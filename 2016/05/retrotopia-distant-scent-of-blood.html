<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the sixteenth installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator, having recovered from a bout of the flu, goes for a walk, meets someone he’s encountered before, and begins to understand why the Lakeland Republic took the path it did...</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The next morning I felt pretty good, all things considered, and got up not too much later than usual. It was bright and clear, as nice an autumn day as you could ask for. I knew I had two days to make up and a lot of discussions and negotiations with the Lakeland Republic government still waited, but I’d been stuck in my room for two days and wanted to stretch my legs a bit before I headed back into another conference room at the Capitol. I compromised by calling Melanie Berger and arranging to meet with her and some other people from Meeker’s staff after lunch. That done, once I’d finished my morning routine, I headed down the stairs and out onto the street. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I didn’t have any particular destination in mind, just fresh air and a bit of exercise, and two or three random turns brought me within sight of the Capitol. That sent half a dozen trains of thought scurrying off in a bunch of directions, and one of them reminded me that I hadn’t seen a scrap of news for better than two days. Another couple of blocks and I got to Kaufer’s News, where the same scruffy-looking woman was sitting on the same wooden stool, surrounded by the same snowstorm of newspapers and magazines. I bought that day’s Toledo <i>Blade</i>, and since it was still way too early to put anything into my stomach, I crossed the street, found a park bench in front of the Capitol that had sunlight all over it, sat down and started reading. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There was plenty of news.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The president of Texas had just denounced the Confederacy for drilling for natural gas too close to the Texas border, and the Confederate government had issued the kind of curt response that might mean nothing and might mean trouble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The latest word from the Antarctic melting season was worse than before; Wilkes Land had chucked up a huge jokulhlaup—yeah, I had to look the word up the first time I saw it, too; it means a flood of meltwater from underneath a glacier—that tore loose maybe two thousand square miles of ice and had half the southern Indian Ocean full of bergs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There was another report out on the lithium crisis, from another bunch of experts who pointed out yet again that the world was going to run out of lithium for batteries in another half dozen years and all the alternatives were much more expensive; I knew better than to think that the report would get any more action than the last half dozen had.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Back home, meanwhile, the leaders of the Dem-Reps had a laundry list of demands for the new administration, most of which involved Montrose ditching her platform and adopting theirs instead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There’d been no response from the Montrose transition team, which was probably just as well. I knew what Ellen would say to that and it wasn’t fit to print. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, the thing I read first was an article on the satellite situation. There was a squib on the front page about that, and a big article with illustrations on pages four and five. It was as bad as I’d feared. The weather satellite that got hit on Friday had thrown big chunks of itself all over, and two more satellites had already been hit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The chain reaction was under way, and in a year or so putting a satellite into the midrange orbits would be a waste of money—a few days, a week at most, and some chunk of scrap metal will come whipping out of nowhere at twenty thousand miles an hour and turn your umpty-billion-yuan investment into a cloud of debris ready to share the love with anything else in orbit. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That reality was already hitting stock markets around the world—telecoms were plunging, and so was every other economic sector that depended too much on satellites. Most of the Chinese manufacturing sector was freaking out, too, because a lot of their exports go by way of the Indian Ocean, and satellite data’s the only thing that keeps container ships out of the way of icebergs. Economists were trying to rough out the probable hit to global GDP, and though estimates were all over the map, none of them was pretty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The short version was that everybody was running around screaming. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Everybody outside the Lakeland Republic, that is. The satellite crisis was an academic concern there. I mean that literally; the paper quoted a professor of astronomy from Toledo University, a Dr. Marjorie Vanich, about the work she and her grad students were doing on the mathematics of orbital collisions, and that was the only consequence the whole mess was having inside the Lakeland borders. I shook my head. Progress was going to win out eventually, I told myself, but the Republic’s retro policies certainly seemed to deflect a good many hassles in the short term. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I finished the first section, set down the paper. Sitting there in the sunlight of a clear autumn day, with a horsedrawn cab going clip-clop on the street in front of me, schoolchildren piling out of a streetcar and heading toward the Capitol for a field trip, pedestrians ducking into Kaufer’s News or the little hole-in-the-wall caf<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>é</span> half a block from it, and the green-and-blue Lakeland Republic flag flapping leisurely above the whole scene, all the crises and commotions in the newspaper I’d just read might as well have been on the far side of the Moon. For the first time I found myself wishing that the Lakeland Republic could find some way to survive over the long term after all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The thought that there could be someplace on the planet where all those crises just didn’t matter much was really rather comforting. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I got up, stuck the paper into one of the big patch pockets of my trench coat, and started walking, going nowhere in particular. A clock on the corner of a nearby building told me I still had better than an hour to kill before lunch. I looked around, and decided to walk all the way around the Capitol, checking out the big green park that surrounded it and the businesses and government offices nearby. I thought of the Legislative Building back home in Philadelphia, with its walls of glass and metal and its perpetually leaky roof; I thought of the Presidential Mansion twelve blocks away, another ultramodern eyesore, where one set of movers hauling Bill Barfield’s stuff out would be crossing paths just then with another set of movers hauling Ellen Montrose’s stuff in; I thought of the huge bleak office blocks sprawling west and south from there, where people I knew were busy trying to figure out how to cope with a rising tide of challenges that didn’t look as though it was ever going to ebb. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I got to one end of the park, turned the corner. A little in from the far corner was what looked like a monument of some sort, a big slab of dark red stone up on end, with something written on it. Shrubs formed a rough ring around it, and a couple of trees looked on from nearby. I wondered what it was commemorating, started walking that way. When I got closer, I noticed that there was a ring of park benches inside the circle of shrubs, and one person sitting on one of the benches; it wasn’t until I was weaving through the gap between two shrubs that I realized it was the same Senator Mary Chenkin I’d met at the Atheist Assembly the previous Sunday. By the time I’d noticed that, she’d spotted me and got to her feet, and so I went over and did and said the polite thing, and we got to talking. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The writing on the monument didn’t enlighten me much. It had a date on it—29 APRIL 2024—and nothing else. I’d just about decided to ask Chenkin about it when she said, “I bet they didn’t brief you about this little memento of ours—and they probably should have, if you’re going to make any kind of sense of what we’ve done here in the Lakeland Republic. Do you have a few minutes?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Most of an hour,” I said. “If you’ve got the time—” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I should be at a committee meeting later on, but there should be plenty of time.” She waved me to the bench and then perched on the front of it, facing me. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You probably know about DM-386 corn, Mr. Carr,” she said. “The stuff that had genes from poisonous starfish spliced into it.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yeah.” Ugly memories stirred.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I would have had a kid brother if it wasn’t for that.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You and a lot of others.” She shook her head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Gemotek, the corporation that made it, used to have its regional headquarters right here.” She gestured across the park toward the Capitol. “A big silver glass and steel skyscraper complex, with a plaza facing this way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It got torn down right after the war, the steel went to make rails for the Toledo streetcar system, and the site—well, you’ll understand a little further on why we chose to put our Capitol there. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“But it was 2020, as I recall, when Gemotek scientists held a press conference right here to announce that DM-386 was going to save the world from hunger.” Another shake of her head dismissed the words. “Did they plant much of it up where your family lived?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not to speak of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We were in what used to be upstate New York, and corn wasn’t a big crop.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Well, there you are. Here, we’re the buckle on the corn belt:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the old states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and across into Iowa and Nebraska. Gemotek marketed DM-386 heavily via exclusive contracts with local seed stores, and it was literally everywhere. They insisted it was safe, the government insisted it was safe, the experts said the same thing—but nobody bothered to test it on pregnant women.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I remember,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And down here, it wasn’t just in the food supply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The pollen had the toxin in it, and that was in the air every spring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After the first year’s crop, what’s more, it got into the water table in a lot of places. So there were some counties where the live birth rate dropped by half over a two year period.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She leaned toward me. “And here’s the thing. Gemotek kept insisting that it couldn’t possibly be their corn, and the government backed them. They brought in one highly paid expert after another to tell us that some new virus or other was causing the epidemic of stillbirths. It all sounded plausible, until you found out that the only countries in the world that had this supposed virus were countries that allowed DM-386 corn to cross their borders. The media wouldn’t mention that, and if you said something about it on the old internet, or any other public venue, Gemotek would slap you with a libel suit. They’d win, too—they had all the expert opinion on their side that money could buy. All the farmers and the other<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>people of the corn belt had on their side was unbiased epidemiology and too many dead infants. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“So by the fall and winter of 2023, the entire Midwest was a powderkeg. A lot of farmers stopped planting DM-386, even though Gemotek had a clause in the sales agreement that let them sue you for breach of contract if you did that. Seed stores that stocked it got burnt to the ground, and Gemotek sales staff who went out into farm country didn’t always come back. There were federal troops here by then—not just Homeland Security, also regular Army with tanks and helicopters they’d brought up from the South after the trouble in Knoxville and Chattanooga the year before—and you had armed bands of young people and military vets springing up all over the countryside. It was pretty bad. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“By April, it was pretty clear that next to nobody in the region was planting Gemotek seeds—not just DM-386, anything from that company. Farmers were letting their farms go fallow if they couldn’t get seed they thought was safe. That’s when Michael Yates, who was the CEO of Gemotek, said he was going to come to Toledo and talk some sense into the idiots who thought there was something wrong with his product. By all accounts, yes, that’s what he said.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All of a sudden I remembered how the story ended, but didn’t say anything. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“So he came here—right where we’re sitting now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The company made a big fuss in the media, put up a platform out in front of the building, put half a dozen security guards around it, and thought that would do the job. Yates was a celebrity CEO—” Unexpectedly, she laughed. “That phrase sounds so strange nowadays. Still, there were a lot of them before the Second Civil War: flashy, outspoken, hungry for publicity. He was like that. He flew in, and came out here, and started mouthing the same canned talking points Gemotek flacks had been rehashing since the first wave of stillbirths hit the media. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I think he even believed them.” She shrugged. “He wasn’t an epidemiologist or even a geneticist, just a glorified salesman who thought his big paycheck made him smarter than anyone else, and he lived the sort of bicoastal lifestyle the rich favored in those days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If he’d ever set foot in the ‘flyover states’ before then, I never heard of it. But of course the crowd wasn’t having any of it. Something like nine thousand people showed up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They were shouting at him, and he was trying to make himself heard, and somebody lunged for the platform and a security guard panicked and opened fire, and the crowd mobbed the platform. It was all over in maybe five minutes. As I recall, two of the guards survived. The other four were trampled and beaten to death, and nineteen people were shot—and Michael Yates was quite literally torn to shreds. There was hardly enough left of him to bury. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“So that’s what happened on April 29th, 2024. The crowd scattered as soon as it was all over, before Homeland Security troops could get here from their barracks; the feds declared a state of emergency and shut Toledo down, and then two days later the riots started down in Birmingham and the National Guard units sent to stop them joined the rioters. Your historians probably say that that’s where and when the Second Civil War started, and they’re right—but this is where the seed that grew into the Lakeland Republic got planted.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Hell of a seed,” I said, for want of anything better. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I won’t argue. But this—”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Her gesture indicated the monument, and the shadow of a vanished building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“—this is a big part of why the whole Midwest went up like a rocket once the Birmingham riots turned serious, and why nothing the federal government did to get people to lay down their arms did a bit of good. Every family I knew back in those days had either lost a child or knew someone who had—but it wasn’t just that. There had been plenty of other cases where the old government put the financial interests of big corporations ahead of the welfare of its people—hundreds of them, really—but this thing was that one straw too many. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And then, when the fighting was over, the constitutional convention was meeting, and people from the World Bank and the IMF flew in to offer us big loans for reconstruction, care to guess what one of their very first conditions was?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I didn’t have to answer; she saw on my face that I knew the story. “Exactly, Mr. Carr. The provisional government had already passed a law banning genetically modified organisms until adequate safety tests could be done, and the World Bank demanded that we repeal it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To them it was just a trade barrier. Of course all of us in the provisional government knew perfectly well that if we agreed to that, we’d be facing Michael Yates’ fate in short order, so we called for a referendum.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She shook her head, laughed reminiscently. “The World Bank people went ballistic. I had one of their economists with his face six inches from mine, shouting threats for fifteen minutes in half-coherent English without a break. But we held the referendum, the no vote came in at 89%, we told the IMF and the World Bank to pack their bags and go home, and the rest of our history unfolded as you’ve seen—and a lot of it was because of a pavement streaked with blood, right here.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Something in her voice just then made me consider her face closely, and read something in her expression that I don’t think she’d intended me to see. “You were there, weren’t you?” I asked. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She glanced up at me, looked away, and after a long moment nodded. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A long moment passed. The clop-clop of a horsedrawn taxi came close, passed on into the distance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>“Here’s the thing,” she said finally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>“All of us who were alive then—well, those who didn’t help tear Michael Yates to pieces helped tear the United States of America to pieces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was the same in both cases:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>people who had been hurt and deceived and cheated until they couldn’t bear it any longer, who finally lashed out in blind rage and then looked down and saw the blood on their hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After something like that, you have to come to terms with the fact that what’s done can never be undone, and try to figure out what you can do that will make it turn out to be worthwhile after all.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She took a watch out of her purse, then, glanced at it, and said, “Oh dear. They’ve been waiting for me in the committee room for five minutes now. Thank you for listening, Mr. Carr—will I see you at the Assembly next Sunday?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s the plan,” I told her. She got up, we made the usual polite noises, and she hurried away toward the Capitol. Maybe she was late for her meeting, and maybe she’d said more than she’d intended to say and wanted to end the conversation. I didn’t greatly care, as I wanted a little solitude myself just then. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d known about DM-386 corn, of course, and my family wasn’t the only one I knew that lost a kid to the fatal lung defects the starfish stuff caused if the mother got exposed to it in the wrong trimester. For that matter, plenty of other miracle products have turned out to have side effects nasty enough to rack up a fair-sized body count. No, it was thinking of the pleasant old lady I’d just been sitting with as a young woman with blood dripping from her hands. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Every nation starts that way. The Atlantic Republic certainly did—I knew people back home who’d been guerrillas in the Adirondacks and the Alleghenies, and they’d talk sometimes about things they’d seen and done that made my blood run cold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The old United States got its start the same way, two and a half centuries further back. I knew that, but I hadn’t been thinking about it when I’d sat on the park bench musing about how calm the Lakeland Republic seemed in the middle of all the consternation outside its borders. It hadn’t occurred to me what had gone into making that calm happen. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
The breeze whispering past the stone monument seemed just then to have a distant scent of blood on it. I turned and walked away. </div>

Both charming and chilling at the same time... Also a nice way of illustrating your Burkean views on the precautionary principle, in the form of narractive fiction.<br><br>And the olfactive theme is a perfectly valid way of making sense of everything that's happening in the world just now - Brazil, France, Venezuela, and even the USA. I could comment on my own country, but I'll let those interested find out the details for themselves. Suffice to say, more of the same rioting, now even the cops are demonstrating against the hate they feel directed towards them. Some extremists almost killed two of them in the burning of their police car. The truck drivers are also going on strike, affecting the fuel supply lines. We have already seen that in the past. Same old, same old...<br><br>A place like the Lakeland Republic definitely looks like science fiction in today's tormented world ! And yet the narrative of its inception feels much too familiar. Peace always comes at a price, as there is no such thing as a free lunch. I wish you were wrong, but as a denizen of Ecnarf, and not unfamiliar with its History, I know otherwise. I feel a lot like Carr sitting dumbstruck on a park bench... Poor Mr Carr, he is really having quite a ride in the Lakeland Republic.<br><br>I would have much more to say, about how the media is starting to convey doubts about technology, or about why I don't believe that the current set of street protests staged in France are viable in the long term, or about the Rescue Game situations that have existed right in front of public sight for so many years. Those will have to wait for another day, as the affairs of daily life feel more important just now.<br><br><a href=#c480730092779143552 title="comment permalink">5/18/16, 3:45 PM</a><br><br>

The depth and breadth of your work has sparked a transformation in my life and expanded my horizons. <br><br>As to the return or Mr. Carr, what a profound episode. This seems like an Omelot moment. Except that in the LR the people didn't walk away from it, they did something about it. What Chenkin said "After something like that, you have to come to terms with the fact that what’s done can never be undone, and try to figure out what you can do that will make it turn out to be worthwhile after all.” Reminds me of the guiding principle you started the ADR with and I think it reflects our position even today. Whatever happens in the next eight years, the hope you put into Retrotopia is very encouraging. I hope that people can have the guts to look at our collective underbelly and actually work to do something about it - and not just act like it isn't really there like Mr Carrs Atlantic Republic has done.<br><br><a href=#c7612833062714822971 title="comment permalink">5/18/16, 4:29 PM</a><br><br>

O’Neil Endowed Chair Global Markets and Freedom and Scholar in Residence at Southern Methodist University"), the following quote:<br><br><i>Corporations routinely sacrifice the lives of some of their customers to increase profits, and we are all better off because they do. That's right, we are lucky to live in an economy that allows corporations to increase profits by intentionally selling products less safe than could be produced.

That contrast in the narrative looked quite stark to me. Incidentally, I liked the bit in the story where you slipped in the faith based statement that I hear quite a lot. You also managed to weave a bit of uncertainty in the protagonists thought processes when that mental mantra was thought. Nice one.<br><br>If the whole GM thing was clearly superior to all other avenues, then it would be self evident and wouldn't have to be defended through the legal system. The thing I wonder about that GM story is how do you support massive administrative body that backs the entire process, when really what they are selling are seeds for vegetables, other plants, grains and supporting chemicals. I don't see where the margins can be that much higher than for other more traditional forms of agriculture. I mean I could be wrong, but to my opinion it appears that the yields would have to be very much greater for it to make any sort of economic sense. Dunno, really.<br><br>I have put very few brain cells towards the election process over in the US, but yesterday morning I listened to a few sound bites and I was quite surprised at the personal attacks and gibes, which seemed to form a great deal of the debates and speeches. I heard Obama making fun of Sanders method of fund raising, and that method seemed eminently sensible to my mind. I heard nasty jibes about "hair hats" and Trump provided a sound bite the gist of which said that America needed to be more unpredictable because they are utterly predictable. And I found myself agreeing with Trump.<br><br>A dawning sense of understanding swept over me as I realised that the mainstream players had forgotten to provide for any sort of a vision and were instead relying on vitriol which is not a good look. It was mildly disturbing and unsettling to be exposed to those thoughts in the sound bites because I suspect the speakers have forgotten the consequences of using those tools.<br><br>Oh yeah, glad you mentioned the lithium thing. Honestly, I could share a story or two about those batteries, but they are not my stories to share and already I’m on the fringe with the renewable energy community down here. No need to add fuel to that fire! Back in the day there was Nickel-Iron batteries and they were very large, very simple, very resilient, very long lived, but not particularly efficient at storing electrical charge. They looked great too, all in glass jars so that you could see the internal workings. Many of those were sold off with the shut down of huge swathes of manufacturing down here in the early 90’s. Alas I was too young to realise the opportunity. Oh well.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c6910376540632311013 title="comment permalink">5/18/16, 7:02 PM</a><br><br>

Excellent post, and congratulations on the tin(foil hat) anniversary. I came to reading your blog from the solar enthusiast, hobby farmer, peak oil and survivalist camps. I was raised at the bottom of the wage class, and have made it to the top of the same class. I used to collect conspiracy theories, and saw a lot of truth in them. My opinion on Government stories/propaganda is that I don't need to know what the truth is to know when I am being lied to. After I started reading your blog in about 07, and reading the Long Emergency,that a significant number of the theories were probably at least partially true, but I couldn't affect them, just myself. Since then, I have taken a permaculture course, got licensed in Ham radio and become a Master Mason. Recently I lent my copies of the Long Descent and the Ecotecnic Future, as well as the Druidry handbook to a good friend, who commented that the Long Descent was depressing reading, but connected a lot of dots for her that hadn't made sense before. The surprise was her 16 year old daughter picked up the books and read them, and used them as a basis for a book report in her school class. She is also enjoying your other blog, so there is hope yet. <br>On a separate note, I have also been reading The Market Ticker, and Karl has made some good points about how Trump could deal with a lot of his promises buy merely enforcing the law as currently written, especially the medical problems. He has brought up the fact the the Oklahoma Surgery Centre (http://surgerycenterok.com) has posted prices for most surgeries that equal the co-pay of most insurance plans as a working example. The illegal immigrant problem is also solvable by enforcing large penalties against any employer who does employ them. Most would then leave once their illegal jobs dried up.<br><br><a href=#c925642161355754781 title="comment permalink">5/18/16, 7:48 PM</a><br><br>

Before, I had served in the Marine Corps, and before that grew up shooting targets and eventually competing in 3 position rifle NRA matches. Anyway there was a would-be Marxist who was also around campus that summer, and we were on a crew haying. After hearing about revolution for a month, I invited him to go shooting. We took my .30 Service rifle, and .30 bolt-gun to a public range just outside an army base. As I was giving him safety rules and shooting tips, we were joined by two more shooters. Not college material, possibly prison graduates, they were shooting AK's with folding stocks. I remember after all these years their tattoos and their attitude: "Frack you whoever you are" in essence. I did not risk any conversation with them. They shot fast, we shot slow. Empty milk jugs were the targets that day. Not easy for a new shooter as my friend learned. We both fired 40 rounds, which even with ear protection is enough for a headache for me. Prone, sitting, kneeling with sling support, padded shooting coat, padded glove, and standing (my favourite), great fun.<br><br>No more talk of revolution in the streets. I dropped out the next year when my GI bill bennies ran out. Began practising the meditation on Chenresi for all beings (by TangTong Gyalpo); still doing that. "Collapsed" a good while ago; still shooting; but I like to hope that 40 rounds saved at least one life.<br><br><a href=#c7667060186181405468 title="comment permalink">5/18/16, 8:41 PM</a><br><br>

Lakeland at large is passingly interested in it, much in the same way that current newspapers put on page 4 or 5 stories of foreign policy interest that occasionally broadcast the shape of things to come to those who know how to interpret them. In a recent NY Times edition I bought, it was a story about how Saudi Arabia has been financing US incursions in the middle east out of mutual interest and tradition, but that that relationship is becoming strained. There's clearly more going on than was written on the surface, especially in the context of events like the regional civil wars and recent US detente with Iran.<br><br>In much the same way, a Lakelander reading the academic story of space debris could infer that the balance of military and economic power globally was about to shift, bringing disadvantages to the satellite-dependent and relative advantages to those with other arrangements for communication, navigation, military power projection, and the like. <br><br>In other words, in a world straining under the constraints of the limits to growth, climate change, and the escalating costs of overcomplexity, it can certainly pay to collapse now and avoid the rush. <br><br>For instance, if one grows one's vegetables, news reports about huge recalls of produce tainted with some ghastly germs carry a different weight than if one was to depend on a grocery store. Similarly scary stories about credit card breaches, iCrack hacks, and car safety recalls gain or lose importance based on how much a person relies on the system in question.<br><br>Thanks for the return of Mr. Carr.

No, I hadn't encountered that -- I was thinking of the way that the US government is running cover for Bayer's neonicotinoid pesticides even though those are causing mass dieoffs of the honeybees that pollinate our food crops, and similar evasions around the pandemic of harmful and fatal side effects of lucrative drugs marketed by the pharmaceutical industry, among other things. <br><br>Fudoshindotcom, oh, granted.

Absence of evidence, after all, isn't evidence of absence, and under the precautionary principle, it would be reasonable to expect thorough testing by people who have no stake in the outcome before allowing the dumping of manufactured life forms into the biosphere and the human body. <br><br>With regard to the placebo effect, as a practicing occultist -- you did know that, I trust -- I use it all the time, with good effect, and you might be interested to know that my experience with homeopathy doesn't support the claim that it's purely a placebo-based system. The differences are difficult to quantify, like many direct experiences, but easy to recognize; there are also certain other factors that set homeopathy apart from a pure placebo approach.

Obviously you conceived these ideas many months ago and new nations, even peaceful Lakeland, are typically birthed in violence anyway. Still it's interesting. <br><br>I know you have a dim opinion of the "hipsters" and so forth who are calling Sanders and Trump "revolutionaries," in that young Americans who haven't been Imperial footsoldiers abroad yet have little knowledge of real-life political violence. Nevertheless, I'd argue that many revolutionaries go into their revolution thinking things can be resolved peacefully, and then find themselves driven to violence and acquiring such experience by necessity. The hipsters don't know a thing about violence right now, but I am starting to wonder if some will have those lessons taught to them soon.<br><br>In my own opinion, today's news reports of violence from these hipster political activists (on both sides) are probably highly overblown, mainly it's pearl-clutching on the part of establishment mouthpieces. But the two established political parties really have only themselves to blame for whatever violence might originate during this election season and beyond. For at least 3 or 4 decades, every four years like clockwork, each political party has energized its voters by scaring them with fears of an Apocalypse if the other party wins power... ("Supreme Court! Abortion epidemic! Runaway global warming! They're coming to take your guns!") And then every four years like clockwork, come the second week of November, the newly-elected party politicians generally seem to act as if all the pressure is off. There are a number of slang terms for this, including "bait-and-switch" as well as NSFW terms involving anatomical parts and "tease". You can only bait-and-switch your followers for so long before ugliness of one sort or another occurs. I think we're starting to see early glimmerings of real political violence right now, but on the other hand, I have typically over-estimated the speed of political change most of my life.<br><br><a href=#c1407417478664079124 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 7:14 AM</a><br><br>

You write the following: <i>/.../the only countries in the world that had this supposed virus were countries that allowed DM-386 corn to cross their borders. The media wouldn’t mention that, and if you said something about it on the old internet, or any other public venue, Gemotek would slap you with a libel suit. They’d win, too—they had all the expert opinion on their side that money could buy.</i><br><br>What has, in your narrative, happened to the legal adage that "the Truth Defence is absolute"? I am the scarred veteran of a libel action by a municipal politician, Ms Karen Cilevitz, who favours development on 31 or 32 or so hectares out of the 77 David Dunlap Observatory and Park greenspace hectares here in Ontario. I think that in libel I know whereof I speak - on the strength, in part, of lots and lots of chats with my erstwhile counsel, at Blake, Cassels and Graydon LLP. <br><br>Everything pertinent to our conservation-of-greenspace land case, in its alleged libel aspect, is laid out on a pair of Web sites. <br><br>(1) The material-in-contention is displayed at <a href=http://www.karen-vs-toomas-blog.ca/ rel=nofollow>http://www.karen-vs-toomas-blog.ca/</a>. I use red for the bits I had, under the terms of the eventual "Settlement", to modify. (I herewith neither affirm that I had to change a heck of a lot nor affirm that I had to change very little. Nope, my lips on this point are sealed, yes ma'am: no affirming of any kind, ma'am, mah lips are SEE-YULLED. Anyone who, speaking hypothetically, might happen to be interested is welcome to search diligently for little red bits, scrolling down and down and down and down and down and down, and looking on every one of those ever-so-long Web pages.) <br><br>(2) The central legal materials, most importantly my Settlement-regulated commentary on the "Settlement", can be inspected at <a href=http://www.karen-vs-toomas-legaldocs.ca/ rel=nofollow>http://www.karen-vs-toomas-legaldocs.ca/</a>. <br><br>My own understanding, JMG, is that as soon as you prove in court that what you wrote was true, the case against you collapses - no matter what the other circumstances in your case might be. <br><br>Further, I think that this principle is pretty common across Anglsaxonia and western Europe, having nothing special to do with the jurisdiction (Ontario, in Canada) in which I have experience.<br><br>So in the situation you sketch, all the Internet bloggers had to do was establish in court which countries had the virus and which countries had the border-biosecurity arrangements. <br><br>Can 2024 companies like Gemotek sway judges, so that they misapply libel law? If so, can that already happen in 2016? If "Yes" to the latter query, can you perhaps refer to a case or two - not in the full rigour of legal citation, but merely in terms that will make it possible to run a general "Google" search and a "Google News" search? <br><br>Perhaps some readers other than JMG will also care to comment, perhaps suggesting a Google search term or two? Such readers could comment right here, or alternatively could send me a private e-mail. I have a special interest in the Truth Defence this week, having this week slammed the University of Toronto pretty hard over at <a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a>, in connection with that same conservation-of-greenspace land case. <br><br><br>Hastily, <br>thinking how important is the Rule of Law, <br><br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br>Toomas(dot)Karmo(at)gmail(dot)com<br><br>in municipality of Richmond Hill, just north of Toronto in Canada<br><br><a href=#c1341430999272465157 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 7:22 AM</a><br><br>

I have been enjoying reading down your latest themes dissecting the political situation in America. And smarting when I find that most hits very close to home, and I'm guilty of being quite privileged even though I tend to think I'm not. You can't change what you don't/won't acknowledge. Maybe I'm not hopeless! <br> As to your fictional series, I'm glad I read today's installment. I have been struggling to enjoy this series, even though I know it represents the best of how the future could be. I appreciate that even though the technology and energy sources have 'digressed' and older fashioned mindset of how people should behave or be allowed to behave (aka same sex marriage) has not digressed. I love that! The other half of me chafes when reading these installments because I have NEVER seen anything work so well. In my experience, the bureaucracy, ego, and general too many cooks in the kitchen all elbowing each other to death to get their say creates processes that can't work without a hitch, disgruntled but stuck people, and general stress - day in, day out. Granted I'm referring to where I work, but it's a big gov contract that my company is trying to 'run' with the 'help' of the government and NOTHING works. Further, at a municipal/city level I don't see a great deal of smoothness of in incorporating policies that work for the people (bike lanes...in tx? Seems like an impossible dream). I guess I'm just jaded enough that I don't see how a seamlessly working future could be crafted by any sort of agency that is a governing body of an area bigger than perhaps a household. And even then I can site examples of familial ways of doing things that don't work ;)So I'm trying to breath and consider this a study in what could be, but in reality I'm grinding my teeth because I don't see this EVER happening (which is terribly disheartening) Today's installment did give me pause - perhaps when your freedom from what doesn't work is bought at so high a price, pavements streamed with the blood of people you know...then perhaps that would change the mindset of people enough to craft a way of living that works according to the resources available to them. But even then...I don't know. I want to believe...but I can't get there. Maybe that makes me part of the problem :/<br><br><a href=#c1329689449630001456 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 7:56 AM</a><br><br>

Even without discussing inadequate science, the mere claim that “GMOs are safe/ GMOs are killing us!” misses out on the most important aspect of the label GMO – it’s an entire suite of technologies, rather than a single monolithic entity and as such, attempts to make sweeping claims about the entire suite of technologies is utter nonsense. Even if completely adequate and comprehensive research (preferably in the form of longitudinal studies stretched out over a generation or two in order to ascertain long term effects on both humans and ecosystems) proved that every GMO crop presently on the market was completely safe (or not) using those studies to claim that “GMOs are safe/not” is the exact equivalent of using a single drug trial to claim that “all drugs are safe” applying it to all present and future drugs, or using a single recalled drug to claim that any and all medicine is going to kill you. Unfortunately, the way the technology is evolving is that when a new strain gets created, the rhetoric behind it is “it’s a GMO and GMOs have been proven safe,” and then a wave of people jump out of the woodwork and start shouting about the evils of GMOs as a broad category, which makes them very easy to shut down.<br><br>Meanwhile, the actual application of GMO technology, contrary to the oft repeated promises about the potential applications of the technology is actually getting applied to things like glyphosphate resistant soy and Bt Maize (i.e. crops with applications I have doubts about even if they worked exactly as advertised with no adverse side effects, since they’re specifically designed to cause large scale disruption of field ecologies), meanwhile, some of the more ballyhooed, but not yet applied potential GMO applications (i.e. plants that grow faster and are more resistant to adverse weather conditions and so on… make me think a little too much about the lessons Australian toads and rabbits, or American Kudzu have to teach us about what happens if you introduce an organism that’s too successful). There’s also the issue that GMO seeds are by their very nature not heirlooms, which affects pretty much anyone interested in farming in the name of self-sufficiency (but that applies to most other forms of hybridization as well). None of the good ideas involved in GMO talk (using C4 Photosynthesis to increase the rate of carbon sequestration in plants, modifying field crops to fix nitrogen for soil remediation, etc.) ever see the light of day, it’s always pesticides or heightened resistant to stronger pesticides to respond to resistant pests. Even the above mentioned good ideas would need extensive testing first and if they were safe they’d only speak for that type of seed. <br><br>That entire argument usually gets me called an anti-GMO conspiracy theorist by one crowd, and a Monsanto shill by the other. Meanwhile, in the long term, the fact that GMO companies can rest on the prestige of the entire suite of technology without ever having to look at every new crop on its own terms, and the fact that the public is insistent on denouncing the entire suite of technologies on principal every time it comes up without discussion pretty much guarantees that eventually something like what you’re describing here will happen, with Crown of Thorns derived Saponin Corn (in response to Bt corn, and/or plant derived saponin pesticides ceasing to be effective) being inadequately tested because “hey, it’s a GMO, and the science on GMOs is settled, right?” while all legitimate concerns are outright ridiculed because “they’re just anti-science.” With neither side realizing that there can never be any such thing as “settled GMO science” for the same reason there can never and will never be such a thing as “settled drug science,” every GMO strain being a unique stand-alone entity that has to be tested on its own terms.<br><br><br><a href=#c6799844667328620604 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 8:01 AM</a><br><br>

The relatively recent controversy over the Georgia state flag should be instructive. The flag was changed to include the Battle Flag of Northern Virginia, popularly called the Confederate flag, in 1956. In the early-mid 2000s a series of NAACP boycotts of other states triggered our Democratic governor to change our flag to an amalgamated mess that contained the 1956 flag as an inset, but no other prominent depiction of the Confederate flag. As I recall we finished dead last in a state flag beauty contest the year it was adopted. This change, which was legislated but not voted on, caused a huge outcry. The subsequent governor, our first Republican since Reconstruction, ran on a platform that featured the flag as a main issue. When the replacement was based off the 1st National Flag of the CSA (the Stars and Bars) there was a strong if unsuccessful push to depose him. I recall walking out of a high school assembly when the new governor had just spoken in south Georgia and the entire block was full of protesters waving the old flag.<br> <br>Liberal bastions like Atlanta, Athens GA, and similar might be open to “Southern Confederation”, but too many powerful people rely on constituents for whom our soil is red from soaking in Yankee blood to demure on our name. I think the best that liberal and/or non-white Southerns could reasonably hope during the founding days of such a project would be for the adoption of “CSA” as the standard moniker outside of formal settings, and just maybe a CSA flag based on the 1st National flag or the Bonnie Blue Star that would allow a bit of polite distance from the harsher realities of slavery, segregation, and white domestic terrorism that the Confederate flag has come to represent for many people.<br> <br><br> <br><br><br><a href=#c2387416483745757731 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 8:37 AM</a><br><br>

New drug applications with the FDA require safety data from 3 non-human species before you can proceed to Phase I trials in healthy humans. These safety trials are often of limited duration, in animals and humans. As trials proceed from Phase I to II and III you start testing in people with the target illness. These people are often very carefully screened to not have many if any additional complicating conditions, such as extremes of age, weight, pregnancy, or other diseases (with their own drug regimens) often seen with the specific malady that is being treated. The duration of drug exposure in these trials typically maxes out at 6 months. The companies pay all costs for the trial, have in-house statisticians process the data, and pay a user fee to the FDA to facilitate review of the data. If I as a lay person want to see the approval data I have to hope it got published, which there is no obligation to do (link 1). All of this can be sped up or waved if the treatment or disease is deemed of particular importance. Who does the FDA use to evaluate drug approval data and if a treatment is particularly important? People who have experience doing so – from the pharmaceutical industry.<br> <br>Please note I just described the process for drugs. I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that the process for GMOs is more haphazard since the FDA has been in the drug business in some form since the 1930s, whereas GMOs are a new issue since the 1980s. Where are the requirements for generational studies in multiple non-human species eating typical concentrations of GMO feed before allowing limited trials in humans? Where are the biodome fields to test how pollen dispersion impacts animals and other plants (GMO genes in wheat appear to have escaped this way over a decade ago, even though GMO wheat hadn’t been approved; link 2)? For that matter, where are these types of studies for conventional pesticides, herbicides, and organic alternatives like Bt spray? GMO technology has wonderful potential, Golden Rice coming first to mind. However, the insistence from GMO boosters that the limited tests that have been done are adequate and skeptics should stop kvetching about wanting better data are tiresome, even when they have some good points, such as how promotion of monoculture should factor more in our discussions of GMO and agriculture then is currently the case (link 3).<br>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/10/tamiflu-saga-drug-trials-big-pharma<br>http://www.cnbc.com/id/100774325<br>http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/07/are_gmos_safe_yes_the_case_against_them_is_full_of_fraud_lies_and_errors.html<br> <br><br><br><a href=#c2241727645437523798 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 8:39 AM</a><br><br>

Carr's reactions in the final paragraphs, especially his connecting Lakeland's "calm" in 2065 with Senator Chenkin's retrospective understanding of the events of 2024, can only come from a perceptive mindset reflecting some of your own syncretic proclivities.<br><br>The assimilation of turning-point events has profound and interesting effects on a local culture, generations and even centuries later. I've lived in places along the Lexington Battle Road, including the nastier parts not emphasized in school books (the Bloody Angle; the roadside houses in Menotomy), and found myself absorbing those cultural fragments—notably including the sympathy and respect for the storybook "enemy"—and passing them along. I've also noticed that while Salem, Massachusetts has become practically a witch-themed theme park for tourists, many people in Danvers, Massachusetts (the former Salem Village, where the conflict and panic originally boiled up before the venue shifted to the court house in nearby Salem Town) will still, to this day, reluctantly say their piece about what happened there over 300 years ago and then suddenly remember being late for important appointments.<br><br>Nineteen, four, and one died in Salem in 1692 (by hanging, privations of imprisonment, and pressing, respectively); Eighteen Lexington townsmen (plus one Regular) were killed or wounded on Lexington Green on April 19th 1774; which by the way was 250 years plus ten days before the Yates Massacre (or whatever the Lakelanders call the event forty-odd years later). The dates and numbers certainly resonate!<br><br>I have an odd prediction to make. If the process of coming to terms with formative events in Lakeland continue to run true to historical patterns, then Lakeland should experience a literary flowering within a generation of 2065, led by authors who grow up among the stories their grandparents and elders like Chenkin tell. I wonder if among those future towering literary figures will be one named Carr.<br><br><a href=#c8352968372778699766 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 9:16 AM</a><br><br>

It was an informative journey on many levels. Of course it was very helpful for me to improve my grasp of spoken Spanish and meet very interesting people. One of the people I stayed at was a Radical Faerie who had worked for Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (an anti-free trade social democrat) before Macri (a neo-con) took over (I arrived a month after this political shift. the atmosphere was tragic). My friend had, or course, lost his job. He told me that when Videla took power 600 concentration camps were built. Of course, these were funded by the United States through Operation Condor. Walking through Buenos Aires, there are plaques on the sidewalks saying, in translation "This person lived in this neighborhood. They were disappeared on this date because of states sponsored terrorism" People in Argentina are very politically engaged. There are neighborhood political groups that meet weekly to eat sandwhiches and chat about projects. Often they do things like build gardens in slums. My friend took me to some demonstrations. There was such a good vibe and I was deeply inspired. Also, no one bothered me for being from imperium. People had the subtlety to see that I had no choice in regards to where I was born I was not treated as a representative of empire. I did have some lively discussions about the appeal of Donald Trump, tho.<br><br>The point I'm getting at rather obliquely is that when I imagine a civil war in the United States I see something similar to Videla's Argentina as a major possibility, especially if the insurgents are funded by a hostile foreign power. The one bright side is that the next generation will likely by way more politically engaged. I'm reminded of this by the scene you paint of the CEO being torn to threads. If China or Russia got a hand in the game when that happens I shudder to think of the possibilities. The other major possibility I see is a bunch of failed states a la Syria or Somalia, or a dour combination of the two. <br><br>Does this sort of reality figure in the Retrotopia narrative, JMG? What is the scale of atrocity you're imagining? Also, what is the scale of foreign involvement with the Civil Wars? You mentioned early on California being a failed state which China brokering a cease-fire. Were there concentration camps built with money from Shanghai or Moscow? Mass graves dotting the landscape? It's really hard for me to imagine that the US will be able to restrain from some industrial/assembly line slaughter of humans before the dark ages roll around, but perhaps I'm being too pessimistic.<br><br>A question I have for others, especially other youngish people (I am 28) is how do you level with the reality that your life may likely end in the next decade or so thanks to other people deciding you have a identity that they will do what they can to destroy? How does this inform your actions? Personally I try to do as much world repair as I can being kind and present with humans and planting food and medicinal plants around so there will be something to cushion the fall even though I don't expect to live long through times of intense political unrest; viz. I'm trans, Jewish, look "ethnic" enough to get crap at times, and am clearly a witch. I stand out, which is a major liability in times of unrest, especially I imagine with the sort of reactionary revolutionary politic that is gaining strength in the political right. Personally, I find strength in my practice of Judaism and also simply my love of life in my body on this beautiful planet and simple wonder of the natural world. I'm curious how other people who are aware of the perilous nature of these times wake up every morning and put one foot in front of the other.<br><br><a href=#c9028572429435047828 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 9:31 AM</a><br><br>

I worked for Monsanto when I was working for pay, from 1984 through 1992, as a research chemist. That's what brought me to St. Louis. I worked on the chemical side of the corporation, not the bio side, not that it matters because the chemical side had blood on its hands too. I'm shaking as I write, because I can feel how the events in the story could happen. That's who Monsanto's CEO was when I worked there (except that he lived in flyover country then), and who it has been since. It's the same with all the other big corporations. The CEOs and anyone from middle management up are the true believers. Have to be, to stay there, to do that kind of work.<br><br>I feel like I have blood on my hands, too. Not because of my work at Monsanto so much. As far as I can tell, nothing I worked on has been commercialized. But I did buy in to progress at one time. I tried being a yuppie. I'm still in the position of living partway in industrial civilization and enjoying its comforts to a degree even as I continue to chip away at the connections I have to those comforts. I feel very much like Mary: I'm trying to face what I have done and still continue to do, to acknowledge the harm I've done, and then to do something worthwhile with what has resulted. To try to atone for what I've done and to help to birth something better.<br><br><a href=#c4158419196130512950 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 10:13 AM</a><br><br>

Canada acquired the formal ability to formulate its own foreign policy (through the Statute of Westminster) in the 1930s. Absolutely full formal nationhood, achieved through the "repatriation" of the Constitution in 1982, was a formal and de jure attestation of a state of affairs which had existed de facto for decades - perhaps (I say this subject to professional, lawyerly, correction) since the Statute of Westminster, or even since the resolution of the 1926 King-Byng constitutional crisis. If violent conflict is to be sought in the founding of Canada as a nation, it can be found only (1) in those localized police operations - it was Ottawa that was the cop-cum-brute - which were the two Riel rebellions under Queen Vicky; and (2) in the small War of 1812 (long before the 1864 Charlottetown conference); and (3) in the remote past, in the subjugation of New France (a violent process culminating in the 1759 Québec siege). Although the First Nations in Canada suffered heavily, and continue to suffer, their situation has never, at any rate outside the pair of Riel rebellions, had the aspect of war.<br><br>Similar points can be made for Australia and New Zealand.<br><br>Similar points can be made also for Singapore. Singapore seceded peacefully, albeit amid bad temper, from Malaysia in 1965. <br><br>Malaysian independence in 1963 was itself in essence peaceful. I hedge with "in essence" simply because some might, in a debating spirit, try to argue for a blurring of the record through colonial Malaya's struggle with an armed 1950s insurgency. <br><br>The case of India is specially instructive. Here is a nation whose primary agency of creation was the Gandhi programme of political nonviolence, Satyagraha. The subsequent war over Partition is less a part of the founding of India than a regional conflict. Perhaps it could be admitted that Pakistan, as a nation, was born in violence, when the political errors over Partition erupted in regional terms.<br><br>Through dearth of reading, I am not sure what to say about Japan. Perhaps Japan features a history of internal disputes, without a real birth-to-nation-through-violence? <br><br>In Europe, points similar to my point regarding Canada, and the like, can be made at least for Norway (peacefully separated from Sweden in 1905 or so) and Slovakia (peacefully separated from the Czech Republic some time after the demise of European communism). The cases of Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, the Low Countries, Greece, Finland, and the Baltics are admittedly more against me than for me. There are perhaps specially daunting complexities in the Balkans, and there are still other corners of Europe (such as Hungary) in which I run up against my own ignorance. <br><br>I would now like to raise the question: How well educated is Mr Carr in history? The points I have just made are commonplace, within the reasonable reach of today's ordinary newspaper readers and today's ordinary patrons of ordinary bookstores. But perhaps education has declined by Mr Carr's day? <br><br>Do you, JMG, sense that Mr Carr will be able to field today-still-simple questions like "Who spearheaded 19th-century German unification?" and "Which principal tribes or ethnicities filled the power vacuum in 5th- and 6th-century Italy?" Or is he, rather, operating at a lower level - say, at the level at which one simply fields Grade Four questions, such as, "Was the last Roman emperor deposed in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th century?" <br><br>What seem to you to be the basic limits of Mr Carr's education? <br> <br> <br>Tooomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br><br><br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a><br><br><a href=#c2750711610401520171 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 10:51 AM</a><br><br>

Traditional breeding methods produce much better varieties. Most of them are just a way to boost sales of the herbicide they are resistant to. Or they try to market golden rice to fight vitamin A deficiency in places where it does not make sense to grow rice, but could grow crops rich in vitamin A that don't require as much water. If they are going to start messing around with things they don't understand, they could at least try to fix a problem that needs fixing like trying to engineer bananas and cocoa plants that can resist the fungi that might wipe them out.<br><br>I use the precautionary principle to justify my avoidance of preservatives and chemical additives in food. Ok, studies have not proven them harmful, but they also have not proven them safe. We have much higher rates of all kinds of diseases (especially cancer) than before their introduction. So I stay away which is not too tough because I only buy the most minimally processed food (canned tomatoes, dried pasta, the occasional condiment when I don't have time to make my own).<br><br>The obliviousness of the gemtek CEO reminds me a lot of the elites scratching their heads and pounding their fists over the the anger displayed by Trump and Sanders voters.

He talked about making a point to get out of of his NY/DC bubble more in light of this (which kind of surprised me), but he still talked condescendingly about how mistaken the wage class is on free trade and immigration. He even cited Burke while doing so! That gave me a laugh. I agreed with his sound bite, "Trump is the wrong answer to the right question", but he downplayed the poor economy and placed the blame on a disappearing social institutions.<br><br><a href=#c6567156604578663272 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 11:05 AM</a><br><br>

I live in a little corner of Devon U.K., where there are interesting things going on, re EU referendum and many others. I commented for the first time just a couple of weeks ago when you reached your 10 year anniversary and mentioned my love of Tolkien (spelled correctly now!) It is a splendid thing to live in the land which is the source of inspiration for the Shire and my home is I like to think, in the Bree Land, so out of the Shire and a bit more edgy. We must, perforce mix with the big folk!<br>I have found your blog stimulating, challenging and frightening, but always interesting. I have done a lot of back reading and am currently reading about peak oil and magic, but that was late last night and I couldn't take in the philosophy lesson. It was lovely to catch up with Retrotopia again today - and thought provoking - I share with other commentators a sense of 'things brewing' but of course they happen more quickly when viewed through the backward lens of history than as they unfold on the ground. I haven't agreed with everything I read here -many views expressed are very different to how I have been used to thinking about the world. I value the civilised forum and the chance it affords to comment and gain confidence. I really value all the comment and dialogue. <br>I popped to the local shop for milk earlier and almost laughed out loud at the headline in one of the newspapers -me and my fellow Brits are to be given a legal 'right' to high speed broadband! Also I saw an interview with Helen Sharman who was the first Brit in space 25 years ago. The interviewer asked her about the future and she talked about colonies on Mars and said that the UK will miss out on 'the future of the human race' if we don't send more astronauts into space. It seems that no one, just no one, is asking where the energy is going to come from. But good news- the Guardian newspaper web site reports that Portugal ran for 4 days straight on renewable energy!

I've always enjoyed the story, but I noticed this time how lively and powerful the writing has become. <br><br>I'd like to share my collapse story a little bit. I was working as an ESL teacher, MA in TESOL from CUNY (look at all those capital letters! That's how you can tell I was in education LOL), but trying to continue my music career. I had to have something to "fall back on" though, so I did what I thought was the responsible thing. No health insurance, contract work that was never steady or reliable, heavy bureaucracy and hidden rules that kept me from doing my best work as a teacher, and not very much music.<br><br>So I cut all my expenses down to the bone, went on benefits, and started playing music full time. I live on about 1K a month in Brooklyn, New York. Now I can put in those hours of practice that you need to have in order to be a master musician. I'm healthy because I can go to the doctor now (Medicaid). I'm going to get to see an audiologist! I'm so excited about that I can't tell you. I would never have even tried to afford that before, and musician ears take a beating. This is the best time I have ever had in my life, and it's because I collapsed. I'm living a very small but rich and enjoyable dream.<br><br>If you don't mind, I'd like to post a link to my song Judge Hardy again, because it's certainly relevant to the story this week, AND this is the studio version, not the live one.

This got me thinking. Do you think that there is a possibility that the microcephaly caused by the Zika virus is not just an unfortunate mutation but the result of accidental human intervention (through larvicides as suggested by a report from Argentinian physicians)? These possibilities are not even reported by the press. And they're shouted down as 'conspiracy theories' - a well-known thoughtstopper that now is even used by Clinton supporters to defend election rigging by the DNC.<br><br>Another thing that is not reported by the media are the increase in cancer rates and malformations in Argentina since the introduction of glyphosate. There was a very good but little known French documentary (Transgenic Wars) that even interviewed the pro-GM Argentinian Science Minister who admitted that there is a correlation between the increases in malformations and cancers and the advancement of the agricultural frontier in cities nearby. By the way, 99% of the GM crops currently planted have been designed to resist a ceraptain kind of herbicide or to emit a pesticide. Predictably, within a few years resistant weeds or pests infest the crops and a cocktail of various herbicides is used. In Argentina they discovered that the most dangerous component of the Orange Agent was being used among others.<br><br>It has been amusing to see how GM lobbyists have associated GM foods with Progress. Anyone who is against it is shouted down as "anti-science". So it's no surprise to see people as Neil De Grasse Tyson in favor of it. It's just one more step in the direction of human dominance over nature. In his facebook page, Bernie Sanders positioned himself in favor of GM labelling, a completely non-radical position. The most liked comments were of his supporters saying they were against those measures because, you know, science. Never mind the funding of research and universities by GM corporations or the blackout of the media to what happens in countries where GMO's are cultivated. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c8603476856098908220 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 12:02 PM</a><br><br>

We didn't actually do very much before I left, but I did learn quite a bit about the practicalities of genetic engineering.<br>1)engineering bacteria is vastly easier than working on eukaryotes like plants or animals. The latter was beyond our means entirely.<br>2)genetic engineering has recently gotten a lot easier to do on a shoestring budget and with limited equipment. This makes the DIY biology movement possible.<br>3)This depends on buying certain genetic building blocks made elsewhere, which must be transported and stored cool. That means that while some stuff can be done in a converted garage or equivalent, it is heavily dependent on reliable refrigerated transportation. It isn't terribly resilient.<br>4)I'm not sure where things have gone since then, but I know the local group didn't actually create anything interesting, so I don't think I missed much by leaving them.<br>5)Safety testing any produced organisms would have been beyond us.<br>6)Traits such as disease and drought resistance are better conferred through standard plant breeding techniques.<br>7)In particular, disease resistance is much more long-lasting when it is polygenic, or when a plant has multiple genes conferring full or partial resistance to a disease. This is because it is much harder for a disease organism to develop tolerance to multiple traits than to a single trait. Genetically modified plants almost always use just one disease resistance gene. This means they are very resistant initially, but tolerance develops faster, and once it is developed they are useless. (I have to reccommend a book: Plant breeding for pest and disease resistance, by GE Russell 1978. It is old, rather technical, and hard to find, but it is fascinating if you want to learn how disease and pest resistance was bred into plants using traditional methods, and what the pitfalls are)<br><br>And that doesn't even begin to discuss all the problems with how GMOs have been used in practice!

If there <i>were</i> no real placebo effect, after all, there wouldn't be a need to normalize for it in scientific experiments!<br><br><a href=#c524196521845118577 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 1:52 PM</a><br><br>

I look forward to see the rest of the story, including more on the origins of the Lakeland Republic and how it managed to avoid getting sucked into the same trap as the Atlantic Republic and other successor states. I find Carr’s comment about how he hopes the LR can survive, but doesn’t see how its possible, rather amusing because in the long run, its societies like the AR that don’t have a future since they are wedded to a status quo that is already starting to come apart at the seams.<br><br>You were talking last week about doing a series on postmodernism, which I am also looking forward to reading. I think there were some useful observations to be made by the postmodernists and some of what Spengler had to say sounds at times like an early form of postmodernism. But the postmodernists got carried away with the obscurantist mumbo-jumbo and mind games and the New Age malarkey about how we create our own reality and ended up jumping the shark.<br><br>We can see how postmodernism has had a destructive effect on academia, but <a href=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/cgsc/carl/download/csipubs/matthewsOP26.pdf rel=nofollow>here is another interesting manifestation</a>. It seems that prior to the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War, the Israeli Defense Force developed a new doctrine that was based heavily on French postmodernist philosophy, the aptly named SOD (Systemic Operational Design). SOD also incorporated a lot of the trendy nonsense that was being pushed on the US military by people like Donald Rumsfeld and Admiral Cebrowski under the guise of Network Centric Warfare, Effects Based Operations, etc, etc, barf, barf.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, the result was a confusing, incoherent and largely incomprehensive mishmash that most Israeli military officers had a great deal of difficulty making sense of. When the IDF attempted to apply SOD to a real world war zone, namely South Lebanon in 2006, against a militarily competent opponent, the results quickly veered toward the comic opera farcical, bringing Karl Marx’s famous observation about how history tends to repeat itself first as tragedy and then as farce to mind.<br><br>Needless to say, the result was a disastrous defeat for the Israelis, even though the IDF had an overwhelming advantage in numbers, firepower and technology. At the peak of the 2006 War, the IDF deployed 50,000 troops with hundreds of jet fighters, attack helicopters and tanks, most them state of the art. Hezbollah defended South Lebanon with a single infantry brigade of 3000 men. Even given the terrain based advantages that Hezbollah had, the IDF should have been able to inflict a sharp and devastating defeat on Hezbollah before pulling back out. Instead, the Israelis suffered their worse military defeat in nearly 2000 years.<br><br>You had also talked about doing a series on deindustrial warfare. As someone who comes from a military background and still pays close attention to military matters, I am interested in seeing how you envision warfare evolving in the not-so-distant future.<br><br><a href=#c6189565209624650109 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 1:58 PM</a><br><br>

He is advocating some sort of change in monetary policy and fiscal policy to get the world economies moving again and to guard against further shocks as in 2008. But I was constantly struck by how much his analysis avoided the idea that there are actual physical constraints on growth. The only approach to such an acknowledgement was an assurance that there will be no lack of new technology. Not a mention of peak oil, declining soil fertility, climate change, drought, etc. He is obviously an intelligent and educated man, but seems as oblivious to the limits of the physical world on which the financial world ultimately depends as a Victorian maiden aunt was supposed to be to the sexual facts of life.

I live in the humid American South and work in a neonatal ICU, so I'll be interested to see if next year, when Zika will have had plenty of time to move in, if we start to see microcephalic babies, or if the first few cases of infection, teratogenic or not, cause a mass mosquito eradication effort with larvacides, and then we get malformations.

A lot of this fiction project has been dealing with gritty realities of a different kind -- providing banking services to consumers, shipping manure along canals to tier 5 power plants, running public and private schools, etc. -- and, as a work of utopian fiction, it's been focused on what could be achieved in each of these areas. That's led some readers to find the whole project rather bland. I think it'll read differently when it's in book form, and the harrowing realities of the Second Civil War discussed in the opening episodes, and some other harrowing realities we'll be getting to as we proceed, provide a contrasting backdrop for the image of a society that more or less works. <br><br>Beetleswamp, "they don't want to do research because there might not be a problem" is one of the most elegant evasions I've seen in a good long time. Of course what's actually happening is that they don't want to do research because there might be a problem, and then they'd have to do something about it. If I were one of the officials in question I'd be very careful about attending public meetings...<br><br>Fudoshindotcom, oh, I get that. I'm still hoping that a political and economic crisis of sufficient severity can stop this short of civil war, but the odds aren't looking at all good just now. <br><br>Steadystatecollege, I find the whole set of curretly popular claims about psychopaths and power very dubious -- it strikes me as yet another manifestation of the habit, very common on the leftward side of American culture, of pathologizing and demonizing the people they don't like. (Another example is the claim that people who vote for the GOP have "authoritarian personalities.") The Lakeland Republic uses the same means to keep its politicians and officials in check that other healthy representative democracies do: effective checks and balances, backed up by public debate and a lively competition between rival political parties that often expresses itself via each party trying to catch the members of other parties in illegal behavior. Is it foolproof? Of course not; nothing in the real world ever is, but it works better than any of the alternatives. <br><br>Zach, thank you. <br><br>Howard, nicely summarized. In the Lakeland Republic, they had a particularly rough fight with Gojira, and it shows. <br><br>Thomas, oh, I don't object to hipsters in general; any group of people that recognizes the virtues of fedoras gets a certain amount of tolerance from me for that fact alone, and I remember well the days when I was young and clueless, too. I'm thinking specifically of the subset of them that likes to spout Marxist revolutionary babble without having the least notion of the human cost. Maybe they will become an authentically revolutionary generation, as you've suggested, but a lot of them are going to have the experience of watching their friends blown away by gunfire if that happens.<br><br><a href=#c5543950730754151992 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 6:19 PM</a><br><br>

Seek useful stuff to do that make sense in war or peace. Mostly just gardening, lots of gardening. Mostly helping others, recently I have been too unstable to hold down my own projects, too sensitive to what's up, but I can help other on my good days. For the last few months I have been in such a funk I can barely relate to society at a deeper level than sleeping at my parents and going to a local farm to make test gardens. They have spots that have been over grown with weeds, so I can experiment as I please in those places, because it cannot be worse than the weed seed back. I work hard, and my family isn't that into the veggies I bring home, but it helps the soul. Experimenting, playing with gardening, feeling how much it takes to really feed people. Until I find a better relationship to my society I have trouble holding down a job or business, but I can work like live stock. Better than a horse, more self directed, more versatile with tools, more force per calorie.<br><br>I worry about how to take care of my parents, they are getting older, they still take care of me, I rely on them much currently, but I want to be able to help them if things disrupt. My Dad works in irrigation, his job is very nearly as safe as human habitation in my region is, and his skills are not easily replaced, working old canals is a subtle art form. But his health is the only thing holding up my whole family. I crave to be in a place to support him.<br><br>I don't worry too much about violence, people know people where I live, my neighbor likes me, she works in dispatch. Things could get bad and I could just sit it out. I have traveled, made peace among bad dudes. Violence, war, these don't worry me, might roll snake eyes, but there are many ways to roll snake eyes. You have more trouble hiding, but healing skills are huge, they earn REAL cred in a crisis, we each have a unique hand to play.<br><br>The poverty of war, that is frightening, I know the taste of poverty, tasted it on purpose when I saw this stuff coming, its bad. But, during a war? That could get crazy.<br><br>But its all in the soul, that's what matters. If you have something good to do, something worth staying out of trouble for, then what matters trouble?<br><br>I have been very isolated recently, I had been making good inroads into bringing up good things for discussion, but since moving I have had trouble connecting. No, its not the move. It the time. Rhetoric, tensions, everywhere, very heated, makes conversation hard. Today I was blessed, got to listen to a friend talk about her family issues, it helped me to listen.<br><br>I just want this era to be over, the acted out pantomime of a society around me is a nightmare. Maybe I just need to get out more.<br><br>@ JMG<br><br>I like the Essays, but mostly this blog is therapy a guiding star in a world that I would other wise be hopelessly lost within.

(There are, after all, some stillbirths due to fetal lung malformations everywhere.) Truth may be an ironclad defense in a libel case, but what do you do when the truth has been obscured by the corruption of science by corporate money? Any sufficiently well-off corporation these days can flood a courtroom with hired shills in white lab coats with Ph.D.s in the relevant science and a long string of publications funded by corporate-friendly interests, who will say what their paymasters want them to say, no matter how dishonest it needs to be, and be rewarded by a new research grant. In my story, that's what Gemotek did -- and since so many people in the scientific scene these days believe in the unequivocal benevolence and harmlessness of GMOs the way that medieval peasants believed in the existence of hippogriffs, that seems unhappily plausible to me. <br><br>Nastarana, stay tuned! ;-)<br><br>Sherril, granted. For Monsanto to be given a taste of its own medicine, I recommend that all existing and future Monsanto products receive rigorous safety testing, using the CEO and other executives as the guinea pigs. Having each one start by drinking a bottle of Roundup might be a good start. <br><br>Toomas, thanks for the link!<br><br>Amy, understood. One of the most ghastly consequences of the wholesale betrayal of collective ideals that has made today's America what it is, is the way that it's withered the capacity to imagine anything better than the sclerotic and dysfunctional mess we've got today. Barack Obama's crassly cynical 2008 campaign, in which he spewed sound bites about "Hope" and "Change" and "Yes We Can" and then turned around the moment he was in office and betrayed the hope, denied the change, and told the American people "No We Can't," is in many ways a perfect summary of the last forty years or so. It's hard to remember that things have been better in the past, and can be better in the future -- hard, because it hurts so much in the context of the utterly unsatisfactory present. I'll do a post on this as time permits. <br><br>Eric, that's a reasonable stance. I'm not too happy with the suite of GMO technologies as a whole, but would have been willing to settle for rigorous third party testing (by actual third parties with no financial stake in the products) and reasonable labeling laws. If the GMO industry is going to argue for the right to dump whatever inadequately tested product on the market that it wants to, though, I'm going to side with the anti-GMO movement: we face less harm from no GMOs at all than from the overfamiliar consequences of scientific arrogance and corporate venality. <br><br>Thomas, I'd like to see that story!<br><br>Buzzy, thanks for the feedback from Dixie! That was my impression as well -- here in western Maryland, five miles south of the Mason-Dixon line, just west of a Civil War battlefield, and in a part of the country that was divided more or less evenly between Union and Confederate supporters, I've had long conversations with people I know who can tell you exactly which CSA units their forefathers served in, and in which battles they fought. Thanks, though, for the reminder about the Bonny Blue Flag! I could see that becoming a workable compromise banner for the new Confederacy -- enough historical resonance to please the traditionalists, but a certain distance from the battle flag and its later uses. If that's the case, no doubt the song "The Bonny Blue Flag" would be a likely national anthem, with "Dixie" having roughly the same role "America the Beautiful" has in the USA.<br><br><a href=#c8451650784311942262 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 6:55 PM</a><br><br>

What doomed Hypatia was not only her defense of the old philosophical traditions, but also her connection to Alexandria’s patrician class; her ghastly fate was as much the vengeance of the underclass against the elite as it was an act of religious persecution. She was far from the only victim of violence driven by those paired motives, either. It was as a result of such pressures that, by the time the emperor Justinian ordered the last academies closed in 529 CE, the classical philosophical tradition was essentially dead."<br><br><a href=#c3900028733718006510 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 6:57 PM</a><br><br>

I think your prediction is quite likely to pan out, all things considered. It would certainly fit historical patterns. <br><br>Clay, exactly. One of the all but universal events in revolutions in history is that some of the regime's military forces go over to the rebel side. That's when you know you've passed from ordinary turmoil to Big Trouble. <br><br>Violet, no, things worked out differently in this future history. I'm pretty sure that at least one foreign power sent arms and funding to help the rebels once the Second Civil War broke out, but there were never any concentration camps -- just a steady worsening of trends already present here and now over the eight years separating 2016 and 2024. There were some major urban riots in 2022 and 2023, and the first stirrings of rural insurgency, but nothing wholly out of the ordinary before the Birmingham riots blew up, National Guard units switched sides, and the Second Civil War was on. There were atrocities on both sides in that war -- there are in every war -- but nothing on an epic scale, since both sides were trying to attract support from the masses. <br><br>As for the possibility of being targeted due to your identity, I have a different perspective on that. My working guess is that later historians will say that the triumph of the campaign for same-sex marriage in the US marked the end of the road for the era of moral scapegoating that was ushered in by Jerry Falwell and his ilk in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The attempt to whip up a frenzy about transgendered people using public bathrooms is already being met with widespread derision -- and when that moral panic crumples, as it will, what then? (Maybe we should have a contest for the next thing for social pseudoconservatives to get into a swivet about.) We are entering a different era, one in which politics rather than religion is framing social conflict, and the themes over which people will struggle and die are still just beginning to take shape -- but my guess is that issues of religious and gender identity will drop into the "who cares?" category in the US for the next thirty to forty years, while other issues entirely become the hot buttons du jour. <br><br>Hawkcreek, like most people who are historically literate, I know that history involves a lot of violence, some of which is directed at appropriate targets. Thanks for the offer of a hacksaw blade, though! <br><br>Donalfagan, good! Certainly the obsessive support for Clinton on the part of the Democratic party nomenklatura is a godsend for Trump's campaign; Sanders would be very hard for The Donald to beat, but an arrogant, venal political hack with no talent for campaigning and nothing to offer but a continuation of a status quo most Americans loathe? I see a very real possibility of the Dems suffering an epochal defeat in November. <br><br>SLClaire, we all have blood on our hands. I can't cook a meal without melting part of Greenland or buy vegetables without indirectly drawing down the planet's dwindling oil reserves. Thus Mary Chenkin's comments apply to me, too, and all the rest of us. <br><br>Don, hmm! I think you can order them through ordinary channels -- and your local bookstore should be able to tell you that promptly, since everything's computerized these days. Please give it a try, and let me know what happens.<br><br><a href=#c7366668197199965356 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 7:24 PM</a><br><br>

I spend a lot of time observing mostly local politicians and local politics, and the party differences are minimal at this level. What strikes me is that the fairly common-sensical, relatively knowledgeable people won't run for office, because the people in office - regardless of party - are either actually idiots, or pretending to be idiots to avoid responding to hard questions in an authentic way, or taking firm positions on controversial issues. Very often they defer to staff, or direct staff to make a certain set of recommendations, so they can appear to be deferring to staff. I suppose it boils down to irresponsibility.<br><br>Speaking for myself, for one thing, I'm better suited temperamentally to report on community affairs than run for office, so that's what I do. I can't glad-hand, or ask for money. Also, I'm not an idiot, and don't want to pretend to be one to play the game, stroke the egos, etc. so I have no interest in spending hundreds of hours of my time intimately engaged with people who are playing those games, trying to get work done. <br><br>In any case, working is not what is going on at the local government level right now. It's posturing. <br><br>Maybe LR hit rock bottom and the posturing had to finally stop, which made room for the workers to get into office. Just lonely and frustrating out here.<br><br>I suppose part of the response will need to be groups of serious people running in blocs, to increase the odds of having at least one fellow hard worker.<br><br><a href=#c8004055206621130532 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 7:31 PM</a><br><br>

As it happens, you're quite correct to question Carr's historical literacy. This is a man who's never heard of Robert Louis Stevenson or David Bowie, remember; he's the natural outcome of the current pixelization of knowledge on the internet -- what he knows, he knows extremely well (for example, the history of jazz) and what he doesn't know doesn't exist at all. General education? Almost completely absent in the Atlantic Republic. As for your broader point, the nations of the British Commonwealth are a bit of a historical anomaly, you know; Britain's one of the very, very few imperial powers in history to relinquish its colonies without much of a fight. Carr's dictum isn't always right, but it's right rather more often than not. <br><br>Greg, exactly -- I was also thinking of the baffled attitude of the current punditocracy to the Trump and Sanders insurgencies when I sent Michael Yates to his death on the platform. <br><br>Sara, thank you. "Where will all the energy come from?" If I could, I'd get that question put on the business end of a branding iron and apply it to the tender portions of the anatomy of anybody who babbles about this or that allegedly wonderful fantasy future, where we all zoom around on jetpacks or what have you. Do you know, by the way, why jetpacks have never been viable? Because you can't carry enough fuel on your back to stay in the air for more than a couple of seconds...<br><br>Dax, thank you for reminding me of the Haitian example. You're quite right, of course -- it happens, has happened, will happen. <br><br>Aron, many thanks -- and also thanks for the music! I'll consider this a soundtrack for this episode. <br><br>Hugo, I wonder if it's ever occurred to any of the people who insist that this or that inadequately tested corporate product equals Progress that if they keep it up, and cause enough preventable disasters, people will end up rejecting the entire concept of progress. I'm already seeing shifts in that direction. <br><br>Nrgmiserncaz, thank you! And thank you also for the link; yes, "haunting" is the word for it. Large parts of the US will look like that in due time; some already do. <br><br>Ed-M, no question, it's going to be ugly whoever gets into the White House this November. As for Pentheus, you know, I didn't even think of him, and I should have. I was thinking of the September Massacres during the French Revolution, and also -- I've been rereading Herbert Marcuse, with an eye toward where he ran off the rails -- Freud's fantasia of the primal horde and the killing of the father-despot. <br><br>Zaphod42, thank you! (Re your offlist comment -- I'd be happy to, but I don't seem to have your email. If you can put it in a post marked "not for comment," I'll respond as soon as time permits.) <br><br>Hereward, thank you! The thing is, your argument doesn't work because it misstates the consequences of competition. Let's compare two counties; one county has lower taxes and fewer amenities, and the other has higher taxes and more amenities. Those who like lower taxes consider the first county the winner, those who like more amenities give the prize to the second.

That's a great piece of writing.<br>Thank you.<br>I'm just trying to conceive if it is true that every nation in history (including any native tribes) anywhere that doesn't have some bloodshed as an incidental starting point. <br><br>Germany, obviously, came together out of the Franco-Prussian war. Spain, sure, out of the defeat of the Caliphate. Switzerland when the four Cantons rebelled against the Austrians. Italy, as a result of Garibaldi's campaign. Plenty of modern states came into being as a result of the Great War, and I suppose many states can point to some war that brought their antecedents into being.<br><br>But not all, I think.<br><br>Did England have an incidental point at which they became a nation? Recent archaeology is casting doubts on Bede's account of violent invasion by the Saxons, but England, indeed all of Europe, has innumerable battles and constant strife as they evolved into nations over centuries soaked with blood. Can any given battle or war be truly said to be the point at which France, or Holland, or Denmark came into being? Some of them have borders that change almost from decade to decade over time. Marriage has been a frequent means of territorial expansion, too.<br><br>Even Canada, despite what we popularly tell ourselves about peaceful devolution from colony to Dominion, has a lot of warfare, but I'm not sure if any one particular violent event really qualifies, at least not the way Paul Revere's Ride does in American history. The question of when Canada began has several points of candidacy: when the French first took land from the Iroquois, although I cannot recall any particular incident of violence that established the trading post that became the city of Quebec, there were certainly plenty of violent incidents and wars over the subsequent 150 years before the next possible candidate: when Wolfe defeated Montcalm. Maybe the U.S. War of Independence which drove out all the loyalists who migrated to and colonized Upper Canada (sort of a violent event by proxy?), maybe the War of 1812 that pretty much solidified Canadian Identity, maybe it was the 1866 Fenian Raid that prompted the Charlottetown conference that resulted in Confederation.<br>Maybe it was 9 April 1917 at Vimy Ridge that psychologically tied the nation together and earned Canada a place amongst the nations at Versailles, not just as a colony.<br>But for most of these Canada already existed as a polity, if not a completely independent nation, which, in fact, didn't happen until the signing of the Constitution in 1982, an event that has no violence associated with it at all.<br><br><a href=#c9218356864316310865 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 8:45 PM</a><br><br>

However, the problem is none of these individual GMO varieties are adequately or independently tested, and when you do finally track down independent studies, it's usually small sample sizes and individuals working on their own time out of University labs that for one reason or another can never fund their research, but even with the small sample sizes, the results point to serious health, safety, and environmental concerns. The reason people reject GMOs out of hand is because none of them are conclusively proven safe, unless you take biotech's word for it. If they were really safe to eat, wouldn't they be willing to mention that they are GMO foods on labels? How much money did biotech spend to prevent that from happening?<br><br><a href=#c7804598527471373966 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 10:30 PM</a><br><br>

I have been reading about civil war lately- not a very cheerful topic, but one I feel the need to better understand, given that I am coming to believe, as our host does, that it is not unlikely in our fairly near future. <br><br>Two other books using the toolkit of narrative fiction to explore the experiences of ordinary people during civil war are "Enemy Women", which is set in the American civil war (don't be put off by the love-story marketing- it's really not just fluffy chick lit), and "Lighthouse Island", set in a dystopian future of disrupted climate and authoritarian government. Both are written by Paulette Giles, an author I've only just discovered and will likely read more from. In addition to actual first-person historical accounts, I wish that those Americans glibly calling for violent political revolution these days would read some convincing fictional accounts like these (and, of course, like our host's "Twilight's Last Gleaming") and reflect a little more about what an actual civil war might do to those on all sides, including their own. <br><br>I'm feeling fear like that Violet describes, not so much for myself as for my children, who will be just coming into young adulthood in the mid 2020's. I'm choosing to channel that fear into teaching them as much as I can now, and also working with a youth organization in our community (4H) which focuses on developing children's civic leadership and participation and service to others, and teaches kids from the ages of 5-19 how to engage in public discourse and decision-making using a modified form of Robert's Rules of Order. I am praying that the seeds I'm planting and nurturing now may make some difference in the future these children will face. <br><br>And like others have mentioned, when I just can't think about it any more, I go dig in the garden for a while. I am thankful to the weeds that they provide an outlet for my anxious energy. ;)<br><br>--Heather in CA<br><br><a href=#c6994972430731396627 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 10:59 PM</a><br><br>

After catching up and rereading the past chapters, I happened to find a copy of Michael Cimino's film Heaven's Gate at the library. It is the restored Director's Cut at 216 minutes. I mention this because it is relevant to the discussion thread for this week's story. It is also a great movie, far from the industry's current fare of crass CGI Super Heroes. I have only seen one movie in a theater in the past year, but have seen plenty of the classics from the library on DVD's.<br><br> In the movie, the wealthy Stock Owners in Montana declare war, in 1890, on the newly arrived immigrants and hire cutthroats to murder the foreigners staking claims in Johnson County. The county Marshall, played by Kris Kristofferson, sides with the poor and in real life Mr. Averell was hanged by the wealthy as a lesson to all. This was at the same time as the execution of Joe Hill, made famous by the song of the same name.<br><br> The movie only ran for only one week, in 1980. It was pulled by the studio because it got such bad reviews. Months later it was butchered into a much shorter film, thereby destroying the master negative. When this shorter version was finally shown, in late 1980, in the greater national market, it met with whithering disdain from the critics, the public and the rich who were defamed by its storyline. It killed the studio that spawned it. The movie faded into obscurity.<br> <br> Now, thirty-five years later, it is a seldom seen classic film, restored from the color separation negatives by Cimino. It has a remarkable currency and an immediacy that speaks to today's political situation. It is also very slow by today's hypersonic action movies that are long on effects and short on meaningful story. <br><br> For the young Americans of today, who are saddled with school loans and living in their parent's basement, the future appears to be joblessness and deeper poverty. Their world and the world of other Americans, in worse circumstances, are comparable to the immigrant victims in the film. The young with no future, are partly Sanders followers, who will assemble in both Cleveland and Philadelphia this summer for “Chicago, 1968 Redux.” Today's party leaders are the Stock Owners of 1890 in modern dress and just as clueless.<br><br> Seeing Heaven's Gate as history rarely told and applying it to tomorrow's confrontations continues another chapter of the troubled and fractured America empire, but this time with a Billionaire as the leader of the pack. What a wonderful weirdness reality takes when the gods go crazy. Where is Howard Zinn when we need him recording and documenting this new chapter for our grandchildren.<br><br> The film gave fresh images and meaning to the Retrotopia story for my imagination to play with and my mind to ponder. We all await the next chapter and the coming reports from whatever happens in the convention cities, this next month. Thank you for your abilities for conger up and illustrate alternate worlds.<br><br><a href=#c193770165294561361 title="comment permalink">5/19/16, 11:01 PM</a><br><br>

Hey, let's insert genes for antibiotic resistance into <i>Yersinia pestis</i>, the bacterium that causes the Black Death -- what could possibly go wrong? <br><br>Barrigan, that's an excellent point. The placebo effect is an extremely powerful healing modality. If our culture wasn't so terrified of finding out that the mind really does affect the body, we'd be figuring out ways to amplify it and use it for healing, not relegating it to the control-group end of pharmaceutical research. (And as we figured out how to amplify and use it, we'd figure out what a significant chunk of traditional magical lore is actually about...) <br><br>Submarine, fascinating -- I hadn't heard of the SOD fiasco yet. Doesn't surprise me a bit that a system based on postmodernism would flop good and hard. Thanks for the link, which is definitely grist for the mill. <br><br>Unknown, thank you. Yeah, I'm glad I got out of Ashcan -- er, Ashland when I did. Sedate old towns in the Appalachians are more my style.<br><br>Ezra, I'd heard the same thing; my wife has celiac disease and so keeps tabs on a lot of things in the food-intolerance sphere. The soaring rates of serious food allergy since GMOs entered the food supply are interesting -- it would be nice if someone would do a well-funded, objective, non-whitewashing study on that. Roundup would be another good place to look. <br><br>Submarine, indeed I have. It's going to be fascinating to watch, if Clinton gets the nomination, how her cheerleading department in the media will deal once Trump goes all out on "Crooked Hillary" and hammers her with the same kind of repeated out-of-the-blue body blows he used to flatten his Republican opponents. As his poll numbers climb and hers slide, it's going to get really colorful in the establishment media echo chamber as they try to argue the country out of its visceral rejection of the status quo -- never realizing that nobody outside the echo chamber listens to them at all. Do you recall when George Will insisted at the top of his lungs that the Berlin Wall wasn't coming down, it came down within the week, and he spent the next month or so quite literally babbling half-connected sentences in print? It'll be like that. <br><br>Rita, the thing that differentiates me from most science fiction writers is that I stopped believing in the myth of progress, and so I can actually write about the world in which we live (and will live in the future), rather than getting stuck in Walt Disney's Tomorrowland, trying to pretend that the paint isn't peeling and half the rides haven't already ground to a halt. Thanks for the capsule review of Mervyn King's book; I may take a look at it, and see how its prose stacks up to, oh, James Joyce's <i>Finnegan's Wake</i>. I've read books by serious economists that made “Oftwhile balbulous, mithre ahead, with goodly trowel in grasp and ivoroiled overalls which he habitacularly fondseed” seem clare as glarse. <br><br>(So to speak.) <br><br>Carl, it happens in really savage riots now and again. <br><br>Spanish Fly, exactly.

I admit to wondering if that was done deliberately. <br><br>Submarine, classic Spengler! Yes, it applies -- except that our society is hardly "too masculine, too healthy, too sober."<br><br>Ray, I'm delighted to have found so many people who are on the one hand interested in hearing my far from little rants, and on the other willing to talk courteously and intelligently with me and one another, so I definitely get that. <br><br>Candace, good! Yes, and that was also somewhere in mind. <br><br>Steadystatecollege, what I meant by referring to the leftward end of things is that it's almost entirely the left that likes to demonize its political enemies using psychological language. The right does it using moral language. Same song, different words. As for why the political system seems to favor dysfunction these days -- well, no government on earth will ever be better than the people it governs, and a lot of Americans are pretty massively dysfunctional these days...<br><br>Siliconguy, I was speaking parabolically, of course. I'd be perfectly happy seeing the corporate executives get randomly sized doses so we could determine what the LD-50 of Roundup is. ;-)<br><br>Renaissance, of course! Don't assume that Carr speaks for me -- I do know who Robert Louis Stevenson was, for example!<br><br>Dennis, I have no idea why people in this country have been so passive in the face of the gaudy corruption, abuse, and kleptocratic profiteering of the medical industry, even when it costs a lot of people their lives.

That's a solid organization and one that teaches many of the same skills the old fraternal orders use -- including the modified Rules of Order. Good for you -- and good for them. <br><br>EntropicDoom, fascinating. I wasn't aware of the movie at all -- admittedly I don't do much in the way of visual media.

I especially liked the lithium crisis as I have done some research on the subject, as you probably remember. The thing that astonished me is that the insurgencies and the second civil war in the USA of retrotopia started in 2026. I always expected that the resilience of the current political-economic system will break later, in the 2030s. 2026 is frighteningly close (I am 47 so if the universe allows me, I will probably see it, but maybe by then I will have already seen worse things in Greece; I am eagerly anticipating your essay on the geopolitical-economic situation and future of Europe that you promised us).<br>Another query I have is where are the war bands? As I understand it, Lakeland Republic managed to avoid the war band stage of collapse due to some good leadership and luck but what about the other nations?

I look forward to them every week.<br><br>I have 4 decades of work as an occupational therapist - most of it in pediatrics. I have had a front row seat for the autism epidemic and so I see the similarities in this chapter of Retroropia. Of course, in the current epidemic of autism (as well as childhood type 2 diabetes, obesity, fatty liver disease, etc, etc) there is not one convenient toxin, but the cumulative effect of hundreds of thousands. Add to these, the almost total extinction of unstructured children's play - where children blew off some stress &amp; its accompanying inflammation. We're at least two generations into this mess so epigenetic variations are being passed on. Lots of finger pointing &amp; mounting rage in parents &amp; grandparents. <br><br>The official party line calls autism essentially a "hopeless" diagnosis and says the best we can do is provide expensive Applied Behavioral Analysis - an approach I believe will go the way of electroshock therapy and iron maidens. (Ooh, boy, wait til you see the ruffled feathers that comment brings on). I know from personal experience and lots of "anecdotal" evidence from parents, providers, and people with autism, that changing diets to eliminate processed foods &amp; spending hours, days, &amp; years teaching these kids to play produces "miraculous" results - but very little corporate profits - so that even mentioning them in medical &amp; educational communities results in varying degrees of shunning. <br><br>I teach seminars for professionals on techniques for developing self-regulation (physical &amp; emotional balance) in children with autism &amp; ADHD and I speak to the importance of food &amp; play in achieving this. I generally get a positive response as these approaches make sense, but most of the participants hands are tied in carrying these out due to institutional restrictions. The cracks are getting ever wider and the alternative healing communities grow as more and more people fall through. <br><br>I would not be surprised to see parents &amp; granparents lead the "revolution". They are that angry. Fortunately we also have many articulate people with autism who can speak to the blessings of neuro-diversity. I hope to see this change occur through returning to sustainability - Retroropia style - without the bloodshed. In fact, I pray for that with each seminar that I teach.<br><br><a href=#c3084404367351253191 title="comment permalink">5/20/16, 5:19 AM</a><br><br>

Do we know for sure that the measles and flu viruses will be swept off the face of the earth by vaccination? If not, could we be making a mistake we might deeply regret for these nonserious infections? Possibilities of epidemics in the future have been bandied about here. It might be something as mundane as a resurgence of these viruses in a resistant form in a population that no longer has the ability to tolerate them.<br><br>Was it worth it? Not for me. I recall the day I got my measles shot and the talk my mother gave me about it. She thought it was great I would never have to go through the measles. She had 4 children sick with measles when I was 2 weeks old. That must have been fun! I never got it. I was breastfed. Since then I've been vaccinated two more times and as a nurse, I get titers drawn when I get a new job. There has been a see-saw with my immunity for both measles and mumps. One time I got just the mumps shot because my immunity for measles was OK. On my last titer a year ago, I had mumps immunity but not measles. So it only lasts a few years. So far as I know, I have a good immune system, in fact it seems better than average. But now they are recommending these shots every 10 years, or at least the Tdap. So now I am 58 and have no immunity to measles, which is bad for adults to get. I've been immunized 3 times. <br><br>I had a friend who got chicken pox in her 40s and was hospitalized. Would my mother have given me that shot if she knew I'd have lifelong problems instead of lifelong immunity? I think not. It's funny that my titers always show immunity to rubella, for which I had the natural disease sometime in childhood. <br><br>I just found the following excerpt which shows just the sort of problem I've been wondering about. Because mothers no longer have true immunity to measles, babies are getting measles, when there are outbreaks, at younger and more dangerous ages in infancy:<br><br>From an Oxford Journal of Infectious Disease:<br><br>Achieving protection against measles presents particular challenges. The highest case-fatality rates occur in children&lt;12 months old worldwide [1–5]; recently, epidemics in the United States have shown a shift of peak incidence to infants&lt;12 months old [6–9]. Infants as young as 6 months old are now susceptible to outbreaks of imported measles in the United States as a result of the earlier loss of transplacentally acquired measles antibodies in infants born to mothers with vaccine-induced immunity to measles [10–13]. Most infants in the United States are now born to mothers who have vaccine-induced immunity to measles, which is associated with lower measles antibody titers,<br><br><a href=#c9211130502017158215 title="comment permalink">5/20/16, 6:10 AM</a><br><br>

Sorry to hear about the lack of stability. I've recently gone through something similar and I lost a lot, and can relate. I'm happy to hear that your dad has a good job and that you're doing experimental garden pots. In regards to it being all about the soul, I totally agree, but also view the soul as a biological entity, the breath of life that enlivens the physical form. While I accept the possibility of death, I still acknowledge my attachments to the forms of my life, my body, and my spirit that fills it. While I do not believe that consciousness ends at death (instead moving on to an astral existence untethered by physicality) I find that I love physicality. It's such a buffet of concrete experience!!<br><br>JMG, Many, many thanks for your perspective!! I certainly hope that you're right in terms of future history. The US has created so many death squads in other parts of the world that it's hard for me to imagine the same strategy not being used here by hostile foreign powers interested in feeding a fractured USA into their wealth pump. Again I hope that I'm very, very wrong and that history more closely follows the course you've outlined.<br><br>In terms of my identities, again thank you for your perspective. Perhaps growing up bullied, with a family line heavily marked by attempted genocide has marked my sense of place in society. Not sure how accurate my own filter is on this, and am thus very grateful for reading yours! I have felt a certain shift in the larger culture, and frankly do hope that sane, relevant political options become more pertinent to finding place within larger society than more biological or religious identities. I'm very curious btw, if you have insights into "the themes over which people will struggle and die " that are just starting to take shape right now - is this social democrats vs anti-free trade nationalism vs an anachronistic investment in the Dubyobama consensus? Something more inchoate as of yet? Something that only coalesces in a sweep of violence like the CEO being killed in Toledo and the Birmingham riots leading to civil war where people get partisan real fast? There are political changes I feel afoot, but they remain rather opaque to my attempts at categorization in their incipient forms.<br><br>W.B, Thank you for sharing your approach. I too try to focus on the creation of meaning, and creating strategies for survival as well. For the past 8 years or so I've been delving deeper into a more meaningful life. The thing is, the more I do it the more attached to living I become! It's so rewarding and meaningful! This seems to be a paradox that I am still lacking maturity to fully apprehend; how to really accept the profundity of death with grace while holding the meaningfulness and beauty of life in a human body on this planet<br><br><a href=#c8364610403065154912 title="comment permalink">5/20/16, 7:55 AM</a><br><br>

While it can suffer from the same internal politics and bureaucratic tendencies as any organization, I consider these a feature, not a bug, as they provide teachable moments to discuss with the kids the types of forces they will certainly have to contend with in the future. <br><br>For readers unfamiliar with it, 4-H has historically been an agriculturally oriented organization supported through the county agricultural extension service that teaches young people how to do traditional skills, such as raising livestock to exhibit and sell, and doing cooking, preserving, and handicrafts. (Think blue ribbons at the county fair.) These are still strong components of the program, but other projects have also been added over the years, depending on the knowledge and willingness of the local adult volunteers. My kids have thus been able to try out photography, archery, chess, and web design over the years, in addition to the aforementioned. The ten kids in the Junior Master Gardener project I lead learned about plant science and ecology, started plenty of seeds and took cuttings from my garden to grow at home, and also grew a row of produce to donate to the local food pantry. (Sorry to brag, but I am very proud of their hard work.) <br><br>The name 4-H comes from the pledge which the kids recite at each meeting and try to connect to their own actions across the year: "I pledge my Head to clearer thinking, my Heart to greater loyalty, my Hands to larger service, and my Health to better living, for my club, my community, my country, and my world." This is something I can get behind. <br><br>I encourage anyone with kids ages 5-19 to check if there is a club in their area, or if not, to consider starting one (even, maybe especially, in urban settings!). A quick Google search will get you going. And for those readers looking for something constructive to do with their time and energy (or a channel for their concern about the direction of the world), please consider volunteering with your local 4-H club. You don't need to have kids, just willingness to engage. Even if you don't think you have skills to share, the organization can provide co-leaders and curriculum on dozens and dozens of topics. If you DO have skills- knitting, say, or small engine repair, or woodworking, or watercolor painting, or what have you- you will be ever so gratefully welcomed. <br><br>Sorry, I'll stop the commercial now. It's just nice to have something to be enthusiastic about in this sometimes-bleak world. <br><br>-- Heather in CA<br><br><a href=#c4779209533348011287 title="comment permalink">5/20/16, 8:11 AM</a><br><br>

I personally prefer good old fashioned heirlooms for a variety of reasons (one of the chief being the fun of having access to unique vegetables you can’t get at stores). However, my issues with GMOs are about on par with my issues with most varieties of overly hybridized crops, or with other, more conventional industrialized agriculture. There’s certainly a scale there, and I wouldn’t necessarily say that round-up ready crops are necessarily worse than the habit of using increasingly larger and larger amounts of round-up on fields that it’s designed to replace (I think the studies that have been done in that area have shown that fields where GMO crops are grown have slightly better biodiversity than fields where conventional insecticides are used, but not by much and don’t even begin to compare to small intensive non-GMO organic plots that don’t use pesticides at all). It’s all part of the same big, messy system and I’d prefer to see the funding and resources being put into GMOs being put towards things that would actually do more good than harm, such as providing incentives to individuals, homeowners associations, apartment complexes, and businesses who participate in “food not lawns” initiatives or a variety of other options… Even with the most optimistic projections for the future of GMOs, there is just nothing to excite me about a promised future where our entire food supply consists of artificial variants on the same species of corn and soy… And the fact that the people who have taken up shaming and humiliating anyone who has problems with the technology or any aspects of it (alas, way too many of them friends from my days in college studying human ecology, sustainable development, and natural history who, sadly, seem to have gained a very different set of values out of that program than I did) are essentially using bullying tactics to force you to buy a product, doesn’t sweeten me any further. <br><br>But I figure if the advocates of GMOs want to turn their advocacy for their product into a moral crusade, the least I can do rhetorically with them is set a bar for them and a fairly low bar at that, of a minimum in longitudinal testing on human subjects and on fields, for each and every new variety of seed developed. That’s the average amount of time it takes for adverse effects of things like lead, asbestos, and tobacco to emerge so it seems fair. But, considering that the first variety of Bt corn was developed in 1996, and within the past 20 years several new varieties have already been developed and marketed without a single longitudinal study them, my bar will probably never be passed. So yeah… if I had to pick a side, I’d be firmly against, but I find that taking the middle ground and acknowledging crops on a case by case basis rather than addressing the entire technology collectively makes people think more, and makes them more uncomfortable. Especially since it renders discussion of things like C4 rice meaningless because it doesn’t even exist yet. Which keeps the discussion tightly centered on the real world, and the adequacy (or lack thereof), of the experimentation on the crops that do exist, (which is so far pretty disappointing as far as experimental design goes). My standards also allow different strains to be viewed separately, so that, if a strain of C4 rice was developed and began testing, I’d look at the crop and the experiments themselves, without once referencing experiments on Bt Corn, which means that, theoretically, it would be possible for some GMO products to be less problematic than others. I figure setting clear, but strict standards while being willing to keep an open mind as long as those standards are met is a fair way to hold on to my values without being dogmatic about it. Of course, with our polarized culture, even that fair line of division is enough to get ridiculed… <br><br><br><a href=#c6126701315807111242 title="comment permalink">5/20/16, 8:49 AM</a><br><br>

However, a desert creature suddenly dropped into marshland is unlikely to survive long. <br><br>In the Lakeland Republic, however, the county lines are more or less arbitrary and humans, unlike the natural world example given above, are quite capable of adapting from tier 1 conditions to tier 5 conditions or vice versa. What is therefore likely to happen is that a majority of Lakelanders decide that tier x provides a good compromise between taxation and comfort and so all the tier x counties start to fill up. As a result they start to prosper and maybe even become overpopulated. Meanwhile the lower tier counties experience dwindling populations and may not even receive enough revenue to keep their limited amenities going. Tier x counties then look at their neighbours and make them an offer: cash for land. Alternatively, the councillors in tier x-n counties see how things are going and hold a council meeting at which they decide to upgrade (n could equally be negative in which case it should read downgrade here) their tier to stop losing so many people. Either way, pretty soon the whole of Lakeland Republic is tier x.<br><br><a href=#c5482564711501494306 title="comment permalink">5/20/16, 11:31 AM</a><br><br>

I liked the idea of getting genetic engineering out of corporate control so that it could be used for something more useful than creating herbicide-resistant crops, but like a lot of you, I was a bit worried about the idea of people playing around and doing who-knew-what, possibly with little idea of what they were doing. So I joined the group, to see if something useful could be done, and also to prevent stupidly-dangerous ideas from taking off. <br><br>It was actually a lab belonging to one of the members, who had his own little biotech startup, so ours wasn't in a garage, and I think it was better set up than most of these things.<br><br>What did we actually do:<br>-we grew yoghurt bacteria, only some of which survived.<br>-we made lab strain E. coli glow (standard thing I did back in 2nd year bio. at university)<br>-we looked at diatoms and fungi under the microscope<br>-we chased down information on yoghurt bacteria and gut microflora in the scientific literature.<br>-we talked A LOT<br><br>That's about it for while I was there. I think they might have done one or two more things after I left, but it has now closed down. I think most of these groups, don't do any more than we did. There's a few larger groups in places like Silicon Valley that do a lot more: http://biocurious.org/<br><br>I'm more worried about individual researchers with their own minilabs than the public groups, since they are harder to keep an eye on. With the public groups, things like putting antibiotic resistance into Yrsinia pestis would get noticed and shut down fast. Most of these labs aren't set up to safely handle human pathogens anyway. Bad stuff coming out of them would likely be accidental - like some twit taking home glowing plants (involves eukaryotes, so not an easy project) they designed, and then having them release seeds so you've got glowing weeds in the neighborhood that you've no idea if they're safe. That would be quite bad enough, though I think the main result of that one would be the local lab getting shut down and a lot more regulation of these groups around the world. That might not be so bad.<br><br>With lone individuals or a couple of friends with a lab that they don't invite random people to, some nasty stuff could well come out of them at some point if transportation links keep working reliably.

As JMG has said, prejudice based on gender identity and religion is on the way down right now. However, the wealth and class gap is white hot and boiling right now. So, if you live a frugal life and don't sneer at the wage class, and meet people at their level with compassion, you should be okay. For example, if I went to the local dollar store/Save a Lot and did a random poll of people to see if they had been abroad, could ever afford to go abroad, or could imagine ever going abroad/being able to afford to go abroad, I'm sure the poll would be a big, fat goose egg (unless I did a bilingual poll, that would skew things a bit) There may be a very rare chance that an Anglo in a mixed marriage with an immigrant had travelled by car to Mexico to meet the in-laws, but I wouldn't count on it.<br>I look for people in the South to pick the name Confederacy precisely for the charged effect it has on Yankees and the Southern straw man they love to beat. Today, there are a lot of "Southerners of Convenience" (aka, carpetbaggers) who live in the South for opportunistic reasons (lower taxes, milder winters, affordable housing), yet have no intention of assimilating into the South, and continue to sneer at the South and mouth anti-Southern stereotypes. You also have the hipsters that Buzzy mentioned, who hate being in the South and want to create some little San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, etc. carbon copy in the South. By reestablishing the Confederacy, all these people will flee phantoms of lynching and slavery that they're certain will come to pass, but never will. Once they've fled, we can then establish our own immigration laws. I fully expect the African American community to stay--they've already collectively voted with their feet to leave (Great Migration), and are now voting with their feet to come back (Reverse Great Migration). They know where home and their roots are, and will probably fight like hell for their part of it.<br><br><a href=#c5806281588206688249 title="comment permalink">5/20/16, 1:36 PM</a><br><br>

Just more evidence of what a flawed candidate she really is and why she's having so much trouble. But then again, she got beaten in 2008 by a first term US Senator that most people had never even heard of prior to the 2008 presidential race, namely Barack Obama.

We know from the newspaper report that satellites in mid-range orbits are goners, meaning lots of problems for countries like the AR that depend on them. We know Carr's high up in AR governance and will be reporting back to AR everything he learns in LR, and he's learned plenty due to the negotiations he's been tasked with carrying out. Carr might realize that the LR's experience has much to offer to the AR to ease the difficulties of the post-satellite era. In this case he wouldn't stay in the LR, but upon his return he would advocate for some of the LR's policies being adopted in the AR. With the AR being between a rock and a hard place, Montrose and her administration might be open to applying some of the lessons Carr has learned from the LR to the AR.

They are the ones standing up to the NWO, asserting their national sovereignty, developing alternatives to Westernization and refusing to back down. <br><br>The Russian government recently banned GMO's and is actively encouraging organic agriculture. Russian leaders, including Vladimir Putin, have openly compared companies like Monsanto to terrorist organizations that are just as dangerous a threat to public safety and national security as Daesh ("ISIS") or Al Qaeda.

This is one of the reasons why I and many of the people I know have become very pro-Russian in recent years.<br><br>I would say the pushback against Monsatan and its ilk has already begun and it is Mother Russia that is leading the charge. Spengler predicted that the next great civilization would come out of Russia and that Russia would not begin to truly flower until it freed itself from the shackles of Petrinism.

Still waiting for a glimpse of where the Lakeland Republic might add end up decades after this visit by Mr. Carr, since it clearly isn't sustainable either, very much living on salvaged materials and books written before its foundation.<br><br>I have spent the two-month hiatus and the weeks about current politics reading the archives, and find some things I posted a few months ago have been mentioned before. Particularly, I have commented that not the entire Roman Empire suffered the fate of Britannia, that Byzantium survived. Others have done so, too - does Stephen Heyer still read this blog? Now I have read up on the fate of Greece in the 7th century and come to the conclusion that it is much more frightening than Britannia or Noricum. What could be more frightening than considering that Olympia, Elis, Corinth and other sites with a 1200 year history of written literature, constitutions and traditions completely vanished from the written record in the 7th century AD? They appeared to be well in 530 (there were more than 80 cities on the Peloponnesos), but after 620 there is not a single inscription or coin to be found until the 9th century. According to Florin Curta (much of his work is available on ResearchGate), a large part of the Balkans, what is now Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia, was simply abandoned by human beings between 620 and 670. This is much more unsettling than imagining Slavic barbarian hordes overrunning the Empire. Constantinople, of course, continued intact and with some literary tradition preserved. However, the first chronicle written after the New Dark Ages, Maximus' Chronicle of 820, depended on a Syriac source - because apparently for 200 years nobody had even bothered to write down yearly events in most of Greece!<br><br>To come back to this week's post: the Lakeland Republic is truly a great utopia and not at all to be taken for granted. Of course, China, India and Japan offer counter-examples where written tradition never completely disappeared.<br><br><a href=#c6537912106534997082 title="comment permalink">5/20/16, 5:16 PM</a><br><br>

I am particularly fascinated with the chapters about how Islam, Christianity and Buddhism tamed the money and debt-based systems in the centuries after the demise of the great Roman, Han and Maurya empires.

Is it foolproof? Of course not; nothing in the real world ever is, but it works better than any of the alternatives." <br><br>It is my considered view that party politics as currently conducted is in large part responsible for the very fubar state of many nation states that masquerade as "healthy" representative democracies. The party system has become a haven for the psychotic, the ideological, and the bizarre, and rewards manipulation and narcissism. It is a very useful funnel for corporate cash ti use to misrepresent and manipulate and it is imho, almost entirely responsible for the current state of affairs.<br><br>It is axiomatic that a problem can never be solved by the same thinking that created it and I submit that we need to go back to first principles and ditch party politics. What is required is a move back to a dominance of the political sphere by independent representatives who then behave in a manner congruent with the Darwinian principle set out here:<br>"The same lesson is taught by Darwinian selection: in any complex setting, free competion produces a diversity of viable options, not a sterile uniformity."<br><br>Applying the Robinson Rules to such an assembly is far more likely to produce a useful outcome than a bunch of party politicians trying to tear each other down so that they may sit at the top of the pole and force their will on those below. It is precisely that unedifying spectacle that has the voting public spewing venom at their television sets every evening at news time.<br><br>The trigger for this view was watching the Tasmanian Greens walk away from a fight about a very badly sited pulp mill by ignoring a serious dioxin issue because their ideological support for plantation forestry as a means to avoid native forest logging was gamed by government and the plantation industry. Never mind the environmental and public health harm, we must not cut down any more native trees, and we will achieve this by ensuring thousands of hectares of introduced weeds are maintained in the landscape. It ended in farce, the agreements were reneged on by an incoming right-wing government and the pulp mill died as its proponents went belly up because they were actually too stupid to see that building a pulp mill put them in competition with their wood chip buying clients who stopped the cash flowing before the mill was approved. The approval process did reveal who the political parties really worked for tho. <br><br>What to do? As I see it the missing link in the political evolutionary ecosystem is an organisation that promotes the value of independent political actors to the general public and counters the massive effort being made by the status quo forces to convince the voters that party politics is a viable meme. Such an organisation would have no political agenda of its own other than to increase independent representation. A big task, I know, but from my reading of the public mood, one made easier by the phenomenon of resonance.<br><br>Looking forward to your reply, and thanks for giving me the opportunity to raise the matter.<br><br>eagle eye<br><br><a href=#c2361305505994376729 title="comment permalink">5/20/16, 5:40 PM</a><br><br>

An embarrassing spectacle to be sure, but fun. There was an article on Limbaugh's site not too long ago pointing out that Trump won't play by the rules. There won't be any pulled punches like McCain did with Obama, where he declined to go after Obama on Bill Ayers and Jeremiah Wright because McCain was afraid he would be accused of being "mean spirited" or "racist" for doing so.<br><br>Trump's presidential campaign instead will resemble Russia's recent military campaigns: smart, well executed and targeted against the adversary's weak points, but ruthless, aggressive and conducted with a complete lack of regard for what the political establishment, the chattering classes and the mass media think and say. <br><br>You can bet your last dollar that all of those Clinton scandals that Bill and Hillary have desperately tried to cover up, obfuscate or explain away will be dredged up and the more that Hillary tries to attack Trump, the more Trump will ramp up the pressure. When Hillary attacked Trump on his alleged behavior towards women, Trump brought up the various Bill scandals involving women, including allegations of rape and big payoffs of hush money. Look at how Trump demolished Cruz not only by calling him "Lyin Ted Cruz" at every opportunity, but also by leaking allegations to the press that Cruz had had multiple affairs after Cruz's allies ran an attack ad aimed at Trump's wife. I recently read an article about Whitewater, suggesting that will be another line of attack against the Clintons.<br><br>Again, I am reminded of Russia's Syrian campaign, where the Russians responded to every terrorist attack against them, like the bombing of a Russian airliner over the Sinai by Daesh and the shooting down of a Russian warplane by the Turks, by ratcheting up the pressure even more, while complaints from Western governments, NGO's and mass media fell on deaf ears in Moscow.<br><br>Forget the popcorn: time to fire up the grill and break out the hot dogs and beer...<br><br><a href=#c30276307590136337 title="comment permalink">5/20/16, 5:56 PM</a><br><br>

The United States? Not so much -- and I stand by my claim that we're very close to domestic insurgency here. <br><br>Matt, good question. All I know is that there are a significant number of reported cases. If I may be a bit gruesome, if you have five or six tolerably strong people pulling on each of the available limbs, it seems quite possible to me that something will give. Still, it's possible that knives or the like played a role. <br><br>Cassandra, the Second Civil War started in 2024, not 2026, and went on until the fall of Washington in 2028. Talks among the various insurgent factions in 2028 and 2029 failed to find common ground, and Partition happened on August 1, 2029 -- that's when the USA was formally dissolved and the Lakeland Republic, Atlantic Republic, et al. came into being. The provisional government of the Lakeland Republic functioned from then until 2032. The referendum about the World Bank/IMF proposals was held in 2031; the Lakeland constitutional convention met in 2030 and 2031, the new constitution was adopted by popular vote in late 2031 and came into force in 2032, when the first elections were held and the first president took office. The LR defaulted on its assigned share of the old US national debt immediately after that -- the provisional government wanted a legally elected government to make that decision. The Treaty of Richmond was signed in 2062, and that's when the borders opened; this story takes place in November 2065. The four attempts by the World Bank and IMF -- one was in 2030, and the other three were in 2062, 2063 and 2065. Does that help? <br><br>Mrbluesky, all the better. ;-) Glad to hear that your local Druids are fulfulling their civic responsibilities -- of course Druidry is much less eccentric in Britain than elsewhere!<br><br>Justin, they're giving it to boys too? Yeesh. <br><br>Susan, I have Aspergers syndrome and agree with you wholeheartedly. It's certainly possible for people with an autism spectrum disorder to learn coping behaviors that will help them get by in a mostly neurotypical society -- I've done it and I know other people on the spectrum who have done so as well. A healthy natural diet is important; so, in my experience, is avoiding television and other media of the same sort -- overstimulation, especially if it's constant and jarring, is a real problem; so is avoiding the kind of medical treatment that consists of drugging the patient into numbness. Thank you for teaching people to move toward less self-defeating modes of dealing with autism!<br><br>Onething, fascinating. Thanks for the heads up; I'll have to look into this. <br><br>Sarah, so do I. I think there's still some hope, if enough people find the willingness to change their own lives and serve as role models -- the more people "collapse now and avoid the rush," the less pressure there'll be on dwindling resources and the more flexibility as large systems break down. But it's very late in the day. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, I gather that things are heating up rapidly over in ecnarF. Thanks for the data points! <br><br>Donald, I do indeed. The Flavr-Savr had another little disadvantage -- it tasted like mildly sour syrofoam. The high-end market wasn't impressed. <br><br>Onething, you're right about science fans, which is frankly weird.

The thing is, the US habit of sponsoring death squads, like most of the gimmicks central to US foreign policy since the Reagan revolution, has been hopelessly counterproductive. Like random drone strikes, it appeals to the faux tough-guy attitudes of a certain class of intellectuals that's rather too well represented in the US national-security community, but it doesn't achieve the goals it's supposed to achieve. This is why the Russians and Chinese, who are pragmatists, don't use it. The Chinese these days don't seem to think much of funding revolutions at all; the Russians like to find a local proxy that can accomplish their goals for them with minimal collateral damage and without alienating any more population blocs than necessary -- watch how the Syrian government, with Russian advice, has been careful to accommodate Kurds, Yezidis, and other ethnic minorities in Syria, with an eye toward building a coalition against the US-, Turkey- and Saudi-funded jihadis. <br><br>If the Russians were to fund a domestic insurgency against the US government, in exactly the same way, their probable strategy would be to direct money, arms, and equipment to those groups most likely to establish a stable regime friendly to Russia as soon as the fighting ended. Death squads wouldn't help that project, quite the contrary, and so you can bet that the Spetsnaz advisers who parachute in to help out the rebels would threaten a cutoff of Russian aid to any group that got into that. It's only the US that seems to think that a permanent state of civil war is a good idea; the Russian approach is to stomp the enemy, end the fighting, sign half a dozen trade agreements and go home. <br><br>With regard to the causes and issues that I expect to be central to the conflicts of the future, my working guess is that gender and religion are going to be supplanted by politics and class. By and large, nobody's going to care if you are Pagan or transgender -- but in much of the country, if you wave around a lot of visible wealth or support a return to the Dubyobama consensus, you'll risk getting stomped, while in wealthy coastal enclaves, if you say anything sympathetic about the wage class or don't show enough sorrowful agreement when people talk about what a wonderful president Hillary Clinton would have been, you'll be out in the cold very, very fast. Where it goes from there will depend on variables that haven't yet been settled, and may not be settled for a decade or more. <br><br>Heather, that sounds very much as though the founders of 4-H knew their way around the old fraternal order system! I'm a little surprised the organization doesn't have an adult equivalent; it might be time to start one...<br><br>Mark, nation-states basically didn't exist until the seventeenth century and I'm far from sure they'll survive the twenty-first. They're the distinctive political form of European civilization, exported like many European ideas to the rest of the world; they have their problems, though just at the moment you're right that they offer certain protections against corporate kleptocracy. (Note to the capitalists among us; Adam Smith, in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, argued that government by an exclusive group of merchants was of all forms of government the very worst; I think he was quite correct.)

That's why, for what it's worth, the law passed by the Lakeland Republic's provisional government banned GMOs until adequate testing could be done, not absolutely; I wanted to suggest that middle ground, and to hint broadly that the World Bank et al. were the ones on the extreme end of things. <br><br>Mr G., thank you! <br><br>James, thank you also -- if I ever feel that I don't get enough mindless hubris in my reading, I'll know right where to go! That's really quite stunning. <br><br>Clay, it still stuns me that Brand went from that sort of common sense to pimping for nuclear power and GMOs. Sigh...<br><br>Hereward, you're assuming that the majority of Lakelanders will decide that they like one tier more than the others. I would argue that this is an unlikely outcome. In today's America, for example, there are many people who prefer low taxes and will do without public amenities to get them, and there are also many people who prefer public amenities and will accept higher taxes to pay for them. That division isn't resolving toward a mean, because it represents serious, enduring value differences. In the same way, some people in the Lakeland Republic like a higher level of technology -- streetcars, electricity, and so on -- and are willing to pay higher taxes to get it, while others will prefer the lower taxes and are fine with a lower level of technology. <br><br>Enduring value differences are actually quite common in complex societies. We see them in everything from the different levels of taxation and public amenity in different US states and counties, to the fact that in most areas you can tune into one radio station to listen to country music, another to listen to rock and roll, a third to listen to classical music, and so on. People have different needs, wants, and tastes, and uniformity rarely exists unless it's imposed by force or fraud. Thus I expect, given the tier system, that different counties will continue to be at different tiers because they'll attract people who value different things. <br><br>Pygmycory, okay, thank you for the explanation. That's rather less scary. <br><br>Onething, jetpacks have used a variety of fuels. It takes a vast amount of fuel to get anything to lift straight up against gravity without the assistance of wings -- that's why the biggest part of the space shuttle on launching was a huge fuel tank, and why the vast majority of any rocket's weight is fuel. Assume you can carry sixty pounds on your back, and let's say half of that is the jetpack; the thirty pounds of fuel you can carry won't get you into the air for more than a short hop. <br><br>Submarine, not quite the opposite. It's certainly the opposite of healthy and sober, but masculine? It's not a feminine society, in any meaningful sense of the word "feminine." What it is, instead, is childish -- even infantile -- without the mature qualities of any gender. As for Robert Kagan cheerleading for Clinton, oh my. I wonder if he realizes just how effectively Sanders and Trump can use that against her. "Here's Mr. Neocon himself, the guy who thinks that sending your kids to die in the Middle East is a great idea, and he likes Hillary. What does that say about the kind of president she would be?"<br><br><a href=#c1879053345454512491 title="comment permalink">5/21/16, 12:00 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not surprised -- the abolition of Pagan agricultural/religious practices and the cutting down of sacred groves, many of which were located where they were to stop soil erosion, drove catastrophic topsoil loss in Greece during the early Byzantine period -- worse than the soil loss after the Mycenaean era, which is saying something; you can still find both in strata on the sea floor all around Greece. I'll chase down Curta's work and integrate it into my models.

Trump isn't surgical. If the brutal treatment he dealt out to his GOP rivals is anything to go on, this election is going to resemble nothing so much a mixed-martial-arts cage match, no holds barred, winner take all; Trump's going to go in there like a gorilla with a bad case of 'roid rage, and Clinton's reputation and political prospects are going to be pounded to a bloody pulp.

I am not arguing for the elimination of political parties, that would leave the nutbags with nowhere to go and nothing to cling to.<br>Our local government in Tasmania is mainly free of party politics, and where it is not I observe that more effort is expended on pursuit of party point scoring than good governance, and the voters know it and respond accordingly, having a pool of worthwhile independents to vote for.<br><br>What I am proposing is an organisation to promote the value of independent representation at state and national levels, and doing so in part by focusing on and publicising the behaviors that make all parties dysfunctional. In time parties might be formed by individuals who understand the value of properly structured representative democracies and thus avoid the toxic behaviors, but currently such organisations are as rare as rocking horse poo, and here in OZ even Blind Freddy is very well aware of that fact.<br><br>By far the largest problem with the party game as currently played is that it has driven almost all of the decent and competent individuals from the political playing field, leaving us with a choice that is largely psychopaths, narcissists and their enablers. Unless and until that sort of personality can be reduced to a harmless minority in government the decline will continue. Good and decent people no longer aspire to party politics, as far as I can see.<br><br>Speaking of the decline, you mentioned in your reply to Violet the propensity for death squads and other gratuitous violence as being a hallmark of American political intervention in other nations affairs. That sort of conduct certainly has precedent, in the reported exhortations of the Levite priests to the Judean tribe in the old testament.

Outside the US the live oral polio vaccine is the preferred type, for many reasons. The main disadvantage is that the viral strains involved can live in the gut for years, so massive vaccination efforts using oral vaccines result in a huge population reservoir. Periodically those attenuated strains revert to near wild type and can cause illness, or someone in a weakened state can develop illness just from exposure to the attenuated strains, which can easily move from fecal matter into less pristine water sources.<br><br>The current oral polio vaccine has two strains, only one of which still causes wild infections. There is now debate about removing the other strain from the vaccine because removal won't do anything about the existing reservoir and any newly vaccinated person will lack resistance if that strain starts to spread. However, the only way to fully eliminate the strain is to remove it from the vaccine so the reservoir eventually peters out. <br><br>Or the dead injection vaccine could be substituted, because there should be no issues with using a new needle on each and every person who needs vaccination in the developing world, right?<br><br><a href=#c1642409903599979740 title="comment permalink">5/21/16, 10:42 AM</a><br><br>

It's by a poet named John Talbot.<br><br>"I have a little apocalyptic fantasy that involves the collection of Loebs in my local library. It’s a complete set, from Homer’s rosy-fingered dawn to the twilight of Ammianus Marcellinus. The very sight of it is reassuringly tidy: all the sprawling energies of a thousand years of Greek and Roman thought and song, distilled and compacted into these snug matching volumes, the Greek bound in olive drab, the Latin in scarlet. Run your fingers over the spines. Here are The Classics.<br><br>Then comes a nuclear holocaust. My local library, like others around the world, is mostly pulverized, but an accident involving molten rubber preserves the case of Loebs intact within a sealed airtight cavity beneath the rubble. Centuries elapse and deposit their layers of sediment. Above ground, the descendants of the survivors plod on, speaking a crude version of English, and when their vestigial civilization is at last stable enough to permit cultivation of the liberal arts, their curiosity turns to the prior civilization, ours, whose evident sophistication is attested only in the occasionally exposed ruin, or in fragments of excavated texts. Of this second category, a half-page of Danielle Steele, the corner of a Dunkin’ Donuts advert, and the odd shred of Paradise Regained are all scrutinized, edited, and interpreted with equal zeal. The fragments are exasperating: they imply a vast literature, and behind it a teeming culture, all tantalizingly out of reach.<br><br>Until one day when excavation unseals that underground cavity, and for the first time in so many centuries, sunlight falls on those green and red spines. The whole Loeb Classical Library, dedicated to preserving whatever could be salvaged from an even earlier lost civilization, has itself survived intact. The excavators fall upon the cache and discover not only the English (which they can mostly make out, though it appears to them as remote as Chaucer to us) but also, to their astonishment, on the facing pages, two strange, even more ancient languages, one with an unfamiliar alphabet. Amid a storm of speculations it is posited that the English is the key to the other two tongues, and in time a latter-day Champollion steps forward and reconstructs the grammar of Latin and Greek. His successors, pioneer scholars of the recovered ancient languages, are at first awestruck—what are these voices speaking out of the dust?—and then electrified, as they begin to read and assimilate Homer and Sophocles and Lucretius and Augustine. These voices must be emulated; the standards are daunting but stimulating; though ancient, they point the way to something new. Academies are organized for teaching the new languages; young souls (they will become poets and historians and scientists) are once again smitten by the songs of Sappho and Catullus, the grave brilliance of Thucydides and Tacitus, the searching effervescence of Plato’s Socrates and Aristotle’s dogged earthbound inquisitiveness. The post-apocalyptic world shrugs off its torpor, hums with ideas and energy and hope.<br><br>I suppose what I mean by all this is that it is good to know that the Loeb Classical Library is there, patiently waiting, in case any civilization (not least our own present one) should require a renaissance."<br><br>(See: http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-bright-ghosts-of-antiquity-7139)<br><br><br><br><a href=#c3309081981084325058 title="comment permalink">5/21/16, 10:46 AM</a><br><br>

If, for instance, one looks at today's America, the vast majority of people live in the cities and the suburbs and there is basically a consensus that this system, for all its faults, works. This also suggests (to me at least) that most people would select a similar set of sevices at a given price. Is this consensus achieved through fraud or coercion? Well, you tell me!<br><br>I appreciate that people have different needs and wants but, to stick to the radio station analogy, no one (yet) is suggesting that we should pay more to listen to classical music than pop, say. <br><br>So, I get what you are saying, but on the one hand I think there are a few basic services few would be willing to do without such things as sewage handling and running water, which will tend to push most people away from the lowest tiers. At the upper end there may be things like public libraries or museums that a lot of people might say they are prepared to do without. This will result in a bunching of most people into just a couple of tiers at best.<br><br>As a current example, take home internet connection speeds. A few of my friends and colleagues insist on having the highest speed on offer. I, on the other hand, have always gone with the minimum (which keeps getting uprated anyway).

The only reason that rural areas have many utilities is because of huge legally required investment, which the rural area cannot support itself. I remember as a child wanting more than 26k internet, but the cable to make that happen would cost $90,000 for our house alone. So it didn't happen.<br><br>Post second world war alot of the utilities that obviously everyone would want, a large number of people simply cannot afford. Centralized electric grids? Economically viable in areas of concentrated population, but in rural areas, who would pay the $90,000 per house? Water utilities follow the same issue.<br><br>To make sense of the tier system you have to keep in mind that the LR can scarcely afford to spread all of the public utilities to its entire population, and trying to charge enough taxes to do so would likely lead to destitution for many, and the uprisings that brings. It can still totally afford to keep those utilities in some areas where they make economic sense. You overestimate how much reality gives a frack about 'personal preference' or 'peer-pressure'.<br><br>Cities have utilities, rural areas less so. This is fact, a reality as old as the first utility. The tier system is a legal abstraction that more or less manages this reality and related interests effecting how to spread the infrastructure. Personally I think that the era based system is a little less realistic, but for the point of the fiction it works well.<br><br><a href=#c727794452488357126 title="comment permalink">5/21/16, 4:21 PM</a><br><br>

This is the kind of pointer I was looking for. Maybe others will have further helpful references, as we seek to clarify the practicalities of the Truth Defence? <br><br>(2) Thanks, commenter "Renaissance Man" ("5/19/16, 8:45 PM"), for analysis of Canada as a nation not evidently born in violence. This is a nice treatment, independent of mine, of the topic I brought up at UTC=20160519T174558Z ("5/19/16, 10:51 AM"). We reach encouragingly similar conclusions. <br> <br>JMG himself comments, in a way relevant to both Renaissance and me, at "5/19/16, 8:07 PM", "Britain's one of the very, very few imperial powers in history to relinquish its colonies without much of a fight." Although JMG's point is true, it must be added that the British Empire is not alone. In the same rather nonviolent club is, surprisingly, the USSR. The Soviet 1956 and 1968 military actions, in Hungary and Czechsolovakia, occurred long before the actual demise of the empire. The demise itself (a process which ran from the dismantling of the Berlin Wall to the final lowering of the Red Bedsheet at the end of 1991) was essentially non-violent. <br><br>I would suggest that if the USSR could surrender an empire in a non-violent way, then so can the USA. A civil war would represent a dramatic, and unnecessary, failure of the American practical intellect. <br><br>(3) The news that Vovan Vovanitch has 20,000 HRC e-mails ("Yellow Submarine", "5/21/16, 5:58 PM"; <a href=http://theantimedia.org/russia-leak-hillary-emails/ rel=nofollow>http://theantimedia.org/russia-leak-hillary-emails/</a>) might be big.

His writing on this recondite topic seems accurate, and therefore inspires confidence in what he might have to say on HRC.<br><br>(4) Since I have just mentioned a Web resource for making sense of the world, I will take this as an opportunity for mentioning another promising resource, namely a huge, and often updated, set of book reviews, at <a href=http://fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/ rel=nofollow>http://fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/</a>.

Thanks for the laugh. One of my favourite, but now sadly disbanded – due to apparently old age - irreverent rock bands TISM (which is an acronym for: This Is Serious Mum) had a song titled: <a href=http://www.metrolyrics.com/whatareya-lyrics-tism.html rel=nofollow>Whatareya? Lyrics </a>. Part of the naughty lyrics included the lines:<br><br><i>So who is your favourite genius<br>James Hird or James Joyce?</i><br><br>James Joyce as you are aware is actually a genius but completely indecipherable! James Hird on the other hand is a long standing football player and more recently coach down here who appears to have become embroiled in some sort of apparently performance enhancing drug scandal - although I haven't followed it in the papers very closely at all. Anyway, I guess the band is saying take your pick! Sorry, I digress, although it is not totally irrelevant... Well, maybe it is a little bit irrelevant. :-)!<br><br>On the food issue, I might add that consuming a lot of produce grown here which has never been sprayed or fed with chemical fertilisers and is grown in manure fed rich and diverse top soil - that the difference in food quality between those foodstuffs and others purchased and consumed from elsewhere is quite apparent to me. It is not all bad and some places are pretty good, but some places are much worse than others. <br><br>Nowadays I can tell when purchased food has been heavily treated with preservatives and flavourings as I get a mild hay fever like reaction, which is often a sign that you have ingested a mild dose of poison or something is seriously irritating your body. That can’t be good, and it wasn’t always that way.<br><br>I reckon one of the things that will become more apparent in the future are: haves and have nots in relation to quality food. It takes a lot of practice over a number of years to avoid that situation, but I reckon that is where we are going anyway.

That's what military strategists call "shaping the battlefield" prior to the actual attack.<br><br>His approach might be unconventional, but Trump's a smart, savvy businessman. He knows exactly what he's doing and how to attack his enemies by relentlessly hitting their weak points. Trump has already brought up Juanita Broderick and other women who claim Slick Willie sexually assaulted them. He has also relentlessly hammered on Hillary for her role in covering up Bill's sex scandals and ruining the lives of the women who were brave enough to come forward. You can bet Trump will feature them at his rallies, run attack ads featuring testimony from women like Broderick, try to get other women that Slick Willie has wronged to come forward and testify, and so on. This is going to be like all out war, but hopefully without the gunfire.<br><br>He is also going after Bill Clinton for his ties to notorious pedophile, convicted sex predator and Wall Street mogul Jeffery Epstein and has pointed out Slick Willie's many junkets aboard Epstein's private jet, which has been dubbed the "Rape Jet".

Realizing the answer probably cannot be framed in a simple 'yes' or 'no', if it tends to be more on the side of 'yes' does that mean a fallback to the Westphalian system that served the world for 300 years will require some "ritualistic" reaffirmation.

Beats me how you can come up with quality essays week after week without fizzling out like some. Reading your essays has help me put into context a lot of the noise that you hear in the media and that I see around me. Salutations!<br> In following your account of the revolt against the use of DM-386 corn, I contrast that with how such things are done now. What usually happens is that some major corporations kills a lot of people out greed or neglect whereupon it takes about a decade of hauling them through courts until they decide to make the problem go away by throwing a big pile of cash at the survivors and their relatives (while demanding a no-blame clause in the settlement).<br> How it goes in practice is like this: "I know we killed your daughter and left your other kids with lifelong crippling problems but hey, here is a cheque so we're cool now, right?" You see this mentality in effect in the film "Erin Brockovich" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghl-E0O82ac) but the real answer is no, it is not cool, as after all - what do you call it when you kill people?<br> I think that sooner or later, someone who has lost family will not stay silent, will not "go postal" and slaughter a bunch of innocents but will research exactly who in that particular corporation was responsible for the grief caused and then the next thing you will hear will be the news of the bloody slaughter of a board of directors or a sniper taking out a CEO or two. That will be when you know that the rules have finally changed.<br> Reading your account of the future, I know that you are only giving us a sliver of the problems that we will be facing down the track but which we, as a race, are still determined to ignore.

I went off of wheat for a month to see if it would help my COPD. It had no difference on that condition, but I found I had lost the ability to forecast the weather by how my joints felt (totally unexpected, so not likely even the Placebo effect). My wife found that it was the last piece in getting rid of her Migraine headaches. Later on, we tried some bread made from 100% organic wheat, and I had no effects. In talking with some industrial farmers (I live in the prairies) I found that there had been a change in how the large scale farms operated (10,000+ acres), as prior to this century, the standard was to grow the grain, swath when ripe, allow the swath to dry (hopefully the weather cooperated), then combine. The big change was that instead of swathing they found that they could spray roundup, the grain would dry standing, then would be straight combined. Legally the roundup could be sprayed up to the day of harvest, but usually there was a week or two. If there was no rain in this period, the full dose of roundup is still on the grain when harvested. So, in reflection, I am sensitive to roundup, or whatever chemical is now contaminating regular grain, and request gluten free food when out to avoid the effects. Unfortunately, my wife is gluten sensitive, so it is not practical to have wheat at home.<br><br><a href=#c398918673678898075 title="comment permalink">5/22/16, 8:35 PM</a><br><br>

Makes sense to me. <br><br>Hereward, and yet right here in the United States, people in adjoining states not only have, but defend, drastic differences in how much tax they pay and what kind of government services they get. I live in Maryland, a mile away from the West Virginia border, and the differences are about on a par between Tier 5 and Tier 3. Thus I have a very hard time believing in your argument. Now of course it's also relevant that at the time of the story, the tier system has been in place for rather less than thirty years; it's quite possible that things will settle out into fewer divisions over time, but they may also settle out into a far more diverse patchwork of county-by-county differences. <br><br>Ed-M, as I see it, Trump's less likely to get us into a war than Clinton, whose behavior as Secretary of State suggests that she has a mania for regime change, and whose lack of tolerance for disagreement and criticism would make her an extremely dangerous commander in chief. <br><br>RepubAnon, I'll want to see how that actually works in practice.

It seemed like an obvious remark in a future when the Chinese economy has the same kind of hegemonic role the US economy has today. <br><br>Submarine, and that was what I expected Putin's people to do in Syria: a massive combined-arms op aimed at the annihilation of Daesh over maybe a month at most. One of the most intriguing things about what actually happened is the precision and economy of it: not something the Russians have been particularly good at in the past. Clearly somebody, or more likely quite a few somebodies, in the Arbat district have been studying history very closely and learning something from it. <br><br>Hubertus, expect more of this. Now that the crisis is impending, it's time to talk about what might be built on the far side of it. <br><br>FiftyNiner, as I see it, the so-called "New World Order" was a temporary phenomenon at most, a brief and ultimately fragile alliance between factions in the US government and an assemblage of global corporate interests that tried, with some success, to impose a corporate-friendly supranational regime on the world. It was inevitable that some of the countries that were assigned the status of third-class world citizens would eventually turn to renewed nationalism, trade and finance barriers, and straightforward military action to defend themselves; it took some of the most stupid political bungling on record, though, to guarantee that Russia, China, and Iran would all fall into that category, and despite their huge mutual differences, be forced to conclude that an alliance was in their best interests. <br><br>Over the decades immediately ahead, I see the entire global economic order going to pieces, the EU imploding, the United Nations reduced to a stage for empty rhetoric and probably relocated to another continent, and nation-states reconsolidating in those areas that can avoid a descent into failed state conditions. It could get very messy indeed. <br><br>Good luck with the diabetes, btw -- I know people who manage it very well by strict dietary controls, for whatever that's worth. <br><br>Kevin, exactly. The difference with my fictional DM-386 corn is that the scale of the disaster was so great, the degree of denial and dishonesty was so large, and the other pressures pushing the US toward civil war had reached such a peak, that an explosion of collective violence was the likely outcome. I think it's quite possible that something of the sort will happen, though it's not necessary. <br><br>Ray, thanks for this. False equivalence is of course a subset of the pervasive problem with Silver's kind of journalism, which is that accurate data does not make up for biased presuppositions, and every pundit in the salary class (including Silver) was basically talking their book: insisting that Trump couldn't win because it would be so disadvantageous to their class if he did. <br><br>Dennis, that's fascinating -- and ghastly.

( but advantageous to the elites who run the show ) My expectation is that the armies and civil services will disband for lack of pay as the financial system unravels and be replaced by local systems of governance supported by local militias with larger units assembled thru a feudal and/or mandala type organization.

Walking an extra ten miles to remain on the square side of section lines makes no sense on foot and results in shortcuts through fields. The occupation of natural land forms changes with less technology and a new political culture.<br><br>Some states have many tiny counties, but Alaska has a few (19) giant sized Boroughs. In the LR the old county allegiances may be stronger than the convenience of geography. People may resist change and be aligned with a far-a-way county seat due to history. Tiers work for those services for which higher taxation may be a burden to the some folks. For other more state-wide or national services such as social services (Police, child protection, Justice, Health) it may be best equalized on a national level. This is is because these services must cover the entire LR in equal measure with fewer local options.<br><br>The old state-lines may need adjusting to reflect geography and not the straight lines of early 1800's, that carved up the virgin landscape.

The analogy of treating a disease of insulin resistance by adding more insulin as likened to treating alcoholism by having the patient drink even more is spot on! I had come to this conclusion myself several years ago while dealing with my mother's diabetes. She was diagnosed with type II diabetes at age 49 and lived until age 87 with the disease. We went through several doctors during that 38 year period. Most of that time mother was able to stay off insulin because we managed her diet well. The doctor did not even list diabetes as the underlying cause of death on her death certificate.<br>Some doctors feel that blood sugar can be brought under control by 'intermittent fasting' -- consuming all your food within any given 8 hours out of 24, which allows the liver and digestive system to completely clear itself. If that strategy doesn't work there are other methods that can be tried. This is what I am attempting now. I was tested for gluten sensitivity by a naturopath and found to be highly sensitive. Wheat is a major culprit in blood sugar control and the good ole American gov is still telling diabetics to eat that whole wheat everyday!

The Old Northwest, as the Great Lakes states were called, were surveyed into townships--basically, every county is made up of X number of townships. The township level of government/organization still exists in some states like Ohio, while it's been eliminated in others. The geographic type of surveying you suggest is an older form called "metes and bounds" and was used in the original 13 colonies, plus the first states of Vermont, Kentucky, &amp; Tennessee. It's basically called out "from this tree 10 miles along Cooper Creek, from the bend in Cooper Creek straight to Smith's Hill, from Smith's Hill diagonal to Lewis Falls, etc.", and is responsible for the "crazy quilt pattern" of county lines in the oldest states.<br>Beating a dead horse, but KY is definitely in the Confederacy. I'm very close to Southern Indiana this summer, and I lived in Ohio and am familiar with Illinois as well. When defending a border, it helps to have sympathetic kind/"your folk" on the other side, and Southeastern Ohio, Southern Ind., and Southern Ill. is Southern/pro-Confederate through and through. U of K fans are all over Southern Ind., and both Southern Ind./Ill. had Confederate sympathizers and even provided regiments to the Confederacy. One of Lincoln's biggest headaches in politics was the pro-Confederate opposition of Southern Ill., and was a major reason the capital was moved from Marion to Springfield. Things haven't changed much at all since the Civil War, and Southeastern OH, Southern Ind./Ill is still Southern through and through, and provides a sympathetic population for the Confederacy to defend the Ohio River border.<br><br><a href=#c6820722823045267385 title="comment permalink">5/24/16, 3:45 AM</a><br><br>

I have definitely seen that in the city of my birth and youth, Atlanta. But Atlantans have been that way since the 70s, wanting to distance themselves from the region as a means of promoting economic growth and selling themselves as an "International City.". Atlantans even explicitly state that they are not in Georgia, in which case I wonder exactly what Atlanta is the Capital of...? Arrogance? Elitism? Self-delusion?<br><br>HOWEVER, in Tennessee, we have home-grown and adopted southern hipsters. Nashville is becoming Portlandia on the Cumberland, hipster with a twang. A visiting friend from Oregon spontaneously commented when we were driving through downtown Nashville that "This looks just like Portland." The southern hipster breed here never claim to not be in the South, how could you possibly do that? Our local NPR announcers have southern accents (and during pledge drives even occasionally lapse into Tennessee verbs...). The transplanted hipsters may start out being ironic rednecks and hillbillies, but then they discover that southern food, culture, and traditions (all those other ones that don't have to do with slavery, racism, segregation, etc.) actually have some really great stuff in them, and the assimilation begins. <br><br>Still, one line they don't ever cross is the Stars and Bars.
