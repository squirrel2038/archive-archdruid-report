For the connoisseur of sociopolitical absurdity, the last few weeks’ worth of news cycles very nearly defines the phrase “target-rich environment.” I note, for example, that arch-neoconservative Robert Kagan—the founder of the Project for a New American Century and principal architect of this nation’s idiotically bloodthirsty Middle East policies, a man who never met a body bag he didn’t like—has jumped party lines to endorse Hillary Clinton’s presidential ambitions.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'></span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Under other conditions I’d wonder if Kagan had decided to sandbag Clinton’s hopes, using a lethal dose of deadpan satire to point out that her policy stances are indistinguishable from those of George W. Bush: you know, the guy that so many Democrats denounced as evil incarnate just eight short years ago. Unfortunately, nothing so clever seems to be in the works. Kagan seems to be quite sincere in his adulation for Clinton. What’s more, his wife Victoria Nuland, a Hillary Clinton protegé in the State Department and a major player in the Obama administration’s pursuit of Cold War brinksmanship against Russia, is now being rumored as <a href=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/clintons-hawk-in-waiting/ >Clinton’s most likely pick</a> for Secretary of State<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For unintended satire, that one’s hard to beat Still, I’d say it has been outdone by another recent story, which noted that the students at Brown University, one of this nation’s Ivy League universities, are upset. Turns out they’re so busy protesting for social justice these days that they don’t have enough time to keep up with their classwork, and yet heir professors are still expecting papers to be turned in on time—a demand that strikes the students as grossly unfair. A savage parody off some right-wing website? Nope; the story appeared in <a href=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/02/18/schoolwork-advocacy-place-strain-on-student-activists/ >the Brown University student paper</a> earlier this month. </div>
<br>
To be fair to the students, they’re not the only ones who have redefined the purpose of a university education in a way that, for the sake of politeness, we’ll call “quirky.” Radical faculty members, who encourage this reenactment of their vanished youth as a political equivalent of Münchausen syndrome by proxy, are doing much the same thing. Then, of course, you’ve got corporations who think that universities are places where prospective employees go to pay for their own job training, university bureaucrats who bubble marketing-firm sewage about offering students the “university experience,” and so on through an entire galaxy of self-regarding and self-important cant. The one thing that finds no place among all these competing redefinitions is, predictably enough, learning. <br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve mentioned before on this blog the need to devise new opportunities for learning, and in particular a new structure for adult education that isn’t subservient to the increasingly blatant political and financial interests of the academic industry. More broadly, the concept of learning has been a core theme of this blog since it began—partly because modern industrial society’s stunning inability to learn the lessons of repeated failure looms so large in public life today, partly because learning ways to make sense of the world and practical skills for dealing with the converging crises of our time ranks high on the to-do list for anyone who takes the future seriously. I think, therefore, that it’s time to move that discussion to center stage, and talk about learning and education in the context of the Long Descent<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We could start that discussion in many different places, but the whinefest under way at Brown just now makes as good a springboard as any. We can, I think, presume that universities don’t exist for the sake of giving privileged youth a place to play at changing the world, before they settle down to a lifetime of propping up the status quo in corporate and government careers. Nor do they exist for any of the other dubious purposes mentioned above. What, then, is a university for?<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s best approached by looking at the other two legs of the institutional tripod that once supported American education. In the long-gone days when the United States still had an educational system that worked, that system sorted itself out into three broad categories of schools: public schools, trade schools, and universities. Public schools existed for the purpose of providing the basic intellectual skills that would allow young people to participate in society as productive citizens. Trade schools existed for the purpose of teaching the technical skills that would allow graduates to find steady work in the skilled trades. In the trade school category, we can also include medical schools and the few law schools that existed then—most lawyers got their legal training through apprenticeship until well into the twentieth century—and other institutions meant to turn out trained professionals, such as divinity schools.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'>
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then there were the universities. The grand old American habit of highfalutin’ obfuscation that used to double the length of commencement addresses and Congressional speeches alike makes it a bit difficult to tease out, from the rhetoric of the day, the intended purpose of a university education, but attending to what was actually taught there in the late nineteenth and very early twentieth centuries makes the point tolerably clear: universities existed to launch students into a full-on, face-first encounter with that foreign country we call the past. That’s why the university curriculum back then focused on such subjects as history, classics, literature, and the like—and why the word “literature” in an academic setting generally excluded anything written within living memory.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This was of course exactly the thing the educational revolutions of our time targeted and, for the most part, destroyed. Under the banner of “relevance,” reformers across the American academic scene in the 1960s and 1970s pushed for the replacement of the traditional curriculum with something more up-to-date, modern, progressive—in a word, fashionable. Alongside the great crusade for relevance came the proliferation of new departments and degree programs. Thereafter, what was left of the old curriculum was assailed by proponents of various flavors of postmodernism, and after that came what’s known in the academic biz as “critical theory”—that is, ideologies of condemnation and exclusion that focus on race, gender, and other markers of privilege and disprivilege in society<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All of these changes, among their other impacts, had the effect of distancing students from the collision with the past that was central to the older approach to university education. The crusade for relevance and the mass production of new departments and degree programs did this in a straightforward fashion, by redirecting attention from the past to the present—it’s not accidental that the great majority of the new departments and degree programs focused on one or another aspect of modernity, or that by “relevant” the educational radicals of the Sixties generally meant “written within our lifetimes.” The other two movements just named did the same thing, though, albeit in a somewhat subtler way.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The common theme shared by the various movements lumped together as “postmodernism” was the imposition of a thick layer of interpretive theory between the student and the text. The postmodernists liked to claim that their apparatus of theory enabled them to leap nimbly into and out of texts from every place and time while understanding them all, but that was precisely what the theory didn’t do. Instead, if you’ll excuse the metaphor, it functioned as a sort of intellectual condom, meant to prevent students from conceiving any unexpected ideas as a result of their intercourse with the past. Those of my readers who encountered the sort of scholarly publication that resulted will recall any number of “conversations with the text” written along these lines, which sedulously kept the text from getting a word in edgewise, while quoting Derrida et al. at dreary length in every second or third paragraph<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If postmodernism claimed to engage in a conversation with the text, though, critical theory—still the rage in many American universities these days—subjects it to a fair equivalent of the Spanish Inquisition: one by one, texts are hauled before a tribunal, tortured with an assortment of critical instruments until they confess, suffer condemnation for their purported errors, and are then dragged off by a yelling mob to be burnt at the stake. The erasure of the past here has two aspects. On the one hand, critical-theory proponents are fond of insisting that students should never be required to read any text that has been so condemned; on the other, one very effective way of learning nothing from the past is to be too busy preening oneself over one’s moral superiority to one’s ancestors to learn from anything they might have had to say<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Popular though these moves were in the academic industry, I’d like to suggest that they were disastrously misguided at best, and have played a large role in helping to generate a widespread, and seriously destructive condition in our collective life. I’ll give a suggestive name to that condition a little later on. First, I want to talk about why the suppression of the past is as problematic as it is<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe liked to point out that a person who knows only one language doesn’t actually know any languages at all. He was quite right, too. Only when you learn a second language do you begin to discover how many things you thought were true about the universe are merely artifacts of the grammatical and semantic structure of your first language. Where that language is vague, so are your thoughts; where that language runs several distinct meanings together in a single word, so do you; where that language imposes arbitrary structures on the complexities of experience—why, unless you have some experience with another way of assembling the world into linguistic patterns, it’s a safe bet that you’ll do the same thing even when you’re not talking or even thinking in words<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'>. </span></div>
<br>
Here’s an example. People who only speak English tend to think in terms of linear cause-and-effect relationships. Listen to Americans try to understand anything, and you’ll see that habit in full flower. If something happens, they want to know what one thing caused it, and what one thing will result from it. In the real world, it almost never happens that just one cause sets just one process in motion and has just one effect; in the real world, wildly complex, tangled chains of interaction go into even the simplest event, and spin out from there to infinity—but that’s not the way Americans like to think<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'>. </span><br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Why? Because the normal sentence structure in English has a subject—someone who causes an action—followed by a verb—the action of the subject—and then usually by an object—the thing on which the action has an effect. That’s our usual grammar, and so that’s the usual pattern of our thoughts.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are, as it happens, plenty of languages that don’t have the same structure. In modern Welsh, for example, most sentences begin with a form of the verb “to be.” Where an English speaker would say “The children are playing in the yard,” a Welsh speaker would say “Mae’r plant yn chwarae yn yr ardd,” literally “It is the children at play in the yard.” Most English sentences imply a cause-and-effect relationship (the cause “children” have the effect “playing”), that is, while most Welsh sentences imply a complex condition of being (the current state of things includes the phenomena “children” in the condition of “playing”). If you know both languages well enough to think in both, you won’t default to either option—and you won’t necessarily be stuck with just those two options, either, because once you get used to switching from one to another, you can easily conceive of other alternatives<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s true of language, I’d like to suggest, is also true—and may in fact be even more true—of the ideas and preconceptions of an era: if you only know one, you don’t actually know one at all. Just as the person who knows only one language remains trapped in the grammatical and semantic habits of that language, the person who has only encountered the thought of one era remains trapped in the presuppositions, habitual notions, and unexamined assumptions of that era.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve used the word “trapped,” but that choice of phrasing misstates one very important aspect of the phenomenon: the condition that results is very comfortable. Most of the big questions have easy answers, and those that are still open—well, everyone’s secure in the knowledge that once those are solved, by some linear extrapolation of the current methods of inquiry, the answers will by definition fit easily into the framework that’s already been established for them. Debates about what’s right and wrong, what’s true and false, what’s sane and stark staring crazy all take place within the limits of a universally accepted structure of ideas that are all the more powerful because nobody discusses them and most people don’t even consciously notice that they’re there.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The supposed openness to innovation and diversity that’s said to characterize modern industrial society does precisely nothing to counteract that effect. The vagaries of intellectual and cultural trends, and the antics of dissident subcultures in art, religion, and politics, all take place within the narrow limits of a conventional wisdom which, again, is not so much believed as tacitly assumed. Watch any avant-garde movement closely, and it’s not hard to notice that its idea of rebelling against the status quo amounts to taking the conventional wisdom just a little further than anyone else has gotten around to going recently—and when that loses its charm, you can bet that in a generation or so, some new movement will come along and do it all over again, and convince themselves that they’re being revolutionary in doing something their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents did in their day.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus, for example, public masturbation as a form of performance art has been invented at intervals of thirty to forty years since the late nineteenth century. It’s happened so far, that I know of, in the 1890s, the 1920s, the 1950s, and the 1980s, and we can probably expect a new round any time now. Each of the self-proclaimed cutting-edge artistic movements that went in for this not especially interesting habit framed it as a revolutionary act, using whatever kind of grandiose rhetoric was popular just then; and then the crowds got bored, and three decades later the next generation was at it again.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The history of the flying car, which has been invented at regular intervals since the 1920s, follows exactly the same rhythm, and displays exactly the same total subservience to the conventional wisdom of modern industrial culture. (A case could probably be made that there’s no shortage of masturbatory features in our collective obsession with flying cars, but that’s a discussion for another time.) For the purposes of our present discussion, the flying car is a particularly useful example, because it points to the chief problem with unthinking subservience to the predigested thought of an era: people in that condition lose the ability to learn from their mistakes.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'>
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are a galaxy of good reasons why we don’t have flying cars, after all. One of the most important is that the engineering demands of aircraft design and automobile design are almost exactly opposed to one another—the lighter an airplane is, the better it flies, while a car needs a fair amount of weight to have good traction; aircraft engines need to be optimized for speed, while car engines need to be optimized for torque, and so on through a whole series of contrasts. A flying car is thus by definition going to be mediocre both as a car and as a plane, and due to the added complexities needed to switch from one mode of travel to the other, it’s going to cost so much that for the same price you can get a good car and a good plane, with enough left over to pay hangar rental for quite some time.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
None of this is particularly hard to figure out. What’s more, it’s been demonstrated over and over again by the flying cars that have been invented, patented, and tested repeatedly down through the years. That being the case, why do audiences at TED Talks still clap frantically when someone tells them that they can expect flying cars on the market any day now? Because the presuppositions of modern industrial society deny the existence of limits and inescapable tradeoffs, and when the lessons of failure point up the reality of these things, those lessons remain unlearnt.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I wish that all the consequences of subservience to unnoticed presuppositions were that harmless. Take any of the rising spiral of crises that are building up around modern industrial society these days; in every single case, the reason that the obviously necessary steps aren’t being done is that the conventional wisdom of our time forbids thinking about those steps, and the reason that the lessons of repeated failure aren’t being learned is that the conventional wisdom of our time denies that any such failures can happen. We live in an era of cultural senility, in which the vast majority of people stare blankly at an unwelcome future and keep on doing all the things that are bringing that future on.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The erasure of the past from the curriculum of American universities is far from the only factor that’s brought about that catastrophic reality, but I suspect its role in that process has been significant. The era of cultural senility came in when the generation of the Sixties, the generation that insisted on excising the past from its university education, hit its thirties and rose into positions of influence, and it’s gotten steadily worse since that time. The inability of our society to learn from its mistakes or question its preconceptions has thus become a massive political fact—and a massive political liability.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
None of the consequences of that inability are particularly original. It so happens, for example, that a little less than 2500 years ago, influential voices in another rich and powerful democratic society embraced the same policies that Robert Kagan and his fellow neoconservatives have been promoting in our time. The backers of this Project for a New Athenian Century believed that these policies would confirm Athens’ hegemony over the ancient Greek world; what happened instead was a nightmare of imperial overstretch, war, and economic and political collapse, from which Athens, and Greece as a whole, never recovered. You can read all about it in the writings of Thucydides, one of the supposedly irrelevant authors that most educated people read before the 1960s and next to nobody reads today.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s an obvious benefit of reading Thucycides. Less obvious and even more important is the subtler insight that you can get from Thucydides, or for that matter from any long-dead author. Thucydides was not a modern politically correct American liberal, or for that matter a modern patriotically correct American neoconservative. His basic assumptions about the world differ drastically from those of any modern reader, and those assumptions will jar, over and over again, against the very different notions that form the automatic substructure of thought in the modern mind.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If Thucydides doesn’t offend you, in fact, you’re probably not paying attention—but that’s precisely the point. If you exercise the very modest amount of intellectual courage that’s needed to get past being offended, and try to understand why the world looked the way it did when seen through Thucydides’ view of the world and yours, your knowledge of your preconceptions and your ability to make sense of the world when it doesn’t happen to fit those preconceptions will both expand. Both those gains are well worth having as our society hurtles down its current trajectory toward an unwelcome future.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>

Homework Assignment #1<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Since this series of posts is on education, yes, there’s going to be homework. Your assignment for the next two weeks consists of choosing a book-length work of fiction that (a) you haven’t previously read, and (b) was written before 1900, and reading it. It can be anything that fits these capacious limits: <i>Little Women</i>, <i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i>, <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, <i>The Tale of Genji</i>, or something else entirely—take your pick. Whatever book you choose, read it cover to cover, and pay attention to the places where the author’s assumptions about the world differ from yours. Don’t pass judgment on the differences; just notice them, and think about what it would have been like to see the world the way the author did.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>

It makes for great storytelling to compare ancient Athens to modern America, but the tapestry of history is rich and varied enough that it's always possible to cherry-pick examples to support just about any hypothesis. That's not to say there's nothing we can learn from history, but we have to do it carefully, using as broad a selection of evidence as possible. <br><br>Also, are you suggesting that all assumptions about reality are somehow equivalent? If my culture believes infinite growth on a finite planet is possible, does that make it so? Because that's postmodernism 101 (except they use the term "metanarrative"). I tend to believe that there is an objective reality independent of our perception, and humans are capable of understanding at least an approximation of it.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c3559872201912282899 title="comment permalink">5/25/16, 5:40 PM</a><br><br>

Even if you’re not religious, it’s a worthwhile read given its influence and insight into a particular worldview.<br>-<i>On Duties</i> by Cicero.<br>-<i>Cato, a Tragedy</i> by Addison. Hugely influential in eighteenth century America and England. Historians suggest that many phrases we associate with the Revolution, e.g., “Give me liberty or give me death!”, were inspired by the play.

My son is a recent graduate of Brown so I know a bit of its history and inner workings. The first important thing to know is that in the late 1990s Brown made what is now turning out to be a bit of a Faustian Bargain. The entire university community decided to face up to the fact that the money which established the university in the 1700s came entirely from the Triangle Trade, as Providence RI was one leg of the three legs which supported Slavery in the western hemisphere. They hired as Browns President the first African American Women to ever hold such a position in the ivy league. She led the university on a mission that was part historical racial introspection and part political correctness. It was successful in part as it led to one of the most racially harmonious and racially diverse institutions in higher education. But it lead to overly sensitive political culture where any "wrong" is deemed to be equivalent to any other.<br> The other thing to note is the set of forces creating the modern ivy league student. Far from the stereo type as kids of the old money elite ( strangely, the prep school wasps can only get in by being good at sports) they are over-programmed children who have spent 18 years with extreme pressure to excel at everything. My sons two best friends were from the ghettos of Chicago and Miami and were the first in their families to go to college, and felt the weight of their extended families to succeed. These are kids who have never gotten anything but an A, and now they find themselves graded on a curve against an entire class of other kids who have also never gotten a less than perfect grade. These are not big 10 college football players taking a schedule of rocks-for-jocks , etc. They face an academic challenge that requires 6-8 hours a day of reading and homework and many of them are burned out from the stress. <br><br>You are right to point this out as an absurd example of how convoluted education has come. But it is the result of many forces including coming to terms with American History, the stratified economic system where only the top few percent do not face diminished chances of achieving the "American Dream" and our demented system of meritocracy which is mostly an excuse to perpetuate the class war you have described in your earlier posts.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c6430231332933133067 title="comment permalink">5/25/16, 6:04 PM</a><br><br>

However, the version of Melville's tome was an abridged version, skipping nimbly over the details - some of it gross - of whaling and life on a whaling ship. Biut at home I had my fathers full edition with glorious illustrations by Rockwell Kent. I noticed that most of my classmates just could NOT wrap their brains around the fact that colonial America, either on the seas or in the Massechusets colonies was a <i>very different place</i> than Brooklyn of the 70s, and had very different cultural assumptions, yet only one or two centuries removed. They did not understand the characters conflicts, motivations, or the expectations of the cultures they were set. <br><br>Since then, the NYS system has sawn off one of the legs of the educational tripod. The NYS Board of Regents has done away with Vocational and Techinical HS Diplomas. The curriculum is now 100% College Prep. Nearly every trade school that is not an accredited university has closed its doors. This appears to come from two directions, a liberal elite disdain for "The Trades", and a hostility to the Unions that are formed of tradesmen. Eliminate Trade education and deny the unions new members, starving them. <br><br>Of course this is monumentally stupid, as a technological society needs it carpenters, plumbers, electricians, masons, construction workers, mechanics, and technicians of all kinds. But apparently when your toilet is overflowing you'll pack it up and ship it to China. The pathetic for-profit Trade Schools that have popped up like so many toxic mushrooms are barely beyond scams and are only marginally less effective at shoving young people into crushing debt for little hope of employment, But NYS has plenty of Lawyers and Financial Managers and other professional parasites.<br><br>Now it is, except within certain radical and cranky, mostly Pagan, circles, a struggle to find ANY historical awareness among the general citizenry, beyond the rah-rah propaganda about American Greatness spewed forth by the political class and happily regurgitated by the corporate media. They appear to live in a forever "now" that they assume goes back to the dawn of time which has NOTHING to do with "Zen mind." But I'm in my late 50s, and I <i>have</i> noticed a lot of change over the decades. The trends are, yes, alarming. <br><br>I am rather glad that even as an art major, a lot of my teachers were old guys (and ladies) who made me look up and read some long dead people.

The public schools and universities have become worse than useless in that regard. <br><br>I really feel sorry for the young people coming of age these days. The so-called educations they are receiving are not only mostly useless but will leave them woefully unprepared for the world that is coming.

But this is all it really does. It seems like too many students (and professors) think that critical theory (and a fairly dumbed down version at that) is the only tool they need.<br><br>It's like grabbing the hammer out of a tool box and throwing the rest of the tools away. You really do need the rest of those tools if you plan on doing anything worthwhile.<br><br>I taught symbolic logic at Tulane University in the late 1990s and early 2000s. i opened my first class of the semester with the same bit: logic is a tool. It is really good at determining if an argument is valid (where validity means that if the premises are all true, then the conclusion will be true - at least for classical logic.*) Logic cannot do jack to help determine if your premises are true. It won't help you evaluate the aesthetic value of prose, and it can't help you read poetry at all. Ambiguity in language does not even show up on the radar of logic. So, I warned my students, don't think you can use this tool for jobs beyond that which it is intended.<br><br>Professors are failing to give this same advice to their students today regarding critical theory. (And I can go the rest of my life without hearing "check your privilege" ever again. While it may have once been a call to introspection, it's become just another high falutin' way to tell someone to sit down and shut up.)<br><br>As for apprenticeships, I fully support this idea. After I left academia, I went to three years of law school. I learned most of what I know at internships at various legal aid organizations. They expect you to do real work and the consequences of fouling it up are readily apparent.<br><br>On a lighter note, I got an email saying that my copy of "Weird of Hali" shipped today.

It was my junior year of high school. I was living in Odessa, Texas as the time and able to join the "honors classes" for the majority of my student life and thus was honored with the option to study concurrently with a local community college. One such class was a history class which focused on Post-Civil War US History to the present (which was 1997 at the time). Most of the class focused on the Civil Rights era so that when time came around for finals, we were presented with three moments from the Civil Rights era and asked to argue why one of those were the most important Post-Civil War moments in American History. Perhaps the Civil Rights era was the most important Post Civil War part of American history, but I didn't like the fact that I was not given the option to choose for myself and thus for my final essay, I used examples from the Civil Rights era to argue why having the ability to decide for ourselves was more important than our teacher telling us that Civil Rights was the most important post Civil War event in US history. My insubordinate thinking resulted in a failing grade for the essay and for the entire class. Fortunately, I knew this would happen and was ready to take the fall-out, but I was glad to have advised against doing this for the other students who thought my idea was what the teacher really wanted to hear.<br><br>I had long been reaching the conclusion that my education was mostly propaganda for not having real thoughts, but that moment clinched it.

Last summer I re-read Herodotus' Histories for the first time in twenty years; in company with Gene Wolfe's concurrent tale of ancient Greece, Soldier of the Mist. Herodotus was very entertaining, and served well to read aloud on an extended car trip that week. Such a stew of comedy, revenge, war, traveler's tales, hearsay, generational family drama... with a very engaging voice that spoke well across twenty-five hundred years. I was flabbergasted to read his description of the mail delivery innovations in the Persian empire - a Pony Express type of relay system.

Modern skeptics should note that Latro reports Greece as it was reported by the Greeks themselves.

Not so much the whole 500 year history, as, specific times within their timeline. But I know how it all hangs together. (Most recently read and highly recommended? Prof. Mary Beard's new "SPQR.") What's constantly on my mind, or, what I notice, is how similar they were to us, and yet, how different. And, I try and grasp the whys, of that. Of course, I wonder the same things about the Victorian's when I read Ruth Goodman's books. :-).<br><br>Languages? Two years of Latin and two of French. Not that I can remember much. But I can still tease out (once in awhile) the general meaning of an inscription. And, it sure jazzed up my vocabulary, and the meaning of some English words. And, it was a revelation, to this 14 year old, that different languages are constructed differently. Who knew? <br><br>I'm excited about the homework assignment. But, please, no "Scarlet Letter!" Spent a whole half year on that as a Junior in high school. Matched only by the ENTIRE SCHOOL YEAR spent on Dicken's "Great Expectations." Wonder if I can round up a copy of "Agricola" by Tacitus (his son-in-law). Always meant to get around to that. <br><br>One of the silliest bits of academic political correctness that I've seen, is changing the B.C / A.D, (Before Christ / After Death) to B.C.E / C.E (Before Common Era / Common Era.)

Why is "splendor" in the accusative? There is no explicit verb in your motto which takes this noun as its object.<br><br>If you meant to write the Latin for "Splendour (brilliance, radiance) of a green light", that would be not "Splendorem lucis viridis" but "Splendor lucis viridis", with "splendor" now in the nominative case. <br><br>Still, this is stylistically awkward, since the motto is a mere noun phrase, with no verb, and does not succeed in expressing a complete thought. <br><br>An example of a complete thought would be "Diligimus splendorem lucis viridis" - "We like, we're rather keen on, we're fond of, the splendour (brilliance, radiance) of a green light." But this thought is trite and weak. We do not want a motto to descend to the level of autobiography. <br><br>One could put into Latin, as an expression of a complete thought which is not too trite, "Let the splendour (brilliance, radiance) of a green light shine forth". That would then be "Luceat splendor lucis viridis." Or, alternatively, one could have "Lucebit splendor luceat viridis" as the expression not of a wish but of a prophecy: "The splendour (brilliance, radiance) of a green light will shine forth (is going to be shining forth, is destined to shine forth)." <br><br>We went through this kind of awkwardness with another user of Latin, a lady whose name I do not now recall, a few months ago. She confessed to not having herself studied the language, and to having relied on something like Google Translate for her incorrect local Wizards' motto. In the end, her case got straightened out nicely, with her revised motto looking just fine. We cannot at this point expect people on this blog to have studied Latin, or even to have mastered any very solid set of modern languages. So we try to help each other out, in as cheerful and gentle a spirit as possible. <br><br><br><br>Hastily,<br>hoping nobody gets too upset by this insistence<br>on accurate Latinity, <br><br><br>Tom <br><br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a> <br><br><br>PS: Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful story from Prof. Gavin Betts at Monash University (Google him for useful textbook, and for short Wikipedia writeup).

(In the Linux world, one uses some text editor, for instance <b>/usr/bin/vim</b>, as opposed to a word processor, like OpenOffice. Word processors are, generally speaking, overkill.) One can then copy the entire essay to the local computer clipboard, and finally one can do a paste of this clipboard text into the blogger input window. <br><br>There is a useful American phrase for topics like Blogger - "PuhLEEEZE, don't get me STAR-did." (I pick this up from a wonderful American cartoon called Doonesbury, or something similar. The hero has paid some money to watch a friend's wedding in live Internet streaming. The pastor says, "And if any know just cause why this man and this woman may not be united in bonds of holy matrimony, let him speak now ..."

Allen</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Oh gosh, a post with education and politics and literature and flying (cars) all together! Not sure I can withstand the burst of ideas and associations all that triggered in me!<br><br>For education, my father was a very good and highly praised elementary school teacher, who retired as soon as he could since the final few years of his teaching career were eaten up by bureaucratic insanity (New Math, et al.) Shortly after I finished college, I had the good fortune to see "Deschooling Society" by Ivan Illich on the shelves of a local bookstore, which once acquired and devoured figuratively blew the top of my head off. It's been years since I read it, so am not sure how well it has aged, but it had a profound effect on my life and caused me to question numerous things in our educational mythos.<br><br>For flying cars, oh gosh, I have some slight disagreements with how you contrasted cars and aircraft (for instance, light weight is an <i>excellent</i> characteristic in cars if performance and high fuel efficiency Is paramount) but that's just quibbling; your central point, that cars and airplanes have <b>very</b> different points of optimization, is spot-on. <br><br>Your 30-40 year cycle applies very well to an event transpiring right now, where some wealthy Swiss are flying a solar-powered airplane in a series of hops (slowly) around the world (it just landed at Allentown, PA.) I worked briefly on a solar-powered plane project 36 years ago, and the only thing innovative about the Swiss solar plane is the use of lithium batteries and social media; all the other tech was available in 1980, and we arguably built and flew a superior airplane back then! Ours (Solar Challenger) was certainly stronger, simpler, higher performance, safer, and cheaper...<br><br>Two nights ago we had some Danish friends over for dinner. Around the table, the topic of American culture came up, specifically the reluctance to reciprocate socially (I invite you over for dinner, and then you later invite me over.) As my wife is French, I was the lone representative for American characteristics. But I explained that I'm not an exemplar of American behavior, likely because I, like my mom, was and am a voracious reader, and with my Aspie mind had early-on formed an idea of how people behave and think and act based more on reading Dickens and Dostoyevsky and Hesse and Nietzche and Melville and Baum and Muir. Needless to say, my early adulthood was a series of puzzlements, to me and to my erstwhile friends and associates. <br><br>Reading assignment? Groan, I have too big a queue already, but they'll have to wait. I stared at my bookshelves, where I have one shelf with a few old books my mom loved, and out stepped "Kidnapped" by Robert Louis Stevenson. What's that doing there? Never read it. So I guess I'll be getting in touch with my long-dead Scottish ancestors over the next couple of weeks.

One of the several goals of this particular curriculum is to use as much public domain literature as possible so that folks may get it from Project Gutenberg and similar free sources.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c2991578130009646211 title="comment permalink">5/25/16, 11:10 PM</a><br><br>

How on earth do they stay more absurd than the real world? Thanks for the cold fusion link -- yes, that's a great example. If I were less ethical than I am, I'd make up some bogus new energy technology and get out there and market it -- between investors and governments who seem to throw funds reflexively at anything sufficiently stupid, I'm quite sure I'd make ten times the income I get as a writer!<br><br>Ray, you went to a good department -- and yes, three readings is a bare minimum; we'll get to that as this sequence proceeds. As for fiction, a whole series of reasons which we'll be building on as we go. Stay tuned!<br><br>Mary, the paddock et al. definitely comes first! I've heard the same rumors about the Clinton campaign. Keep an eye on DNC chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz; if she loses her position before the convention, that's a pretty solid signal that the Dem leadership has realized that Clinton's going to suffer a catastrophic defeat at Trump's hands, and is about to throw her under the bus and try to give the nomination to someone who can actually win. <br><br>Eric, I wasn't thinking of the song, but that'll do!<br><br>John, congratulations -- I wondered who was going to fall into that trap first. No, I'm not suggesting that all assumptions about reality are equivalent; I'm suggesting that compassionate understanding should precede judgment, and that the reflexive habit of assuming that current presuppositions are always right and good and true while those of the past are always wrong and bad and false makes it impossible to perceive the shortcomings of our current beliefs. The only sense in which all assumptions about reality are equivalent is that all of them are culturally constructed human phenomena that fail to account for all of the universe of human experience -- that's not postmodernism, unless you consider Chuang Tsu, the authors of the Upanishads, and the Greek philosophers of the Old Academy to be postmodernists. <br><br>As for the use of historical examples, that's been this blog's bread and butter all along, you know, and I've already discussed your objections to that habit <a href=../../2014/03/american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html rel=nofollow>in a previous post</a>. The parallels between Athenian policy before and during the Peloponnesian War and neoconservative policy in today's United States are precise and extensive, and could be developed at great length; I haven't done so here, as the point wasn't central to this week's post. I quite understand that fans of neoconservative policies bridle at the comparison, given what it implies about the future of the United States, but there it is; I'm sure the war party in Athens would have been just as incensed to be told that their preferred policies were going to bring about the ruin of their country.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c105450095706600581 title="comment permalink">5/25/16, 11:21 PM</a><br><br>

It has two meanings, that are two different words in german. One is "das Argument", which means a rational piece of Information or logic that helps to prove your point of view, the other one is "der Streit" which means an emotional verbal conflict. This influences heavily the idea of how differences in opinion are treated in both cultures. <br><br>The englisch speaking world has the tradition of rhethoric, which is the art of putting forth your arguments to persuade the other side and thus "win the conflict", since "having an argument" because of the shortage af the vocabulary always contains the conflict element.<br><br>In german tradition, a dispute carried out with arguments is not about winning and convincing, but about increasing knowledge. So if your point of view is your thesis, and the other one thinks different, than his point of view is the antithesis. The goal of the conversation is not to win and convince, but to exchange pieces of data and logic ("Argumente") that increases both sides knowledge until they find out how the previous contradiction came about and can both achieve a higher level of knowledge, called the synthesis. The concept of thesis, synthesis and antithesis was developed by Hegel and Fichte, but i think they just formalised the cultural behaviour they were exposed to. While this way a difference in Point of views can be solved for both sides advantages, Germans have no concept of "agreeing to disagree", which is the rhethoric stale mate in the english culture. <br><br>Another difference between english and german culture (i can only compare those because those are the languages i am fluent in) is what the author of "the german Genius" called "inwardness", the concept of moral selfevaluation, which Kant formalized to his categoric imperative. This difference is nicely reflected in the titles that Marc Aurels "Meditations" got in each Language (very old and very good book). The original greek title translates to something like "pointing to myself", which is translated in German to "selfobservation" because it hits a concept existing in german culture. The english speaking culture does not have this concept, so it just translated to "Meditations", which means "something you do with your mind without talking and i dont have a better word for it". <br><br>And while talking about losing the past, due to both heavy american cultural influence and cultural senility, the Germans are starting to lose the connection to their philosophical traditions. While everybody reads Goethe at school, Kant, Fichte and Hegel are not part of the curriculum in most parts of germany and instead the Idea of the english concept of rhetoric, practised in "debating clubs" is starting to spread.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c6528917049477033777 title="comment permalink">5/25/16, 11:46 PM</a><br><br>

That said, all deities behave in ways that, from a human perspective, approximates to ratfinkdom from time to time -- even (or especially) those deities whose followers make the most noise about how perfect and good and loving they are. <br><br>Submarine, do you know if Ebert's got essays available online? I don't do video if I can possibly help it -- I find the act of watching little colored pictures jerking around on a glass screen perhaps the most boring and irritating of all human activities, up there past watching paint dry and listening to Hillary Clinton fans try to defend her record. <br><br>Samurai, I suspect that it was precisely the fact that you tackled the unexpurgated originals that laid the foundations for your ability to recognize the stupidity of shutting down the trade schools.

She tried massage parlors and dating services to promote her wares. They came under increased scrutiny due to a change in city regimes. Meaning the authorities wanted new brides. So she installed an institution called “Ginger's Sexy Reading Room” as an alternative service, complete with a library of the classics in the relaxing waiting room. This confounded the police. In the pulsating center of the city, across West Burnside Street, where today stands the empire of the Powell's Book, Ginger opened a Reading Room. A Sexy Reading Room.<br><br>The police sent in their finest under cover to request services. Ginger knowing the mission and the special forces, met the challenge with Thucycides, Plato and other classics, in some cases bound in leather. Although binding in leather was not her specialty. On the night of the raid, my friend was walking past, on the way to his nearby rock polishing shop to check on a set up, grinding over night. After closing time at a neighborhood tavern, he stumbled into the crowded waiting room of Ginger's, lined in books and he inquired as to the party. The cops were threatening and cajoling, asking everyone why they were there.<br><br>My friend picked up a copy of Thucycides and started reading out loud. Books were plucked from the shelves. Another person started loudly reading Gibbon's Fall of Rome. Ginger was quoting Shakespeare. A play by Euripides was acted out by an elderly man in tweed. A scantily clad chorus of girls emerged from the back room to echo his soliloquy. The classics prevailed. The cops were quoting Miranda.<br><br>In the cacophony there was a stand off. Everyone plead that they were there at 3:00 am. for the ancient knowledge of the texts lining the walls. No laws had been broken. No offers of overtly Sexy Reading had been proposed or accepted. Just the classics and nothing more. After all, if the Christian Scientists could have their reading rooms, so could Ginger and the classics. Even at 3:00 a. m. Thucycides had won the battle. The reporters following the police radio leads, wrote it up as a comedy.<br><br>Later, the police and Ginger quietly negotiated a new price and the establishment closed in favor of more lucrative ventures in other parts of town, on an old state route, in the shadowy suburbs to the east. Parking was limited on Burnside and the location was too visible for secretive entry. The sign stayed up for months to the delight of the tourists. Ginger's Sexy Reading Room had served its purpose, calling out the forces of goodness and battling high mindedness with the Greek classics.<br><br>This story shows that the past has merits and lends meaning in our present lives. A document from ancient times can have power beyond what lies hidden under the dust. It can force change on the young and inexperienced and reveal truths that stand against today's budding tyrannies. And the classics are Sexy!<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c4792829336670938599 title="comment permalink">5/25/16, 11:53 PM</a><br><br>

It is a very nice read (or listen) especially from the perspective of "setting a civilization down for a soft landing". I admit it is pretty soft on the modern consciousness, perhaps the biggest rub being the physiognomy bit. But that is so unapologetic it is actually less of an issue than what is the routine in many modern productions. <br><br>Before that was Pierre and Luce by Romain Rolland. This one is really recent of course but interesting because in my impression Rolland brings with him another good bit of historical perspective (a picture in a picture so to say). "The world of yesterday" by Stefan Zweig is a related one that does this job (for the most recent times) pretty good I'd say.<br><br>Of course none of those really are "large caliber", but I have pretty much quit contemporary fiction since the digital libraries came online (particularly the audio versions).<br>I wonder if part of Nietzsche's emphasis on music derives from it being complementary to "worded language". Further that makes me wonder if the English music scene is (was?) so successful because by and large the people have very limited ability to express themselves via language, and thus do what they have to by means of music. Scandinavia would be a counter-example though. Hm. <br><br>@JMG: You often use "special characters" that you copy and paste into the text when using other languages. If you paste and cut them, e.g. into your search bar, before they go into the text - they should be stripped of their original formatting and not stand out in any way.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c3534281050749046172 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 12:00 AM</a><br><br>

I believe at five years old they can know what their next steps are. I believe that because at my last school on the East Coast where I was the principal, my 5-year-olds were leading their student-led learning conversations with confidence". <br>She said education should become more "learner-centric" to enable students to be change-makers, rather than being put in a box and told to conform.<br>"I like kids that challenge, and I like kids who challenge me and the system. But also that we give them a set of really good values as framework".<br>The key values were integrity, adaptability, open to learning, respect and empathy.“<br><br>Yeah right, let those 5 year olds tell us what they “need” for their next step in their education. We’ll just “give them” some really good values and let them get on with it. I wonder just how one goes about “giving“ values in school.

As things stand, at first, it'll only be those who recognize the need, but we'll see what happens. <br><br>Chris, no argument there. I tend to think that one class in critical theory would be well worth having on the curriculum of any literature degree -- but just one class, and then, having learned to recognize the issues critical theory addresses, we proceed to the many other things worth discussing.

My audience is scattered thinly all over the world, and I have yet to encounter a country or cultural group anywhere that has responded to what I have to say with "Well, of course!"

I was fortunate enough to learn Latin by way of that durable early 20th century monument, Wheelock's Latin, which hadn't quite been shoved out of its place in the University of Washington Latin Department yet; I then helped found a Latin club that met at a Seattle bookstore for some years, which also used Wheelock as its core text.

B.C. as you say stands for Before Christ, and Christ means "The Anointed One", a title of the Jewish Messiah who has not yet appeared on this planet (though Bar Kochba, Shabbatai Zvi and R. Schneerson were among the men so hailed during their lifetimes). A.D. does not stand for After Death. It is the abbreviation for Anno Domini, "In the year of Our Lord." Should the five-sixths of humanity who are not Christian be required to make a declaration of faith in the divinity of Jesus every time they cite a date in the world's most widely used chronology? If you impose this on me, perhaps I'll be driven to dating everything AUC, and then only classics majors will have any idea what year I'm talking about.<br><br>Do you expect atheists to lay a hand on the Bible and say "So help me God" when they testify in a secular court?

I'm an English/Environmental Science major at UMass Amherst. I love what you have to say about the teaching of literature today. Everyone I know regards me as a little weird that I prefer classic/old literature- I read "the hollies" as a friend of mine put it, meaning I read, Dickinson, Frost, Dickens, The Brontes, Yeats, Shakespeare, and Virgil. What I find really funny is that the Emily Dickinson museum is right here in Amherst and not many of the English/art majors here have made a voluntary pilgrimage to it. She is my favorite poet. It's a safe bet that if I wasn't a huge fan of Emily Dickinson's poetry I wouldn't be here at UMass Amherst. <br><br>I started out in college as an engineering major. It became clear to me after only one semester that engineering was about striping all the humanity out of life. Everywhere I looked in the engineering building there were posters advertising nuclear energy and clean coal. These things I already disagreed with whole heartedly. The engineering program at Western New England College is largely self guided; when I said I wanted to do green energy I was quickly made wise to the fact that green energy isn't going to fill all our energy needs. The green engineering program the college offered turned out to be a simple marketing gimmick that involved a small windmill that ran a few light bulbs and a solar water heater on the front lawn. These devices were marketed as powering Slieth Hall but in actuality did an inconsequential amount. I wish so much that my love of writing, poetry and art had been encouraged in high school; when I got to that first semester at Western New England College I was a wreck. It was writing and drawing that gave me the courage to change course and I flunked out of Western New England College on purpose; my parents were going to force me to endure another semester there. I realized then that our society essentially grooms people to be astronauts. From then on, I was trying to just get in touch with the Earth/reality. <br><br>How I got here to UMass is a long story. In my academic death/suicide I found the preverbal axe to grind and something to write about. The Juniper Summer Writing Institute of Poetry in 2013 was the first real academic success I had in college and my first course at UMass. <br><br>The most educational experience I've ever had was in high school. I ran into the woods and I had a very spiritual experience sitting at a beaver pond; there I found my creativity again. It was how the sun touched my skin, the wind went through the trees. Still I can't come to terms with that day because I still seek to bridge an unbridgeable dichotomy. Real human contact is what people going to college want; that is the college experience people crave. Human contact doesn't really exist today. Right now I'm trying to harness that creative spirit I found at the beaver pond nine years ago and if possible make my living by it. <br><br>Sincerely, Austin<br><br>PS It's 3:30 am here in Massachusetts sorry about any misspellings or grammatical errors. I also tried using the google ID the from UMass apparently college students can't post blog comments.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c2186040028843428696 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 12:33 AM</a><br><br>

In high school i got great works direct from silent generation teachers. I just had nine days off and read:f.scott fitzgerald, tender is the night, great gatsby and henry james, portrait of a lady. I had interrupted my reading of milton'sbparadise lost for this. I am readin in parallel that, divine commedy and iliad, partway through all. I know some french, russian, spanish, italian and fluent in german. <br><br>Zauberberg and portrait of a lady seemed prominent in tender is the night composition. Expat americans should definitely read henry james and tender is the night. James explodes stereotypes between europeans and americans which are a basis of our cultures. Americanization of europe has dumbed europeans down but feelings are still there. Work is exhausting but pleasurable for its own sake and for human contact so my reading outside of days off is slow. Genre lit like scifi, detective leave me critical. Who writes as artist nowadays, john updike? Was james joyce, faulkner, virginia wolf trying a 60s type experiment of ridiculing naive narrator to say'think for yourself' through flow narrative? 60s went further towards middle ages then. Tell people what exactly to think. Worse than dickens black white moralizing or henry james greys moralizing by far. How many angels on the head of a pin? Irrelevant ideologies die off quickly. You said totalitarianism was squeezing all areas of life into one area in othr blog. It seems that politics hs taken over culture as well as invading religion. PC thinking from left dominates universities. This destrys critical thought. If churches in south preach neocon patriotism the effect is similar inother area. Since money controls everything it is clear where it is all coming from. Need for oil and trade on right and on left spreading human rights civil rights at home and abroad. Global system is anti imperialist as usa can by definition not be imperialist being a collection of rejects, freedom fighters and this is a multicultural antiracist, antinationalist experiment so surveillance state, torture are ok in name of greater good. This cycle is ending with this elction. <br><br>As to being modern and realistic I am reading Great expectations and pip's sister in 2nd chapter so like my wife I laughed my head off. <br><br>Masturbation and other homemade porn is main internet content.Private art if you will. Intimatest moments made public. Lady chatterley's lover also controversial or nudist beaches. Who cares. Work hard, play hard goes the saying. Drink, dance and screw on the weekend. Prudery was for victorians.STDs spreading through casual sex internet dating at record pace. Downside to internet sexuality and polyamorism. <br><br>Your holistic learning pproach with discussion forums is a great boon to integrative knowledge of self and society. Great works and current events discussion forums. <br><br>My spirituality has broken through to group problematic so that deep internal life is a practical daily political problem of sexual and race relations. I can't hate nobody when i love everyone too much so my political ideas are just ideas without substance. <br><br>I read comics preteen so I know where all our marvel films originate. Cultural desolation. Keep up good work.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c1240383211939690079 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 12:34 AM</a><br><br>

Gah. <br><br>Submarine, then there's no time to lose -- start reading it at once!<br><br>Keith, I disagree. Obviously people of different ages are going to benefit from different old books -- but would you deny <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> to a child? It's a 19th century book. As a child, I delighted in Walter Scott's <i>Ivanhoe</i>, Thomas Malory's <i>Le Morte d'Arthur</i> (and any other original Arthurian legends I could get my hands on), the autobiography of Ben Franklin, and many other old books. If anything, the younger the better, so that the child grows up with a broader sense of the possible. <br><br>GE Canterbury, Herodotus is also just plain good reading -- as of course is Gene Wolf, as the quote you cited demonstrates.

That wasn't my intention -- it's simply that I try to keep the themes of my two blogs broadly separate so that each one is accessible to its own audience. I'll consider your point, though. <br><br>Casamurphy, delighted to hear it. I wonder if the teacher had ever heard of either work. <br><br>Ynnothir, may I make a suggestion? Start with a shorter dialogue of Plato's. <i>The Republic</i> is in many ways the capstone of his thought, and it helps to work up to it by reading some of the others first. The Meno or the Crito would be good places to start. <br><br>Casamurphy, Voltaire is always worth reading, but I'd follow it up with Burke!<br><br>Lewis, by all means get Tacitus' <i>Agricola</i>; it's available online if nothing else. But of course you'll need fiction for the homework. How about Petronius Arbiter!<br><br>Toomas, <i>Virile agiter</i> remains one of my favorite Latin jokes, and I think it's one that would have appealed to the old Roman sense of humor. Thank you. As for formatting problems, I did exactly what I usually do, so I'm gathering that Blogger "upgraded" -- that is, made things worse, which is what that word does generally mean, of course. <br><br>Have you by any chance read "The Origins of English Nonsense" by Noel Malcolm?

(I'm good with that; the beer's better out here.) <br><br>Knutty Knitter, glad to hear that you've found your way to a more sensible program. As for languages, though, dyslexia is a problem only when nobody bothers to make accommodations for it. Do you have any trouble memorizing tunes? How about lyrics? You can absorb a language aurally, starting with songs -- in fact, singing a language is a powerful way to pick up vocabulary and grammar, which is why most cultures teach their children to sing songs in the course of their early education. With me, everybody: "A, B, C, D, E, F, G..." <br><br>BoysMom, thanks for this! Bunyan's great fun, too -- very well suited to the second grade, as well as thereafter. <br><br>Deedl, those are first-rate examples -- many thanks! The interesting thing is that "argument" didn't originally mean "verbal fight" in English. Old narrative poems routinely had an "Argument" at the beginning, which was a prose account of the story, so that the reader had some idea of what was going on and didn't get lost in the thickets of prose. I'm glad to hear that German schools still teach Goethe, and I'm not going to complain too much if Hegel gets forgotten -- to my mind, Schopenhauer was correct to label him as a poseur who used incomprehensibility to pretend to profundity -- but no Kant? That's appalling. <br><br>EntropicDoom, thank you. That's a grand story. <br><br>Latefall, large caliber isn't required. In some ways the pop fiction and children's books of earlier eras are just as revealing, if not more so, than the serious stuff. As for formatting, I write all these posts on OpenOffice and paste the whole thing in a lump into the New Post window on Blogger; I hope I don't have to separately cut and paste and repaste each individual accented vowel!<br><br>Interrogante, three good examples. Yes, I'm familiar with the business about Twain. I wonder if any of the people arguing for that know what the verb "bowdlerize" means. <br><br>Latefall, a good example. It's probably unnecessary to point out that Darwin never uttered that phrase -- it was coined by Herbert Spencer, and represents a falsification of Darwin's concept. <br><br>Nuku, that's a classic. The rationale dates back to Rousseau, and no, it didn't work back then, either. <br><br>Somewhatstunned, thank you! <br><br>Unknown Deborah, you're welcome. <br><br>Goedeck, there you are -- ahead of the pack. ;-)<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c4617050056662726372 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 1:33 AM</a><br><br>

I have used the curriculum myself for homeschooling and it definitely delivers on the promise of developing a balanced, socially adept, free thinking individual. My kids were never star students but they are able to talk with people of any age, and more importantly, they want to. I loved teaching the curriculum because I learned so much that I myself never got at public school. Subjects are dealt with at certain times for specific reasons and are developmentally appropriate. But it puts one at odds with mainstream society. It was difficult and a bit alienating to do it before ipads, but I shudder when I think of trying to do it now.

This week's essay brings to mind an anecdote that opened my mind to the possibilities of scanning reality for possible preconceived notions, which always contain opportunities to to affect seemingly effortless change simply by leaving the agreed-upon mindframe.<br>Contemporary German gardeners consider bishop's weed their arch nemesis, for it is increadibly resilient and fast-spreading. One local permaculturist here found a fantastic solution, though: He just decided to not see it as a problem anymore. Afterall, it makes a much better companion for his trees than lawn, while also being a great wild food. Thereby he spared himself tons of meaningless work (fighting something that wants to live) and got better soil and thus better fruit, plus free spinach equivalent, just for the cost of a preconceived idea that wasn't all that useful to begin with.<br><br>3.

Apart from the book-length requirement, that is. Being short on time, but wishing to enter in the spirit of things, from Project Gutenberg, I chose 'A Mere Interlude', an 1885 short story by Thomas Hardy. The story centres on a young teacher who regrets her chosen profession, and opts for marriage to escape it. <br><br>The only other book I've read of Hardy's was 'Far From the Madding Crowd' - and unfortunately that was a forced reading at age 16, for my English Literature 'O' Level. (Regarding the modern preference for moving pictures, that dreary book only came to life halfway through our studies with a viewing of the Schlesinger film with Julie Christie, Terence Stamp et al. Our English teacher was a hard taskmaster, but not afraid to take short cuts). <br><br>The plot of this story, written 11 years after 'FFTMC' has obvious similarities. A capable and educated young lady, marriage as the central focus, to an older man, and a relationship with a younger but arrogant type. And contented camaraderie providing the happy ending, all set within the rigid constraints of Victorian society. <br><br>But would Thomas Hardy, for all his sympathy for his female characters, ever be considered a modern day 'SJW', what with marriage as the focus, and lines like this..?<br><br>"On examination the poor girls turned out to be not only plain-looking, which she could have forgiven, but to have such a lamentably meagre intellectual equipment as to be hopelessly inadequate as companions". <br><br>Perhaps that's just a reflection of the Victorian preoccupation with class, and that only education could deliver 'betterment'. Or is it that such blunt description is now no longer permitted, lest it cause offence?<br><br> <br>http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/15252/pg15252-images.html<br><br>Here's hoping there will be old-fashioned and honest marks out of ten for our assignments... ;-)<br><br><br>cheers<br><br>Mustard<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c4200587546903327203 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 4:32 AM</a><br><br>

Preach it, Brother Greer! I'm an English professor with a degree in Medieval and Renaissance literature; now I'm given textbooks (not that I use them) that are a collection of unknown modern writers whose views run the political and social gambit from A to B. C.S. Lewis, on the other hand, agrees with your ideas for education:<br><br>"Every age has its own outlook. It is specially good at seeing certain truths and specially liable to make certain mistakes. We all, therefore, need the books that will correct the characteristic mistakes of our own period. And that means the old books. All contemporary writers share to some extent the contemporary outlook – even those, like myself, who seem most opposed to it. Nothing strikes me more when I read the controversies of past ages than the fact that both sides were usually assuming without question a good deal which we should now absolutely deny. They thought that they were as completely opposed as two sides could be, but in fact they were all the time secretly united – united with each other and against earlier and later ages – by a great mass of common assumptions. We may be sure that the characteristic blindness of the twentieth century – the blindness about which posterity will ask, “But how could they have thought that?” – lies where we have never suspected it, and concerns something about which there is untroubled agreement between Hitler and President Roosevelt or between Mr. H. G. Wells and Karl Barth. None of us can fully escape this blindness, but we shall certainly increase it, and weaken our guard against it, if we read only modern books." <br><br>The full essay can be read here: http://silouanthompson.net/library/early-church/on-the-incarnation/introduction/<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c576806704993233488 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 4:48 AM</a><br><br>

I'm right now wading through the deep tangle of education options for my not-quite-school-age kids, and leaning more and more to homeschooling them. But I'm still trying to decide what that'll look like. Charlotte Mason's ideas are appealing-- she liked getting kids out in nature every day, teaching handicrafts, giving kids lots of free time, AND introducing elementary kids to Plutarch as a jumping-off point to the classics. There are still small colleges out there devoted to studying the classics (my sister graduated from one), and they are almost exclusively Catholic: St. John's College in Annapolis comes to mind, as one of the larger non-catholic (I think?) ones. <br><br>Languages: I took the mandatory two years of Spanish in school, and learned almost nothing, but have made it a bit further studying it on my own in recent years. So far, either I'm not good enough, or the language is too close to English, to have the effects you're talking about. On the other hand, I've been hacking away at Vietnamese on and off for the last decade, and it's an extraordinary experience. The grammar is simple, and there are no words of more than one syllable, but it's been challenging and enlightening. I think the language is 85% what we would think of as idiom. There is no single word for "sun". The phrase is "mat troi", literally "sky face" or "face of heaven". There are category words that embrace things I think I understand, until I run into the other bizarre things they cover. "con", for instance, is a category for animals and small children. And also knives. The best english equivalent I can come up with is maybe "creatures". I've made far less progress here than in Spanish, but it's been vastly more educational. And I cackled last week when I realized that the word for kangaroo translates as "bag rat". I wonder if one gets more benefit from the study in proportion to how radically the language of study differs from one's native tongue.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c4329720945958034858 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 6:07 AM</a><br><br>

It's much easier for many of us to look at works from the past--sometimes published only a few decades ago--and notice what is unacceptable to us, such as certain racial attitudes or gender roles. But it's harder for us to look at contemporary works with an equally critical eye. Future generations may look at a lot of current popular children's books (that most people today don't find objectionable) and see them in a much different light. The glorification and unquestioned acceptance of fossil fueled powered lifestyles, a worldview of no limits, the culture of consumption, or even just the mass amounts of trivial, vacuous themes that obscure and leave deeper, more important themes unmentioned: I wonder if these may be grossly apparent to future people who stumble across them.

As I have said previously, I deeply involved myself in this mindset when I was a schoolboy, and this self-defeating design appears to have become even more the case today than it was back then. I have a theory about why this is so.<br><br>Basically in the society of the Era of Pretense in this country, adults are conditioned to spend their lives chasing after what they think they're supposed to want. If one is physically attractive and socially well-skilled and well-adjusted, or at the very least has connections conferred upon them by the social status into which they were born, their pursuits will be mostly accommodated by society. These people are looked upon as the "winners". Then there are those who are partially or entirely lacking in any of these advantages. Their attempts at pursuing the conventional forms of self-fulfillment frequently get them ignored, rebuffed, or in some cases low-key persecuted by "winner" types. So that would make these people the "losers" in this pursuit-game.<br><br>It's not difficult to understand how the social-justice mindset would be appealing to some of the "losers". After all, what the whole political correctness trip attempts to do is take the social ostracism and bullying tactics employed by the "winners" and turn it back on the more privileged group in an attempt to achieve some kind of victory. Unfortunately, it's because this kind of rescue game is approached with the mindset of feeling like a "loser" (which, in fairness to these less-privileged types, is a mode of feeling into which they have been conditioned for quite some time), the social-justice approach will necessarily reflect the many neuroses of people who feel like "losers". And when you approach a situation with the mindset of a "loser", you will, quite simply, lose again. That's just how life in human social environments has always worked.<br><br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c3684629844285185204 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 8:13 AM</a><br><br>

It was extremely classics oriented with little of the postmodern deconstruction you’re describing. I took classes on Greek myth in British literature, Pre-Raphaelite art and the Victorian novel, Russian literature and Soviet culture, and Irish history, culture, and literature (with a study abroad component). And we learned to look at everything in its own context, rather than from modern sensibilities. The classes required for my Natural History and Humanities degree looked at the history and methods of the natural history tradition combined with field ecology, lab work, and wilderness trips through the university outdoor center, and we learned plant identification, navigation, wilderness first aid, outdoor leadership and related topics, topped off with a capstone project and senior thesis. It was a very good education, made me the person I am, and opened up some great internships and volunteer experiences (I didn’t follow the career path that opened up because I wanted to put down roots near friends and family, and I’d have had no control over where I moved). I found out that the TTU honors college just graduated its last ever NHH major, so I’m one of the few graduates they had.<br><br>Recently, I went back to school briefly for some classes I needed for my resume, and was shocked by the shift in the school culture. The classes were much easier, rarely assigned reading, and never assigned essay writing. The big shock, though, was the student life on campus. When I was in college the first time, I was an officer in an environmental club and a film club. In the former we organized all the recycling on campus, worked on community gardens with the ag department, worked with the university for things like campus xeriscaping, better bicycle lanes, etc. and put together workshops on topics like peak oil, sustainable development, reskilling, regional ecology, and permaculture, plus presentations by climate scientists in the atmospheric science department. In the film club (I know you have your issues with film, but some film I think can be useful), we studied the films of artists like Andrei Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman, and Michelangelo Antonioni … and presenters put together discussion packets with recommended reading and discussion points relating to philosophy and literature the films engaged with. This time, the environmental activist group sat around talking about green techno-gimmicks, and the one actual event they put on was a visit by a technician at a solar power plant. When time came for questions he couldn’t answer any of my questions about net energy output, energy bleed in electronics, or raw materials for part replacement, and responded to questions about grid dependence by insisting on the potential of nuclear power to make up the difference. As for the film club, I didn’t finish the first meeting, since intensive critical discussion was replaced with talk about whether popular movies pass the “Beshdel Test.”<br><br>The younger generation worries me more. A friend of mine has kids around the age of 12, and aside from the things their father makes them read, they don’t get exposed to things older than they are. And there’s an obsession in schools with protecting these children from the trauma of failure (they’ve even stopped giving “Fs” because it hurts self-esteem.) And attempts to teach kids about social justice don’t making them nicer or less prejudiced, (that still has to happen by discipline and teaching manners), it is making them more insistent on their own feelings. I’ve seen young children spout pop psychology to protest being told “no.”<br><br><br> As for Bulwer-Lytton… yeah, I figure I need something that’s going to require mustering some “intellectual courage,” in order to get the full effect of the exercise you’re suggesting. And reading something that has threads to ideas that influenced my own beliefs, and to ideas will probably push every rage button my 21st century mind has will be a good workout. <br><br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c6195058692576459017 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

But after reading an article about Oberlin in the latest New Yorker (The Big Uneasy, by Nathan Heller) I began to formulate a different opinion. In their pursuit of 'diversity' many small elite colleges &amp; universities have begun to heavily recruit and import urban minority students. Such students would largely be from the wage class you have been discussing, while the more traditional students (as well as the administration and faculty) would largely be from the salary class. <br><br>The salary class believe that they are offering a wonderful opportunity to the wage class to move on up and acquire the perks and privileges they already enjoy. But the wage class students have seen through this and have decided instead to challenge the comforts of the salary class.<br><br>You said "We can, I think, presume that universities don’t exist for the sake of giving privileged youth a place to play at changing the world, before they settle down to a lifetime of propping up the status quo in corporate and government careers." I think we can presume that they *shouldn't* exist for that purpose, but the students from the wage class may well be arguing that that is precisely their purpose, as currently configured.

The result of this compromise has been, I think, different political constituencies seeing different parts of the system that are useful to them and that they want to encourage - and what isn't useful to them that can be discarded. Right now, corporate and market power is in ascendancy, so only those parts of the compromise that benefits the market - the technical training aspect - are encouraged, while the rest is seen as "fluff."<br><br>One other thing - having gone through a humanities program at an engineering school, I will say that not every professor in the humanities (or history, for that matter) understands that the reason you read things not written in modern times is to see the historical echoes and lessons to be drawn times past and how they can be used to interpret today's occurrences.

Having enrolled craving precisely that full-on, face-first encounter with the past, getting instead a muddy descent into the swamp of absurdity of the contemporary is something I still recall as one of the worst disappointments of my life. Desperately needing to be "relevant" (btw, that word has always triggered my gag-reflex, so thanks for clarifying its origins), the discipline did the obvious thing and made itself subservient to the religion of progress, embracing a collective agenda of trying to fit the last 200.000 years of human experience into the world view brought about by three hundred years of industrial society. Given that archaeologists are the red haired stepchildren of the humanities, constantly struggling to justify their own existence, I suppose it would have taken superhuman capacities for reflective thinking on their part to do anything else, but the resulting intellectual gymnastics, where "critical" works out in practice to identifying totally and unthinkingly with the unconscious assumptions, beliefs and narratives of the present and projecting it with militant fervour onto the human legacy as a whole, is truly one for the records.<br><br>Now, John, I must say, given the explanation of what a university education is supposed to be and what it is supposed to accomplish, you do a really good job of providing us with exactly that.

Ideally postmodern theory is useful because it furnishes the imagination with more ways to understand-- it corresponds to classical skepticism. The pervasive and, dare I say, goofy abuse of it is to take it as telling you how to think, i.e. to make of it an ideology. Basically a category error. Critical theory has the excellent virtue of raising the question, "Whose past?" There are more pasts than one, always more worlds and perspectives to consider than prevailing powers will entertain. The error, seemingly, is to answer "Our past!" and put an end to it. For "relevance" there is no excuse. <br><br>There are also the corrosive social forces: universities have the misfortune of being economically useful by producing fiat goods of minimal relation to energy use, namely academic publications, white-collar positions, and latterly debt. And archetypally the university resembles the ecclesia, which means people will fight ruinously over what it means and who owns it. <br><br>I studied at an excellent Canadian university and I think the golden thread was still to be found there, but it was in spite of an overwhelming assault on academic morale. It was a constant struggle to keep serious attention where it belonged. The changes Robert Mathiesen has described happening at Brown in the 90s were well underway when I left.<br><br>By the by, my experience of the mandatory class on literary theory was that the subject would have been better served by a term spent with the Presocratics.<br><br>I do miss the collegiality though.

As one of the leaders explained it to me, "you can't realize how different our cultural values and worldviews are [from the U.S. culture] without speaking our language, because the structure of the language - and where the structure places the subjects and all surrounding relationships - are completely upside down from the English language." <br><br>On another note, one of the reasons I homeschool is so my children can read many books in their entirety, especially "old" classic books. (side note: Jane Eyre is one of my favorites, with some of the best writing I've read - ever - on the need for character). So obviously I don't like the 'postmodern' disregard for classics. <br><br>Yet, after 8 years of homeschooling, I also am sick-to-death of being surrounded by Christian conservatives who believe the only classics worth reading are those that cast Christian European culture in a positive light. Anything written from the enormous wake of destruction that European culture has left behind is conveniently ignored or discounted and dismissed (with a sniff) as 'postmodern' (nothing like a label to ensure instant dismissal). I know a number of Christian families that won't even let their children read about the Greek or Roman gods, as they don't want the kids to have exposure to other gods (or the thought that cultures make up their own version of such). So I'm torn. I see where modern education has gone and how worthless it is. But I also have empathy with what they were trying to originally accomplish in breaking out of the singular mindset. It seems, rathering than adding well-written diverse pieces onto a classical education, they threw out the baby, the bath water, and the bath tub.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c7881544172835730037 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 12:03 PM</a><br><br>

There was a lot of criticism of Wheelock - in particular, people who agreed with Professor Dowling thought that Wheelock got in the way of learning Latin. Some even said that Wheelock was partially responsible for the decline of Latin education in the United States (too watered down to have the advantages of older textbooks, without the advantages of modern language learning textbooks). Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata, a textbook from Denmark, was much more favored (like Wheelock, it first came out in the 1950s, though it took decades for it to become known in the English-speaking world).

One thing I've tried to cultivate since I've started reading this blog is a sense of timelessness, not getting caught in the moment, and realizing our place in the greater scheme of things, and it's placed me at odds with virtually all of the people I encounter. All of them are very much "of the moment" and "prisoners of their own time", and now JMG has so expertly explained why. Really, that seems to be the fault line that separates me and the people I've encountered--the looks of blank incomprehension and frustration at my efforts to detach and be timeless. I think it ties what JMG says about people being "prisoners of their time" and digital addiction, which forces people to live in an eternal, non-reflective present. I think detachment is one of the prime values JMG cultivates on this blog, and for good reason. It's one of the primary tools recommended for friends and relatives to maintain their sanity when a loved one is engaged in addiction. Realizing the addict is doomed and basically a "dead man walking", the friend or relative is counseled to detach and stop "rescue" behaviors. An attitude of detachment is useful in dealing w/digital addiction and the other symptoms of our sick culture as well.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c637756761181088833 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 12:52 PM</a><br><br>

I mention these traditions because they still survive in the present, but I think the mediaeval European approach was more similar to them than post-Erasmian Western approaches too. <br><br>The traditional approaches involved memorization and oral transmission of select texts through a qualified teacher. Autodidactism was rare. By contrast, in the modern approach, while a teacher can be helpful in shedding light on unclear points, self-reading of texts is the general rule. In modern universities, at least in my experience, it's taken to the extreme where one rarely reads any few books through from start to finish in a given university course; one reads excerpts from books and articles that are relevant to the course syllabus.<br><br>The shift in meaning of Aquinas' fear of a man who knows only one book captures this quite well I think.

Ebert is a huge fan of Spengler and cites him regularly. He has a <a href=http://www.amazon.com/review/R5EI7G287Q6LUs rel=nofollow>great review</a> of the Decline of the West posted on the Evil Empire's website, in which he describes the Decline of the West as "probably my favorite book" and which is well worth taking the time to read.<br><br>He has a couple of recent essays out about the Trump phenomenon, which he argues has some disturbing parallels with the rise of Caesarism in the late Roman Republic. I would add that I don't think its likely we will see Trump play the role of Caesar this time around, in part because I think it's too early in the cycle. <br><br>But I could very easily see him playing the part of Marius: a wealthy, charismatic demagogue who rises to power by tapping into the seething anger and frustration of the internal proletariat and upends the system, thereby setting the stage for the rise of Caesarism.<br><br>I am guessing you have seen some of the stories coming out about Debbie Wasserman Schultz. There have been a lot of stories circulating lately about widespread discontent within the Democratic Party establishment with Schultz. I read one story earlier today saying that at least 12 US Senators are calling for her ouster. There was another story that said that as Chair of the DNC, she has the right to name all 15 members of the Platform Committee. But instead, she agreed to only name four, while offering Clinton the right to name six members and Sanders the right to name five.<br><br>You won't hear DNC officials say it openly, but I get the distinct impression the Democratic establishment is getting very worried. It's starting to dawn on a growing number of Party insiders that if Clinton is the nominee, the Democrats will probably get crushed by Marius, er Trump, in the general election. <br><br>There have been rumors that the Dems might dump Hillary and bring in Joe Biden as a compromise, but honestly, I don't see that as helping. Biden has most of the same liabilities as Hillary: uncharismatic, widely disliked and distrusted, lots of scandals in his background and a prime symbol of everything that is wrong with the senile elite. If it's Hillary or Biden, it will be an epic beatdown by the master of cage match politics. At this point, I think the Democrats only chance of winning is if Sanders is the nominee. Lets see if the Party leaders are smart enough and wise enough to swallow their pride and give him the nod.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c8013829353689250777 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 1:56 PM</a><br><br>

I received my bachelor's in history in 2015 (and a Master's in 2015), and certainly there was absolutely no whiff of the Social Justice stuff that seems to be demolishing America's institutions of higher learning. Certainly there were no safe spaces, or big banners announcing inclusion or some such. There were, of course, student political protests of the the usual (or perhaps used-to-be-usual) kind- Palestine, GMO foods, African drought- but they followed the rules, weren't loud or aggressive, didn't accost passers-by or block traffic. In fact, there was a week set aside for the Palestine protesters, who set up in one of the larger lobbies and had their placards and information booths there for the week. The rest of the year, you didn't see them. <br><br>I hope that I am not deluding myself why I say that I think my experience was something like the old-time University education you described, though it certainly is not thanks to the administrative staff. I was lucky to have several older professors who had been teaching since before Post-Modernism appeared (by older I mean that they were all well into their 80s) and I was very fortunate to have a chance to learn with them before they retired. I am glad to say that I know nothing of Post-Modernist theory, or of any particular theory. I merely learned how to research, how to analyse, how to communicate and how to develop an argument. Pretty useless skills in many departments.<br><br>I know that what I received is not what many of my friends received. The courses that were the best- that is, the ones that challenged me and forced me to do a lot of work, but that I was always looking forward to the next class- were the ones with very small enrolments. The classes that had large enrolments were either easy and airy or boring slogs that did not deviate from the textbook. <br><br>The good courses were the ones taught by the older professors, who taught us to think rather than to apply theory. In all fairness tot he younger professors, I should perhaps change that to 'the best courses'-none of my professors seemed to be too worried about applying the grid of theory to any part of the past, but the elders seemed best at teaching. One nice deviation was a young German professor of the classics- in his course I read both Herodotus and Thucydides, so their use is teaching is not dead yet!<br><br>Looking back at it, I feel that the best indicator that my University education was in fact an actual education is that there was an element of risk. Maybe that sounds a little strange, but as high school and university become developmental stages rather than educational options, one begins to worry that these schools are simply shuffling their students through a life stage. You often hear- and I'm glad I never said it, at least not to a professor's face- the litany of "I worked hard on this, therefore I deserve an A". One begins to worry that their professors are simply pushing you through an assembly line and that what you are doing has no particular bearing on your grades. I am happy to say (now, at least- at the time I was distinctly unhappy) that there were several major assignments on which I worked extremely hard and which I failed- sure proof that our papers weren't being rubber stamped. Then again, I did graduate on the honour roll, so clearly I didn't have much trouble getting my grades back up, but still, I never felt complacent. At any rate I certainly never complained that my extra circulars took precedence over my education.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c7558043481125237939 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 2:21 PM</a><br><br>

Massachusetts in 1850 was estimated to have a 98% literacy rate, and you could probably find similar rates for most of what is now the USA – far higher than the USA’s literacy today.<br><br>2. At the same time, people took for granted that college was not for most people. Clarence Hall Robison’s “Agricultural Instruction in the Public Schools of the United States,” published in 1911, wrote that public schools “have a duty to the majority of its students who will not go to college.” They didn’t mean that students would miss out on college because they were poor – although there was some of that – but that most would become normal farmers, printers, builders, carpenters, and so on. Being a professor isn’t everyone’s speciality in life, and they knew that. <br><br>3. College sports involved students showing up to support their fellow students, not millions going into a money-making machine of television contracts, bidding, scholarships and sponsorships. Look at a picture of fans at a sports game circa, say, 1950, and you’ll see no screaming or painted faces, no obese people, no beer-cap cans – just rows of healthy-looking teenagers in suits and ties. It was a social, formal event, and people dressed up for the occasion. <br><br>4. Most students took courses to specialise in their field, but then, in their final year, took a “capstone” course, taught by the dean or some venerated professor, to tie together everything they had learned. The idea was to bring the disparate strands of education together into a common cause, as they would all be members of the same society. <br><br>5. By the time I got to college in the 1990s, of course, some courses existed solely to teach grade-school-level remedial reading, and the fashion was for literature and film teachers to ignore things like plot and characters and focus instead on the lurid sexual subtext they imagined to be there. It was all very postmodern and useless.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c4903658386547945123 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 2:26 PM</a><br><br>

Another 30 year repeat, or at least a cousin of it are the scams and products the internet advertises. Looking at magazines from the '50s, catalogues from the '20s and newspapers from the turn of the century one notices some rather, well, familiar concepts. Instant/ Easy this, no pain that, ancient secrets now affordably revealed, etc. Internet popups have less text than those old ad spreads, but the message is the same, and the product, if not identical, is at least recognizable. One rather wonders if X-ray and ultraviolet emitters will make it back into the health regime anytime soon. They went out in the '30s, so the times ripe for a repeat. <br><br>Also, as someone who knows a lot of pilots and who flys model aircraft, the most important criticism I can level against the flying car is not design problems- it's user problems. Most people seem to be barely able to handle navigation in two dimensions, and these pie-in-the-sky futurists want to add a third dimension to that?

I'll stretch the definition of fiction to include myth and legend. <br><br>Shane, nah, you're letting your Boomerphobia run away with you. The generation responsible for the educational "reforms" of the 1960s was the previous generation, which produced the radical young professors who spearheaded those changes. The Boomers in this case were simply cluelessly cheering along. <br><br>With regard to your second question, not quite. As I've noted in the past, my take is that America in particular, and industrial civilization in general, took a catastrophic wrong turn in the 1980s, and a huge amount of what's problematic in today's world has unfolded from that wrong turn. The issues I'm discussing here helped pave the way for that wrong turn -- like most tremendous historical mistakes, this one is well rooted in our culture's past -- and so needs to be addressed in the course of sorting out where to go from here. Not everything that's happened since 1980 has been a disaster -- there are definitely things worth saving -- but there's a lot of rooting up to be done.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c2870478331022330272 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 5:15 PM</a><br><br>

This lesson's assignment is fiction, for reasons we'll get to as we proceed. By all means, though, enjoy Mencken -- some of the liveliest prose this continent has ever produced. <br><br>Fudoshindotcom, pick an ideology, any ideology, and if you take it far enough it'll end in absurdity, followed by mass death. The modern faith in progress looks as though it's going to follow out that rule right to the end...<br><br>Synthase, do you by any chance practice meditation? Getting rid of irrelevant thoughts is a standard meditative skill. If not, find a book that sets off the critical-theory chatter, and when something pops up from that source, return your attention to the words you're reading. Try different ways of shoving aside the intrusion -- I have a friend who imagines King Arthur from <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i> whacking the anarcho-syndicalist peasant and shouting "Shut up! Shut up!" -- but keep on going back to what you're reading, and refocusing there. Don't engage the thoughts -- push them aside and go back to what you were doing.

You might consider getting some beginning-reader books in German, and using them as supplements for your own learning -- that's a trick a lot of people find helpful -- and if your child decides that one of them is the book that gets to be read at bedtime every single night for two and a half years, I promise you every bit of German vocabulary and grammar in that book will be yours forever. ;-)<br><br>Aunteater, good question. There's certainly much to be gained by learning at least one radically different language!<br><br>David, fair enough. Now go deeper -- instead of simply identifying the sort of tropes that current critical theory likes to discuss, find other ways in which Collins' vision of the world differs from yours. <br><br>Tidlösa, heh heh heh. Neoplatonism's great for that, because it's so eminently logical and reasonable, and explains why the material world follows material laws and the other modes of being intersect with them in the way that, ahem, fits human experience. I have no idea how Siris would react to theurgy, but probably not very well -- Iamblichean theurgic Neoplatonism was the last and most serious rival Christianity faced in its struggle for dominion over the Roman world, and Christians still get acutely uncomfortable when faced with it. <br><br>As for my three best books, those would be <i>Inside a Magical Lodge</i>, <i>A World Full of Gods</i>, and <i>After Progress</i>. All three of 'em were frankly too far from the conventional wisdom to get an audience, but if any of my books are remembered a couple of centuries from now, it'll be these.<br><br>Latefall, interesting, but not really something I want to focus on right now, due to the funding issues -- I'm interested in "where you are, with what you have, right now" options. <br><br>Mark, translations certainly qualify, if you don't happen to know the original language.<br><br>Dan, stick to your guns. Eighteen years from now the academic industry will have collapsed of its own weight, and your child will be much better off without it. <br><br>Martin, good. That's certainly something to notice. <br><br>Vashti, I never said there was anything mystical about it -- just that different language structures imply somewhat different ways of thinking about the world. All the modern Celtic languages, if I understand correctly, share that habit of using the verb "to be" to frame sentences that would be transitive in English, and it's worth noting that Celtic literature, poetry, and philosophical thought tends to apply cause and effect relationships much less often than English-speaking equivalents do -- for example, there are only two Western philosophers who've denied the reality of sequential time, and both of them were Celts (John Scotus Erigena and George Berkeley). Different habits of speaking result in different habits of thinking; the differences are subtle, but I'd argue that they're there. <br><br>Barrymelius, a real education is always a matter of guiding and enhancing the student's own efforts to learn. I also learnt most of what I know from my own studies, but now and then I've had somebody more experienced to help me aim my studies more effectively and challenge me to think through the consequences more deeply, and the resulting education was better than it would have been if I'd been out there entirely on my own.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c4823147247594865817 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 6:51 PM</a><br><br>

Like the Victorians, we're deeply offended by certain things that didn't use to upset people, and we insist on getting rid of the offending item, by banning books, producing bowdlerized versions, etc., so that people don't have to experience the offending whatever-it-is. Note how well that worked; the Victorian era was followed by a convulsive reaffirmation of sexuality. Will our era be followed by a convulsive reaffirmation of racial and gender divisions? <br><br>Patricia, all valid points. <br><br>William, I read <i>A Hero of Our Time</i> in the original in third year high school Russian, and it was a heck of a story, so my vote would be for that!<br><br>Mister R., hmm! That makes a great deal of sense. <br><br>Tomuru, no argument there. You can start with ecology as a core and branch out into other sciences from there, and end up with a very good general view of things; the problem is that if you do that, you stop supporting the status quo -- and that's why that approach to the natural sciences got dropped like a hot rock thirty years ago. <br><br>Peter VE, I'm planning a post on what you've called "tribalism." It's going to go in directions you may find uncomfortable. <br><br>Eric, you definitely got lucky! I certainly understand that a lot of people find film interesting, and I'm all in favor of them watching films, studying them, discussing them, etc. My lack of interest in visual media is something like tone deafness, really; it simply doesn't communicate to me what it apparently communicates to a lot of others. <br><br>Gavin, I should have known that XKCD would have something funny to say about that!<br><br>Over the Hill, fascinating. I wasn't aware of that. <br><br>Jake, sure. Finish that one and read another that qualifies, too!<br><br>Steve, either one will do. <br><br>Mike, interesting. I hadn't gotten the impression that the protest activities were primarily on the part of students of color, but I'm prepared to be wrong. <br><br>Hiero, yes, that's underlying this analysis. I'm quite aware that many professors in the humanities have no clue what they're there for -- Postmodernists had to come from somewhere, after all! <br><br>Atilio, Steiner's quite correct -- the mind reflects the past so we have something we can use to make sense of the present. More on this two weeks from now!<br><br>Sven, yes, I'd noticed the same thing -- and yes, this is the opening salvo of a series on education. It should be quite a ride. <br><br>Nastarana, yeah, the school districts I attended were early adopters of "social studies," and I found them a total waste. I found books on history at the library to feed the hunger they didn't touch.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c5722839033151519660 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 7:22 PM</a><br><br>

Both postmodernism and critical theory started out with valid questions; down the road we'll talk about how they turned into ways to erase the past, and metastasized into forces destructive of learning. <br><br>Multi-Mode, yes, the backlash against the failed system of education in the US is beginning to build steam. That's one of the reasons I decided that this topic is a timely one. <br><br>Edde, the School of Hard Knocks is always a valid source for a diploma!<br><br>Janet, I've seen the same thing among some Christian homeschoolers -- they aren't upset about a vacuous education, they just want to choose the vacuities!

On the subject of education, we home schooled the boys in Oregon after issues with the local school. At home, the boys were not really taught in a class room setting, but let loose. After some attempts to use store bought manuals and “What Your Fifth Grader Needs to Know” books, the boys took off on their own.<br><br>One ended up developing software for a Swedish company he found on-line that needed environments written in code for games. They sent him all the software and he wrote the code. I only discover this when he showed me the cool warehouse he built with rain, sun and lighting switched on and off with a button. After that he went into building computer hardware and fussing with electronics as a hobby.<br><br>Our younger boy set up the internet, using microwave antennas, with a friend from his house, a block away utilizing their high speed web connection used for business. They wired up our house, at a time when I was satisfied with dial-up.<br><br>Oregon has very liberal homeschooling rules and we were not under any programs or curriculum requirements. They both tested high in the state required test given by a private Christian homeschooling group. We were decidedly non-religious. Looking back, I realize I was lax and we needed firmer control and a more disciplined program. We had books around the house which the older one read for pleasure. But generally it was chaos.<br><br>On weekends the boys and I went to the local game store for Dungeons and Dragons, 3.0 sessions lasting many hours. We also met people who opened their house to Saturday night gaming and some sessions lasted into the morning hours. The boys memorized countless books and charted numerous D&amp;D characters. Both became rules lawyers and the other adult players and our strict GM were amazed at their tenacity for such a young age. Socially both boys were engaging and communicated at an adult level. We still role play twice a week.<br><br>Once we moved north to Washington State they went back into the school system. The programs here allowed them to move to Community College, while still young and get associate degrees at state expense. Now the older one is finishing college after some military and the younger one needs a job. <br><br>Looking at my own education, long ago, (1949 to 1969) I know that I never really tried or applied myself. I was lax and unfocused. I had no self disciplined or to-do list of goals. In high school I got “C's.” Instead of learning I puttered and wandered. If I snowed, I announced I was sledging and I returned home, whenever. Sometimes it was the next day. Calling home was never required. I roamed and had adventures and near death experiences. No one was the wiser and there was no police reports to contest.<br><br>My summers were spent on long bicycle rides and hiking in the mountains. Freedom can be taken for granted, but does not always educate by itself alone. The main quality I gained was self-limiting caution. I developed sturdy antennas for danger and “not-rightness” which I continue to use today. I did not step into direct challenges, but learned to sidestepped danger and conflict.<br><br>I had an unsupervised childhood, but that made me inner directed and self guided. My brother focused on languages, where I failed (Latin) and he now speaks several languages easily. We both focused in college and earned degrees we never used professionally. I confess I am still learning or trying to learn how to learn.<br><br>When I grow up, I intend to be smarter, better and more youthful. Until then I grow shorter, grayer and sleepier.<br><br>There are tens of thousands of books to read, absorb and digest. A thousand lives would not suffice for all the learning that could be taken in. I diminish with age and I am amazed by all I thought I knew, but only faked to fool myself.<br><br>For the kids today, the system is failing them at all levels. We are in a collapsing empire, where self education may be a blessing or a curse.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c3115182318501968522 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 7:52 PM</a><br><br>

Though all of your work is truly great, I really think that After Progress is your best non-fiction book thus far (I haven't read A World Full of God's yet but look forward to getting a copy soon.) For me, it was the best treatise I have ever read that laid bare the myth of progress, the defining zeitgeist of our time. I have been chomping at the bit to read it again, but I told myself I wouldn't start until I have finished Spengler's The Decline of the West.

Anyway, about that favorite teacher, he's leading the class trying to talk about a super sexy scene early in the book, Shamhat's taming of Enkidu, and one student is not having it. This guy is going off about how inappropriate and offensive it is. Professor tries to describe what we know about the sexual norms of Ur, that much which we find offensive simply isn't part of their story. The Student ain't having it.

It's been many years since I read him, and I probably read most of his novels, so won't be doing so this time, but I do recall some of the sense of his time I got reading him and other works such as the <i>Hornblower</i> books. One was the pace of action in the narratives. There was just this natural, for them, sense that things take time, and that it's OK, and worth laboriously and fully describing, that sequences of action take time to fully account for. And it leaves one with a very different appreciation of the continuity of the story when fully played out. Jack London, in <i>Sea Wolf</i> is another example off the top of my head.

Thank you for gracing us with your pick-me-ups on Thursday and Friday. By Sunday evening, I am in the doldrums, wading through Monday and Tuesday as if through sticky molasses. I often cannot make much sense of what is going out "out there," and you elucidate things.<br><br>HEDGE SCHOOLS, MEDITATION, AND ESSAY WRITING<br><br>Hedge schools of 1700s and 1800s Ireland are a good example of how supplement kids' educations got performed in olden days, although in those days the schools seemed to have been for boys only. NEW hedge schools would be for girls and boys. "Hedge" refers to outdoors but were held mostly in houses or barns. I think this is the way childrens' educations are heading. Just because formal education will collapse doesn't mean that kids don't get educations.<br><br>Essays. I graduated high school in 1970 but have found that I never learned (1) how to write an essay. There is hardly any help for people, speaking from my age of 63, who want to re-learn the basics of writing. Over two years, I kept asking "What don't I know?" discovering that sentences are what I need to learn. Sentences are the backbone of English, so I have been partaking of the book "It Was the Best of Sentences, It Was the Worse of Sentences" by June Casagrande. My second step is to learn (2) how to write research papers. I am having to cobble together my own courses because there is very little offered online. I was shocked that courses are offered in almost every OTHER subjects except fundamental English writing for English-speakers. If a person is English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL), there are zillions of programs getting lots of funding but oddly, nearly nothing for English-speakers (WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD). Now is not the time to speak on the vast disparity of resources going to non-English speakers (foreigners) vs. English-speakers (natives) in the U.S.<br><br>When you mentioned knowing two or more languages, I am lucky if I can manipulate the ONE language I am familiar with: English. I have a sense of how limiting the one language is, but it is "all I got," so to speak.<br><br>There is a big difference between people practicing senility and people practicing what could be mistaken for senility: sitting meditation. There is nothing inherently wrong with staring into space. What is important is what you do with staring—what you do with space—and what you do when perceiving both. When I stare into space, I often perceive infinity or nothingness, which panics the general populace, and staring into space (or staring at the back of my eyelids) helps keep my mind sharp. But then again, I have a decade of training in meditation behind me. I do not need to be entertained — I just "close the eyes." Anything of Buddhist meditation will do. I feel sorry for saps who stare into space but are unable to take advantage of the terrific view ("nothing"). Meditation is a way to get beyond language. Meditation and writing are a good one-two punch.<br><br>(continued)<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c4907069765873290689 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 10:51 PM</a><br><br>

Never too late.<br><br>In a way, I am attending my own elder version of "hedge school."<br><br>Education in the U.S. has not collapsed completely yet, although when I was in school, it was downright dreadful (upstate New York). Hedge schools for kids are not in vogue yet, but I am convinced hedge schools will happen. I am surprised that I hear nothing about hedge schools popping up in the U.S. In Wiki, it says hedge schools were taught in Ireland during the 1700s and 1800s, teaching English and Irish; and the "three Rs" (reading, writing, and 'rithmetic-arithmetic). Some hedge schools taught Irish bardic tradition, Latin, history, home economics. Parents made hedge schools exist.

Man leaves a record; but how much better is he than the apes if he does not study it and heed its warning?”<br><br>@Brian Kaller - RE: the literacy rate in Massachusetts in the 1850s. One of the main points in Neil Postman’s <i>Amusing Ourselves to Death</i> is that America, even during the 18th century, was a very literate place, perhaps the most literate society in human history up to that point. He develops this argument as a means of showing how far we've fallen in political discourse, e.g., the Lincoln-Douglas debates (intended for, and heard by, everyday folk) vs. modern political "debates," which are vapid and dominated by soundbites and handwavy arguments. And our forefathers achieved this widespread literacy and general learnedness using far fewer resources than the modern education system.

Your comment re my tendency to pass judgment triggered a provocative and frustrating internal conversation this morning and this is an attempt to capture the core of that train(wreck) of thought.<br><br>I began by thinking something along the lines of “Of course I judge – if we aren’t analyzing and assessing, then we aren’t existing – cogito ergo sum.” Then I wandered into a familiar conversation re the existence/non-existence of an absolute truth, an absolute reality by which all things can be properly assessed. The fear that I have in allowing that such a thing does not exist is the loss of any frame of reference – the image of tumbling blindly through a black void is what always comes to mind. So I cling to this idea of an absolute reality, which I would correlate to a classical monotheistic deity, though not necessarily sentient (I am reading your “A World Full of Gods” at present and yes, it is provoking many of these same issues).<br><br>Next, I thought of your previous post on Burkean Conservatism and the whole empirical approach, as opposed to that of the idealist. Accepting the premise, for the sake of argument, that the ideal of an absolute reality is merely a projection/abstraction of my desire to “solve” the messiness of the myriad subjectivity of existence by invoking a realm of perfection (so to speak), I then fall into a fit of philosophical despair because that would mean that there is no escape, that I am “trapped” in this imperfect, messy reality. (Yes, this is the remnant of the gnostic disdain for material existence that lingers on in my thought. Still working on purging that.)<br> <br>How can I adopt a framework for assessing my environment knowing that it is not at least an approximation of the “true” framework? (Understanding that even if a “true” framework existed, I could only approach it asymptotically.) But if radically different perspectives are all valid, then the perspectives themselves can have no objective meaning. And if there is no objective meaning, then I am back to tumbling through the void again.

(I was not aware this was the origin of the reference to a wife as "She who must be obeyed" in various British sitcoms on BBC.) I chose this book because thought I don't read a lot of nonfiction, but one series I enjoy and have every volume is Elizabeth Peter's Amelia Peabody mysteries (set in the late 1800s and early 1900s Egypt). Frequently, the characters disparaged their adventures as being "something from a Haggard novel" and insinuating Haggard as being an author no person of good breeding and intelligence would read.<br><br>Though I enjoyed the story of Cleopatra as he wrote it, it did have some very obvious biases and glaring stereotypes. (The plot twists really aren't so awful as some I have seen in movies today, though.) I am pondering as I start "She" which of my criticisms are valid and which are just mental fluff derived from the post-modern POV, what can be attributed to differences in wealthy class Victorian Culture vs Modern American Culture and what is just Haggard imagining what Eqyptian Culture might have been like under Greek influence...<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c7476293362478188932 title="comment permalink">5/27/16, 11:07 AM</a><br><br>

I'm reading "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas" (1870) by Jules Verne. This particular edition published in 1922. Am reading it because it qualifies (fiction, book length, before 1900) and easily found (Hubby collects everything, including old books). Having skimmed through the book, my assumptions about attitudes and knowledge about that particular era have been challenged. For example. <br><br>[ “The Nautilus has run aground?” <br> “Yes.” <br> “And this accident came about . . . ?” <br> “Through nature’s unpredictability not man’s incapacity. No errors were committed in our maneuvers. Nevertheless, we can’t prevent a loss of balance from taking its toll. One may defy human laws, but no one can withstand the laws of nature.” ]<br><br>and this:<br><br> [ During the course of the next day, April 12, the Nautilus drew near the coast of Dutch Guiana, by the mouth of the Maroni River. There several groups of sea cows were living in family units. These were manatees, which belong to the order Sirenia, like the dugong and Steller’s sea cow. Harmless and unaggressive, these fine animals were six to seven meters long and must have weighed at least 4,000 kilograms each. I told Ned Land and Conseil that farseeing nature had given these mammals a major role to play. In essence, manatees, like seals, are designed to graze the underwater prairies, destroying the clusters of weeds that obstruct the mouths of tropical rivers. <br> “And do you know,” I added, “what happened since man has almost completely wiped out these beneficial races? Rotting weeds have poisoned the air, and this poisoned air causes the yellow fever that devastates these wonderful countries. This toxic vegetation has increased beneath the seas of the Torrid Zone, so the disease spreads unchecked from the mouth of the Rio de la Plata to Florida!” <br> And if Professor Toussenel is correct, this plague is nothing compared to the scourge that will strike our descendants once the seas are depopulated of whales and seals. By then, crowded with jellyfish, squid, and other devilfish, the oceans will have become huge centers of infection, because their waves will no longer possess “these huge stomachs that God has entrusted with scouring the surface of the sea.” ]<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c5514783895679757513 title="comment permalink">5/27/16, 3:51 PM</a><br><br>

What exactly from that difference should we be taking home? Because <i>that's</i> the problem with kids today! They're totally hell-bent on understanding the difference between them and their fellow students, but they believe that what really matters most is accurately grasping the power imbalances concealed in language. They don't look for anything like what I consider a healthy culture looks for in its language: like love in the Christian world, worship in the Islamic world, the Way in the Confucian world, etc. As a result, they actually start to fear difference of opinion, which leads to situations like the Oberlin article posted in the comments above, where the students started quietly re-segregating themselves based on race.<br><br>Books can give you some hints of what life is all about. I like your Tale of Genji suggestion, as that book opened up a whole world for me. But for example, when Robert grumbles that having to read about different culture is "elitist and demanding", maybe he all he really wants to do is plant potatoes in his Appalachian victory garden and wait for the coming crash? And indeed, even assuming he has some kids, what do they need to know about the world of the past other than the huge mistakes of technological civilization? Isn't a little senility a pleasant thing during the fall?<br><br>I guess that's a whole post's worth of question. I wonder if your sequels to this post will frame the preservation of knowledge in terms of the Second Religiousness -- and indeed, it's kind of interesting that <i>A World Full of Gods</i> kept popping up over and over in the comments even though it's not the subject of the post.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c4993145158208689710 title="comment permalink">5/27/16, 7:33 PM</a><br><br>

On the other side due to the sort of censorship I observe going along with it.<br><br>First about the thinking habit; While in Merriam-Webster's Learner's Dictionary there is a simple definition of bowdlerize by: “to change (a book, play, movie, etc.) by removing parts that could offend people”. This seems to me the idea, you JMG had in mind, while you use the expression. However, when I use the German Langenscheid dictionary it says it differently. Here bowdlerization is a: “Reinigung von anstößig erscheinenden Stellen“. This has both, a greatly valuating and a noticeable ancient tone. In English I read it as “purification of indecent or even offensive parts”. So while Webster keeps it more matter of fact, in German it is valued as morally inappropriate. In addition in German the ancient tone sounds like a phrase from the second empire. Quite a different perspective on things!<br><br>Second, by searching in the internet about it, I find no Wikipedia record. Only old conservative dictionary or independent small ones. So in Wikipedia there is a censorship about one aspect of censorship. That is especially relevant for Wikipedia. Which is the greatest definer of words in the world. Here they do not even mention the twisting, eradication or reformulating of words at all. And I got to know, that bowdlerization is a frequently and fervently used method of Wikipedia. And the only way there it is addressed is by silence.<br><br>Quite interestingly! Makes your point of how things are considered or being censored quite vividly for me.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c4345446481480032186 title="comment permalink">5/27/16, 9:25 PM</a><br><br>

They were pointing out plants and flowers in old paintings, hundreds of years old, 'notice all the flowers are in bloom, but actually they bloom at different times, they drew perfectly from memmory. All these plants have symbolic religious signifivcance from tradition, bible, etc. which everryone would have understood as shorthand.'<br><br>This is craftsmanship. Cmpetition therefore must have been fierce. What is left in museum is tip of iceberg. Industrially I have learned that a nail maker in a regional german town kept up an incredible pace, doing several operations quickly and making jhundreds of nails in an incrdibly short time. Again competition in the towns and between the regions was fierce. No slackers. To compare from nowadays. I have noticed and it has been well noted elsewhere that local turkish immigrants in germany are not so good at academics.on the other hand at work their speed and natural ability plus social capacity I observe excels mine and many others. One colleague said ' go down a side street anywhere in Istanbul and in a half hour you have identical haircut of the latest hollywood stars or runway models, much better, quicker than in Germany'. <br><br>Get rid of machines, computers and I think our caacities as human beings will revive enormously. Modern alienation. I go to tourist destination anywhere in Europe and pay a hotel. My African colleague pays only transport, has extended family from his village across Europe, USA, canada, carribean, home country in Africa and slleeps on couch. There are lots of social and physical organs which are atrophied in modern people.Critical thinking in logic is one, physical agility and craftsmnship a second, social conviviality a third. Spirituality is dying on the vine altogether.<br><br>I believe I can count mysel lucky to have switched from a desk job with a few contacts to whom I rarely spoke for 15 years to a rapidly moving physical activity with dozens of contacts. The stimulation of whole human capacity reachesmuch more towards limits in every sense.<br><br>I recall a story about coyotes in suburbs out west.

I must say I did laugh out loud about the whole 'Inquisition' approach to learning, as it's too true. Doesn't matter how great the mind was, I'm sure I've slain it and promptly proven that post-modern thought is far superior, courtesy of my teachers. Out of interest, was that a normal behaviour too, say, 400 years ago? I would imagine it's a largely modern habit, as we wear such a badge of honour and superiority these days. <br><br>Just as I was reading the paragraph about sentence structure in English, I was thinking about the example yn Gymraeg, 'Mae'r dŷn moyn gofin rhyw beth i ti' - a sentence that has tortured me ever since I was introduced it via my Welsh learning tapes a couple of weeks ago! Or the other example which I find, philosophically speaking, very interesting is 'Mae ci gyda fi' - it is the dog with me - nowhere near as possessive as 'my dog' - I'm sure a first language Welsh speaker might shake their head, but surely, that is exactly how it would be thought of in Welsh, even if it is a 'clunky' translation into English, it's surely more accurate? I know very little about linguistics, so I can't really comment further. But surely that affects your thinking? It has to? The idea of the dog being with me, not being mine, is very different, and would elicit a different relationship in my mind. I'm currently learning all the different Welsh words for the environment too, and they're far richer than their modern English equivalents, to the point where there are things you can't adequately express in English, but can in Welsh. <br><br>I can speak a bit of Spanish too, and again there you find you have to express yourself differently. Chatting with some Spanish friends, and we were discussing how there seems to be less exact words in Spanish, like you find in English. As a result in Spanish you have to be more descriptive, and use more metaphorical thinking. Whereas in English you can be more exact and specific. Perhaps lending English better to science or philosophy and Spanish to story telling? That was the conclusion we came to anyway!<br><br>I'm reminded that in Quechua they don't have a past or future tense, nor really a concept of time and space, in the way that we do at least. So the classic story goes that if you ask someone, in Spanish even, who is a native Quechua speaker, everything is 15 minutes away. Now they must have a sense of history and tradition, but my thoughts on this, though I haven't been able to discuss this with anyone, say from Bolivia, is that their version of history and tradition, must be much more living or present. Not some thing that happened aeons ago, but something that is with them. I suppose to say, their ancestors are living with them, not dead in the past? Once again, the language must have a tremendous effect on the way people think.<br><br>And finally, my experience has been that as a result of my much more extensive reading of the last 18 months, I am now able to think far more clearly, and eloquently myself. Whole concepts, and ways of thinking have been opened up to me just by expanding my vocabulary. Basically, I'm reading more complicated stuff than I used to, and accordingly my own mind is developing. Contrast that to the drivel that comes out of popular culture, and well, it's no wonder that we have this negative spiral. If the old saying of 'grass grows grass' is right, then well, 'drivel grows drivel' is probably equally so.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c7368159220312556253 title="comment permalink">5/28/16, 1:58 AM</a><br><br>

I'm currently reading a book written about farming in rural England in the early to mid 20th century, and it's fascinating and has introduced to me a few very useful ideas which I will employ, and it's fascinating to see how things were done then, and perhaps will be done in the not so distant future. So in other words, I'm reading the future! Now of course, I don't think we're literally just stepping back in time, and some of today's thinking, and tools, will make it through into the future. But it's very useful to see how you run a farm with little in the way of fossil fuels. Equally so, it's interesting to read about how synthetic fertilisers came into use, and to learn what people thought of them in the beginning. The chancers jumping at them as a way to improve yields and make more money, and the old-timers of the day being cautious and distrusting. Now I could easily judge the 'chancers' and say how could they do such a thing! But then that would be the post-modernist way of thinking would it not? Or instead I could see that I may well have done the same thing, if faced with declining yields, and a need to provide for my family. Far more useful to put myself in the mindset of the 'progressive' farmers of the day, as they were thought of, and learn, than to judge. I'm sure I'mm doing things myself that people could look back on and think 'what was he thinking of?!'<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c8381067278808026318 title="comment permalink">5/28/16, 2:07 AM</a><br><br>

I took it all with good grace though. The person who made the gain at my expense was stupid enough to insult me to my face too. The funny thing was that they clearly felt that my display of good grace was a character weakness. That was also despite the fact that I had been helping them for several hours. It was a pleasure when they discovered that despite my good grace has limits and I do actually have teeth and am prepared to use them at short notice to good effect when circumstances dictate. Lesson learned for them.<br><br>Anyway, I've had to work doubly hard this week and have been somewhat out of sorts. That's life.

I even managed to top one subject and received a prize for that achievement. However, what I actually learned during that time was to answer the questions that were asked and to pre-empt the questions on the exams. I got pretty good at that, I see patterns and stories everywhere as that is how the world looks to me. But I'm honestly unsure that it prepared me in any way, shape, or form for the real world outside of academia. It was honestly a bit of a let-down and it appears to also be a barrier to trade because it is a requirement in my profession, where it used to once be an apprenticeship. And it cost a lot of wealth and time as I studied at night part time after a full day’s work. I don't like that system at all, it just seems so wrong to me.<br><br>And the focus on recent books for the assigned study work and exams appeared to me to be a crass grab for cash by the lecturers who had often written - or co-authored - those assigned books. And I questioned the need for new editions every year.<br><br>I'll try and get through Sun Tzu's text, The Art of War. I could share some insights into that mind for sure and they sure do jar with today's thinking and belief systems. Incidentally, I use Sun Tzu's many strategies in my day to day life.

Just thought I’d mention that…<br><br>I haven't mentioned it to you before, but get this: I saw an advertisement which appeared to be masquerading as an article in the newspaper spruiking: Unlisted bonds for those times when interest rates and dividends are falling!!!! Nooooooo. I couldn't believe it as the bond market is not for the small time investor. And the really weird thing is I know of a few people that now have: Interest only mortgages on their house..... That means they have no intention of ever paying back the loan and the banks love it because they receive what they want the most, which is a drip feed of cash returns from suckers in return for something that seems to have been substantially devalued over the past few decades... Not that anyone seems to notice. Those two indicators are some of the worst things that I have come across recently in the world of economics. It is going to be a real mess when the dust settles. Oh yeah, I won't even mention the financial apps that are being marketed to Gen X and Gen Y people.

So I dug out Gareth King's <i>Modern Welsh: A Comprehensive Grammar</i> (Routledge, 1993), and what he describes here makes perfect sense but was completely new to me. (Thanks, MawKernewek, for prompting me to look this up!) What MawKernewek describes in his comment is what King names the Collective/Unit (C/U) system, and he contrasts it with the Singular/Plural system that is also found in Welsh as well as in English and most other European languages. But English, Spanish, French, German, etc., ONLY have the Sing./Pl. system; only Welsh, apparently Cornish, and perhaps other Celtic languages, also have the C/U system.<br><br>King describes the Collective/Unit system on pp. 48-49 and pp. 67-69. In the regular Sing./Pl. system, the basic unit of the noun is singular; the plural form is derived from the singular form. In English, we have, to use King's examples, cat (singular) and cats (plural) and book/books. The same basic formation is found in Welsh: <i>cath/cathod</i>; <i>llyfr/llyfrau</i>. In the C/U system, however, which primarily comprises nouns that name living things, the basic form of the noun is a <i>collective</i>: <i>plant</i> (children); <i>moch</i> (pigs, swine). It's important to note that these nouns are conceiving what they name in a collective manner--another way in which speakers of Welsh will be viewing the world differently than English speakers. To speak of a single child or pig, then, a "unit" form is derived from the collective form: <i>plentyn, mochyn</i>. <i>Coed</i> (which can be translated as either trees or wood) is another example. So an individual tree is <i>coeden</i>. (The names of particular species of trees also follow the C/U formulation as well: <i>bedw/bedwen</i> [birch/a particular birch-tree]; <i>derw/derwen</i> [oak/a particular oak-tree]). There are many, many other examples.<br><br>And by the way, here is what King writes about the use of third person plural <i>maen</i>: "It is a fundamental rule with verbs in Welsh that 3rd pers. pl. forms are only used where the corresponding pronoun <b><i>nhw</i></b> <i>they</i> is explicitly stated. In all other cases where the subject is 3rd pers. pl., the 3rd pers. sing. form must be used" (p. 137).<br><br>Finally, if one does a Google search for "how language shapes thought," one will find many useful articles and videos.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c1049552295277183053 title="comment permalink">5/28/16, 4:00 AM</a><br><br>

Noam Chomsky once said of it, "That's not even false." Basically, the "texts" of Critical Theory really just intend to intimidate newbies, undergraduates, or people of other fields into feeling like they can't understand the long strings of "big words" (or, let's call it what it is: made up words the author invented that have no real meaning) and feel therefore that they just must not be smart enough to understand whatever it is that writer is talking about. This perception works well enough from the outside, which is why year after year old barnacles from the Theory Bubble somehow continue to keep their tenure lines to host seminars on this PseudoScience which is at least as shameful, or probably more so, than if they were to keep hosting courses for or directing university funds to courses on Alchemy or Phrenology. <br><br>That's how it looks from the outside. However, my own perception from spending time dealing with it from the inside is that from there it is a very fragile, silly, and small field with very few real arguments and promoted by professors who all too often realize how much they are "bluffing." Especially when one compares it to a real, respectable Science, the silliness and smallness of this as a field become even more apparent. <br><br>However, a competition between real science and Critical Theory is something of an irrelevancy now, considering that that feud only makes the slightest amount of sense in a world where a bloated and universally-attended college system is the norm. In a post-education bubble collapse future, in which education shrinks down to being a luxury of the super rich, or informally handled by local religious institutions etc., this feud will be completely and utterly meaningless, much as it already is to anyone who is not being forced to "believe" in Critical Theory in order to get an A on their paper next week.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c6954560196572096899 title="comment permalink">5/28/16, 7:02 AM</a><br><br>

I'm steering clear of Wikipedia entries, Cliff Notes or Classics Illustrated Comics. I want to draw my own conclusions. I did discover that it was written during the time of Emperor Claudius / Nero. Just to get the time frame. And, when I was looking up the proper spelling of Satyricon, I noticed that the movie that kind of stuck in my head was by Fellini. Can't remember much about it, except the banquet and a few fumbly bits. Probably saw it during my student / foreign film days. Which was a LONG time ago. <br><br>Someone asked me about the "naughty bits", in the Satyricon. I'd guess that since the Loeb translation was so long ago, there will be quit a bit of Victorian "sensitivity" to those passages. I'd guess it will either have a word or two in the original Latin, or, whole passages. Let's the scholar draw his own conclusion. :-). <br><br>Of course, just about any discussion of Roman freedmen, trots out the fellow who throws the banquet in Satyricon. That he's very gauche and nouveau riche. So, I suppose, class issues will be in play. We'll see. I'll also keep a couple of good, general dictionaries, at hand. Just in case. Sometimes, word meanings have changed, greatly, from Victorian times, to now. Hopefully, won't be as bad as when I read William James, "Varieties of Religious Experience." One hand on the book, one hand on the dictionary. It was a slog, but well worth it.

I can't remember her name but a local educator was complaining about the lack of content in education in the 1950s. She said it can't be all "process", there has to be some "content" for "process" to work on. And by "content" I take to mean facts or IOW, rote learning.<br><br>It seems that by degrees learning things like the fact Dublin is the capitol city of the Republic of Ireland fell into disrepute. I had a boss in the 1990s who was supposed to go Ireland to help open a new subsidiary for our company. And she told me she's terrible with geography. She asked me, is Europe a country (no, I'm not kidding, she really did ask that) and, is Ireland part of the UK? This from a supposedly university educated professional.<br><br>The study of history has been in rough shape for a long time. No sugar coating it. A young relative of mine who recently graduated from university with a business degree and who just passed her CPA exams knows beans about history and she doesn't care. She dismissed the whole field with the assertion that it's the winners that write histories anyway. <br><br>Well, yes they do so she has a point. But so do the losers. In any case there's the history of outright fabrication and there's the inconvenient and embarrassing history with all kinds of omission as a consequence.<br><br>And there's the history of distortion. During the Cold War the history I learned at school made scant mention of the horrific casualties of the Soviets in WW2. We never heard of Kursk. We DID hear that Stalin dithered for a week after the German attack and therefore made the task of repulsing German armies massively more difficult. But nowhere was it written that the USSR accounted for two thirds of German war casualties. In OUR history the war in the East was a sideshow as opposed to the main event that it was. We just couldn't give the Soviets recognition commensurate with what they did. <br><br>The history of WW1 that we learned was all about Britain and the Commonwealth and Canada's outsized deeds never mind that our contribution was small in comparison to the scale of the conflict. What we learned about the French effort was of their bolting during the gas attack at Ypres and how Canadian troops valiantly held the line. So of course we schoolboys were just puffed with pride. OUR country did that. <br><br>But Verdun and its massive butcher's bill got little notice nor the fact that most of the western front was defended by the French army. Nor was there much about the sea of blood shed in the East nor on the Italian-Austrian lines. What we learned was unbalanced to say the least.<br><br>And I would imagine that America's view of WW1 was all about American industrial output and American heroism and can-do-ism along with a hearty helping of scorn for their blundering, dundering allies. And even more so with respect to WW2.<br><br>Having said all that, in my opinion SOME history is a whole lot better than none. Even with rampant dishonesty and nationalistic horn-blowing we did learn the basic shape of the past, who was on whose side and what-not during the 20th century conflagrations.<br><br>I keep hearing that the Japanese do their own fiddling with facts and presentation much to the great annoyance of the Chinese.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c4958622992586961874 title="comment permalink">5/28/16, 11:19 AM</a><br><br>

If not, might I suggest finding a more modern translation? Many older editions of 20,000 leagues used the original seat-of-your-pants translations done to publish English versions of Verne's works right after the French publication. As a result, they cut out much of the actual science and descriptions that Verne used- and often added in scientific errors of their own. Hence the reason why Verne's works were considered fanciful children's books in anglophone countries, while in France he is better remembered as a writer who took rigorous care to include the best scientific knowledge of the day in his fictions. Indeed, in the French text, the Nautilus herself is described so well that several designers have been able to draw up schematics for her, and the design itself has been pronounced as fairly sound. Most English translations have left out Verne's lengthy discussions on how his submarine worked. So don't be surprised when you find some interesting science in the pages of Verne's books. He wanted them to be as real as possible. The only thing in 20,000 leagues that is unreal are the Nautilus batteries, which are far more powerful than any batteries we have today. (Verne, living through the revolutions in electrical storage technology of the 1850s and 1860s clearly thought that this trajectory of improvement could only continue, and thus batteries that could produce thousands of kilowatts for months on end were only around the corner.

The insurance industry really reflects the larger economic tides at play, so I get where they are at.<br><br>Anyway, I've fallen for a rather engaging insurance scam without even realising it. Down here, life insurance is offered as an optional extra in your superannuation funds (that is sort of an equivalent 401K thingee). Obviously it costs you for that insurance which is paid for out of your funds, and clearly as you get older, the policy become more expensive. All of that is very reasonable and fair. I pay the policy because I’m not entirely convinced that the funds will be worth anything when I need them at retirement age, so I might as well get some use now.<br><br>As part of that policy, the insurers also offer a payout for what is known as TPD (Total Permanent Disability) which means that on the off chance that you are knocked over by some unfortunate event and are no longer able to work, that you will receive a payout - if you have that insurance policy.<br><br>However, here is the fun bit. If your policy says somewhere TPD: Any occupation. Then apparently that means that you may personally be lying on your death bed, but with one useful hand and the ability to speak. And the insurer may suggest to you that they won't pay because you could be working as a telephonist. It appears to be a rather engaging scam. I've also been noticing that the insurers are heavily defending claims for defective buildings as well, and there was a recent case down here - that was apparently supported by the legal system - where the owners of an apartment building had to borrow $2.4m (I believe) to replace the roof of their apartment block as the findings where that the insurance would not cover what appeared to be substandard building practices in the building.<br><br>Interesting times.<br><br><a href=http://www.theage.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/super-sector-tussle-looms-over-life-insurance-as-funds-go-it-alone-20160527-gp5ml7.html rel=nofollow>Super sector tussle looms over life insurance as funds go it alone</a><br><br>Yes, the old saying that when you assume something, you can make an ass out of you and me, seems to apply here! ;-)!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c7670682936123532931 title="comment permalink">5/28/16, 5:38 PM</a><br><br>

I would venture to say, it can be recognized as when as a reader, you are 'lost in the world' of the story, and then start to drift into fantasy about time traveling into the book - being a smarty-pants modern person correcting their 'wrong' thinking, winning the medieval war of swords and axes with a surprise machine gun from the future. Then you have to remind yourself - yeah, that can't happen, so: how very different the time, the constraints, the society, etc. Very silly childish fantasies, but I think they occur to a lot of us and is a sign that the reader is experiencing this dichotomy. <br><br>Don Plummer: Oh my goodness!

I can't add much to the train of thought expressed here. I'm rather preferring to stay back, read, digest and learn from others' perspectives. I recognize some of the down sides described here from my own and my kids' education, and don't recognize others of it. Overall, my own education was not so bad and my kids's is really very good. <br><br>I will continue to advise them on the course I think they should take, (College? No college? A gap year or two working abroad? working domestically? trade school? working apprenticeship?) and then they will make up their own minds and do what they want because at that point it's their lives and in their hands. I know they are/will be ready. They are both level-headed and clear-sighted and have thus far gotten a truly exceptional education and a fair upbringing, as good a start as we could do. ((but YIKES! my babies!!))<br><br>On the garden front: I'm giving up for the next (last) month we expect to be here; My little terrace garden is absolutely thriving, greening. growing and budding like crazy in this cool clean mountain climate, but the local monkey troupe has found it and eaten every single little green tomato, pepper bud, even lettuce and carrot-top greens.

Wait until the weekend to comment, and it's standing room only! I wish I could read through all the comments, but I did appreciate the post, JMG. I haven't had any experience with the educational system for a decade or two, but I'll take your word for it. It's obvious from talking to people (and reading online) that no one is reading history. In fact, their idea of "history" is about two decades back! So many seem to think they've thought up all the "new ideas" they post... it's amazing. I've always been a history buff, so I've read enough to see the cycles and the similarity of human nature through the ages. Read some ancient Greek or Roman poetry and see that people have not evolved that much. Yes, the perceptions of the world are often very different, but human nature (what we <i>do</i> with the perceptions)hasn't changed, as far as I can see.

In this essay you have touched a theme very close to my heart! I nearly became a school teacher (back in the ‘80s), but in teacher’s college, I was so horrified by the absolute nonsense that was being peddled as ‘learning how to read’ that I practically ran out of the college screaming!<br><br>Sir, I accuse you of encouraging your readers to become time travelers. A very dangerous proposition! For in sticking one’s nose into old books, odd ideas may enter one’s head! I had the pleasure of earning a degree in time travel (English lit with a heavy dose of humanities). One week I was sailing with Odysseus, another week listening with rapt attention to Cicero’s speeches. Learning to recite Middle English in a way that would make Chaucer proud! Spending entire years at The Globe watching plays of Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe and their contemporaries and learning to think like these great playwrights and the philosophers and occultists who inspired them. And then I spent a couple of decades with the sage-poets of ancient India. Once one can relate to the voices of those who are long dead, the world will never look the same again!<br><br>The end result? I am officially an oddball who finds most modern published material (fiction or non-fiction alike) to be utter rubbish and find most people to possess only one “eye” (being able to relate only to the present). Was the price worth paying? Absolutely!<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c2124742444847658397 title="comment permalink">5/29/16, 5:50 AM</a><br><br>

The sort of thing JMG highights here has been all too common at Brown since at least 1980. Some of it has been facilitated by some of the faculty, but a lot of it has been encouraged by the administration, and especially by almost all of the Deans, who are on the frontline in dealing with unhappy students. One of the most highly placed and influential deans insisted at one memorable faculty meeting that undergraduates were mere children, not even adults in training, and that it was our job as Faculty to protect them at any cost. On another occasion, face-to-face, the same dean told me that keeping students safe was the most important thing, the highest responsibility of all faculty, far more important than educating them. Another, lower-ranked dean pushed very hard at me once to give a student a passing grade for a course she never took, so she would have enough credits to finally graduate after five years on campus. When I remonstrated that at Brown, all grades were officially given by the Corporation on recommendation of faculty, not by faculty at all, so the Corporation could give that student a passing grade on its own authority, I was told that it was part of my job as faculty to be the fall-guy for the corporation in case the shale ever hit the fan. In this case I yielded: the grass that bends before the storm-wind does better than the mighty oak that shatters in the storm. This particular student came from one of the very richest families in the United States, and Brown assiduously cultivates such families no matter what the cost to its integrity. (I have heard, usually from students, of far worse examples of cultivating of the rich, and protecting their children at any cost, than mine was. Two of them were positively hair-raising.) So ... like fish, universities rot from the head on down.<br><br>When I first came to Brown in 1967, it was a small and first-rate undergraduate college with almost no endowment at all, and very few graduate students. Since then, it has become a fair-to-middling research university with a multi-billion dollar endowment through (1) ruthless cultivation of wealthy donors, (2) relentless pursuit of research grants and income from patents owned by the University, and (3) high-level, quite skillful gamesmanship within the global economy and international politics, on the very highest levels of power. It has seemed to me since about 1980 that the University favors those academic fields of teaching and research that (1) appeal to status-seeking wealthy parents of students, (2) generate the most annual revenue from grants and patents, and (3) train undergraduates to become high-level players in politics and economics on an international scale. Other fields are tolerated, especially if they can make the university look good to the general public (theatre arts and dance come to mind), but starved of funds, and there is slow pressure to collapse the smaller departements into larger units with vague academic boundaries.<br><br>(to be continued)<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c3158553785757864754 title="comment permalink">5/29/16, 9:44 AM</a><br><br>

A number of academic departments, including my own, were set up in the early post-war years specifically to give undergraduate men -- Brown was all-male then -- the education they would need as a foundation for the more rigorous training they would later receive in these agencies. I was good friends with a much older professor who had facilitated all this at Brown, and he in turn was a close friend and fishing buddy of James Jesus Angleton, chief of the CIA counterintelligence staff. One of the departments he set up with "spook" money was headed up by a man who had been an operative in the OSS while it was particularly active in China under Bill Donovan. Our offices were adjacent. On one memorable day we had an extended conversation about lock-picking and safe-cracking (an armchair-hobby-interest of mine since my very young years). I was blown out of the water by the depth of his knowledge and techincal expertise. Clearly, he had not been a desk-jockey, but a field operative. The first chairman of Brown's Political Science Department -- another spook-money deaprtment -- came to Brown directly from the CIA. And, as a minor side-note, nearly all of the Watergate burglars and conspirators were post-war Brown alumni, who were undergraduates at the height of the University's entanglement with the CIA. Of course, it depends on one's politics whether this level of entanglement counts as rot or as patrotism. Either way, it began the University's involvement in the processes that led to the rot I was describing above.<br><br>So I quite agree that the higher education system of the United States is going to collapse within a decade or two, precisely because it is dependent on an interational economic order that is going down the tubes. I look forward to seeing what can be (or should be) salvaged from its ruins for use in the coming Dark Ages.

When I finally decided to drop out of college a few months ago (after much stress and waffling), I was struck by the realization that I can learn pretty much whatever I want now, without worrying about major tracks or credit limits or the looming shadow of Student Loan Debt. I’m especially looking forward to a post on learning languages. I would second the recommendation for Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata, by the way--it’s the curriculum my Latin teacher used at UWM, and it’s quite good. <br><br>On a related note, have you heard of St. Martin's Academy of Medieval Arms? They teach Medieval and Renaissance European martial arts, along with a background of the trivium and quadrivium. When I asked the instructor to recommend some reading as a starting place for studying the trivium and quadrivium, he rattled off a list of primary sources--none more recent than Hugh of St. Victor. No shallow attempts to be “modern and relevant” there.

First, Hillary would have to withdraw before the convention, thus freeing up a lot of her delegates to vote for someone else. There are a lot of negative things you can say about her, but quitter is not one of them. If something unanticipated happens and she withdraws and Sanders doesn't, then Sanders gets the nomination - her delegates aren't meekly going to accede to "orders from headquarters" to vote for someone that nobody has heard of. Sanders is unlikely to quit before the convention - he has things he's planning to do there, including rules and planks.<br><br>The rumors about whats-his-name have been flying ever since the nominating process started. <i>Someone</i> likes him, and keeps on pushing rumors that he's a viable candidate.<br><br>(*) I know perfectly well who Joe Biden is. The average American probably doesn't, and name recognition is most of the game. As the old politician said when his apprentice came in waving the paper with another story bashing him, "Son, I don't care what they said about me. Did they spell my name right?"<br><br>@JMG<br><br>I thoroughly agree with your contention that it's useful to immerse yourself in a different way of looking at the world to shake up your own conceptual structure. I used to see this all the time with beginning computer programmers: learning a second language was almost as hard as learning the first one, because the first language gets all mixed up with the operating system and the application domain. The second language means the developer has to tease these apart. It's even better if your second language is from one of the other two major language families. (The reason I don't see it any more is that I'm retired.)<br><br>No linguist I know of today would subscribe to the strong form of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (language shapes thought) that you're using. I know it's popular in education circles and similar, but it's been disproved thoroughly. The intermediate form, however, has examples all over the place.<br><br>Using your example, I don't read it as a cause-effect statement. "The children are playing in the yard" is, to me at least, a simple statement of fact. There is no whiff of why they're playing in the yard. "In the yard" is not an object, it's a location where the activity is occurring.<br><br>It's also not a good example of the point you're trying to make: "are playing" is present tense, progressive aspect, that is, a description of an action that's being viewed as ongoing. Your example needs something a bit more direct, like: "Dad is barbecuing the ribs," which at least has an object and does imply an actor-patient relationship. That's active voice (which your example isn't) and can be translated into the passive as: "The ribs are being barbecued by dad."<br><br>The point here is that, while English has constructions that imply a cause and effect, it has a lot of constructions that don't have this implication - even if writing teachers try to convince their students that they need to use the active voice all the time.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c1693715629352475591 title="comment permalink">5/29/16, 4:11 PM</a><br><br>

The control issues are irrelevant - if you actually had flying cars, you'd have traffic control systems that would keep the carnage to a minimum. Just like there is a lot of safety research going into self-driving cars today.<br><br>@JMG<br><br>A bit out of season, but I recently ran across a reference to Friedrich List, who I had never heard of. He seems to be a pretty famous economist who followed Hamilton and didn't like Adam Smith one bit.<br><br>@Hubertus<br><br>Wikipedia is easy to edit. You might like to read this as a bit of attitude: https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2016/04/20/do-it/ . It'll be interesting to see what happens to it. The place you can get into trouble is putting in unsourced material and not following the "neutral point of view" rule.<br><br>@Alex Blaidd<br><br>Languages are funny things. You mentioned the English genitive (aka the possessive). It simply means an association. The association can be one of legal ownership, but it need not be, which is why calling it the "possessive case" to "simplify" grammar causes a lot of confusion in beginning grammar students. If I say "Mary's room," and Mary is a teenager living with her parents, Mary is not able to put her room up for sale on eBay, much as she might like to on occasion.<br><br>The Wikipedia article on the Quechua language indicates that the verb has four tenses: past, present, future and pluperfect. I'm not sure where the idea comes from that it doesn't have tenses.<br><br>As an interesting side note, English does not have a future tense. Now that a lot of people have picked up their jaws from the floor, I'll explain. There is no verb form in English that indicates the future. To indicate "future" I have to use an auxiliary verb, and to a linguist, that isn't a tense. That's a mood. If I say "I will be going to church," I'm expressing a possibility; the verb "going" is called a non-finite verb, that is, it has no orientation in time. (The -ing suffix means it's a gerund-participle.)<br><br>Chris (Cherokee Organics)<br><br>"Interest only loans" are for people who would prefer to rent, but don't want the hassle of dealing with rental agents, etc. It also gives them the option of selling the property if the price goes up; they own it, not the bank. I've seen it used to good advantage by retired people who have no intention of creating property values to pass to their heirs, if any. Like any financial instrument, it can be used inappropriately, and the fact that financial advisors here in the US aren't under the stricture of "fiduciary duty" to their clients is another major issue.<br><br><br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c2098416577979643955 title="comment permalink">5/29/16, 4:13 PM</a><br><br>

I've read embarrassingly little in the way of Spanish literature, and should fix that. <br><br>Mike, the difference between wage class and salary class isn't the only one that's relevant; my point in bringing it up was to add it to the other, more widely discussed divisions, not to erase the latter! <br><br>234567, we'll be talking at some length about memorization as this series proceeds. <br><br>Myriad, great! So you zoom up to 10,000 feet in ten minutes...and the fuel runs out. I can see very quickly how this will end...<br><br>Foo Bar, Russian also has the advantage of noun declensions, so you have to think about what role each noun plays in a sentence. I found that very good training as a writer -- English tends toward extreme vagueness in its grammar, and corresponding vagueness in thinking. <br><br>Avery, let me repeat the last bit of the assignment: "Don’t pass judgment on the differences; just notice them, and think about what it would have been like to see the world the way the author did." That's exactly what students these days aren't doing; they've been taught to pass judgment on the past, feel cozily superior to it, and avoid thinking about the ways that past modes of thought made sense at the time. <br><br>Hubertus, we'll be talking about bowdlerization in quite some detail in an upcoming post, so any remaining questions you have will be settled in due time! <br><br>Ed, add "get rid of televisions" and you have my wholehearted agreement. <br><br>Alex, those are excellent examples! Another I find intriguing is Lushootseed, the native language of the First Nations of central Puget Sound. In Lushootseed there are, strictly speaking, few nouns; most of the time, if you want to make a noun, you take a verb and slap the prefix <i>s-</i> in front of it. So most things we describe in English using nouns, as things, to a Lushootseed speaker are processes. <br><br>Cherokee, your story doesn't surprise me at all. I did two stints in university; the first time I drifted around for three years and didn't accomplish much, other than finding the woman I married; the second time, almost a decade later, I went into university the way an armed robber goes into a mini-mart: get in, grab what you want, get out. The latter strategy worked well, and I got the things I wanted to get, but I was very deliberately feeding the professors what they wanted to hear the whole way, while keeping my own thoughts to myself. <br><br>Don, I have the earlier two-volume series by the same author, which is what I used to learn Welsh grammar.

I'll go with "The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling" by Henry Fielding as it is an 18th century novel, an era of which I know very little, and is one that I have been curious about a long time. As for this week's post, there is so much to unpack. Your Athenian Empire comparison may be apt but I do not think that we have had our Sicilian Expedition moment quite yet. Your "Twilight's Last Gleaming" illustrates what that could look like though.<br><br> I think that there is something to be added to your discourse on learning a foreign language and that is the matter of cultural attitudes. As an example. There seems to be a cultural idea in English-speaking people that learning a foreign language is hard and without little practical everyday use. I have come across this attitude in meeting people from a dozen or more English-speaking countries and I use to have it as well, big time. Thus it was both embarrassing and humiliating to meet Dutch children who were fluent in Dutch, French, German and English. This was the 80s so I have no idea if this remains true of Dutch kids today or whether their education has been 'modernized'.<br><br> I came to the realization that learning the basics of a language enough to get by can be done in about three months without the endless grammar tables and formal ways of teaching. In the high school that I was at in the 1970s in Australia, learning a second language was mandatory and I chose German which helped me enormously when I went overseas. The thing was, I did poorly at it in school until I was actually in Germany when it all came back. I realized that once the cultural idea about learning languages was junked, the learning could then flow.<br><br> The trouble is, when you think about it. If such a blatant false idea can hold so many people back, what other ideas do we also have that are holding us back that we are not even aware of - except manifested as general frustration or dissatisfaction? Not for nothing then was the Greek motto 'Know thyself'!<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c6652236935366800632 title="comment permalink">5/29/16, 10:51 PM</a><br><br>

I've noticed a big disconnect in the way most kids are parented, which I will call the "progressive" model--have every advantage, excel at everything, do everything for their kid to "get ahead" (without ever questioning where this "ahead" is we're "getting to". Then I see the existential results of this parenting among the 20-30 something crowd, they've been parented to "get ahead" in a world that is catabolically collapsing around them. No wonder they're enraged! Somehow, this is another thing we need to turn the clock back on, this "progressive" parenting to "get ahead" in a world that is no longer "progressing", where there is no "ahead" to "get to". Somehow, we need to revive and recover the "resilient/survivalist/take punches and keep on going" parenting of our grandparents/great grandparents generation.

To a fault, the conversations are no more stimulating than conversations I've heard around wage class members. Mostly mouthing pop culture soundbites referencing TV shows and movies. What is striking to me is how similar topics of conversation are among people who think themselves quite different from others (conservative/progressive, wage class/salary class) Yet, even though the salary class members, to a fault, are no more intelligent or stimulating in conversation than the wage class, they sneer at the wage class as uneducated. What we are discussing here in these posts is the worthlessness of our current education system, yet most salary class, college (university) educated people think themselves more intelligent than the wage class, non-college educated simply b/c of that piece of paper. In my experience, the wage class, non-college educated are under no illusion that a degree is a mark of intelligence. They rightfully understand that it is a class and status marker, and nothing else. They realize that their "betters" are not any more intelligent than they are. This certainly must have lethal consequences as we combine these posts on education with the posts on class &amp; privilege and a senile elite.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c7435786968743522819 title="comment permalink">5/30/16, 10:35 AM</a><br><br>

The duration of the orbit of the moon does not happen to divide exactly into the duration of the orbit of the earth. Twelve lunar months are shorter than a solar year. Thirteen lunar months are longer. The Islamic year is strictly lunar and it does not keep itself lined up with the solar year at all. <br><br>The Jewish calendar uses a more complicated formula to maintain any given month in the same season every year. There is IIRC a twenty two year cycle during which most of the years have twelve months but a few have thirteen. Because of the differing lengths of the calendar years, the winter solstice might or might not fall during Chanukah, and the vernal equinox might or might not fall during Passover. Those festivals always occur in the early winter and the spring respectively. <br><br>Systems to harmonize lunar months with a solar year are common in agricultural civilizations, because as long as you have a literate group of priests or astronomers to keep track, they allow you to celebrate the new and full moons as holidays (on the first and fifteenth of the month in the Jewish calendar) and also celebrate seasonal festivals on the same calendar date every year. The ancient Greeks had this sort of calendar too. Look up Metonic Cycle for an explanation of a typical system.<br><br>When your years vary in length by thirty days according to a set formula, a historical event dated in that calendar can be converted to the Julian or Gregorian calendar by simple arithmetic, but only if you have a table to identify which year in the cycle it is. Years in the Julian calendar are always the same length. The Gregorian calendar has leap days, but they are less trouble to deal with than leap months. For historians dealing with periods of centuries or millennia, lunar calendars are a pain in the neck.<br><br><br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c6402264314113160459 title="comment permalink">5/30/16, 11:58 AM</a><br><br>

I have a lot of thoughts on education vs schooling vs learning- words that I don't think are interchangeable- but as we go along I find I just have more and more questions. Any thoughts or comments? Planning to address this subject in a later blog? Thank you.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c4759127791456057827 title="comment permalink">5/30/16, 9:53 PM</a><br><br>

Nice work. However, academically you were on the money with the second stint and that focus was the best response given the circumstances. <br><br>That sort of straight-jacket approach to teaching reminded me of high school where the English teachers asked the students to write a creative essay and/or creative writing assignment. I always took that to mean write creatively and in whatever style I felt like. However, if you didn't write the creative piece exactly as they wanted it, you would not receive a good mark. I was always a bit suspicious of requests for that sort of work and the teachers were always very cagey about what sort of format and result they were after. To my mind I often wondered how they even marked such assignments and the whole thing smelled like a dirty rat.<br><br>The other thing that strikes me as being very strange in our culture is the notion that the only people who can introduce new concepts or new ideas into our society are those that have passed through the top order of the educational industry and hold a PhD. And the only way to get a new idea in circulation is to complete a PhD and have it peer reviewed. It is such a strange turf war.<br><br>Yeah, I reckon the insurance industry has hit upon hard times. The story behind the AIG insurer and its insurance of the credit default swaps on sub-prime mortgages appears to be very surreal to my mind. The reliance that industry has on income streams from investments is a reflection of the larger economy. It is not like the banks aren't after that outcome too. When you stand back and look at the banking industry, they don't actually want to hold assets, instead they seek the rights to an income stream from those assets so as to pay salaries and dividends. If one day, they have to sell the assets and/or otherwise dispose of them, the problem there is that they'll crash prices as the volume of sales would potentially be too high for the market to bear. Eventually they will have to face this problem and my gut feeling is that they will run out of buyers at that time. It honestly looks to me like the same see-sawing problem that the oil price will inevitably face.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c7700435234211413044 title="comment permalink">5/31/16, 1:07 AM</a><br><br>

It certainly sounded that way to me. And like all good stories, it has a grain of truth to it. Yes, your claim is correct in the short term.<br><br>However, it is also incorrect in the longer term because it has an underlying assumption behind it which is built on some very shaky ground. Your claim, presupposes that a person has the income with which continue to pay the interest only mortgage well after they have ceased earning a living. From what I've seen, once people retire their incomes drop, and yet the interest only mortgage demands to be paid month after month.<br><br>I find your sales pitch to be a very dubious claim. And you also again failed to address the other points that I raised.<br><br>When I read claims like yours I wonder to myself about the sort of future that the people making those types of claims want to leave for their descendants. It is not a good look.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c7805343317930811180 title="comment permalink">5/31/16, 1:18 AM</a><br><br>

Yes, I've definitely fallen into stories with that in mind as well. At the risk of boring reiteration; when the "modern machine-gun" fantasies start is exactly where I know we, (myself and the characters) are diverging in cultural background, as it's usually a difference in frame of mind, in perspective. For me getting back into the story under THEIR rules can them take place, but I'm obviously a creature of my own time - it doesn't come automatically for me.<br><br>@Shane: Yes, there are definitely some times and situations in which it's unwelcome for a non-parent to speak about parenting, but IMHO, this is not one of them. You're really simply including parenting/prepping the next generation into the critique of the whole of societal senility still in thrall to 'progress'. I would guess it's not possible for believers in progress to rear-up their kids with anything else, though, eh? <br>I think it's pretty odd as well, but several of the teachers at my kids' very expensive tippy top tier International school have taught limits to growth and peak oil theory. They teach practical approaches and they've made fair allowances for my eldest's after school job, (he is the only kid in the entire school with an after school job. It's just not a 'thing' here.) I suspect it falls on deaf ears much of the time, but they do teach it. My kids have discussed it at the dinner table, unprompted by me.<br><br>As I'm going through this contemplative 'letting go' phase - apart from my own emotional blubbering, (My BABIES!!!) taking a realistic look at mine - I think they'll do OK, even in the downturn/collapse. As OK as far as anyone can predict anything. &amp; I must admit, it's not all because of my husband and me. It is in large part because of the great teachers they've had, (not all, but enough great teachers) in their lives.<br><br>Of course, every parent wants to give their kids "the best"; but I think it's hard to realize that sometimes "The Best" is in what you DON'T give them. Ha! As an artist, I like to think of it as the negative space on a canvas. :) e.g. " I know all of your friends have iPads and are going to Europe or New Zealand this summer. I am giving you the gift of negative space by NOT giving you those things. Work and pay your own way and you will be able to see the joy, the positive space of having them!……..

"Shapes thought" (as John Roth put it) is ambiguous, obviously, and could cover any degree of influence on any part of a person's thought, or any one of several possible "weak forms" of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis. The very term "Sapir-Whorf hypothesis" was coined by a later linguist (Harry Hoijer), writing after both Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf were dead. Hoijer's formalization simplifies and somewhat misstates what Sapir and Whorf thought about the influence of the forms of language on the forms of thought. Whorf, who wrote more on the theme than Sapir did, clearly meant to insist only (1) that a person's habitual, unreflective thought and behavior were influenced to some extent by the forms and uses of that person's native language, and (2) similarly, that a person's habitual, unreflective perceptions of the world around him or her were similarly influenced to some extent by the same things. Beyond that, Whorf speculated provocatively and somewhat wildly about specific cases, chiefly taken from the Hopi langauge, and those speculations now appear to have missed the mark, in light of further research on that language.<br><br>The real problem, however, that the majority of present-day linguists seem to me to have with the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is that it cannot naturally be made compatible with the fundamental principles of Chomskyan linguistics, which has been the dominant "paradigm" in linguistics for quite a number of decades now. In Chomskyan linguistic theory, there is supposed to exist a universal grammar underlying all human languages. This universal grammar is determined by human biology and especially psychology. This universal grammar also can be precisely expressed in a logically and mathematically consistent formal notation. It is, I think, as much a clash of incompatible theories about language and culture as it is a question of objective facts: cultural and linguistic universality vs. cultural and linguistic relativity.<br><br>If anyone wants to pursue this further, I recommend reading two of Whorf's papers, namely, "The Relation of Habitual Thought and Behavior to Language" (1941) and especially his most mature work, "Language, Mind and Reality." (1942). Both are available in his selected writings, published after his death under the title _Language, Thought and Reality_ (1956), and freely available as a public-domain PDF at archive.org. <br><br>A word of caution to the reader: although Whorf was educated as an engineer and a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and he worked all his adult life as a very highly regarded fire-insurance inspector, he was *also* an esotericist and occultist (and a member of the Theosophical Society). His 1942 paper was written with for Theosophists, not for professional linguists. Even so, it amply repays reading by any linguist.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c1261454843747706619 title="comment permalink">5/31/16, 8:53 AM</a><br><br>

It is the extremely different families of languages found in a wide range of aboriginal cultures in Australia and the Americas that offer the best evidence for his view.<br><br>As it happens, my own training as a linguist was in the pre-Chomskyan days, partly in Anthropological linguistics, and partly in Indo-European historical linguistics as practiced by German and Russian linguists. When Chomsky appeared on the scene, during my student years, I avidly read not just his lighter popular works like _Syntactic Structures_, _Cartesian Linguistics_, and _Aspects of the Theory of Syntax_, but his heavier formal papers in _The Handbook of Mathematical Psychology_, in _Information and Control_, and eventually also his very disappointing _The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory_. His formal work, examined closely, seemed to me to rest on unproven, possibly false, premises. Nor could I see how his theory of syntax had much to offer for the grammatical study of the highly inflected languages that interested me most, where paradigmatics is at least as important as syntax, if not more so. I did admire his political courage and his stance as a gadfly toward our dominant culture, but I could not buy the "bill of goods" (as it seemed to me) of his linguistics. -- And the Chomskyan critiques of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis did not impress me as valid.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c4966146259959117676 title="comment permalink">5/31/16, 9:17 AM</a><br><br>

Loeb edition. It's interesting. Michael Heseltine translated it in 1913 and it was revised and re-translated by E. H. Warmington in 1969. THE first footnote from Warmington states "It must be remembered that Haseltine's attitude toward sexual matters is not to-days." In Heseltin's original introduction, he states "His book is befouled with obscenity, ..." I wonder why he bothered to translate it, in the first place? <br><br>There are PAGES on the texts history. Lost codex, fragmentary bits. Apparently, the whole beginning and end is missing. It is observed that medieval copyists "...shortened these extracts, especially but not always when they were offensive." So. Are we getting Petronius' view of things, medieval copyists view of things, the first modern translation's view of things, or, the recent re-translations view? <br><br>Of course, one can hope that a more complete (and contemporary) edition will turn up in some Egyptian papyrus rubbish dump or, maybe if they discover the lost Latin library from the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum, more will be revealed.<br><br>But, to the original assignment, I'm jotting down notes, as I go along, as to how they're alike to us, and how they are different.

I was born in Canada but my mother tongue was an obscure European dialect, as unintelligible to the majority national language as English is to German. But as far as bilingualism and multi-lingualism go, I think there's some practicalities to consider such as ease of communication and mutual comprehension. <br><br>The first neighbourhood in Canada was one with with some kids that spoke a language that wasn't far off from my own so we were actually able to play together. But when I started kindergarten there was trouble. I had no idea what was being said. I was lost.<br><br>So my teacher hauled my parents in and told them in no uncertain terms that I had to learn English and for them to abandon their mother tongue as it was an impediment here, pointing to me as Exhibit A.<br><br>She also used herself as an example, saying that her mother insisted on fluency and literacy in Hungarian. A waste of time she said as Hungarian was useless in this place. Said she, you MUST learn English. Your boy MUST learn English.<br><br>So this teacher was no proponent of bilingualism or multi-lingualism. But her lecture sure did light a fire. By the time I was in first grade, I always spoke to my parents in English. By the time we visited the old country in my early teens, large swathes of my mother-tongue were lost to me through disuse. I spoke it haltingly and with a heavy accent to the great amusement of my cousins.<br><br>From the fifth through the twelfth grade I learned French in school. But I never used French in everyday life. As a result, I've forgotten almost all of what I learned.<br><br>In my own experience, if you don't use it you lose it. Keeping more than one language is difficult when one language, in this case English, dominates.<br><br>As far as the Europeans go, my employer has had extensive multi-national operations, especially in Europe, and, aside from a few employees, most of the Europeans seem to be functional only in their national language and speak only a bit of English and badly at that. These people aren't bozos, all are highly skilled and educated.<br><br>It's as if there's silos of linguistic incomprehension. How does the EU work in the long term without a common language? I say it's not enough that a perfumed multi-national elite speak to one another. <br><br>As a post script, I found the Dutch and Hong Kong Chinese to be the best English speakers.<br>But the most unintelligible English speakers are the English. No joke, their accents are impossible. Maybe it's deliberate.

Little did I know that the Spring term of 1970 was the end of teaching classical languages at Auburn. There was not enough demand, they said, to continue offering them. This came with a strange twist, however. The Pre-Med, Pre-Dentistry, Pre-Veterinary Medicine programs still needed this language requirement for its young doctors- to-be.<br>The solution to the dilemma came in the form of a somewhat imperious, no nonsense Southern matron by the name of Ms McLeod, an associate professor in the English Department. A course titled "Medical Vocabulary" was fashioned and became a requirement. There were even stories of would-be doctors who had good grades being pulled out of graduation lines because they had managed to flunk Ms. McLeod's Medical Vocabulary!<br><br>Fast forward a couple of years. I was living in a boarding house where three or four other students from my home county also lived. The youngest of these was an exceptionally dedicated young freshman, barely 18 years old, who was determined to become a veterinarian. He was the youngest of nine children. At birth the doctor managed to dislocate his shoulder and when the problem was discovered it was too late to correct. As a result his arm grew somewhat shorter than it should have been. (Consequently, the State of Alabama paid his tuition, books and lab fees in total due to his disability, just as the state did for me due to my father's disability from WWII.)<br><br>My friend was determined to succeed, so he signed up for medical vocabulary in the Spring quarter of his freshman year. He did not put it off as the children of privilege seemed to do. When he got the syllabus for the course he was totally intimidated and somewhat discouraged. He knew that I was studying foreign languages and he had never been interested, but he knew there must be a link to all these foreign words he was seeing and what I was studying. He asked me if I could possibly help him devise a plan of study for mastering this daunting mass of information. The course had morphed by this time into rote memorization of an extensive dictionary of Latin and Greek terms modified by myriad prefixes and suffixes, not to mention the nomenclatures of symptoms, syndromes and diseases that had been given names from the various European languages depending on the nationality of the doctor who described them. What worked in my tutorial was that I would review the material after my friend had covered it in class. I would then describe what the terms actually meant and many times tell some story from my own understanding of the terms. My stories became "mnemonics" for my friend and he was able to take those mnemonics with him on test day.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c3530698941383064436 title="comment permalink">5/31/16, 3:31 PM</a><br><br>

I have not kept in touch with him. The last I heard from him he had married a fellow student from North Alabama; had converted to her faith--the Church of Christ--and they had gone to Latin America as missionaries.<br>NOTE: At this time in the 1970s, there were only 16 schools of veterinary medicine in the United States. The schools followed a complicated system of admissions so that all states would have a chance for their students to pursue the veterinary career. This system meant that the requirements to get into any school of veterinary medicine were substantially higher than for any medical school. That is more or less still true today with only 28 schools of veterinary medicine. <br>NOTE#2: My mnemonic from this experience is the word "ultradolichocephalic". I remember it because my friend laughed so hard when he encountered it. It means extreme long headedness, which is a physical description. I looked the word up on dictionary.com, which did not have it, and on Merriam-Webster.com which came back with the statement "Aren't you smart?" and just for that you can sign up for month for free!

<div class="avtb a_224281" id=c6378710451302180824></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11875439585157447036 rel=nofollow>Patricia Mathews</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Okay - I read the Saga of the People of Vatnsdal, and the first thing I learned was the difference between an Epic and a Saga. An epic is one grand adventure, with a story arc, with the hero(es) at the center. A saga is multigenerational, and the passage of time is at the center. <br><br>The first thing I saw was a classic, timeless piece of Old Phartery that could have come from any board room or trailer park in today's world, or any chronicles of any civilization that had writing. The paterfamilias, Ketil the Large, who is the local lord, the chief, is under fire from his followers for allowing a bandit's nest to spring up on one of the major roads in his territory. The first thing the old man, who has apparently aged out of doing his job as a war chief, does is turn on his teenaged son - who had neither the height nor the bulk of his sire - and lace into him for a wimp and a weakling and a wussy, "worse than a daughter," then segue into "When I was your age...." and then into a rousing chorus of "What's the matter with kids today?!?" As I said, totally timeless.<br><br>A modern boy, and I'm using modern loosely, would have been storming off in a massive rage and a blind determination to show the abusive old geezer what's what. Young Thorstein? "When he walked away, he was very angry... his uppermost thought was to out his father's luck to the test and endure his taunting no more. But ... he is a rational young man and goes about it very cool-headedly. And when he succeeds, "his father greeted his son warmly", apologizes, and they are soon reconciled. We start seeing a lot of this in the sagas - quick anger, but quick reconciliation, easy partings and rejoinings. Because when it doesn't, it becomes lethal and tears the social fabric apart beyond repair. And the Icelanders knew it. <br><br>One of the greatest differences, though, would probably shock every historical illiterate whose notion of medieval warrior cultures includes the 'knowledge' that women were helpless chattels. These Norse warriors listened to their womenfolk, for good or ill but mostly for good. Giving good advice to their menfolk was actually part of their job description, and a woman is very often the voice of reason. Again, when she is not, the social disapproval of those around her pervades that part of the saga. <br><br>Everyone should be so pleasantly shocked.<br><br>There are others. Binding oneself to a prophecy - moving to Iceland simply because a seeress said he would - is the greatest one. You can grasp that intellectually, "fate is fully fixed; wyrd will have its will,"* but I think it would truly elude most of us on our deepest levels. It's a different world out there.<br><br>**Not from the saga. From "The Wanderer", 10th century (?) Anglo-Saxon. That giving good advice was part of a lady's job description is also laid out explicitly in an Anglo-Saxon manuscript, but it's also there in the Icelandic material for all to see.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c6378710451302180824 title="comment permalink">5/31/16, 8:12 PM</a><br><br>

Actually, most linguists I know of accept the intermediate forms as saying something useful; the weak form is banal and the strong form simply doesn't work. As far as Chomsky, outside of his followers, he's on the way out as the "dominant" form of linguistics, and has been for some time. He and his followers seem to exist in a hermetically sealed bubble.<br><br>The other weird thing about Chomsky is that he was almost right: there is a universal basis for language, but he was looking in the wrong place. It's semantic, not syntactic, and it's a lot smaller than he thought it was. It is the Natural Semantic Metalanguage, and it comes with a formalism for describing cultural differences in languages.<br><br>To give an example of the latter, from Wierzebicka (p.94):<br><br>many people think like this:<br> when someone does something, it is good if this someone can think like this:<br> "I am doing this because I want to do it."<br><br>This is the Anglo English cultural script for personal autonomy. One notable thing about the form is that the entire vocabulary consists of "semantic primes" that are claimed, with very strong evidence, exist in all languages in very simple forms. It can be translated directly into any language, with absolutely no loss of meaning. The reference is "Imprisoned in English - the Hazards of English as a Default Language," Anne Wierzbicka.<br><br>@Chris (Cherokee Organics)<br><br>I thought I said that the people who made "interest only loans" work for them were retired (and hence on a fixed income), and had no intention of accumulating property values for their children, if any. Other uses of that particular financial instrument are, of course, more risky. They look quite insane from the viewpoint of someone who has the idea that owning property is necessary for security, and not to people who don't have that particular mindset.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c8042421202821476369 title="comment permalink">6/1/16, 10:16 AM</a><br><br>

These kinds of loans are usually done only on commercial property sales.<br><br>If you think that the property is going to appreciate in price in the short to medium term, and the rent won’t cover the interest + principal payments, the interest only option allows the property to pay for itself while you wait to sell it for a profit.<br>Anyway, The big downside is (and its happened to me) that the property actually loses value, say when a property bubble goes POP. Then the bank has the right (spelled out in fine print of course) to request a cash payment to lower the loan to property value ratio. Also, they may cancel the interest only deal and make you pay principal too. Then you are really in the pooh! <br><br>Interest only is also a temporary option one can request from the bank if one is having trouble paying off a conventional “interest + principal” loan. Sometimes a bank will let you pay interest only for a fixed time in the hope that you’ll get your act together and start paying off principal as well.

Gender is so much more biologically determined than race, and yet it is gender that the progressives see as "fluid", "a spectrum", and "changeable". Over the years I've had long conversations with 8 trans people, and the process by which they switched from male to female, or female to male, had zero fluidity to it. The process was 5-8 years of drugs and surgeries, and weekly therapy sessions to help deal with the reactions of friends and family and the person's own feelings about what was happening. The trans process becomes the #1 central thing that person is doing with their life. When the "process" was complete, the work on themselves didn't stop. One switched back to the original gender, two went back to graduate school (which I consider a form of hiding from reality), all of them relocated in the country, and all of them left their partners at the time because they didn't feel like they fell out of love for the person who supported them financially and emotionally through the all of the process.<br><br>But none of this can be spoken in public because the reaction would be so great. <br><br>I'm not saying transgender is wrong or should be outlawed or anything like that. The reasons people do it - to be happy and who they really are - is something every human being struggles with on this planet. We all yearn for a certain kind of satisfaction and feeling of completion. It sickens me when the media spends so much time glorifying transgender like it is natural,normal, simple, easy, and makes people happy.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c2316173830102109782 title="comment permalink">6/2/16, 5:38 AM</a><br><br>

A handful wanted to study Classical Civilisations, however, and the Classics teacher, who had once taught Ancient Greek, Latin, Classical Civilisations, and I think run at one point an after-classes club studying things to do with Ancient Egypt... but interest had dwindled to her teaching a class of mostly Classical Civilisations to about 5 girls, with me sitting in the corner of the class with Latin textbooks. My father, who was quite an academic person, and is an archaeologist and geophysicist, had got me to start studying Latin when I was at primary school, because he thought it useful (it was certainly useful to him later when he had me around to translate stuff while he was busy processing data...) and so I wanted to carry on with it at GCSE, less interested at the time in reading old documents (especially as they're full of variant forms of Latin, abbreviations that I am sure made sense to those who read them, but are now some sort of arcane code and inconsistent spellings), but because my first language is French and I was interested in the underpinnings of various Romance languages. <br><br>I was the only person interested in learning Latin, and lucky to sit on the Classical Civilisations class while studying my battle reports and (thankfully more interesting) poetry, and I was the only person in my class who thought the history of languages, etymology and suchlike was actually vaguely interesting in itself, rather than as a way of impressing people at dinner parties and sounding intellectual. This was in the early '00s, and I think trying to persuade teenagers 10+ years later that the Classics are relevant, that learning a 'dead' language is useful (living in Scotland, I am witness to how there is much debate as to whether learning Gaelic is waste of money or not) or that ancient history has anything to teach us in our 'brave new world'. I'm an oddball because I've got Aspergers and was raised unconventionally, nothing particularly 'special' on my part for being the way I was, just a product of my upbringing in conjunction with a neurology that leaves me somewhat more bookishly inclined than social. <br><br>At least in the UK, ancient history is tangibly present pretty much everywhere, and you don't have to go far to find something at least 1,000 years old, and I guess that presence is a good way of encouraging people to be interested in history, because it is just down the road, in ruins or a museum, not several thousand miles away and several thousand years ago, but even so, we still struggle to have children interested in history (and many of the more 'academic') aspects of education past primary school. When I worked at a primary school for a few years, it was wonderful to see young children so imaginatively engaged in learning about the past - yes, mythology and history ended up pretty interwoven at that point, and we made brightly coloured dragons to lurk in castles and (being up in the Highlands) a Loch Ness Monster to float past Urquhart Castle, but at least they were excited, and there is also huge benefit in mythology. <br><br>I certainly think that there is a lack of history, and historical perspectives in modern education, but sadly I think it is because too many people, especially younger people, find it no longer relevant, and as I so painfully found out, those that do are seen as geeky and weird by their peers. A trend of anti-intellectualism, pop-culture obsession at the expense of experiencing culture as a whole - in which pop-culture has a place, but is not the only aspect.<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c2836033761453586334 title="comment permalink">6/2/16, 9:01 AM</a><br><br>

In his book, The French Lieutenant's Woman, the author John Fowles confronts this tendency head-on by jumping out of the story, set in the Victorian era, and speaking directly to the modern reader about how the Victorian mind-set differs from the reader’s. In fact, the whole novel is really “about” that difference, and the main character Sarah is a person who functions as a transitional stage between the Victorian and modern culture. <br><br>(The movie version went even further by having two interwoven stories: the Victorian era story as a movie in production, and the 1980’s era story of the two lead actors making the movie. Each story “comments” on the other).<br><br>Fowles’ literary “device” is a form of Metafiction. Many fiction writers exploit the difference between the mind-set of their contemporary readers and that of the characters in the fictional work in various ways. For example, the surprise ending in which a character does something which is “in character” for his culture and time, but not what the reader expects given his own unconscious cultural assumptions.<br><br>Ain’t fiction wonderful!<br><br><a href=against-cultural-senility_25.html#c2647470679131752118 title="comment permalink">6/3/16, 4:03 AM</a><br><br>
