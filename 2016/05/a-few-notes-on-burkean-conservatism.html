<div class=MsoNormal>
Several times recently, in posts on this blog discussing the vagaries of current American politics, I’ve had occasion to reference my own political philosophy by name. This has caused a certain amount of confusion and curiosity, because the moniker I mentioned—“moderate Burkean conservative”—falls nowhere on the narrow range of political opinions allowed into our collective discourse these days. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course a good part of the confusion arises because the word “conservative” no longer means what it once meant—that is to say, a person who wants to conserve something. In today’s America, conservatives who actually want to conserve are as rare as liberals who actually want to liberate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The once-significant language of an earlier era has had the meaning sucked right out of it, the better to serve as camouflage for a kleptocratic feeding frenzy in which both establishment parties participate with equal abandon. Putting meaning back into the words can be a risky proposition, in turn, because so many Americans are used to waving them about as arbitrary noises linked to an assortment of vague emotions, the common currency of what passes for thought in so much of modern American life. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nonetheless, I think the risk is worth taking, if only because a genuine conservatism—that is, a point of view oriented toward finding things worth conserving, and then doing something to conserve them—is one of the few options that offer any workable strategies for the future as the United States accelerates along the overfamiliar trajectory of a democracy in terminal crisis. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s start with the least familiar of the terms I mentioned above, “Burkean.” The reference is to the Anglo-Irish writer, philosopher, and politician Edmund Burke (1729-1797), generally considered the founder of the Anglo-American conservative tradition. This is all the more interesting in that Burke himself was none of the things that gets labeled “conservative” in today’s America. For example, while he was himself an Anglican Christian, he defended the rights of Catholics to freedom of worship at a time when this was a very unpopular stance—roughly on a par with defending the rights of Satanists in today’s America—and lent his own home to a group of Hindus traveling in Britain who had been refused any other place to celebrate one of their religious holidays. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He was also an outspoken supporter of the American colonists in their attempts to seek redress against the British government’s predatory and punitive trade policies, and maintained his support even when all peaceful options had been exhausted and the colonists rose in rebellion. Yet this was the man who, toward the end of his life, penned <i>Reflections on the Revolution in France</i>, which critiqued the French revolutionaries in incisive terms, and which has much the same place in the history of Anglo-American conservatism that <i>The Communist Manifesto</i> has in the history of the modern radical left. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This doesn’t mean, by the way, that Burkean conservatives quote Burke’s writings the way Marxists quote Marx or Objectivists quote Ayn Rand. Like other human beings, Burke was a blend of strengths and weaknesses, principles and pragmatism, and the political culture of his time and place accepted behavior that most people nowadays consider very dubious indeed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those of my readers who want to hear what Burke had to say can find <i>Reflections on the Revolution in France</i>
online, or in any decent used book store; those who want to engage in ad hominem argument can find plenty of ammunition in any biography of Burke they care to consult. What I propose to do here is something a bit different—to take Burke’s core ideas and set them out in a frame many of my readers will recognize at once. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The foundation of Burkean conservatism is the recognition that human beings aren’t half as smart as they like to think they are. One implication of this recognition is that when human beings insist that the tangled realities of politics and history can be reduced to some set of abstract principles simple enough for the human mind to understand, they’re wrong. Another is that when human beings try to set up a system of government based on abstract principles, rather than allowing it to take shape organically out of historical experience, the results will pretty reliably be disastrous. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What these imply, in turn, is that social change is not necessarily a good thing. It’s always possible that a given change, however well-intentioned, will result in consequences that are worse than the problems that the change is supposed to fix. In fact, if social change is pursued in a sufficiently clueless fashion, the consequences can cascade out of control, plunging a nation into failed-state conditions, handing it over to a tyrant, or having some other equally unwanted result. What’s more, the more firmly the eyes of would-be reformers are fixed on appealing abstractions, and the less attention they pay to the lessons of history, the more catastrophic the outcome will generally be. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That, in Burke’s view, was what went wrong in the French Revolution. His thinking differed sharply from continental European conservatives, in that he saw no reason to object to the right of the French people to change a system of government that was as incompetent as it was despotic. It was, the way they went about it—tearing down the existing system of government root and branch, and replacing it with a shiny new system based on fashionable abstractions—that was problematic. What made that problematic, in turn, was that it simply didn’t work<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Instead of establishing an ideal republic of liberty, equality, and fraternity, the wholesale reforms pushed through by the National Assembly plunged France into chaos, handed the nation over to a pack of homicidal fanatics, and then dropped it into the waiting hands of an egomaniacal warlord named Napoleon Bonaparte. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Two specific bad ideas founded in abstractions helped feed the collapse of revolutionary France into chaos, massacre, tyranny, and pan-European war. The first was the conviction, all but universal among the <i>philosophes</i>
whose ideas guided the revolution, that human nature is entirely a product of the social order. According to this belief, the only reason people don’t act like angels is that they live in an unjust society, and once that is replaced by a just society, why, everybody would behave the way the moral notions of the
<i>philosophes</i> insisted they should. Because they held this belief, in turn, the National Assembly did nothing to protect their shiny up-to-date system against such old-fashioned vices as lust for power and partisan hatred, with results that made the streets of Paris run with blood. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second bad idea had the same effect as the first. This was the conviction, also all but universal among the <i>philosophes</i>, that history moved inevitably in the direction they wanted: from superstition to reason, from tyranny to liberty, from privilege to equality, and so on. According to this belief, all the revolution had to do to bring liberty, equality, and fraternity was to get rid of the old order, and <i>voila</i>—liberty, equality, and fraternity would pop up on cue. Once again, things didn’t work that way. Where the <i>philosophes</i> insisted that history moves ever upward toward a golden age in the future, and the European conservatives who opposed them argued that history slides ever downward from a golden age in the past, Burke’s thesis—and the evidence of history—implies that history has no direction at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The existing laws and institutions of a society, Burke proposed, grow organically out of that society’s history and experience, and embody a great deal of practical wisdom. They also have one feature that the abstraction-laden fantasies of world-reformers don’t have, which is that they have been proven to work. Any proposed change in laws and institutions thus needs to start by showing, first, that there’s a need for change; second, that the proposed change will solve the problem it claims to solve; and third, that the benefits of the change will outweigh its costs. Far more often than not, when these questions are asked, the best way to redress any problem with the existing order of things turns out to be the option that causes as little disruption as possible, so that what works can keep on working. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That is to say, Burkean conservatism can be summed up simply as <i>the application of the precautionary principle to the political sphere</i>.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The precautionary principle? That’s the common-sense rule that before you do anything, you need to figure out whether it’s going to do more good than harm. We don’t do things that way in the modern industrial world. We dump pesticides into the biosphere, carbon dioxide into the air, and inadequately tested drugs into our bodies, and then figure out from the results what kind of harm they’re going to cause. That’s a thoroughly stupid way of going about things, and the vast majority of the preventable catastrophes that are dragging modern industrial society down to ruin result directly from that custom. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Behind it, in turn, lies one of the bad ideas cited above—the notion that history moves inevitably in the direction we want. Yes, that’s the myth of progress, the bizarre but embarrassingly widespread notion that history is marching ever onward and upward, and so anything new is better just because it’s new, which keeps so many people from asking obvious questions about where our civilization is headed and whether any sane person would want to go there. I’ve discussed this in quite a few earlier posts here, as well as in my book <i>After Progress</i>; I mention it here to point out one of the ways that the political views I’m explaining just now interface with the other ideas I’ve discussed here and elsewhere.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The way that a moderate Burkean conservatism works in practice will be easiest to explain by way of a specific example. With this in mind, I’m going to go out of my way to offend everyone, by presenting a thoroughly conservative argument—in the original, Burkean sense of that word “conservative,” of course—in favor of the right to same-sex marriage. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We’ll have to pause first for a moment, though, to talk about that word “right.” This is necessary because by and large, when Americans hear the word “right,” their brains melt into a puddle of goo. The assumption these days seems to be that there’s some indefinite number of abstract rights hovering out there in notional space, and all of them are absolute and incontrovertible, so that all you have to say is “I have a right to [whatever]!” and everybody is supposed to give you whatever it is right away. Of course everybody doesn’t, and the next step is the kind of shrill shouting match that makes up so much of American political nonconversation these days, in which partisans of the right to X and partisans of the right to Y yell denunciations at each other for trying to deprive each other of their rights. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If you happen to be a religious person, and believe in a religion that teaches that God or the gods handed down a set of rules by which humans are supposed to live, then it probably does make sense to talk like this, because you believe that rights exist in the mind of the deity or deities in question. If you’re not a religious person, and claim to have a right that other people don’t recognize, you’ll have a very interesting time answering questions like these: in what way does this supposed right exist? How do you “have it”—and how do the rest of us tell the difference between this right you claim to have and, say, an overdeveloped sense of entitlement on your part? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All these confusions come from the attempt to claim that rights have some kind of abstract existence of their own. To the Burkean conservative, this is utter nonsense. A right, from the Burkean point of view, is an agreement among the members of a community to allow some sort of behavior. That’s what it is, and that’s all it is. The right to vote, say, exists because the people of a given nation, acting through political institutions, confers it on a certain class of persons—say, all adult citizens.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What if you don’t have a right, and believe that you should have it? That’s called “having an opinion.” There’s nothing wrong with having an opinion, but it doesn’t confer a right. If you want to have the right you think you should have, your job is to get your community to confer it on you. In a perfect world, there would no doubt be some instant, foolproof way to establish a right, but we don’t live in a perfect world. We live in a world where the slow, awkward tools of representative democracy and judicial review, backed up by public debate, are the least easily abused options we’ve yet found to accomplish this task. (That doesn’t mean, please note, that they can’t be abused; it means that they’re not quite as prone to abuse as, say, the institutions of theocracy or military dictatorship.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With that in mind, we can proceed to the right to same-sex marriage. The first question to ask is whether government has any business getting involved in the issue at all. That’s not a minor question. The notion that legislation is the solution to every problem has produced a vast number of avoidable disasters. In this case, though, what prevented same-sex couples from marrying was governmental regulations. Changing those regulations requires governmental action. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second question to ask is whether government has any compelling interest in the existing state of affairs. History shows that letting government interfere in people’s private lives is a very risky thing to do, and while it can be necessary, there has to be a compelling interest to justify it—for example, in the case of laws prohibiting child abuse, the compelling interest of protecting children against violence. No such compelling interest justifies government interference in the marital decisions of legally competent, consenting adults; as noted further on, “Ewww, <i>gross</i>!” does not count as a compelling interest. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The third question to ask is whether the people who will be affected by the change actually want the change. That’s not a minor question, either; history is full of grand projects, supposedly meant to help some group of people, that were rejected by the people who were to be “helped,” and those inevitably turn out badly. In this case, though, there were plenty of same-sex couples who wanted to get married and couldn’t. Notice also that the proposed change was permissive rather than mandatory—that is, same-sex couples could get married, but they could also stay unmarried. As a general rule of thumb, permissive regulations don’t require the same level of suspicion as mandatory regulations. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The fourth question to ask is whether anyone would be harmed by the change. Here it’s important to keep in mind that “harmed” does not mean “offended;” nor, for that matter, are you harmed by being kept from forcing others to do what you want them to do. One of the eternal annoyances of liberty is that others inevitably use it in ways that you and I find offensive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We put up with the inconvenience because that’s the price of having liberty ourselves. Claims that this or that person is going to be harmed by a change thus need to evince specific, concrete, measurable harm. In this case, that standard was not met, as there are no Purple Hearts issued for being butthurt. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The fifth question is whether the proposed change is a wholly new right, a significant expansion of an existing right, or the extension of an existing right in its current form to a group of people who did not previously have it. Creating a wholly new right can be a risky endeavor, as it’s hard to figure out in advance how that will interact with existing rights and institutions. A significant expansion of an existing right is less hazardous, but it still needs to be approached with care. Extending an existing right in its current form to people who don’t previously have it, by contrast, tends to be the safest of changes, since it’s easy to figure out what the results will be—all you have to do is see what effect it has had in its more restricted application. In this case, an existing right was to be extended to same-sex couples, who would have the same rights and responsibilities as couples who married under existing law. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The sixth question, given that the right in question is being extended in its current form to a group of people who didn’t previously have it, is whether that right has been extended before. In this case, the answer is yes. Marriage between people of different races used to be illegal in many American states. When extending the right of marriage to mixed-race couples was being debated, the same arguments deployed against same-sex marriage got used, but all of them amounted in practice to someone being offended. Mixed-race marriages were legalized, a lot of mixed-race couples got married, none of the horrible consequences imagined by the opposition ever got around to happening, and that was that. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So, to sum up, we have a group of people who want a permissive regulation granting them a right already held by other people. No actual harm has been demonstrated by those opposed to granting that right, and no compelling interest prevents government from granting that right. The same right has been extended before with no negative consequences, and a very simple change in the wording of existing marriage laws will confer the right. Under these circumstances, there is vastly more justification for granting the right than for refusing it, and it should therefore be granted. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No doubt some people will take offense at so mealy-mouthed an adding up of pros and cons. Where are the ringing affirmations of justice, equality, and other grand abstract principles? That, of course, is exactly the point. In the real world, grand abstract principles count for little. In a society that values liberty—not, please note, as a grand abstract principle, but as a mutual agreement that people can do as they wish so long as that doesn’t infringe on the established rights of others—what matters when someone petitions for redress of a grievance is simply whether that petition can be granted without any such infringement. The questions asked above, and the institutions of representative democracy and judicial review, are there to see to it that this happens. Do they always succeed? Of course not; they just do a marginally better job than any other system. In the real world, that’s justification enough. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What about the religious communities that are opposed to that right? (This is where I’m going to shift gears from offending my readers on the rightward end of things to offending those on the other end of the political spectrum.) Conservative Christian groups are a religious minority in America today, and it’s a well-established rule in American law and custom that reasonable accommodation should be made to religious minorities when this can be done without violating the agreed-upon rights of others. That doesn’t give conservative Christians the right to force other people to follow conservative Christian teachings, any more than it would give Jews the right to forbid the sale of pork in America’s grocery stores. It does mean that conservative Christians should not be forced to participate in activities they consider sinful, any more than Jewish delicatessens should be forced to sell pork. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By and large, businesses that serve the general public are rightly required to serve the general public, rather than picking and choosing who they will or won’t serve, but there are valid exceptions, and religion is one of them. I’m told that in New York State, orthodox Jewish businesses are legally allowed to post signage stating that Jewish religious law applies on the premises, and this exempts them from certain laws governing other businesses; thus, for example, a woman who enters such a business with uncovered hair will not be served.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It would be a reasonable accommodation for conservative Christian businesses that cater to weddings to be able to post signage noting that they only provide services to the kinds of weddings authorized by their own religious laws. That would let same-sex couples take their business elsewhere; it would also let people who support the right of same-sex marriage know which businesses to boycott, just as it would let conservative Christians support their co-religionists. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Again, any number of shiny abstractions could be brandished about to insist that conservative Christian businesses should not have that right, but here again, we’re not dealing with abstractions. We’re dealing with the need to find reasonable accommodation for differing beliefs in a society that, at least in theory, values liberty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Claims that this or that person will be harmed by letting a religious minority practice its faith on privately owned business premises, again, have to evince specific, concrete, measurable harm. Being offended doesn’t count here, either, nor does whatever suffering comes your way from being denied the power to make other people do what you think they ought to do. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
My readers may have noticed that, given the arrangements just outlined, nobody in the debate over same-sex marriages would get everything they want. That’s at least as offensive as anything else I’ve suggested in this post, but it’s the foundation of Burkean conservatism, and of democratic politics in general. In the messy, gritty world of actual politics, nobody can ever count on getting everything they want—even if they shout at the top of their lungs that they have a right to it—and the best that can be expected is that each side in any controversy will get the things they most need. That’s the kind of resolution that allows a society to function, instead of freezing up into permanent polarization the way America has done in recent years—and it’s the kind of resolution that might just possibly get some semblance of representative democracy intact through the era of crisis looming ahead of us just now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
*******</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Two other things. First, I’m frankly astounded by the outpouring of congratulations—not to mention tip jar contributions—that came in response to last week’s post on the tenth anniversary of <i>The Archdruid Report</i>. On the off chance that anyone didn’t get thanked sufficiently, please know that the lapse wasn’t intentional! I’m more grateful than I can say for the support and encouragement I’ve received from the community of readers that’s emerged around this blog. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Second, I’m delighted to announce that the first issue of <a href=http://intotheruins.com/ >Into the Ruins</a>, as far as I know the first-ever magazine of deindustrial science fiction, is now in print. This is the periodical equivalent of the <i>After Oil</i> anthologies, chockfull of new stories selected by editor Joel Caris; those who like compelling stories about the future we’re actually likely to get won’t want to miss it. Subscribers should be getting their copies shortly if those haven’t arrived already; as for the rest of you—well, what are you waiting for? ;-) You can order copies or buy a subscription <a href=http://intotheruins.com/issues/issue-i-spring-2016/ >at this website</a>.</div>

Usually when someone uses a squishy, subjective term with multiple meanings, e.g. liberal, conservative, Christian, etc. my first thought is, "Define your terms!" Like Damon Knight's definition of science fiction, so much is "what I point to when I say it." A lot of it seems like emotional reasoning, and tribal identity. Thus, "I am a member of a group. My group is good. Anything identified with my group is good. Anything outside of my group is bad." So, if a "liberal" proposes something that "conservatives" support, many "conservatives" will reflexively reject it because it came from an outsider. Of course, liberals usually have the same response when the roles are reversed.

You're asking whether government should interfere in the private sexual decisions of consenting adults; I've already suggested that this is a bad idea unless there's a compelling interest, and the benefits to society of trying to prevent nonmarital sex are by no means as clear as you've made them out to be. Remember, we tried that as a society for some centuries, and the evidence of history suggests that it was no more effective than Prohibition -- and like Prohibition, the old laws and customs banning nonmarital sex fed crime and produced a bumper crop of ruined lives, without seriously impacting the actual frequency of nonmarital sex, sexually transmitted disease, single motherhood, and so on. Nor are the negative consequences of being raised by a single parent necessarily any worse than the negative consequences of being raised by parents who hate each other but are forced by law to remain in each other's company -- a survey of the literature on Victorian family relationships will demonstrate that clearly enough. <br><br>History thus shows that the benefits to legal prohibition of sex outside of marriage are largely illusory and the costs are real and serious. That being the case, government does not have a compelling interest; the people who would be affected by the change you're proposing clearly don't want to be "helped" by it. Liberty, if it means anything, includes the right to make bad decisions, and therefore -- from the standpoint of moderate Burkean conservatism, as I understand it -- the gradual social changes that, over the course of the twentieth century, abolished prohibitions on nonmarital sex were justified. <br><br>WB Jorgenson, exactly! If it ain't broke, don't fix it, and if you're going to fix it, you need to be able to show that your solution will be better than the problem.<br><br><a href=#c2596140847106381423 title="comment permalink">5/11/16, 6:03 PM</a><br><br>

Berlin is quite another matter, and I share his take. As for Mann's novel, it's got many levels, but the social-satire aspect is to my eye always there. <br><br>Leo, exactly -- thus my jab at verbal noises linked with vague emotional states as the common currency of American nonthinking. <br><br>Justin, as I see it, the laws against homosexuality were religious in origin, and thus part of the hangover (in the head-pounding, gut-churning, kneeling at the porcelain altar and repatriating your last two meals sense) from the theocratic stage of European history. That is to say, they were certainly part of the general revulsion toward sexual pleasure that pervaded Christianity before the modern era, but I don't think the matter was anything like as utilitarian as you've suggested. <br><br>Tom, as far as I know, there are very few religious groups whose doctrines actually prohibit, say, doing business with people of a different ethnic background or skin color. There are a few -- the Christian Identity movement comes to mind -- but religion wasn't the source of the Jim Crow laws, and I've specified that accommodating the needs of religious minorities is something of a special case. (For example, the draft laws grant special exemptions to members of religious minorities that aren't granted to other categories of people.) Thus I don't see civil rights laws as necessarily invalid; a lot would depend, as it generally does, on a case by case analysis of costs and benefits.<br><br><a href=#c7263626611422634373 title="comment permalink">5/11/16, 6:17 PM</a><br><br>

With regard to Sharia, keep in mind that every Halal butcher shop, and for that matter every mosque, already follows Sharia, in exactly the same way that every orthodox Jewish synagogue, schul, and delicatessen follows Talmudic law; there's a very large line between following religious laws in private lives and private associations, on the one hand, and insisting that it should replace secular law across the board on the other.<br><br><a href=#c8696725556573213937 title="comment permalink">5/11/16, 6:21 PM</a><br><br>

In your interpretation, Burke sounds more like people imagine a liberal to sound like! That is, a liberal before the term lost any meaning and became a synonym for "SJW on Twitter". <br><br>It could be argued that same-sex couples shouldn´t have the right to adopt children, since children need both male and female parents/role models. This would be a compelling interest for the government to either stop same-sex marriage, or create a form of marriage sans children. Also, international adoption organizations (whether we like it or not) tend to avoid nations where children can be adopted by same-sex couples, making it impossible to adopt foreign children if same-sex marriage is passed into law. But yes, I´m trying to argue the case in a "Burkean" fashion here, following your example. <br><br>As for the French Revolution, I believe that the ancien regime was so rotten, that the revolution became inevitable once the nobility had rejected Necker´s reform proposals - "abstract ideas" or not! The "Burkean" argument makes sense only in a society that can still be reformed by some other means. If it can´t, we all have to ride the tiger (and go off and run like hell when the tiger stops, I suppose). <br><br>I also agree with some of the comments above, that democracy is preferable because it is (in the words of Churchill) "the worst possible form of government...except for all the others". C S Lewis said something similar: he supported democracy precisely because humans *aren´t* perfect. Even Plato (sic) had a similar opinion, stating (or letting one of his dialogue characters state) that democracy was incapable of great glory, but precisely for that reason, also incapable of great crimes...<br><br>Does this make me a Burkean?

It would be nice to meet people like that. ;-)!<br><br>In an astonishing coincidence this morning, I was listening to the radio when a lady representing the Australian Conservation Foundation was being interviewed on a rather important topic. I thought that the interview may be interesting and I was particularly curious to hear what that group was trying to conserve.<br><br>You see the problem is that Cape Grimm which is in the north western corner of the island state of Tasmania - a stunning, wild and very remote corner of the planet - has a scientific station measuring some of the world's cleanest air, which they believe will very soon be able to measure 400ppm (that's parts per million) of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere at that location. This is an unprecedented recording / measurement from such a remote corner of the world. The very thoughtful interviewers asked the very hard and outstanding question: “Whatever happened to the 350 organisation?” BAM – as I’ve heard said!<br><br>What surprised me the most is that after delivering a concise and very well spoken summary of the problem, the representative then went onto claim that their group was demanding that the government apparently do something about the problem, because without government action... No doubt they are correct in that assertion, but they also failed to mention other more immediate courses of action which may possibly have put them out of a job. The interesting thing was that the representative had an ever so slight moment of hesitation before communicating that particular meme and I wonder if there was a guilty conscience underneath those words - or even a true sense of the sheer scale of the problem. My gut feeling was that the words were intended to provide a soothing effect, but I could well be wrong?<br><br>Out of sheer curiosity, do you see that meme being thrown around? The reason I ask is because I wonder how well that meme will last when the climate extremes, become even more extreme? My gut feeling is that at some stage in the future, people may switch to the even more dubious claims such as: Well, action could be taken if it weren't for . Dunno.<br><br>Of course: "A right, from the Burkean point of view, is an agreement among the members of a community to allow some sort of behavior ."<br><br>It is my gut feeling that community is often avoided / feared - or only fostered with likeminded people - for the very reason that people are indulging their "overdeveloped sense of entitlement on your part?" as you put it.<br><br>Putting up with the many interesting characters who have very different desires and objectives in a real community is a very different experience as I know only too well.<br><br>PS: I second your opinion of "Into the Ruins" - which I received in the mail this morning - and urge everyone to go out and subscribe to this excellent and very well priced publication. And most importantly, it appears to be completely advertisement free!<br><br>PPS: Did you just provide a basic lesson on the processes of logic, deduction and reasoning? Well done, you! :-)!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c6756599462366271069 title="comment permalink">5/11/16, 6:56 PM</a><br><br>

How are we to know what aspects of our society are worth conserving without some shared values? You attempted to address this in your discussion of liberty by characterizing it as a "mutual agreement" rather than an "abstract principle," but proceeded simply to put that abstract principle into words: "people can do as they wish so long as that doesn't infringe on the established rights of others." See Article IV of the Declaration of the Rights of Man:<br><br><i>"Article IV - Liberty consists of doing anything which does not harm others: thus, the exercise of the natural rights of each man has only those borders which assure other members of the society the enjoyment of these same rights. These borders can be determined only by the law."</i><br><br>What this suggests to me is that there are in fact certain "grand principles" which you value, like liberty and perhaps also justice and equality. They are crucial in guiding you in determining what facets of our society are worth preserving and, perhaps, provide direction if you feel some aspect of society needs changing. Correct me if I'm off base here.<br><br>If all the above is essentially on target, that suggests your major issue with the French Revolution is not ideological but rather methodological. That sounds reasonable; nobody (save a few bloodthirsty communists) wants to defend the Reign of Terror. I fear, however, that your analysis of how social change happens is unhelpful. Here you are on rights, and how people acquire them:<br><br><i>"A right, from the Burkean point of view, is an agreement among the members of a community to allow some sort of behavior. That’s what it is, and that’s all it is. The right to vote, say, exists because the people of a given nation, acting through political institutions, confers it on a certain class of persons—say, all adult citizens."</i><br><br>Really? The people gave themselves the right to vote by "acting through political institutions?" In every historical example I can think of, people organized themselves and put pressure on the state in non-traditional ways, using methods firmly outside of the existing political institutions, methods which often included violence. American land-owners won the right to govern their own affairs through victory in their independence war, a model that many other colonized people would be forced to follow. The French bourgeoisie rejected the institutions of the Monarchy when they swore the tennis court oath and affirmed their willingness to pursue and defend their aims with noble blood.<br><br>I know the French Revolution horrifies you as much as it did Burke. And that's fine, no conservative should be a partisan to that movement. My contention is that the conservative ideology you propose has no mechanism to evolve unless society is already shaped in a certain way, already possesses the "awkward tools of representative democracy and judicial review" won in a historical transformation which almost certainly was not conservative in nature. I fail to see how a Burkean conservative, situated in the American south in the 1950s, could be anything other than a proponent of "state's rights" to uphold Jim Crow. <br><br>Given that your underlying project seems to be to identify the elements of the present society, technical and ideological, which are worth preserving in the face of imminent collapse, I can understand the allure of a political ideology which claims to make preservation its primary aim. However, such an ideology is much less alluring if situated in a society whose organization starkly contrasts with the abstract principles we hold dear, places like the French Old Regime or Old Dixie. For me, Burkean Conservatism as you have described it, needs to be paired with a positive project, perhaps some sort of ecological democracy, for it to make any sort of sense.<br><br><a href=#c8430797549412755226 title="comment permalink">5/11/16, 8:43 PM</a><br><br>

I don't remember exactly, but he had list of criteria of what constitutes life and since viruses lacked one of them he said they didn't qualify.

Eventually the class came over to my side of the argument.<br><br>Of course there are sterile things in nature, like Mules, that are surely living things. But I would say that although they are alive they are defective.<br><br>I do not think it is coincidental that same-sex marriage has become an issue at a time of universal below replacement reproduction rate in Western countries. I am not claiming that homosexuality is a major cause of the current sterility (at least not yet - I don't pretend to know what exactly drives the behavior but I think you would agree that from the historical record of the ancient world it appears that it may be somewhat socially elastic) but the sterility of modern life makes it appear to be a good idea. We no longer save seed, raise chicken or breed goats - and wish our grass would behave like the asphalt. To an Amish farmer the idea of two men getting married is as absurd as it would be to our great-great grandfathers.<br><br>You wrote about Catch 22s a week or so back but here is the ultimate one as I see it: The population of advance countries is depleting natural resources fast. Infertility would seem to be the best way to reduce the population and save resources. But as the population gets older how do you pay for promises of a long retirement with fewer young workers? At certain point those promises will obviously not be able to be paid, so why should younger people keep at it and support the system? A tipping point will be reached and a vicious cycle starts. (As in Obamacare now: healthy people dropping out of insurance, causing insurance premiums to go even higher, causing more healthy people to drop out) I believe that even if ecological disaster doesn't destroy our economy first then the socialized Welfare/Warfare/Financial state will still find a way to collapse under it's own weight instead. <br><br>The problem of modern life might be even greater then the Earth's stinginess. I see the end of a civilization as an inevitable battle between the forces Arrogance and Apathy.

Just because I have it does not mean I am REQUIRED to drive. It just means I can, if I chose to.<br><br><a href=#c1891391566114619847 title="comment permalink">5/11/16, 9:05 PM</a><br><br>

I'll try being more offensive next time. ;-)<br><br>Pinku-sensei, oh, granted -- the language of political discourse is so thoroughly corrupt in today's America that any abstract scheme ("tradition vs. rationality," for example) inevitably fails to make sense of the whole picture. <br><br>Tidlösa, by the logic you're proposing, single parents should have their children taken away from them, since they can't provide role models of both genders! Same-sex couples have been raising children in the US for a while now; I know of no evidence that the children are in any way disadvantaged or harmed by this. It's also been quite common, especially after major wars, for large numbers of children to be raised in households consisting only of women, as the men in question were no longer alive to take part, and those children also came out fine. Thus your proposal can't be justified. <br><br>Justin, oh, I get that. Most "utilitarian" claims are pretty irrational, when you give them a hard look. As for access to wedding cakes, I'm not a great fan of homophobia either, but again, the nature of liberty is that some people are going to use it in ways that you and I dislike. <br><br>Lynnet, no, now you're comparing apples to grapefruit. There are specific religious prohibitions against same-sex relationships in the Bible. There are no such prohibitions preventing Christians from doing business with non-Christians, and so appealing to religious law as a basis for such an exclusion would be impermissible. As for slippery slopes, <i>every</i> issue is a slippery slope heading somewhere -- meaning, of course, that if you take any statement and extrapolate it far enough, you can get something unacceptable. That's why every determination of rights is a tradeoff in which nobody gets everything and everybody gets something. <br><br>Blue Sun, yes, I've heard "paleoconservative," and considered it for a while, but there's more than one flavor of conservatism included in that word. (Though I did come up way over on the paleoconservative side of things on the quiz you linked to.) That's why I settled on "moderate Burkean conservative" as a self-description -- it differentiates me, for example, from religious conservatives, monarchists, Traditionalists, and the like. <br><br>Thelma, the deadline's passed, but I haven't yet had time to begin assembling the anthology; if you've got a story, or can get one together fairly soon, you might want to surf on over to <a href=http://merigaproject.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>The Meriga Project</a> website and post a link. In the meantime, though, there's <a href=../../2015/12/the-flutter-of-space-bat-wings.html rel=nofollow>a new Space Bats contest</a> on. <br><br>John, in an arbitration process, where both sides have agreed not to use the mechanisms of civil law, relying on the Talmud or any other traditional law code would pass the "sniff test" -- since the regulation permitting this is permissive rather than mandatory, and both sides have to agree to it, no one's liberties are being infringed on. <br><br>S.

We all put up with limits to our freedoms; that's part of the bargain of living in a diverse society.

As for behaving civilly toward barbarians, among the things we need to discuss in this sequence of posts are the limits of tolerance. All in good time! <br><br>Vesta, excellent! Yes, I was planning on getting to that. Burkean conservatism is also evolutionary ecology applied to the sphere of human politics...<br><br>Duke, a lot of it is the peculiar but very popular belief that humans are somehow uniquely outside of nature. Thus we go out of our way to avoid noticing that we can often be outsmarted by an ordinarily resourceful duck. <br><br>Ray, exactly. Exactly! Politics is an art or, better still, a craft rather than a science. There is never only one right answer, and there are no answers that are entirely right. <br><br>John, trusting such decisions to a Supreme Leader is generally a very bad idea. If I were alive and politically active in France in 1789, I'd advocate for a written constitution, an elected legislature that met regularly, and specific reforms that limited the arbitrary power of the monarchy and abolished the special rights the aristocracy had over the Third Estate. Assuming that the Paris mob and a majority in the National Assembly backed me, the result would be a parliamentary constitutional monarchy on the English model, but with a written constitution subject to amendment by established procedures -- and that would be well positioned to extend further liberties to the French people over the course of the next century or so. <br><br>Notes, that seems entirely sensible to me. Heaven knows almost anything would work better than the Unaffordable Care Act, but expanding Medicare into a single payer system has all the advantages you've listed, and would very likely be the best option we've got. <br><br>Avalterra, yes, a case could also be made for taking marriage out of the purview of government. That would be a considerably larger change than simply changing the requirements for marriage, though, and you'd need to be able to show that there was enough benefit to be gained by that step to make it worth doing. <br><br>NC Jim, of course it's a slippery slope. Every decision that weighs the rights of one person against the rights of another is a slippery slope.

I was wondering who was going to bring that up. What you've done, of course, is point to the complementary viewpoint to Burkean conservatism, that of classic liberalism -- at its core, the belief that a society should constantly be called to live up to the values that it claims to hold. In a healthy democracy, the liberals are constantly proposing measures to bring a society closer to its ideals, and conservatives are just as constantly requiring them to prove that their proposals will actually improve things, and won't have ghastly consequences. <br><br>That said, you're being somewhat unfair to Burkean conservatism in insisting that it offers no options for establishing entirely new rights and freedoms. Not so; do you recall my mentioning in the post that Burke supported the American Revolution? There are times -- they don't happen often, but they do happen -- when a wrong is so deeply entrenched that ordinary methods can't uproot it, and that's when you turn to other options. That's a very, very risky thing to do, but sometimes it's the only option. Thus I consider the American Revolution and the Civil Rights movement both entirely justified in the context of their times and places. Now of course I'm a moderate Burkean conservative, and thus tend to set the bar for justifying change lower than some others might, but there it is.<br><br>Bill, exactly. The habit of all-or-nothing thinking is very deeply rooted and very damaging in today's America. Congrats to your friend on his marriage!<br><br>Stacy, to my mind that's a different animal. It's only an issue because in the US, for a variety of bad reasons, your health care coverage is partly paid for by your employer, and that produces all kinds of conflicts when (as in this case) the employer's religious convictions and the employee's freedom of choice come into conflict. It's not surprising that a conflict of that kind produced a split decision at the Supreme Court! There are many other reasons, of course, why the current US way of handling health care costs needs changing, but the inescapability of conflicts along these lines is one of them. <br><br>Tom, you'd have to ask an Orthodox rabbi about that. <br><br>Nathan, I see the widespread acceptance of same-sex relationships in Western countries, rather, as a predictable outcome of the social changes that have turned Christianity into a minority religion in the West. Plenty of societies outside the Abrahamic religious sphere have zero trouble with same-sex relationships; a great many of them tend to differentiate between marriage, which is a contract between families for the purpose of producing children, and love -- but even that's not a universal. The decline in population -- that's normal, as I think Spengler points out somewhere, when a Culture becomes a Civilization; certainly it happened in a big way in the Roman world, and in other examples as well. As for the transformation of some European nations to Muslim-majority societies, that's yet another matter, which will get a post of its own in due time. <br><br>Bill, I ain't arguing. I see it as an attempt by the totalitarian end of the Left to demand universal obedience to their dictates, and thus just as out of line as the equivalent demands made by the totalitarian end of the Right. <br><br>Compound F, I hadn't heard of that.

I have a question for you, though. It's been on my mind for a few weeks, so I hope you don't mind if it harkens back to old posts. Also, I'm afraid it might seem a bit cheeky, but I really don't mean it in that way. I've been a faithful reader for years, though an infrequent commenter, and I am asking because I have great respect for your judgment, and really want to know what you think. So here it is: how do you square your Burkean awareness that the new will not necessarily be better (and can be a lot worse) than the old, even when the old sucks, with your conviction (expressed in last week's comments I believe) that Trump is preferable to Hillary, even though we don't what he will do, because it seems likely that it will at least differ from the current set of disastrous policies? <br><br>I'd like to offer a couple caveats here. I don't like Hillary and do think the status quo is a mess. Also, I am not scared of (or disgusted by or inclined to laugh at) Trump supporters in general. I appreciated your recent series of posts because they've given me support in my campaign to get acquaintances to stop referring to Trump supporters as "mouth-breathing, backward racists" and acknowledge that they are for the most part regular folks legitimately frustrated by being screwed over for the past 50 years. However, the idea of Trump himself as president DOES scare me a lot. It's the combination of uncontrolled ego, complete inability to tolerate criticism or mockery, bullying instincts, and authoritarian principles. <br><br>Also I think the racism thing is a bit more complicated than you made it out a couple weeks ago. I'm not sure it's just a question of does Trump hold prejudiced views. Personally, I'm not sure if he holds any views other than those related to his own greatness. I am sure if it would help him get elected he'd be more than happy to love on Hispanics and Muslims. The point is the opposite is true, so he is doing the opposite. He is USING racism as a tool to rev up people and, at least to some degree, to distract them from the real sources of their distress. What's to stop him from doing the same once he is in office? When, for instance, his people realize he is not going to help them as he promised, and he needs a convenient distraction. (I really am very doubtful that he will help the wage-earners who have suffered most from the neoliberal consensus. Free trade has made him rich! He made his true colors clear in the first debate when he said that U.S. wages were too high if we wanted to compete with China). I am an ESL teacher, so I work with a lot of recent immigrants, many of whom are Hispanic and Muslim, and who are frankly terrified of a Trump presidency. I have to say, I trust their judgment too. Many of them have seen this movie before, in their countries of origin.<br><br>So anyway, while Hillary is the obvious representative of the dysfunctional, corrupt status quo, couldn't things get a lot worse quickly? Personally, I can so easily picture them doing so under a Trump presidency that I am willing to hold my nose and pull the lever for her. What makes you more sanguine about our prospects under him, or at least willing to take that risk?<br><br><a href=#c7405133318029635523 title="comment permalink">5/11/16, 10:39 PM</a><br><br>

A tradition that calls for painstaking weighing of pros and cons in the context of public debate is going to have colorful internal debates over the pros and cons of any proposed social change. To my mind, that's a feature rather than a bug: if everyone comes out spouting identical answers, the ideology in question is too rigid to work in the real world. <br><br>Russell Kirk had a massive influence on the development of my thinking, and his book <i>The Conservative Mind</i> ought to be read by anyone who wants to get a sense of what that much-vexed word "conservative" used to mean; for the benefit of my readers on the left, I'll mention that this lifelong conservative denounced the Iraq war and ripped into the Neoconservatives in no uncertain terms. That doesn't mean I share all his ideas, of course. As for Burke's comment about true religion, well, sure, and if we had any way to know which one of the world's many religions was true, that might actually mean something. As it is, liberty allows us each to choose the religion (or lack of same) that seems best to us, and so we muddle along as best we can. <br><br>As far as libertarianism, though, you've misunderstood me. I don't support the unilateral right of businesses to choose with whom they trade; rather, I support the American custom of allowing certain exemptions from ordinary public-accommodations laws in the case of religious minorities, when that can be done without significant infringement on the rights of others. To my mind, the libertarian movement is a classic example of the opposite of one bad idea being another bad idea -- but that's a discussion for another time. <br><br>Candace, the rights extend as far as law and custom extend them. Remember, rights aren't abstractions; they're agreements. Negotiating the point at which one person's rights end and another's begin is one of the things that the political process is there to do. <br><br>Claire, I know. My own point of view -- which is that mandatory vaccination is justified for serious infectious diseases, and not justified in other cases -- is by and large one that neither side wants to consider.<br><br><a href=#c8968310813161119139 title="comment permalink">5/11/16, 10:41 PM</a><br><br>

I looked it up online and got through about the first half. The Court observed, correctly, that California already had a law that afforded same sex couples exactly the same legal rights, privileges and responsibilities as statutory marriage, but under a different label, civil union.<br><br>The author observed briefly that the proponents of marriage equality might have pursued it by trying to extend civil union to heterosexual couples (who were not eligible) while at the same time removing marriage from the state law codes altogether. "But that is not the case before us."<br><br>That was a road not taken, which IMHO would have accorded better with Burkean conservatism than the victory that was won. The First Amendment forbids an establishment of religion. Logically that means to me that "marriage is between a man and a woman", "marriage is between a man and up to four women", and "marriage is between two consenting adults who are not more closely related than first cousins" are personal opinions, and whether they originate in particular religions is something to which the civil law ought to be indifferent.<br><br>(continued in part 2)<br><br><a href=#c1744595353567990130 title="comment permalink">5/11/16, 11:01 PM</a><br><br>

At the time the gay rights movement was gathering steam, cohabitation and adultery were legal in CA, spouses were not obligated to live together, and all divorce was no fault. This is a very different institution of marriage than the Christian sacrament. The groups that had pushed the successful initiative to ban same sex marriage made no serious effort to overturn the civil union law (equally scandalous to their convictions) because it had been on the books for awhile and most of the public accepted it.<br><br>My read on public sentiment at that tine was that if the gay rights activists in California had gone for getting marriage out of the state law code altogether and substituting universal civil union, they would have had a good chance of getting that passed by the legislature, and it would have made the proposition moot, because "marriage" would no longer have had any legal meaning.<br><br>From a Burkean POV, this would have been a better solution. It would simultaneously have granted equal rights to all adults regardless of sexual orientation, extended societal support for the family unit, and reduced the number of things that people with different moral and religious views can fight over in the courts. People would be obligated to recognize each other's civil unions; recognizing each other's marriages (or not) would be a private matter. The Christian confectioners would be left in peace.<br><br>I understand why the activists chose not to do this. As a practical matter, it's easier as JMG says to extend existing rights to another group than to rewrite the entire state law code, even if in this era a computer can be programmed to do a global search and replace on the term "marriage". Getting rid of legal marriage would have made coordination with all the marriage laws in other states and in Federal law much more difficult. But the main reason, I think, was the one that the majority opinion in the case I'm discussing cited as the basis for its ruling. That is that in our culture, the word "marriage" has a status and dignity that "civil union" does not. Some (not all) gay people wanted that dignity. Some heterosexual (or passing as heterosexual) people wanted to deny it to them. The gay people and their supporters won outright in the end.<br><br><a href=#c5554536526367713682 title="comment permalink">5/11/16, 11:05 PM</a><br><br>

One of the central points of Burkean conservatism is that disagreement is okay. Having different opinions is okay. Arguing like anything to defend your point of view, even when other people disagree with it, is okay -- and it's okay for them to disagree with you, too. Thus it isn't popular among those whose personal insecurities are so extreme that they can't bear the thought that someone, somewhere, might hold a belief they don't like. <br><br>Mister R, no argument there -- as long as you don't go around trying to make everyone else ostracise everyone who goes around trying to make everyone else do something... ;-)<br><br>Kuanyin, the policies that Trump supports aren't coming out of the blue. Backing away from the global economy, reducing US military commitments overseas, enforcing immigration laws, eliminating tax loopholes on corporate income -- all these were standard policy not that long ago, and they produced better outcomes than the neoconservative consensus that Clinton has pursued throughout her political career. I think we can discount her current campaign rhetoric, as that's no more relevant to what she would actually do in office than Obama's cynical sound bites about "hope" and "change," or for that matter George Bush Sr.'s equally cynical rhetoric about a "kinder, gentler America;" the policies she's supported in her career are all but indistinguishable from those of George W. Bush. <br><br>As noted in my post, one of the tasks of a conservative is deciding what is worth conserving, and the specific policies Clinton supports -- giveaways for the rich, punitive austerity for the poor, irresponsible military interventionism overseas, and the like -- are disastrous mistakes for which most Americans are already paying a bitter price. Thus rejecting the continuation of those mistakes in favor of a return to policies that worked better for most Americans is, I would argue, a thoroughly conservative thing to do. <br><br>As for the rest of your argument, you're projecting the same fantasies on him that Obama had projected on him by the frothing end of the Right, and that the Dems loved to project on George W. Bush in his time. Clinton's behavior does not lead me to think that she has any respect for the rule of law, any capacity to tolerate criticism, or any particular willingness to abide by the limits of the Constitution, so I could use exactly the kind of scare-language you've used here in talking about where a Hillary Clinton presidency could go, you know. <br><br>Deborah, granted -- there were always other options. Myself, I think that getting government entirely out of the marriage business is probably something to move toward over the long term, but it's a drastic step, and a simple extension of the right to marry to a population that requested that right was arguably the simpler and less disruptive choice.<br><br><a href=#c5381294016111155745 title="comment permalink">5/11/16, 11:16 PM</a><br><br>

The two areas of contention were 'Birth Control' and 'Euthanasia' medicines. States came up with different approaches to this problem. <br>In Illinois, then-Governor Blagojevitch (sp?) mandated that all pharmacists must dispense all legal medications regardless of their consciences or beliefs, or have their license to practice revoked. Several pharmacists lost their licenses over this, thus never again providing prescriptions of any type to anyone.<br>Tennessee took a Burkean approach, in that private pharmacies were allowed to refuse to dispense one or another med based on conscience, but they had to post their restriction publicly (in the front window and/or at the counter), and were expected to refer a birth-control-pill-seeker to the nearest pharmacy that would provide services, if asked.<br>Walgreens and CVS, who currently control 99.4% of all prescription dispensing in the United States, require conscience-burdened pharmacists to declare their beliefs to management before any incident occurs. I worked for each of them for years, but never knew anyone who tried this route. Not sure if that means 99.4% of US Pharmacists have no beliefs on this, or if those that tried it mysteriously vanished from employment soon after..<br>Bottom line, Burkean Conservatism still makes an appearance every now and then, but certainly not as often as should be the case.<br><br><a href=#c7315893741097851373 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 12:23 AM</a><br><br>

You have once again stated what should be obvious to anyone with half a brain but which sadly has been almost entirely overlooked in recent years. I believe that it was Enoch Powell who said that Conservationism was a methodology not an ideology, although I can't find any evidence for the quote so it is possible that it was somebody else or that I imagined it altogether. In any event it always used to be the case that the British Conservative Party prided themselves on being wholly without ideology, that kind of thing being for the other side. In the view of many on the "New Right" or "Real Right" this lack of ideology on the traditional right has been a fatal flaw in the post World War II era where extreme prosperity and stability have allowed the ideological left to drive social change in the direction that they desire without the negative consequences taking immediate effect. Those negative effects haven't gone away, it's just that we won't become fully aware of what we have lost 'till we need it.<br>Perhaps it's time to give name to the opposite to the "Burkean" mindset. I would like to suggest "Yeswecanism" to which the reply will always be "yes we can, but should we?"<br>Yeswecanism is also the world view of Jack Russell terriers and other small yappy dogs.<br><br><a href=#c2676621899643189285 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 1:43 AM</a><br><br>

I am currently reading Burke's "Reflections". It is a text demanding patience and attention, not to mention a dictionary! So far a few things jump out at me. One is the deep suspicion of revolutions and grand plans to overhaul society. Another may be summed up as "no system of government is better than the people that it is composed of".<br>Yet another worthwhile proposition is best written by Burke himself. "You will smile here at the consistency of those democratists who, when they are not on their guard, treat the humbler part of the community with the greatest contempt, whilst, at the same time, they pretend to make them the depositories of all power". I have and continue to see this contempt in my own country, Pakistan, in the proclamations of the upper middle class folks. They too, proclaim the virtues of truly representative democracy as long as the lower classes vote for their (middle class's) candidates. The poor are condemned for idiotically selling their vote to corrupt politicians. Apparantly, "true" democratic nations don't do this.

Although it is correct that up till now same sex or single sex parents have done as well or as badly as others, does it follow that we should let same sex marriage adopt kids? <br><br>JMG's argument that given nothing untoward has befallen these kids, thus we can let same sex marriage adopt kids is reminiscent of conducting social experiments on kids, in other words a violation of the precautionary principle. <br><br>Furthermore, although war, divorce create single parent families, these situations have not been created on purpose, they are the resultant of the messy nature of life on this planet. <br><br>Adoption by same sex marriages is creating a similar situation artificially and on purpose. <br><br>It is also saying that a father + a mother is the same thing as 2 mothers which is the same thing as having 2 fathers. A non - demonstrable proposition, unless we accept to conduct social experiments. <br><br>In view of the above, I favour the "Pacte social" without adoption. It is a fair deal, that would upset very few people. Exactly in line with the precautionary principle. <br><br>By the way, if same sex marriage is acceptable, what about polygamy or polyandry?<br><br>In view of the above I see no reason to limit marriage to a monogamous relationship (how monotonous!) <br><br>Why not multiple partner marriages, let us say 2 women 3 men, or 5 women 2 men? <br><br>The permutations really are multiple! We can even have temporary marriages, limited in time (automatic divorce after a mutually agreed period).<br><br>Now, please be nice to me in your reactions!<br><br>Thank you!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c7006176451203357157 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 3:39 AM</a><br><br>

I actually have no problem with what you say, maybe not for the "right" reasons. I certainly agree that marriage is essentially a contract between consenting adults the govt should stay out of it. Yes, that means polygamy is OK. Same sex marriage is OK. And, gasp, polyandry. Not that I would do it myself, but frankly, it's none of my business.<br><br>My business, on the other hand, is also essentially a contract between consenting adults for me to untangle their bookkeeping and help them analyze their financial position, or keep track of their donors or customers or whatever, and help manage grants or events or programs or what have you. I don't see why govt should be able to force me to do this for organizations or businesses that are actively working against my interests, such as groups promoting racism, misogyny, intolerance, inequality, etc. I therefore very reasonably expect other business owners to have the same right.

As someone said, why would you want someone who hates you to make you a cake in the first place? <br><br>Regarding health care, that is an area where I simply do not believe we should have a free market in the first place. We need a basic human right to healthcare (not health "insurance") which should include a non-profit single player system and govt provided clinics and hospitals accessible to everyone. As the insulin argument above shows, some things should not be left private business and IMO profiteering off the sick and letting people who can't afford treatment of medicine die is a violation of our constitutional right to life. And where you work should have nothing whatsoever to do with what healthcare you can receive. Medicine is a special case for many reasons. Other nations have recognized that. The US is throttled by monied political interests that won't give up their ability to profiteer without a fight. Maybe a literal fight.<br><br>There's no such basic human right to get a cake from whatever bakery you want. And a local Baker who refuses customers will soon find a competitor who will be happy to take their money. That is how a relocalized economy will work - no more Hobby Lobbys or other giant chains imposing edicts from on high. Just local businesses who either deal with their community or go under.<br><br>The sad fact is that going to legislate some things just doesn't work. It only driver them underground where you can't see what they're doing at first glance. SJWs were astonished by this political season and the issues coming out of the woodwork, and that racism and misogyny still exist, because they thought they had legislated them away. They they began using that fact to try and impose more legislation, which will only make the backlash worse. Things will only change when we as individuals stop feeding the beast with our time and money. Why does anyone still shop at Hobby Lobby? Either because they agree with their positions or they don't care enough to be inconvenienced by going somewhere else. Same for climate change... If we're not willing to put our time and money into doing things differently...well, you get it.<br><br><a href=#c532496740634014395 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 5:46 AM</a><br><br>

It is neither a hope of conservation (classically the hope of keeping the system as it is) nor "progressive" (classically, changing stuctures and laws to fit modernity). It is not conservative in values (resurecting "old" moral values) but rather liberal as the Europeans and the founding fathers understand liberal: The government should have as little say (or rather use the power to regulate as little) as possible. Other than that, I would call it a political process attitude. And it is extremely reasonable.<br><br>Where I disagree is in your understanding of marriage as "something which is allowed." Nowadays it is understood as a contract between two people. This is neither the historical sense (rather it is thought of as a contract between two families and two members/status carriers of a tightly knit community) nor does it have to do with the consequences of marriage:<br><br>When one marries, she can combine her tax rate with that of her spouse and (partially) her children.

Rather it occurs in a context of already shaped and forms traditions and other aspects of a social order. So please take this as an expansion on your points.<br><br>From this perspective, things become a lot more nuanced. One can certainly see same-sex marriage in the West as effecting a certain incremental change as the interaction of families and the greater society interact. As Burke noted, we cannot really speak of universal rights in part because governance is an inexact science. But we can talk about things in a context.<br><br>I would argue that same-sex marriage is an issue that arises from the separation of marriage not only from reproduction but also (and more importantly) from economic production. This change has been happening (with frankly disastrous effects) for the last century or so. Now there is a lot to dislike about the separation of marriage from economic production -- this has head, for example, to a real hegemony by corporations over every area of the economy in the US and most other "developed" countries.<br><br>So I think a real fear a Burkean might have on the issue of SSM in the US is that it makes this very consumerist, industrial economy harder to dismantle and further entrenches these shiny ideas of rights. But on the other hand, things have been moved so far in this direction that it is hard to argue that the harms in recognizing same-sex marriage in the US are greater than the harms of not recognizing it. The harms of recognition are now largely abstract and the harms of not recognizing are very tangible for some people.<br><br>On the other hand, what of a different cultural context? What about the economic order where people still retire with their children, where family businesses hold strong against corporations, where hand-made crafts are still seen as status symbols, etc.? Where gender makes a useful way of dividing family responsibilities over the generations? In such a social context I think the question of harm goes very much the other way.<br><br>One of the problems of course with pointing this out is that people on both sides of the issue tend to designate the independent thinker as the enemy.<br><br><a href=#c2162835877290134821 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 6:01 AM</a><br><br>

As you have stated, it is important to bring meaning back into words, and when dialog between individuals and groups lack proper context for want of proper meaning, dialog breaks down irrational posturing. But as the saying goes, humans are not rational, but rationalizing creatures. <br><br>When words can only draw upon the realm of abstraction, and not from agreed upon norms of conduct and cultural tradition, they can mean absolutely anything. I think a powerful example is how Americans have come to perceive the constitution as an unchangeable, monolithic document, when it was always meant to be a fluid document that would change with the changing social norms and practices as well as the changing self image of society in general. When abstractions are heaped upon a document with clear wording and meaning, anything goes. You don't even have to read it!

It's a shame, really. You've gotten your political label down to 3 words, but I'm sure somebody out there will now go ahead and drag up some mistake Burke made in his youth and accuse you of hypocrisy because of it. (Aha! they'll say.) Then you’ll have to add another couple words.<br><br>Labeling becomes more interesting as the political drifts over to the religious. As for myself, it would be convenient to label myself as a "Conservative Christian" (cue the tomatoes headed at my face, yikes!) but that carries so much baggage in our culture today that it is incomplete as a descriptor, airborne rotten tomatoes notwithstanding. <br><br>In one sense, you have an advantage labeling yourself as a Druid, if only because there are fewer humans in recent memory carrying that banner. You certainly don't have the likes of the infamous Creflo Dollar or Benny Hinn up on stage waving the banner and screaming, "Look at me! I represent the movement!" (Or if you do, not as many.)<br><br>Then there is the curious double standard we see in our national discourse. You raise a very good point by using Orthodox Jews as an example. When an Orthodox Jewish baker, say, refuses to cater a non-Kosher banquet, there's not a peep from the media. Yet a Conservative Christian baker makes a similar convictions-based refusal, and it ignites a firestorm, prompting media denouncings, mocking skits on Saturday Night Live, and accusations such as "wacko" (apparently even from some of your readers). <br><br>Obviously there is a difference in that same-sex marriage is a hot topic at the moment, but I believe it goes beyond that. There seems to be this myth abroad (apologies, I mean 'myth' in the sense of a story that is not true) that the United States used to be a Conservative Christian nation. <br><br>As someone who's studied the Christian scriptures and read a bit of history, however, I'm not sure it ever was. I could understand why today's Conservative Christians would find the myth that the US was once a Christian nation convenient, and tend to use it.<br><br>What I find fascinating, though, is that the media also buys into this myth. Lock, stock, and barrel. Sure, it serves as an excuse to maintain Conservative Christians in their place as the media's favorite whipping boy, but I wonder if it doesn't also serve as a convenient explanation for our current national problems? I'm not sure I can explain how we ended up with this myth so firmly cemented in place. <br><br>Once again, the answer is probably Capital-P Progress. What's old must die. We must shed ourselves of our old (and therefore mistaken) notions. And thus, we ALL must have at one time in the past held said mistaken notions.<br><br><a href=#c3153418143481308835 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 6:20 AM</a><br><br>

I try to avoid applying labels to myself, however, as useful as that can sometimes be, simply because in the highly charged, finger-pointing atmosphere of current US politics, terms like "liberal" and "conservative," "left" and "right," are simply, to use a term you created and that I've since borrowed (thank you!), used as snarl words, hurled at political opponents without regard to their original meaning and without the user's even defining what he/she means by the term.<br><br>So much of our political discourse is also tied up in binary thinking, something you have discussed before: employing of false dichotomies and false analogies. But issues, people, and their viewpoints are far more complex than can be fit neatly into any ideological box. I probably myself have both a conservative and a liberal streak in me. Which streak would prevail in a given situation would most likely depend on the topic under discussion.<br><br>It's quite clear that most self-identified conservatives in the USA are hardly conservative at all. Thank you for making that point clear. It's difficult, though, to get people to understand why this is so.<br><br>I find it interesting that you would use same-sex marriage as the example of how Burkean conservatism works. Have you read Wendell Berry's essay "Caught in the Middle," published in his recent book <i>Our Only World</i>? Berry here discusses sexual politics, specifically abortion and same-sex marriage. He arrives at the same conclusion you do on "gay marriage," but his argumentation is different. Most relevant to your column this week is the way that Berry, simply and straightforwardly, deals with what you here call the “Ewww, <i>gross</i>!” factor: "One may find the sexual practices of homosexuals to be unattractive or displeasing and therefore unnatural. But anything that can be done in that line by homosexuals can be done, and is done, by heterosexuals. Do we need a political remedy for that?"

I would add also that this sort of micromanagement doesn't actually happen in conservative societies. For purposes of this I will say that the simplest test of what sort of society is conservative is that conservative societies usually expect people to retire with their children (and naturally this has implications for things like same-sex marriage). I want to talk more about the implications this has on premarital sex because I think it puts the issue in a different (and more complex) context than we see it in the West.<br><br>When parents retire with their children end up with a real interest in who their children marry. Consequently publicly snubbing one's parents' interests in this regard will get one nowhere, and parents will find ways to enforce their interests. On the other hand, you have the fact that if you don't have a counterbalance to the power parents have, children end up at their mercy. That counterbalance is usually family honor, and the prohibition of premarital sex plays into this. In other words, nobody wants their family to be known as the one where pregnancy preceded marriage, and so when this happens the parents will quickly make sure any objections they have to a given match are left at the door. Almost every culture where parents have a lot of influence have these safety valves for the children to essentially override a parental veto. Premarital sex is one of them and the condemnation is part of what makes it an effective override (because the threat of contageous shame is enough to get them to support the marriage).<br><br>Interestingly enough there is also a lot of evidence that bridal kidnappings in Greece and Rome also had a similar role with the brides often conspiring to be kidnapped, and even the brides parents being in on it if it meant saving face about a lack of dowry or the like.<br><br>Sometimes the condemnation is more functional than the prohibition.<br><br><a href=#c8512841792514346926 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 6:42 AM</a><br><br>

The one area, though, where I find myself differing with you, using the same basic line of reasoning is the position you took on the bakeries. I can see where you’re coming from, and I agree that both sets of rights (the rights of the gay couples, and the rights of the people with religious objections) need to be taken into account, but I think the logic of Burkean Conservatism you’ve laid out could be used to draw the line in a slightly different place based on the place where existing laws draw those lines. The problem with businesses is that they fall under the heading of Public Accommodations, which would, in the process of extending the existing rights granted according to religion, race, gender, etcetera to the gay community would place those couples under the protection of the already existing Civil Rights Act of 1964, and would be upheld by the Heart of Atlanta Motel V United States supreme court case. Therefore, the legal line should be drawn according to what counts as public accommodation. That would mean, someone operating a bakery available to the public would be bound by the same laws that apply to all public accommodations, but that anything outside of that definition would be within legal rights to make its own decisions according to belief (thus, if it was a priest being asked to perform a wedding, or a church or other private institution that does not provide public accommodation being chosen as a venue the law would be on the side of the private institution, and the baker would only be protected if they were not running a shop open to the general public). It does seem like, even from a conservative approach to the legal system, religious accommodations should only apply to religious institutions. Is that fair? Or is it taking a different approach than the one you’re speaking of?<br><br><a href=#c20831548455975901 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 6:57 AM</a><br><br>

The trouble is that a religious minority (in terms of % of the country) is that it can easily clump together to make a religious majority in a particular area. The Christian Right may be a minority on paper but they own huge swaths of the south and would love the opportunity to make it impossible for gay people to live and travel there. And how would it work exactly, making those distinctions between a minority (free to discriminate against otherwise protected categories) and a majority (no)? You'd just have people manipulating what the definition of minority is so they would be free to discriminate. Again, we tried this pre-Civil Rights and the situation was intolerable for large sections of the population.

Reading your post today I can see that Burke must have had a profound impact on James as the process you describe matches almost exactly what James proposes, except that James is applying the same thinking to the individual. James is also interesting, to me, in that he sees pragmatism as a tool to using ideas to make sense of the world, but also as a tool that you can use to judge the ideas you apply, so working inwardly and outwardly (hopefully that is making sense).<br><br>When reading James it occurred to me that his ideas seemed to be very much rooted in Darwinian thinking, but since Burke was writing a century earlier, do you think Darwin was possibly influenced by Burke?

When we are back in the stone age there will be little use for aberrance in any sense as every sexual act and most anything else will have to aid ultimate survival of the species.

North American indians had perhaps similar isolation to Britain. So the concept was similar. Chinese were quite practical and inparticular Egypt had such a multimilennial stabilty based on isolation. Culture generally is a fixed point based on nature, genetics, language in all regions. Violate this in extremis by upending culture, peoples, customs and you will violate Burke.

I'll be thinking about it for awhile. I disagree, however with your argument about bakers being allowed to discriminate based on religious belief.<br><br>I think the baker making a cake for a gay wedding is a bad example. I think pharmacists are a better example, at least in part that the refusal to fill a prescription can have far more serious consequences than refusing to bake a cake. A lot of states (Illinois comes to mind) allow pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions based on the their conscience. These laws were mostly enacted with a mind towards allowing conservative Christian pharmacists from being forced to fill prescriptions for birth control pills. But consider the following. The Church of Scientology does not recognize mental illness and disavows the use of psych drugs. What happens when a Scientologist pharmacist in Illinois refuses to fill a prescription for antipsychotics based on his or her religious convictions?<br><br>I think my response to the issue would be as follows. As a society, we have decided that businesses open to the public have to be open to everyone equally. We've been doing this since the 1960s with respect to race and sex, so it is not a new idea. If you have an objection to filling prescriptions or baking cakes for some group or groups then you always have the option of not going into those professions in order to assuage your conscience.<br><br><a href=#c3993820101042767562 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 7:31 AM</a><br><br>

Just wanted to let y'all know first that I found a house and will start moving into tomorrow. Thank you again for all the positive energy and kind words. <br><br>JMG, belated happy decade posting (was overwhelmed last week)!! I found this blog 2 and a half years ago and it has changed my life profoundly. It hasn't provided a path (truth is a pathless land) but it has provided light to help me pick my way through the woods. Many thanks from the bottom of my heart.<br><br>Re Burkean conservatism: as I've mentioned before, this is essentially the political outlook I have (yes even as a trans person, eccentric etc) and I feel that it is heavily informed by my decade of gardening. I remember once while I was visiting a squat in New Orleans I would later live at, my friends were excited about gardening. There was an enormous lemon balm plant in the garden, which for some reason they wanted to take up to plant something else in its space. The beautiful melissa was dug up and then the main gardener of the house returned. She saw the melissa and got angry "why did you dig it all up??" she cried. They said they wanted to divide it, to plant some chives where it had been. It was promptly replanted and it promptly died.<br><br>Governments are similar to plants. They grow from specific seeds on specific soil. If they are resilient and strong they perrenialize and keep the "weeds" at bay (competing narrow interests of society). Spengler even talks about how politics arises from the plantwise nature of man. If the institutions of governance are violently uprooted then what's gonna grow? Crabgrass? Rocks? It appears historically that after violently uprooting political institutions out come the weeds which fight violently and then the old plant tentatively sends up a shoot from the deep roots that are still lodged in the soil. There is a lot of crying and gnashing of teeth. The garden is in disarray. A lot of people die in utterly idiotic ways. In the end nothing really changes, except there's a few more mass graves, more poverty and maybe the country is now under foreign dominion.<br><br>Also, as a trans person I feel that it is only decent that people who believe that my identity violates their religion have a right to keep me out of their religious spaces/institutions. I believe it would be indecent for me to, say, try to use the ladies room in a fundamentalist Christian Church. Part of the reason I choose to move back to New England from the South is that my trans is less of an issue here for the most part. When leftist queer people to try to push their values down someone else's throat it absolutely disgusts me. Sure, I believe we deserve to have our genders to be legally recognized, and with minimal hassle (my papers are in order and it was a year and a half of crying on the phone with government bureaucrats). But that doesn't negate a certain degree of sensitivity to other people's needs and principals. If I don't want people to destroy my identity what right do I have to try to destroy theirs?! Also more pragmatically I fear that by being insensitive to people's values around sexuality and gender we may be setting the stage for more explosive violence some years down the line. It frustrates me that many people with less vulnerable identities use trans issues as a way of politicking, I've talked with friends with other vulnerable identities (poor people, people of color, etc) and have found that my sentiment is shared by many. I'm interested, and reservedly hopeful, about the shifts in political life that are afoot. My sense is that a lot of allegiances are changing very, very rapidly.<br><br><a href=#c2452289454460116466 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 7:59 AM</a><br><br>

The religious ceremony, in which two people promise to love and cherish each other until death do them part, is completely different. <br><br>The government contract of marriage is designed so that when the two people decide they'd rather be dead than remain married, have the option of divorce, and it gives guidance to how they divide up their property, their house, their kids, their pets, etc.<br><br>It also grants certain benefits, like health insurance, Social Security, etc. This is why civil unions in certain states are not enough.<br><br>My friend has been in a relationship with his partner for over 40 years. About 10 years ago, his partner became seriously ill. His partner did not work and was not on my friend's insurance, because...not married.

I think that we can do better.<br><br>Obama used the ''why invent something new'' when pushing for his mandatory insurance company tithing bill, because, of course, we already had a lot of people who had such insurance through their employers. Of course, we also lready had Medicare, and wouldn't it have been much easier to take out two words "over 65'', then to pass a 1,600 page insurance company written bill? Or, expand community health clinics, which are public and usually free, and which we already have. <br><br>The mandatory vaccination thing is an attack on religious and individual rights, using scare propaganda. We already have well over 95% of children covered for dangerous communicable diseases under existing laws. The religious communities that refuse have their occasional outbreaks of diphtheria and whooping cough, but pose no danger to the vaccinated. Hepatitis B and HPV are not a danger to the Disneyland attending public. The flu vaccine, widely pushed, is usually said by the CDC, the next year, to have been disappointingly ineffective.

Usually those go together, as with many socialists, but sometimes you can get one without the other: either the grand visions of World Enlightenment(TM) due whenever the Age of Aquarius(TM) gets around to starting, or some libertarians' advocacy of self-ownership as the One True Right from which every other right can be logically derived.<br><br>I flirted for quite a while with the latter camp after I ran across the work of Roderick T. Long. The last straw was when I realized that there is simply no good case for the Lockean theory of acquiring property. Locke, of course, argued that we acquire property through mixing our labor with unowned resources. Libertarians love this theory but the obvious counterargument is: why? Why isn't the labor simply expended?<br><br>The best case for it I've seen was by Roderick T. Long, a philosopher I admire quite a bit (he made me take Aristotle seriously). He argued that the Lockean theory explains why we own our bodies: since in eating we mix the materials of the food with our bodies. Analogously, when we mix our labor with resources, they become, in a sense, part of us.<br><br>That always struck me as silly: first, it suggests that eating something someone else owns is analogous to cannibalism. Second, and more damningly, it's completely superfluous: the much simpler, more obvious reason I have a right to use my body is that it's part of what constitutes <i>me.</i> In which case, self-ownership (if you want to call it that) doesn't help explain why you can own anything else.<br><br>This is, of course, the problem with all forms of rationalism: eventually you have to either make unjustified assumptions of the kind you claim to be avoiding, or you have to make really bad arguments for those assumptions.<br><br><a href=#c2691728997776527442 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 8:23 AM</a><br><br>

Thanks for sharing it and laying it out in such concise terms. Though it seems to me that what reliably happens once "Being offended doesn't count" is established, the offendable immediately begin summoning superhuman creativity to explain why That Which Offends is really detrimental to society as a whole, and as such officialdom must take action to prevent people from engaging in it.

Those laws only applies to employees who are handling food, hence the clothed staff in the bar &amp; grill inside the nudist resort, serving all the nude patrons (who generally are required to sit on towels, of course).

Well, the government does set some regulations on public restrooms for health purposes etc. but these are regulations on the proprietor, not on the public's use. While there are things you aren't allowed to do in a public restroom, I can't think of any that aren't also forbidden in all other public spaces. So this does seem to be an extension of government into a new area. Not a good sign.<br><br>Second, this is a restriction, not a permission. The bar just got ten feet... err, I mean, a good bit higher.<br><br>Third, what benefits might accrue from the measure? The argument tend to center around the possibility of men pretending to be transgender women in order to perform various forms of sexual misconduct in the women's room, and women's fear of the same. The latter is a poor argument (on the level with being offended) unless the former is in fact a significant risk... which no one seems to have any evidence to suggest it is.<br><br>Finally, existing laws already penalize the various forms of sexual misconduct that might be engaged in.<br><br>All this strongly suggests that laws regulating who can use which restroom are inappropriate at this time. It's driven by the fear that people are suddenly going to start using a right they have always had to do something that is already illegal, and the only way to combat a sudden epidemic of criminal misconduct is to take that right away.

That is why the government is involved in marriage.<br><br>I would prefer the system they have in Canada, which is, IIRC, based on post-revolutionary French civil law. Civil unions _for all_, and you may have a church wedding and marriage as well in any church which is willing to do so. I agree with Deborah, that the current argument in the U.S. is precisely because of the loaded word "marriage" and the cultural status it confers. The fundamentalist religious right does not want "those people" to have that status, and whichever "those people" (formerly mixed race, now homosexuals or trans) of any particular time do want it. My proposal would likely result in the complaint from christian evangelicals that government was "stripping the right to marriage" from good christians.

After a couple years of crashing now to avoid the rush I'm heading back to get a job in corporate America to pay the bills and would like to report an interesting change in background checks. Today for a new job, I had to explain a Misdemeanor on my record from 2006, where it appears my now ex-wife left empty trash containers out to long at a home I used to own. I have no recollection of the event and apparently paid a $35 fine pleading guilty back then. So I pray for forgiveness and redemption and am working to turn a new leaf away from my criminal past. I am so thankful the report did not pick up the window I broke playing baseball in the alley back in 2nd grade, truly a low point in my life.

Having grown up as a liberal and still considering myself one--though I'd say a combination of farming, being involved in local food systems work, and your incisive writing have all helped to instill quite a streak of Burkean conservatism into me--I have quite often fallen into the mode of grand statements about how things ought to be, rather than simply taking a hard look at the practical outcomes of policy. (Not that I always lost sight of those realities, but it certainly wasn't the basis of my rhetoric.)<br><br>I also really enjoy your explication of classic liberalism, as I have a very strong belief in that constant attempt to live up to ones ideals--both at a personal level and at a societal level. I deal with this struggle internally all the time, as I have some pretty high ideals for myself and, conversely, I am a man who very much enjoys comforts, many of which stem out of contradictions of my ideals.<br><br>We are a messy lot, humans. I think again of my favorite quote from <i>Overshoot</i>: "Using the ecological paradigm to think about human history, we can see instead that the end of exuberance was the summary result of all our separate and innocent decisions to have a baby, to trade a horse for a tractor, to avoid illness by getting vaccinated, to move from a farm to a city, to live in a heated home, to buy a family automobile and not depend on public transit, to specialize, exchange, and thereby prosper." It really, for me, perfectly summarizes the trap we've fallen into. We humans really never were designed to have access to so much and to so easily be able to make choices of comfort that lead to destruction. I don't think we're wired to make that choice right, most of the time.<br><br>Yet, that doesn't excuse us from the need to constantly attempt to make that choice right and to do it more often than not. That's the struggle I have within myself; I am very forgiving of human frailty, my own included, but I also don't think it's an excuse not to act right by the world. So in that way, I suppose I am a liberal. But I also firmly believe that limits are the only way to ultimately bring us into a better balance, and so I suspect that belief puts me in the conservative camp.<br><br>Still, I come back to this notion of social change in the context of pros and cons, and I can't help but love it. It's fascinating to see people take your cake baker example and extrapolate it to other situations that seem similar at first glance. But by taking a measured, pro and con approach and actually considering each case rather than wrapping it in soaring rhetoric of one side or another, you can actually burrow down into considered, imperfect solutions that may function in the real world.<br><br>Good gods, if I lived in that political reality!<br><br>I hope that as our political ecosystem continues to crumble around us, we can find the strength to reorient ourselves to a way of conducting our political lives more in that tradition. In the mean time, I have a lot to think about, and perhaps that process will help me to contribute to a new kind of political functioning in this country.<br><br><a href=#c3877964164020652658 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 10:28 AM</a><br><br>

Get angry at other person, lose track of what point I was actually trying to make.<br>3. Other person responds in kind; cycle repeats. <br><br>I think this is the standard pattern. I really do try not to do this. When it comes to analyzing a piece at leisure, I'm a little better. I can do a close-reading of an essay and figure out what the writer's argument is and whether it actually works. But you are able to do the same thing in real time, with comments that aren't neatly laid out in essay format, without leaping to an emotional reaction or losing the thread of your own thoughts.

First, what do you think of the "right to deny service" argument as it applies to corporations? For all that we ostensibly hold them to legally be people, the idea that a corporation could hold religious beliefs has never sat well with me. Second, during the civil rights movement we had to legislate restaurants, for example, to serve African-Americans, overriding their right to deny service in order to counter-balance a pervasive and in some places ubiquitous cultural resistance to a legislated right. How would you contrast that situation with the gay marriage debate?<br><br>I really appreciate hearing your thoughts on this.

I admire your eloquence and clarity in untangling complex issues and putting words to vague ideas that are difficult to explain clearly.<br><br>In this particular case, I have a difficult time with the concept that religion should be able to be used as a foundation for any difference in treatment under the eyes of the law. By this logic, it should seem reasonable that any particular discrimination should be tolerable, so long as the discriminator cites a religious edict for doing so. Part of the problem I have with this is the definition of religion. If I were a card-carrying Satanist for example, should I be allowed to exclude anyone who seems overtly Christian (or any church-going religion for that matter) from my business?<br><br>To clarify, I'm not advocating that businesses should not be able refuse service to anyone, just that religion should not be made as a special-case for such exclusion.

The only rights you really have are those which you can successfully assert against a force outside yourself saying you do not have that right. Membership in a higher social class is helpful in asserting perceived rights since that status confers more political, economic, legal power that can be brought to bear in defense of said perceived rights.

They are Burkean as they lack abstraction, writing, complex verbalizationn and therefore live in the now. How to experience this? I work around a lot of people doing cleaning but like a servant am of a lower class. My commiunication is minimal. So I observe those above me like a dog his master. Read moods from face and body language, tone of voice, eyes. To me they might have no past, married, any kids, political opinions, even name unknown, just rapid fire instructions. Regardless or because of this one gets to know who they all are at a very basic level. I live 'now' amongst them. Like a dog guessing where its master is gone to when a certain person is not at work, pehaps sick, on vacation, quit, later shift. Humans live in their heads as they talk a lot, have opinions, abstract. I generalize about all the people, try to guess age, star sign, hobbies, family status due to behaviour patterns. We all make assumptions when we meet new people, generalize. Sexism, racism are built up on visceral feelings we get from group interaction, mostly in youth. In this sense we are burkean in our prejudicial behaviour towards friendships, marriages, grouping tendencies. See slow assimilation of ethnic and racial types. <br><br>Religions, social theories, science, philosophies come and go as these are peripheral concepts. An individual remains as is since birth. Each persn has a standard mood, capabilities which remain same. One is happier, another more sad, another more serious, etc. We can develop ourselves through training or ameliorate highs and lows through techniques like yoga, alcohol, social contacts, aerobics, etc. We adapt our potential to our environment. Animals do same. If you had pets you notice as with kids different moods as standard personality traits.<br><br>Being a wage earner, always running, more mute than communicative makesme more in tune with my animal, burkean self. Sitting all the time alone at a school desk, dorm room desk or office computer effected my social capabilities negatively. Not talking, just observing develops intuition.French and German or Chinese philosophers and social theoreticians were perhaps eggheads of sorts. Thatcher called EU treaty on single currency cloud cucko land. She is turning out to be right. The Fed and QE, NIRP is all crazy. Like Byzantium we will have to fall back to a simpler more common sense model based on real human behaviour. Trump and Bernie Sanders are tapping into common sense just like Le Pen and 5 star and Podemos. The more reality separates from theory the greater the backlash in politics, science, religion. Industrialism for example is based on theory. We can have it all. No price to pay. You can't have a free lunch. Brain cancer from mobile phones, skin cancer from sunny vacations, lung cancer from cigs, microwave ovens denaturating food. Ozone destruction by CFCs. Bees dying off due to pesticides. Antibiotics running out of effectiveness. Run off from agriculture. <br><br>Animal instinct plus human intellect drives shortsighted behaviour. If we want something, we go get it, like predators. Overeating, sex, addictions. Human intellect alows us to rationalize away our behaviour. Religion, politics make us to gods or servants of god. We are allowed as inspired by god or intellect to take everything, do anything.<br><br><a href=#c3550642823125028094 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 11:58 AM</a><br><br>

That’s the common-sense rule that before you do anything, you need to figure out whether it’s going to do more good than harm. "<br>The principle deserves a more precise formulation than that. It is, that if there is a possible hazard, uncertainty dictates caution - that is, not taking the contemplated step. It is expressed precisely by the solid yellow line in the middle of the highway: there is a known hazard, oncoming traffic; and because you cannot see whether that hazard is oncoming, you must not cross into its path. (In general, traffic laws and practices express very practical wisdom, because the consequences of mistakes are so dramatic and immediate.)<br><br>You're right that Burkean conservatism, as described here, is equivalent. "Look before you leap," as the maxim says - and don't leap if you can't see what's there. There is also the first law of tinkering: save all the pieces.<br><br>I've long noted that conservationists are the only real conservatives these days. In fact, the "left" has been very conservative, notably in its opposition to "free trade." What we're really doing is trying to conserve the regulatory and welfare systems that make capitalism bearable. There is probably a better way, but "laissez faire" (an old term for "free trade") isn't it.<br><br>The bigger picture is that "liberal" and "conservative" have become grab-bags of proposed policies. There are overarching themes to each; the Green Party tries to make those explicit with its 4 Pillars and, in the US, 10 Key Values. But in practice the grab-bags are pretty arbitrary. This is the interesting thing about Trump: insofar as he expresses policies, he lands solidly on both sides of the usual line. Apparently the resulting blend is surprisingly popular, especially in such a defiant package, but Republican "conservatives" hate it.<br><br><a href=#c5832520205742581648 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 12:20 PM</a><br><br>

In other words, a third party Green Party maybe also including the Working Families Party (of which I am a member) coalition is being contemplated for the fall election. One Senator Ben Sasse from Nebraska has promised to walk out of the Republican Convention; it remains to be seen how many he can take with him. Sasse is known to have Presidential ambitions himself. I consider it highly likely that there will be at least two major, believable third party challenges this fall, and that the election might well be decided in the House of Representatives. To that end, the Democratic Party is doing everything it can to stack the House with pro-Hillary conservadems, many of whom are former Republicans.

New York is very interesting (and unique in the US) in that we probably have christian fundamentalists (since we have everyone), but you never hear from them. We've got the Jehova's Witnesses, but no one takes them seriously (and they are now fabulously wealthy due to owning a large chunk of now super-Hipster downtown Brooklyn). We've got muslims of course; my last encounter with one was my old next door neighbor, who chased away a known bike thief from my bike, so I owe him one, and he always left his "Happy Ramadan" signs up way after Eid, just like the people who never get around to taking down their christmas trees and showing that human nature is universal.<br><br>The place where religion gets political is, bluntly, Judaism (and I hope no-one accuses me of anti-semitism here). The ultra-orthodox can, honestly, be pains in the neck. What's interesting is the people I see who are the most anti-Satmar are other Jews. My old boss is Jewish and he once went on a rant abut them that from a gentile would be seriously unacceptable (and I've heard they are even more hated in Israel because they are exempt from military service). But the conflicts are at a relatively low level of heat, because, lets be clear, who can imagine NY without Jews? (bye by bagels, pastrami and so much else). No one seriously thinks that anyone is going to cart them off, anti-semitism is pretty socially unacceptable (at least among most classes). But you've seen conflicts over things like bike lanes (which they object in their neighborhood due to "indecently dressed" women), the last Brooklyn DA was primaried out due to credibly evidence he'd covered up sexual abuse in their community, theirs the occasional scandal around one of their "neigborhood watches" beating up people, etc etc. I've got multiple woman friends who've bought things at their stores and rolled their eyes at some of the things (they usually have a less-orthodox jew on staff to talk to women). But it all sort of works out and people are mostly pretty level headed. So it gives me hope that it's possible.<br><br>The other big difference is of course the power dynamic: They don't have enough power that they will seriously ever challenge anyone. Whereas there are parts of the country where it really does seem like there is a minority that wants to turn them into a christian version of Saudi Arabia.<br><br><a href=#c1154838507161508302 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 5:41 PM</a><br><br>

I question this type of thinking when confronted by a rapid and significant change of circumstances, as might be confronting us in the form of rapid climate change or resource depletion. I am not saying that humans are smart enough to invent to systems or structures from scratch, that is usually a disaster as you point out. But perhaps there might come a time when we must abandon our current structures and paradigms wholesale and fall back on some other system that has proven to respond better to such extreme circumstances. Of course the gold star in anthropology would go to the one who could identify such a culture. Perhaps with what is coming down the pike, the Pirate Societys of the Caribbean might be a good model, or maybe the orginazational structure of Genghis Khan.<br><br><a href=#c2439165071565723407 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 6:19 PM</a><br><br>

I wonder whether a lot of the pro-Sharia types in Europe went there precisely because the folks back home weren't interested. <br><br>Greg, with regard to the country clubs, keep in mind that it's hard to play golf without a golf course, and if nearly all the golf courses in your state are the property of segregated country clubs, you've got a problem. Since the people owning the country clubs weren't religious minorities, for whom special accommodations have traditionally been made in America, it wasn't unreasonable for people of color who wanted to play golf to press for access to the country clubs. <br><br>YCS, it shall indeed. You've made an important point, though -- the stunningly parochial thinking of those affluent liberals who can't imagine that anyone might have a valid reason to disagree with them. <br><br>Nati, the changes in marriage didn't happen because of changes in government policy. The government policies changed, bit by bit, because millions of Americans were dissatisfied with older notions of marriage, and altered their own marriages accordingly. I'm part of that process; my wife and I have been married for 32 years, and it's been a happy marriage precisely because we negotiated (and renegotiated) the terms of the relationship rather than accepting the frankly dysfunctional models of marriage our culture and our families presented us. If you want to see that as a revolution, by all means -- but remember that Burke supported the American Revolution...<br><br>David, John Stuart Mill is one of the great names of classic liberalism, and yes, he put a lot of effort into coming up with an ideal that would be generally accepted and could thus be used to guide public policy. As I noted to A Post-Millennial earlier, that sort of thing is the natural complement of Burkean conservatism, and if you find classic liberalism more to your taste, by all means. <br><br>Professor D., that only follows if you ignore the immense harm that was being caused by the Victorian approach to marriage, fixate solely on the harm that's been caused by the current version, and redefine the replacement of the older form of marriage by the current form amounts to the "destruction" of marriage. None of those seem valid to me. I can't speak for your circle of friends and acquaintances, but I know plenty of people who are more or less happily married, so it's a bit much to claim that marriage has been "destroyed" -- I'd say, rather, that it's changed, and the problems that have followed the change are inevitably different from those that preceded it.<br><br>Cherokee, how do you take rights away? By the same process that brings them into being. If a community, acting through its institutions, says, "This right no longer exists," then that right no longer exists. We do this all the time; when a judge sends a criminal to jail, the judge is saying in effect, "The community has decided to deprive you of most of your rights, in response to the crime you've committed." Bang! The rights are gone. Since a right is simply an agreement on the part of a community to permit some behavior, that's all it takes. <br><br>Fudoshin, oh, granted, the Traditionalist approach becomes very appealing as a society runs into increasingly serious trouble, and I expect to see a lot of that sort of thing as industrial civilization winds down. Sometimes it's a good idea, as when hearkening back to older traditions allows for the preservation of worthwhile things that would otherwise be lost. Too often, though, what you get is a sort of roleplaying game at gunpoint, where everyone is required to pretend that they live in some supposed golden age of the past.

Especially where you commented that<br>“...when human beings insist that the tangled realities of politics and history can be reduced to some set of abstract principles simple enough for the human mind to understand, they’re wrong. Another is that when human beings try to set up a system of government based on abstract principles, rather than allowing it to take shape organically out of historical experience, the results will pretty reliably be disastrous.”<br><br>I agree with your premises, and would remark that, at this time men become dogmatic.

A single payer system has its problems, but even at their worst, they're better than the corrupt and dysfunctional mess we've got at the moment. <br><br>Scotlyn, I'd agree that there are both private goods and public goods worth, shall we say, conserving! One of the pleasant features of Burkean conservatism is that it does tend to make for good neighbors, as negotiation, compromise, and a lack of interest in rigid ideological positions comes with the package.<br><br>Germandom, er, whatever; you seem to have some very narrow definition of the word "stance," which is not the one I'm using. <br><br>Scotlyn, delighted to hear it. Are you getting the occasional bursts of absurd good luck yet? <br><br>Chris, I fail to see how same-sex marriage has any connection to the abandonment of the household economy; I know same-sex couples, one member of which is a stay-at-home housewhichever, and in at least one of those cases he makes a pretty fair contribution via the household economy. I've spoken before of the massive benefits of restoring the household economy to its former importance, and where that's concerned, it seems to me, any family -- however constituted by gender -- could make that choice. <br><br>Dan, exactly. The US Constitution is a set of agreements about how the states and the people will manage their political destiny together. It's been amended many times, and quite a few of those amendments were for the better; it could quite frankly use some more amendments right now. <br><br>Blue Sun, oh, we have them in Druidry; they just don't get as much publicity. As for the mythology, of course -- affluent liberals are deeply into the myth of progress, affluent pseudoconservatives are deeply into the myth of decline from a golden age, and both have cooperated in spreading the fantasy that the US used to be a conservative Christian nation, in the teeth of the evidence. How many people remember that John Chapman, aka Johnny Appleseed, was a Swedenborgian missionary, and that Thomas Jefferson wrote up a version of the Gospels from which, as he put it, every statement that would not be accepted as evidence before a modern jury had been deleted? This has been a country of religious radicals, eccentric beliefs, freethinkers, occultists, and bona fide nutjobs since about fifteen seconds after the <i>Mayflower</i> sighted land, and I wish people would stop pretending otherwise. <br><br>Don, no, I haven't read that Berry essay, and clearly I'll have to remedy that. Of course he's quite correct; technically speaking, the one difference between gay sex and straight sex is that straight couples have one additional option, which can sometimes result in pregnancy. <br><br>Chris, and those cultures will have their own decisions to make about what counts for appropriate behavior, of course. Thanks for the anecdote about Kirk!<br><br>Eric, and that's exactly the sort of debate that's involved in settling where the line is going to be drawn.

Sure, I'd be happy to have a look at it. <br><br>Johnny, it's entirely possible that Darwin was influenced by Burke; a lot of people in 19th century Britain read and discussed Burke, so direct and indirect influence are both possible. As for Dewey, he's one of the philosophers I've been meaning to get to for a while now; as I think I mentioned a while back, I tend to study philosophers one at a time, and fairly intensively, but his turn is coming. <br><br>Ed, granted, there are times when things become so chaotic that conserving much of anything becomes all but impossible. That said, the effort's often worth making. <br><br>Wagelaborer, the people who insist that they're going to "take to the streets, smash the state, and have a revolution" -- do they ever actually do anything about that shopworn fantasy? Or do they just sit around with their hands in their shorts daydreaming about the subject? The soi-disant revolutionaries I've met have all belonged to the latter category. Of all the classes and categories of people in today's America, they pose the least threat to the status quo. <br><br>Don, Trump has also talked at length about normalizing relations with Russia, getting our allies to do more for their own defense, and focusing on rebuilding here at home instead of overthrowing governments overseas. I think there's some chance that, if he's elected, he would be less likely to get us into yet another round of useless wars. Clinton? Based on her record, a vote for her might as well be a vote for George W. Bush. I'm not a Trump fan; I find some of his policies and a good deal of his posturing very unwelcome; but if it comes to a choice between him and Clinton (and I hope it doesn't come to that; I still think Sanders has a chance) I really do think he's the lesser evil. <br><br>Chris, okay, let's take a look at what you're doing. You're shifting the discussion from wedding cakes to pharmacies, and why? In order to find a general principle that you can apply to all such cases. (That's what I get from your discussion of both as "examples." Examples of what?) This is exactly the sort of thinking I reject. It's been said that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, but it might be said with even more truth that consistency is the mother of bad laws. Rather than finding some grand abstract principle that will inevitably yield injustices on one or the other end of its application, the Burkean approach is to treat each case on its own merits: i.e., since nobody ever died from not getting a professionally baked wedding cake, wedding cakes involve different issues and different constellations of rights and responsibilities than pharmacies do, and reasonable accommodation can quite readily apply to one but not the other. <br><br>Vesta, nicely phrased. Accurate, too.<br><br><a href=#c174520217185363390 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 7:35 PM</a><br><br>

With Burke (and Mr Greer) I see that history shows the terrific and brutal power that governments can command, often by people with good intentions who all too often feel forced into grim decision by necessity. It seems wise to accept a priori limits on such power, and think hard before deploying it.<br><br>But of course this means that government can't grant all petitions, redress all grievances, or set the shape of society. Society under such a government must have its discontents, and even some left behind completely, and the people in charge will have to be able to tell them "too bad; sometimes we can't just change things."<br><br>Is anyone really ready to accept that?<br><br>I'm fatalistic about it. A basically steady-state government structure seems out of reach now. Cultures are larger than governments, as they say, and as a culture we're tumbling. Society always has divergent views, but we seem to be in a place where views have moved past the disagreement stage and gone straight to the stage where people can't communicate with each other, even enough to disagree.<br><br>Imagine three people sit down, in all sincerity, to discuss government policy: a 60-something church-going religious conservative who barely used the Internet except email at work and exchanging the occasional picture of his granddaughter, an old school McDworkinite anti-porn down-with-the-Patriarchy radical feminist, and a non-religious libertarian electrician who owns his own truck and has two younger employees with whom he is always frustrated and complains that they don't show up on time (likely due to drug problems).<br><br>These people would not disagree on policy issues. They wouldn't even be able to discuss policy issues. The conservative and the libertarian would agree on lower taxes, but that would sound like code for racism and privilege to the feminist. The feminist and the libertarian would agree on certain social issues, but that would sound like Satanic destruction of society to the conservative. The conservative would favor the privileging of heterosexual marriage, which would sound like female slavery and white-male oppression to the feminist, and like moral authoritarianism to the libertarian.<br><br>Where do we go with Burkean conservatism when society is atomized and divergent to the point where we can no longer talk? Where reigning systems are intolerable to so many, and the proposed changes are odious to so many more?<br><br><a href=#c6526257247041672829 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 8:49 PM</a><br><br>

She’s suing the company on the grounds she should have right to wear “comfortable” flat shoes. If she wins her case, should this right be extended to all those poor white collar guys forced to wear suits and ties to work on hot days. Why can’t they be allowed to work in more comfortable shorts and flip flops? Is this the beginning of the slippery slope?<br>Just an example that the line is always hard to draw and depends on the circumstances.<br>I can understand and sympathize with your aversion to wearing a black tent with eye slits, but you are ok with some women having the right to do this in your neck of the woods (even if its not really their personal choice but something they are forced to by their culture)? <br>On the other hand, if you found yourself in a country with Sharia law, Islam as the state religion, and a traditional patriarchal culture, your right to appear in public in shorts and low cut top might not exist, or if it did, it would only be applied to “crazy Western tourists who bring us lots of hard cash and only flaunt themselves around the fenced-in swimming pools of expensive hotels“.<br><br>I think there is a tendency in most of us to want clear-cut simple solutions to all the problems of society.

Most of us know, by direct experience, that a father is not the same as a mother. From direct and common experience a mother is worth much more than a father to a kid. <br><br>The question is, are we, as a society, ready and willing to deprive a kid intentionally and permanently of a mother by allowing 2 men from adopting a kid just because the empirical evidence is neutral?<br><br>If I were a legislator, I would be extremely reluctant in doing that. It very much sounds like children rights are not being fully respected at this point. <br><br>Laws need to rest on fundamental principles, not on empirical evidence.

The kinship is more than analogical, in fact: the conservative method, as you might call it, should draw on the results of the social sciences as well as history (though the various social scientific doctrines have to be evaluated by their performance in the real world – as should the conservative method itself). The sciences have many virtues: besides being better than other methods of investigating the world, they encourage people to ask the right questions and to tolerate doubt and disagreement. Science can become haughtily dogmatic, especially when it contradicts common sense. Behaviorism is the first example that springs to mind. But behaviorism was defeated much more easily than the ideologically-rooted pseudoscience of, say, the Nazis and Soviets. Science – and presumably imaginative Burkean conservatism – is as capable of producing bad ideas as anything else, but it is usually better at destroying them.<br><br>2) One of the big problems for the social sciences is how to categorize things. That is what adjusting for confounders is all about, but that only works if you have a large enough sample size. To the extent that conservatism draws on history, it will often have to choose between adjusting for confounders and having a reasonable sample size. Furthermore, although there are conventional confounders to control for in studies of individuals, it isn't clear what confounders there are for societies. Often it will be unclear on which side of a binary (or where on a spectrum) a country should go. In the case of Latin American immigration, for example, reasoning from all the historical cases of mass immigration will produce an unhelpful mess. They are too dissimilar. You could narrow it down by working with cases of immigration into democracies, or cases of immigration into declining great powers, or cases of immigration in which the immigrants were relatively culturally united (e.g. <i>not</i> 19th century mass immigration to the Americas), or cases of immigration into the US Southwest (e.g. the Chinese, the Dustbowl refugees, the Sunbelt migration). If we had more historical cases than we do, we could treat all of this scientifically, and get results of the same (doubtful) quality as those of the social sciences. As it is, we don't have much to go on as to which of these measures is best. The USA has been pretty good at assimilating immigrants, but falling civilizations have been pretty bad at it. Working from economic data will provide an equally uncertain position. At this point, the method falters. Recourse to something beyond it is necessary in order to make a decision. I think the usual conservative answer would be to do what is less risky, but this does not seem to be required by the method.<br><br><br><a href=#c8848866308728256648 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 10:37 PM</a><br><br>

Any account of the world, especially one simple enough to work as a political platform, will generalize about the world in ways that correspond well enough to reality at one time, but become increasingly detached from it as time goes on (this account included?), so it is important to continually overcome old dogmas. And it is good to encourage disagreement. Without it, whichever dogma has a momentary advantage will solidify its position and stop requiring rigorous arguments of itself. The lower the standard of argument, the longer until it becomes clear that the old system has stopped working. It is necessary, however, for a political movement to actually have political positions. The tension between these two goods seems to have collapsed in favor of the second, creating the modern conservative movement. A better solution might have been to acknowledge that any particular conservative movement's endorsed positions may be wrong, but also that it is necessary to take a position in politics and defend it against people whose methods are theoretical and ideological. This is a rather weak hand politically, unfortunately.<br><br>4) It seems that all political thinkers could and should be conservatives of this kind (just as all physicists should be scientists), including political radicals. Violent revolutionaries couldn't be conservative, but someone trying to create a fundamentally different social order could go about in a consensual, reversible manner. I know that some radical circles stress building alternative institutions now, within the old system, with the hope that they will be able to function better than their official counterparts, and thus attract enough of the population that the eventual transfer of power would be relatively easy and the new government relatively stable. This seems to me like a reasonable conservative course of action. This is sort of what happened in the American Revolution, or so it seems to me. It's not clear that it could work in a non-colonial situation, though federalism seems to allow for it in a smaller way (as in the history of women's suffrage).<br><br>Vaguely on topic, since you mentioned the religion of Progress and I have mentioned failures of science: a friend tells me that satellite designers have realized that much of their work could be done with sophisticated hot air balloons orders of magnitude more cheaply. I don't know enough to speculate about the implications for deindustrial technology.<br><br><a href=#c8457536435923070142 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 10:37 PM</a><br><br>

To my mind, any claim that history is going somewhere in particular is mythology -- and all things considered, if I want to read mythology, I'll pick up the Mabinogion or a volume of Ovid. <br><br>Violet, congrats on finding a new place to live! Thank you, and kudos as well, for a clearly expressed statement of one of the least common virtues these days -- the recognition that even people who don't like you have rights, too. <br><br>Wagelaborer, exactly -- there are crucial differences between marriage in civil law and marriage as it's interpreted by many of our American religious traditions. If two people want to have a religious interpretation apply to their marriage, great -- here again, the marital choices of legally competent consenting adults are nobody's business but their own -- but the state has no business forcing some particular religious interpretation on everyone. <br><br>Lynnet, it's specifically in the Talmud, which is the core body of Jewish religious law. You'd have to discuss the matter with an Orthodox rabbi if you want to know more, though. But you're right, of course: it's a matter of figuring out where to draw the boundaries. The point where something is specifically prohibited in religious law is one workable choice, when larger issues aren't involved. <br><br>RPC, to my mind, you'd have to justify the claim that society's interest in demanding a particular kind of childrearing environment supersedes the right of individuals to manage their own private affairs, including the raising of children. I'd be very slow to accept the claim that government can be trusted with the right to decide how children are to be raised, outside of very basic health and safety issues; consider how badly the Federal government has messed up education in this country by zealously pursuing a set of fashionable theories!<br><br>David, exactly. I really do have to do a post here on the separate-spheres doctrine at the heart of the political philosophy of liberty, don't I? Your co-worker has the right to let her religious beliefs shape her political opinions, because the one place that the religious and political spheres can be allowed to overlap in a free society is in the individual conscience. More on this later on. <br><br>James, excellent! Yes, utopianism and rationalism tend to run together -- it's so tempting to think that you can rationally play out a society and have it come out perfect. The mere fact that this has been tried countless times, with reliably disastrous results, never dissuades the true believer. There are, as I see it, two flies in the ointment; the first is the issue you've raised here -- the hard fact that no logical system can prove its own first principles, and so you've always got some degree of Garbage In, Garbage Out rising from the foundations. The second is that the universe is not a rational phenomenon -- or, put another way, what we call "reason" is simply the set of habitual ways of data processing that turned out to be that little bit more successful in keeping our ancestors fed, mated, and out of the jaws of cave bears than the alternatives. Reason is not the truth about the world, and trying to make the world follow rational patterns always ends in disaster.<br><br><a href=#c6659302637309448300 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 10:40 PM</a><br><br>

As for the link between these points and the Cimmerian hypothesis, hmm! I hadn't thought of that, but you're right -- it's the mental equivalent of a wholly built-up environment in which nobody has to worry about nature intruding. <br><br>Bill, exactly. I don't patronize stores with the Jesus fish on the signs or the advertising, either. <br><br>Jeffinwa, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>James, no argument there. I thought it was very telling that the moment the pseudoconservative right lost the fight against same sex marriage, they basically ran out and found something else to get offended about -- it's as though they've become addicted to a state of moral panic. When they lose this one, maybe we can get them to fly off the handle about naked dogs in public -- after all, innocent children might be traumatized by seeing a dog's bare genitalia. Oh, the horror! <br><br>In addition to the points you've made, I'd point out, first, that transsexual people have been using bathrooms corresponding to their nongenetic sex for as long as there have been transsexual people, without causing any of the consequences the pseudoconservative right is shrieking about these days; and second, that if we want to pass regulations to keep people from perpetrating sexual acts in bathrooms, we should logically start with those most likely to do so. Congressmen have been caught far more often engaging in sex acts in public bathrooms than transsexuals have -- thus, if the actual point of the exercise is to decrease the likelihood that children are exposed to sex acts in public bathrooms, passing laws banning Congressmen from using public bathrooms would seem to be a much higher priority. I expect to see the defenders of America' precious bodily fluids proposing such legislation at once.<br><br><a href=#c7127595798637816928 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 11:11 PM</a><br><br>

The difference between what I'm suggesting and standard libertarianism is that libertarians try to ground their arguments on grand abstract principles, and so end up proposing extreme views mandated by those principles, instead of trying to work out pragmatic compromises based in history. <br><br>Zach, oh, good -- I was hoping that somebody would fall into that trap. Why should American law and custom allow reasonable accommodation for the beliefs of religious minorities? Is there some grand abstract principle that justifies that? Nope. It so happens that most Americans have tended to agree that this is a good idea, and from the standpoint of Burkean conservatism, that's all the justification it needs. <br><br>Glenn, and that's also an option, though I don't know that it's the best one -- again, all we have to do to make same sex marriage work in the US is to change a few words in a few places in the laws governing marriage, and there you go. <br><br>MickGspot, I'm not at all surprised. Since the supply of labor so vastly exceeds the demand at this point, all kinds of silly things will be popping up to decrease the number of job applications that human resources departments have to process, and that's one of them. <br><br>Joel, you're welcome and thank you. The thing is, we live in a society in which the political institutions were designed with that kind of back and forth in mind, and they could still be used for that purpose. What's needed is a relearning process by which a significant number of Americans start thinking of politics, not as a place to park extremist fantasies, but as the process by which people of many different opinions figure out how to live together in peace. I think that's possible; if I didn't, I wouldn't have posted this essay. <br><br>Steve, hmm. It wouldn't be a single post; it might have to be an entire sequence -- but I'll think about it. (So to speak.) <br><br>Jeff, the drastic and extremely unwise innovation by which corporations have been given legal personhood needs to be reversed; one of the amendments to the US constitution I'd support soonest is one that restricts the rights of personhood to natural persons, i.e., actual human beings. That's my response to your first question. As to the second, I've already addressed that. As I noted in my post, the rule of thumb I'm invoking here is that "reasonable accommodation should be made to religious minorities when this can be done without violating the agreed-upon rights of others." The Jim Crow laws were not reasonable accommodation to a religious minority, and they did violate the agreed-upon rights of others, so they were rightly thrown out. <br><br>FLWolverine, that last comment of yours, to my mind, sums things up pretty neatly -- because I'm quite sure we can expect that sort of behavior no matter who becomes President next January. <br><br>Nephilimsd, that sort of demand for consistency is very common; the problem is that any rule applied consistently ends up producing injustice at one or another end of its application. It's customary in American law to provide reasonable accommodation should be made to religious minorities when this can be done without violating the agreed-upon rights of others. Is that inconsistent? So long as it helps people of different beliefs live together in relative peace, I don't see that consistency matters at all.<br><br><a href=#c265162240008421888 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 11:29 PM</a><br><br>

For example if most people were self-employed and few W2/1099 forms were filed, income taxes would be largely unenforceable (ad in fact they are unenforceable in Indonesia, where I lived for 4 years).<br><br>Without income and corporate employment, both corporate pensions (and similar plans like 401k's) and public pensions (like social security) become out of reach for most people. So the alternative means of support is to retire and live with one's children and help them raise one's grandchildren. Family businesses thus achieve the same sort of immortality that corporations currently enjoy in the current social order in the West.<br><br>So those are two huge differences. This then leads to the points I made about premarital sex and family honor. Having a *functional* condemnation of premarital sex only works when you have functional family honor because this allows pregnancy to have political power in the family politics of marriage.<br><br>What these things then mean is that marriage ends up being an institution which is largely framed in terms of one's social duties to one's parents rather than one's own quest for personal fulfillment. And one has a duty to one's parents to get married and have children of one's own if one is able to.<br><br>Another thing is that in these cases you have some other problems to deal with that you don't have in a corporate economy. How do you spread around the means of production to the next generation? In my wife's culture, men inherit the business and women inherit the family responsibilities. Hence men marry into family and women marry into business.<br><br>This is not to say one could not imagine a family household business economy where same-sex marriage was recognized. But when you start looking at actual such economies today, one tends to see a lot of things that would have to change to make same-sex marriage actually attainable and that means you have some real harm arguments which don't apply in the West. After all, it is one thing to argue for SSM if nothing else needs to change. It is different to argue that everything else can change to accommodate such a purported right. So on one hand, that's something which ties SSM as an issue to reduction in birth rates (because having children is no longer conducive to retiring in a good lifestyle), and so also the harm issue across this divide.<br><br>BTW and as an aside this gets to what I think a lot of Americans don't understand about Third World countries. The term of course comes from the idea that these countries were non-aligned in the cold war but people in the US, because they see a force of history going in one direction, think they are in the process of becoming like the US, but in fact developing nations have many different critiques of Western social and economic order and don't want to follow us. They see a culture of isolation and loneliness.<br><br><a href=#c885882714497391276 title="comment permalink">5/12/16, 11:43 PM</a><br><br>

In this case, "works" can mean anything from "prevents a society from descending into failed-state conditions" on up. In any specific example, you need to figure out what's completely broken, what's malfunctioning but could be repaired with a bit of maintenance, and what's purring away just fine. As I noted in my post, France on the eve of the revolution had a government that was as incompetent as it was despotic, and serious changes needed to be made -- but the result of the Revolution was not an improvement on the Bourbon regime, unless you think economic collapse, mob rule, mass murder, the effective abolition of civil rights, and the rise of a tyrant for whom France was just one huge arsenal to feed his military ambitions count as an improvement! <br><br>Zachary, part of the problem is that word "shouldn't." It's astonishing how few people these days grasp the difference between a statement of fact and a value judgment. More on this in a future post!<br><br>Buzzy, thanks for the info!<br><br>Rapier, yes, your comment was what kicked this off, for which thank you. I use the term "pseudoconservative" deliberately for the post-Reagan movement; the current right wing in the US is as starry-eyed a bunch of utopian fantasists as you can find anywhere -- they've just taken their abstractions from Ayn Rand and an assortment of cherrypicked Bible passages rather than from Karl Marx. Will that last? I suspect it won't -- but we'll see. <br><br>WB Jorgenson, when people ask me that, I tend to say, "Neither. Why do you insist that there can only be two sides?" Then their brains melt and dribble out their ears...<br><br>Iuval, a hint: nobody "has" religious charisma.

My hope is to start a conversation among those who aren't committed to dogmatic extremes of any kind, and eventually the three people in your dialogue will notice that something different is going on and, if they want to get in on it, they need to learn how to communicate courteously with those who disagree with their ideologies. <br><br>Kuanyin, you're quite right that Trump is astonishingly good at attracting projections -- better even than Obama was, and the latter was no slouch.

Whose principles? Yours? Mine? Someone else's? The whole point of this post is that trying to base laws on fundamental principles, instead of simply paying attention to what works and doing that, is a bad idea.

In today's America, given the specific set of social conditions we have today and will face in the predictable future, the revival of the household economy can be done just as effectively by same sex couples as by cross-sex couples, and so the history and prospects of the household economy are irrelevant to the current discussion.<br><br><a href=#c4199527143419985607 title="comment permalink">5/13/16, 12:24 AM</a><br><br>

The doctrine starts in a case involving Dartmouth College where it basically means that a corporation is an artificial entity and therefore only has certain rights, and the job of the court is to determine which rights it has and which rights it does not have. John Marshall's opinion in that case was that the state could not just dissolve the college because they didn't like the board of trustees. In essence corporate personhood started out as a way of restraining corporate rights, because the corporation did not have all the rights of the owners.<br><br>When we look at Citizens United and Hobby Lobby, it is fairly clear that the court is moving away from that view and seeing corporations instead as just a collection of individuals, so the individuals' rights must be respected and the corporation doesn't get different rights just because it is incorporated. Citizens United is based on the premise that you cannot regulate speech by regulating money, and you cannot threaten to throw corporate officers in prison for their role in speech. Hobby Lobby is based on the idea that corporate owners don't lose their rights to live a religious life merely because they incorporate a business. In many ways these cases are a step away from corporate personhood. In other words, the corporation as a person no longer matters, only the natural persons involved.<br><br>So the question is what replaces corporate personhood. Do we say as a society that the federal government can regulate anything by regulating corporations (because incorporation signs away individual rights, and because that is the entry price to running a business)? Do we destroy the balance of power by saying only natural persons have rights and that such natural persons' rights include without question the full rights of the owners, directors, and officers of the corporation (in which case Hobby Lobby and Citizens United look rather minor in comparison to what we will get)? To my mind that is a cure worse than the disease. Or do we try to go back to what worked in the past, where economic power was far more decentralized, where small businesses were favored over large businesses (by very high marginal taxes on corporations etc)?<br><br>Those are uncomfortable questions in our current economic order. And I think careful application of a precautionary principle is very important in looking at how we restore justice to our economy.<br><br><a href=#c6192953005467408879 title="comment permalink">5/13/16, 12:44 AM</a><br><br>

One of the points I usually make (that I had assumed was more implicit in this conversation but I guess not) is that we don't *know* what the impact will be on SSM regarding reasserting a household business economy. We cannot say necessarily how society will evolve to support this and how it will affect same-sex couples. But we cannot rule out the US as re-establishing such an economy in a way that is inclusive of such households. In the end, I am sure, we will see less government intervention in marriage and more community intervention and that may not all cut in the same direction across the entire country even.<br><br>But again, my point is that the whole shape of modern marriage in the US is shaped by the corporate economy. This also includes gender roles to a large extent and one can see feminism as a reaction to women being stripped of power by industrialism (domestic power is work a whole lot more when most economic production takes place in and around the home). In a culture where one has not had that history of corporate economics it is hard to find parallels to same-sex marriage as it exists in the US.<br><br>I think our disagreement is less than our agreement, and I think we both agree that social and economic orders are products of their own history. That history is not the same in Utah as it is in West Virginia. It is not the same in Malaysia as it is in Indonesia. It is not the same in Sweden as it is in Germany.<br><br>As corporate collapse eventually happens in the US, SSM will be apart of the legacy of social structures that comes into play. It makes it harder to look to the past purely for models that accommodate everyone at such a point. But at the same time communities will make organic decisions about the shape of family as needed for their own survival. As I am sure you would agree, not every community will likely come up with the same answers.<br><br>So how we got here is part of the question. How it affects where we go is another one and that is murkier.<br><br><a href=#c952645962616057950 title="comment permalink">5/13/16, 3:39 AM</a><br><br>

That is funny.<br><br>Thank you for the answer in relation to the removal of rights. I must confess that I was hoping that it would be otherwise. But of course, opportunity often knocks, but sometimes it is dressed in overalls and looks an awful lot like hard work.<br><br>You may be aware of the inflating housing bubble here. The bubble is inflating to absurd heights.<br><br>One of the politicians, I believe it may have been the opposition leader (but please someone correct me if I'm wrong), was reported to be touring a suburb today in Sydney where the median house price is - I believe - AU$1.5m (that's US$1.09m) and it wasn't a high end suburb. What was absurd was that the politician was spruiking policies for the forthcoming Federal election and promising to address housing affordability, whilst also promising to pursue policies that grow house prices.<br><br>Such claims are absurd because it is patently obvious to everyone (including Blind Freddy) that pursuing contradictory outcomes is simply not possible. It cannot be achieved. I mean you can't make houses both cheaper and more expensive at the same time. It is a ludicrous claim. But no one seems to have called him out on that.<br><br>Unfortunately, from my perspective so many people want to pile onto the gravy train of ever increasing house prices that I'm seriously unsure whether there is the will within our society to actually address this problem. My gut feeling is that I'm seeing an expression of greed on a massive scale, and I worry about that because it is primarily the young that are excluded and if a person only owns one house then it also becomes a meaningless gain (unless that person is increasing their debt as a result of house price inflation). It ain't good and it worries me.<br><br>I am patently unsuitable for an entry into politics as they stand today. I am much more predisposed to personal relationships with agreed to costs, benefits and obligations. And such things seem to be brushed aside nowadays in politics and that circus would drive me bananas and there would be the ever present temptation to brush the imbeciles aside.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c5868210417201998772 title="comment permalink">5/13/16, 4:13 AM</a><br><br>

We want to still decide this by legislative means? Even if one agrees with the Supreme Court, their taking over the right to decide an issue is not necessarily one to be accepted without comment. <br>As William James suggested in his "Varieties of Religious Experience," when some people find their lives work better if they believe in an old man in the sky telling everyone what to do, that is a religious truth for them, and, usually, a legal right to be protected by the First Amendment. Notwithstanding a frequent state of war between the groups, it seems to work for them. The fact that it may short-circuit thought may even be a plus, if it allows them simply to get on with their lives.

I understand your dismissal of 'Ayn Rand fantasists' who stand opposed to pragmatic older traditions of history-based political conservatives. Some of the fantasists seem to have hijacked the views of our own conservatives here in Britain.<br><br>When you are talking about the value of the 'moral fabric' of collective action I could not agree more. I wonder in this context what you think about the future specifically of the Republic, and how it can secure a moral fabric within its present Constitution? <br><br>Burke of course had attached caveats to 'Democracy' while at the same time retaining ‘Monarchy’. I wonder therefore whether his support for the American Colonists was more designed to keep them within a 'reformed' monarchy? An incompetent incumbent monarch apparently could be seen as a glitch rather than as a reason to destroy and attempt to replace the monarch and associated historical collective moral fabric with 'rational written principles'. <br><br>The Republic as it turned out was to be a modern restoration of a very old idea - there were not too many republics around yet in Burke's day. I suppose arguably the Constitution has kept the continuity of moral fabric in what became the USA. Burke though had a curious notion of future Empire. Was he speaking as a voice in the English Parliament for the Colonists, as an active politician or a philosopher for his vision of a new power in the world with his own take on creating a transcendent English destiny? <br><br>One can see Burke’s appeal to Churchill the British conservative aristocrat (ref. Rapier comment this post) with an American mother. Churchill was romantic about the British Empire and the USA, and history.<br><br>Burke as you say is a model for arguing rationally the treatment and respect due to minorities and of Catholics at that time within Britain. (I suggest however that Burke as protagonist for a Catholic settlement within British Law was not a singular endeavour: it was ‘in the air’ for sometime I think? I think perhaps for example of William Cobbett the journalist politician who also stood as a conservative critic at the doorway of modern political economy and at the same time retained something more than nostalgia for the pre-Reformation and the lost mediaeval institutions and the background of rural household economy.)<br><br>best<br>Phil H<br><br><br><a href=#c6413703032586352744 title="comment permalink">5/13/16, 7:59 AM</a><br><br>

In my understanding that would be an infringement of children's rights. <br><br>Now I am NOT saying that I am right and that everybody else is wrong or that my logic is unassailable, it is simply the way I feel and think about the issue. <br><br>The contingencies of actual real life certainly works in favour of same sex marriage and adoption, as after all it is better for kids to be in a stable male/male family and cared for adequately than to be into institutions. No doubt about that. But should this type of arguments be used to justify adoption by same sex couples. I don't think so. <br><br>Anyway, I'd like to thank you for your civility, lathechuck! and that of JMG too! <br><br>As I said earlier, I was very apprehensive of expressing my views on the matter on an open forum as it is clear that the tide in favour of adoption by same sex couples is unstoppable in the western world and even in Mauritius which is a fairly religious and traditionally minded country, the tide is turning among the younger generation. <br><br>For instance, my kids think that it is curious and incomprehensible that I oppose same sex marriages and adoption for instance.

Perhaps you could do a similar post on the original intent of classic liberalism and how they might approach something? Though I learned enough from your interaction with A Post Millennial above what to expect I think. It seems that there is too, a balanced left, and that if the right and left were to 'play their roles' then we could achieve balance. <br><br>What's happened of course is that neoliberalism has taken over both sides of the political spectrum. <br><br>Here's a question I have. What if the change in question is actually about returning to a state that has a long tradition? So instead of necessarily proposing something new it's about proposing to go back to the way things 'always were'? In my mind that would be seen as Burkean conservatism. For example, Corbyn's Labour want to re-nationalise our country's utilities and rail (well those in his party who don't want to put him out to dry that is). As they have been under national control for the vast majority of their existence, could that be considered conservative? Does this also mean that the idea of being exclusively either a liberal or conservative party has been abandoned by the political mainstream? <br><br>This question interests me also with regards to agriculture. If I am to explain to a farmer the benefits of a traditional grazing system, as opposed to the current practice, and I suspect that farmer to be conservative, as is usually the case, then I would be better appealing to his reverence for tradition than say in the latest published data about why traditional systems are more effective (and thus an evolution, as I might put it if I were talking to someone who was more liberally minded). <br><br>Finally may I ask if you took the systematic points of your argument with regards to equal marriage rights from a particular book?<br><br><a href=#c2114674583831295200 title="comment permalink">5/13/16, 10:49 AM</a><br><br>

But since there were already over 250 comments on the post when I found it, and this one is heading the same way, I figured you could use a break from the "Happy Anniversary" type posts ,and this certainly could wait.<br>I don't know what led me to this blog exactly, but it was probably a mention of the long emergency or the catabolic colapse that turned up via a google search on cheery topics like "the decline of the United States" or "the fall of cililizations", since I had just read "Collapse" and "Guns, Germs, and Steel" by Jerad Diamond. And although I recommend both books, I thought they were a bit light weight. I never really followed the peak oil or the global warming scenes on the net, because, after all, "They will think of something". An error that your blog has pointed out rather sharply. <br>I am sure that it wasn't a comment that led me here, because until I read your blog , I never read comments - like a true elitist , I had trained myself to not even look at comments, under the assumption that they were all worthless. A second error underlined by the quality of the discussions here.<br>Fifteen years ago, I bought a standard all electric fixer-upper house (with a well) in an old suburban neighborhood within walking distance of the university. The surrounding area is all agrcultural, and has a lot of Amish and Anabaptist farms so horses and buggys, farmer's markets, and craft beers are common here. We have decided to stay here come what may.<br>Since I started reading your blog about five years ago, I've insulated and air sealed the entire house, added a woodstove that heats it well (and a woodpile that ate about 500 sq ft of my back yard), a small vegetable garden that took another 500 sq ft of backyard, and a rainwater catchement system that feeds a lilly pond and waters the garden. I have had the existing apple and pear trees pruned and fertilized in hopes of making hard cider in the fall, and added solar panels on the roof. My electric bill is now tiny, and my diet is much improved.<br> These are all positive effects of your writing, but you have made it clear that they will not be nearly enough - without fossil fuels for the chainsaw and jeep I'd never be able to process enough wood for the winter, and the garden would need to be at least four times it's current size to provide a basic diet for a couple. So be it - I'm certainly ahead of where I was (and where my friends and neighbors are) as regards our physical resilience. I thank you for that.<br>On psychological/spiritual resilience, I am no Druid, but I have been studying my ancestor's old stories and lore about the Celtic civilizations that existed before the Romans took over Europe a few thousand years ago, and I believe the preindustrial iron age could have actually provided a pretty good life for most people, so I have less/little fear for my decendants at the end of the current empire. Perhaps the end of the Kübler-Ross denial and anger phases; but I don't think so - I am still mad as hell at my generation(Boomers), but I'm working on getting over it. I thank you for that too.<br>Finally on this weeks post, I don't imagine that wedding cakes for same sex marriages is really a big issue for most of your readers - it is a non issue for me as both my grown children are in long term committed relationships (complete with mortgage and children) but are not married. Next time you feel like offending a lot of readers consider abortions or gun control here in the US - both, after all involve killing humans and will certainly stir up trolls.<br><br>ArtDeco at artdecohq.wordpress.com<br><br><a href=#c5407231219345949518 title="comment permalink">5/13/16, 1:19 PM</a><br><br>

The notion that women have some special claim to power in a domestic economy is not true.

More and more, I am seeing a deep undercurrent of anger and rage building, which Donald Trump and the alt right are tapping into. <br><br>I think that if things continue the way they have, we will eventually see open warfare and blood in the streets. So far, I think the right has exercised quite a lot of restraint because most conservatives still believe in playing by the rules. But continuing to play by the rules doesn't make much sense when you are dealing with people who not only use intimidation and bullying tactics as a matter of routine, but get the government to do a lot of their bullying for them. We also know that the activist Left has effectively seized control of institutions like the courts, the mainstream media, the public school system and academia. So again, why should those on the right continue to play by the rules when it's a rigged game run by people who hate them and everything they stand for?<br><br>I think we will see a major insurgency within a decade or two, if not a full blown civil war, in part because the activist Left just keeps pushing and pushing and insists on demonizing and marginalizing those who don't agree 100 percent with the SJW agenda. Push people too far and they will rebel, especially if they feel they have nothing to left to lose. <br><br>Sooner or later, people are going to realize that if you keep giving into bullying tactics, you only encouraging the bullies to push even harder, just like Hitler did in the 1930's until he miscalculated in 1939 and found himself in a war with the British and French. One of the reasons why I think Trump's candidacy and the alt right movement are so significant is because it shows people are starting to fight back against the radical Left.<br><br>William Lind believes we are headed for another American civil war and even wrote a novel on the subject.

I must be older than you to think of this as a naughty word!<br><br>It's nice to be back online and Thank You for the (for me) introduction of Burkean Conservatism. I will have to look into it further. One thing that keeps popping up in my mind about your explanation of it, particularly as illustrated with the example of the same sex marriage and Christian bakery - and the comparison of the wedding cake to life saving pharmaceuticals is that this common sense Burkean approach works best and perhaps can only work in a much smaller country. (?) What keeps popping up in my head is that the USA is simply too big to manage in any one-size-fits-all structure. You inevitably end up with laws trying to cover all bases with silly consequences or a labyrinth of a gazillion laws trying to distinguish- and cover all bases. In a country of 300 million peeps, too many bases!<br><br>I think the argument of comparing the wedding cake to life-saving pharmaceuticals is valid under the premise that in establishing a law of forced-commerce safeguards the unpopular minority needing the life-saving drugs. It's an umbrella law, safeguarding the accessibility of commerce; so while absurd when talking about a wedding cake, it is rational when it must (because of scale) include talking about all commercial products, (because that will include necessary, even life saving ones). <br>To apply this Burkean common sense approach - to distinguish between fripperies like wedding cakes, possible necessities like the one grocery store in a food-desert-locale and absolutely necessary ones like the life-saving drugs, I think many more laws or more intricately written laws would be necessary. e.g.: definition of minority status, or number of followers in % to the whole region of minority religious followers, level of necessity of the goods in question, etc. In a massive population and geography like the USA, I just don't see how it can work very well. It becomes far too cumbersome. Well, I think that's what the USA has got now and it doesn't work very well at all. <br><br>I have often thought the natural 'evolution' of the USA, not to mention some other huge countries, is disintegration back into smaller separate nations which can be more cohesively governed and where these distinctions can be managed because the scale is smaller, (fewer bases to cover.) I don't feel pro or con for this, I just think it is what will, perhaps must happen. Do you think this is true?<br><br>@Karim: I understand and respect your concern. I was going to point out to you 2 things re: same sex couples and adoption. One was what lathe chuck said. ('Nuff said.) The other was just a gentle reminder that human gender identity and traits are not binary, they're on a spectrum. There are definitely some men, whether gay or straight who are by nature more nurturing, unconditionally loving, 'mothering' and possessing of what we would consider feminine sensibilities, especially towards children; some females, both gay and straight, who possess traits we would more traditionally associate with masculinity. I see this crossing of lines a lot amongst the male and female teachers at my place of work / primary school. In my 54 years of wanderings on this earth, I gather the suspicion that we silly humans cross those lines far more often than is generally thought, and far more often than NOT! We just don't talk about it. <br><br>The other thought that keeps popping up for me is that we silly humans are like herding cats. We seem bent on defying any cohesive political or societal structure or even gosh darnit - gender behavior!<br><br><a href=#c6728270034858990596 title="comment permalink">5/13/16, 5:50 PM</a><br><br>

Since this was a single blog post rather than a book on Burkean conservatism, I didn't think it was necessary to reiterate that questions of the sort you've brought up, like other political questions, are settled by the same process of legislative action and judicial review backed up by public debate. <br><br>Eric, exactly. The place at which the right of free association gives way to the right of equality in public accommodation is something that has to be negotiated by political means, and will inevitably be a compromise that leaves extremists on all sides unsatisfied. Many thanks for the link!<br><br>Phil, the destiny of constitutional government in the United States is a huge question, and one that's probably going to need a series of posts all on its own. At the moment, the bipartisan kleptocracy is blatantly ignoring the constitution, and the radicals on both sides are just as happy to tear it down; unless that can be reversed, I don't see much hope of anything other than a straightforward descent into Caesarism. Can it be reversed? We'll talk about that further on. <br><br>RPC, that's a very helpful criterion! <br><br>Roger, oh, granted. The left is yelling about the war on women and the right is yelling about the war on Christianity, and meanwhile what's left of the rule of law and the politics of compromise and civility goes gurgling down the drain. One virtue of the Burkean conservative approach is that it offers a way to step back from the barricades. <br><br>Over the Hill, good. Philosophy shows us that the collection of appearances we call "matter" are an epiphenomenon of consciousness, not vice versa -- you can get that from Schopenhauer or Berkeley just as well as from the Upanishads or the Michael Teachings -- and from that standpoint, the study of history is a way of seeking to understand the transformations of consciousness over time. The heroic-cause school of history suffers from what Blake called "single vision," the flattening out of experience into a one-dimensional movement; the same is true, equally, of the myth of progress, or for that matter Marxism and its equivalents. History is so much richer than that! <br><br>Alex, I consider Jeremy Corbin to be one of the few actual conservatives in British political life, and Bernard Sanders to be a close equivalent on this side of the pond. Both of them want to scrap some policies that have failed, and go back to earlier policies that worked -- and in both cases, that strikes me as an excellent idea. More generally, you're quite correct -- saying "why don't we go back to what worked" is an eminently conservative idea, as well as an eminently sensible one, and the fact that the Tories on your side of the pond and the pseudoconservatives on ours simply want to go charging ahead in a course of radical change that has consistently failed to bring about the results they claimed it would -- well, that right there shows that they're not conservative in any meaningful sense. We have too many free-market Jacobins in conservative clothing these days!<br><br>David, you're most welcome!<br><br><a href=#c8379081650097955435 title="comment permalink">5/13/16, 6:10 PM</a><br><br>

It's a spectrum, from gay guys like me who are androgynous, with a definitely feminine mind in the way I flirt, or even dominate, sexually, yet am more than happy with my male parts, my red body hair, etc., to someone like Violet, who's way more on the feminine side. The gender spectrum exists in all sexualities, but, IMHO, is more pronounced in the LGBT community. I say this, because there are lots of maternal gay men out there, fulfilling a maternal role to their children. Just because there are two men does not mean that there is not necessarily a maternal figure(s) or maternal role(s) in the household. Now one may discuss gender "confusion", but anthropology and human history is rich w/people outside the gender norms of their culture. Atypical gender is found in a minority of people in almost all cultures.<br>There's also been a lot of discussion about the South. Perhaps Bill can shed more light on this, but the South is the nation's most conservative region, in the true Burkean sense of the word. We regard change with suspicion, give great deference to the existing order of things, and make change much more slowly than other parts of the country, particularly the Northeast and West Coast. Many people confuse our conservatism with being reactionary, which most of us are not. Regarding the collapse of Christianity and the acceptance of same sex marriage, it is happening here as well, albeit more slowly and cautiously, in true Southern conservative fashion. Counties and cities that for years voted dry every time a wet/dry election came up are voting wet. Even hard liquor is sold and bars are open on Sundays in places where that never was the case before. Church attendance is declining here as elsewhere. Now, we are still the Bible Belt, which means that compared to, say, NYC, we're a very religiously Christian kind of place. But that is an apples to oranges comparison. Compared to our past, we are less religious, and the Baptists and other evangelical denominations have much less sway over our politics and our people than they once did. Young evangelicals, particularly college educated ones, are very tolerant of same sex marriage, and have assured me that it's all a matter of time of waiting for the old opponents to die off/step down before changes are made regarding LGBT issues in evangelical churches.<br>Now, this doesn't set well with certain "progressives", who should proclaim victory and move on to other issues. A discussion with an older lesbian a few months ago reminded me of what JMG said in a recent post about white privilege dying, and how certain people will be flailing at ghosts of dead -isms, if I may paraphrase, as the world changes. This lesbian was railing all against the evils of the Christians as if it were still 1985, fighting the good fight of yesteryear. Personally, I think she needs to get out more and meet more people of different ages and beliefs than herself, and then she'd find out how much younger evangelicals have changed.<br><br><br><a href=#c8362736211993552908 title="comment permalink">5/13/16, 6:19 PM</a><br><br>

In this day and age, it would be a great benefit recognizing in law cohabitating couples. I read where it was eliminated starting in the late 19th-early 20th century as a form of social engineering to push people into legal marriage. I think reviving common law marriage makes a lot of sense--Canada, for example, never eliminated it. Does anyone know more about the history of the push to eliminate common law marriage?<br>Regarding country clubs, we belonged to one growing up, and I can say that there are different classes of country clubs, some more exclusive/elite than others. For example, the most elite one in Lexington was Idle Hour, then Lexington Country Club, then on down from there. Small town country clubs tend to be less elite, less extravagant, and more congenial. There was an urban legend about Idle Hour that one of the black staff fell in the pool once, upon which the pool was emptied and scrubbed to a t. I also heard that it was anti-Semitic, as well, perhaps Ahavah can shed more light on that...<br>Regarding traditional cultures and homosexuality, many traditional cultures have found homosexuality beneficial. Having adults who don't procreate around to help with childrearing and other tasks can be useful, and many traditional cultures had specific roles for their queer folk. It wasn't until colonialism and the spread of Christianity, Islam, and industrialism that many cultures became homophobic. Even in our modern, Western culture, gay people are known for adopting the most at-risk, least "desirable" children. If that's not a social benefit, then I don't know what is.<br><br><a href=#c361776884428739368 title="comment permalink">5/13/16, 6:20 PM</a><br><br>

The affluent classes are increasingly divided into hostile blocs. It's outside of that end of the class structure that you get the possibility of actual consensus -- and that in itself suggests that the affluent classes are cruising for a bruising in no uncertain terms. <br><br>Ed, oh, granted! One of the good things about the recent loosening of gender roles is that it gives more room for the people involved in any given marriage to adjust the terms of their relationship to better suit their own needs. It used to be scandalous for the husband to stay at home and the wife to work -- my wife's great-aunt and great-uncle did that, and took oceans of flack for it -- but there are plenty of couples where that's far and away the most sensible arrangement. Other examples could be cited by the ream. <br><br>Ien, yes, it's been discussed at great length already. I'd be fine with having a group of Pagans win the right to celebrate Beltane with an outdoor orgy -- for that matter, I'm told that some already do so. Whether you're tired of giving reasonable accommodation to religious minorities or not, it's a well-established custom in American public life, and one I support. <br><br>Art Deco, thank you! It's exactly because wedding cakes for same sex couples is such a petty issue that it makes a great touchstone here; we can watch the self-righteous indignation boil up, compare it with what's actually under discussion, and chuckle. <br><br>Submarine, glad to hear it. There's a real chance that the next decade or so will see a complete repolarization of American politics, in which what now passes for the bipartisan conventional wisdom inside the DC beltway becomes recognized as one of several options, and a party supporting those policies has to contend with another party whose views embrace the middle ground between Trump and Sanders. I for one would look forward to that. <br><br>Jon, funny! The interesting thing is that I know people in gun clubs who would be glad to take it. <br><br>Don, oh, I know. There's always the possibility that he'll do the same kind of bait and switch that Obama did, and adopt all the policies he claimed he was going to reject. The point is that with Clinton, we know exactly what we're getting. <br><br>Zach, excellent -- you're digging yourself in deeper. Each of your questions is an attempt, in increasingly heated language, to try to extract a grand abstract principle from the pragmatic agreement among most Americans that religious minorities should be given reasonable accommodation where this does not impose undue burdens on the rights of others. That sort of reflexive principle-seeking, and the heated language as well, is of course absolutely standard these days, and it leads to exactly the sort of intractable political stalemate we've got today: each side is insisting, "If you support this policy, you must therefore support this grand abstract principle," and out come the straw men, to be battered to bits in the usual fashion. What I'm suggesting, of course, is that the approach in which you're engaged is a bad idea, and an approach based on pragmatic agreements negotiated on a case by case basis is a much better way to enable people of widely differing opinions to live together in relative peace.<br><br><a href=#c9026625291222704248 title="comment permalink">5/13/16, 6:29 PM</a><br><br>

I think it's very likely that we'll see a domestic insurgency or an open civil war here in the US in the next decade, but it won't be because of the antics of a few pampered, affluent would-be radicals -- the "social justice warriors" you mention. It'll be because of the increasing impoverishment and immiseration of most Americans, carried out by the current bipartisan consensus, for the benefit of the affluent 20% or so.

A family that allows much of this will lose out in the Darwinian sense because human children are so unbelievably labor intensive to raise that you need the commitment of two main adults do accomplish it. Before the industrial revolution, people just could not afford it.<br><br><a href=#c3713650014337591771 title="comment permalink">5/13/16, 6:54 PM</a><br><br>

For one thing, the matter of who's the father has to be somewhat irrelevant in the raising of the child. After all, if men are expected to be engaged only with the raising of their own children, then I really can't fault a man who wants his children to be his offspring. Second of all, the risk of STDs has to be low - we forget that most of the common diseases have responded to condoms, social enforcement of monogamy and to some extent antibiotics by becoming slower-burning. They used to be quite lethal and quite horrific in comparison to the modern strains - syphilis as you may have contracted it in 1650 makes AIDS look kind.<br><br>Changes to human biology aside (JMG, have you read Margaret Atwood's MaddAddam trilogy?) it seems to me like the healthiest way of assigning children to men is to have the male relatives of the mother, rather than the biological father being the male caretakers. However, societies based on the nuclear/extended family, where most men end up reproducing have obviously been very successful. One thing I haven't been able to find out about the matrilineal model is the rate at which men who live to puberty successfully reproduce.<br><br>There is some evidence that historically, across cultures, a much greater proportion of women who make it to adulthood reproduce compared to men meeting the same criteria. It does seem to me like it matters how reproductive success is distributed among men especially, because there is reason to suggest that women's reproductive success is far more equal due to biological limitations.<br><br>I'd like to beat the horse I buried earlier. I think that sexuality is more fluid than we like to pretend it is. In situations where the opposite sex is not readily available, I suspect that a reasonable percentage of people would go for it if there were few consequences. I would argue that in societies where most men do not reproduce, but the energy and perhaps anger of those men is necessary for the society, prohibitions on homosexuality serve a 'utilitarian' purpose in preventing defection.<br><br>I try and pay attention to sociological trends, even ones I don't identify with, and the expulsion of gay men from the professionally oppressed has been quite a surprise. I also read that something like 50% of gay men in France voted for Front Nationale. It's pretty clear that the social-justice scene has no clothes.<br><br><a href=#c255823616177873742 title="comment permalink">5/13/16, 7:38 PM</a><br><br>

In short, it seemed to me that at every step, the decisions were somewhat arbitrary. E.g., Does the government have a compelling interest? You give an example which you believe constitutes a legitimate compelling interest, and then basically assert that, no, there is no such comparable need. As much as I agree on the matter, I don't see how that's anything but an opinion that you and I share. <br><br>Now, maybe you are saying that if enough people agree, from a Burkean position, a right has been established, as long as the agreement exists. Fair enough, but I don't see how this can be used as an argument, in the court of public opinion, to establish the right in the first place.<br><br>The second is the same as a comment I made, also too late to get an answer, in the post before your recent sabbatical:<br><br>"I find it ironic that, as a self described Burkean conservative, you seem to be favoring the two revolutionaries in the running [for the current election], while roundly dismissing the more institutional candidates." [I then gave some personal opinions that are not so relevant to the current post.]<br><br>And then:<br><br>"I am persuaded in my old age that revolutions are almost never a good thing. That is, that they always cause a lot of collateral damage and more often than not produce a worse situation than they overthrew. I think Burke would agree." [Though you give the counter-example in this post of his support of the American Revolution, would you so equate the conditions of the colonies under British colonial rule to the current discomforts of average Americans today? Or is this another case of if enough of us think we have a right?<br><br>To that end, I might as well throw in one more comment from that post:<br><br>"I don't want to minimize the fear and pain that a lot of people are going through these days, but I am especially flummoxed by the people commenting here that equate Sanders and Trump as more or less interchangeable agents of bringing down the status quo, as if they are suffering intolerable hardship and are willing to do anything to just mess things up. I suspect a lot of these people are actually pretty comfortable in their own lives, at least on the scale of worldwide comfort or how bad things can be in this country, also." [Well, I might have put that better, but it seems to me that there is a pretty high burden placed on anyone wanting to advocate revolution from a Burkean position.<br><br>So, how would you present a Burkean argument for Sanders or Trump? I just don't see it.<br><br>Oh, and since I was in travel mode last week, I also wanted to give a hearty congratulation and big thank-you for the service you've been providing for the last 10 years in this blog. I am especially thankful that the writing of this blog has resulted in a respectable number of very fine books, some of which sit on my bookshelves, and some of which have been passed on to others I thought were ready for your message.

They also have one feature that the abstraction-laden fantasies of world-reformers don’t have, which is that they have been proven to work. Any proposed change in laws and institutions thus needs to start by showing, first, that there’s a need for change; second, that the proposed change will solve the problem it claims to solve; and third, that the benefits of the change will outweigh its costs. Far more often than not, when these questions are asked, the best way to redress any problem with the existing order of things turns out to be the option that causes as little disruption as possible, so that what works can keep on working." </i><br><br>I profoundly agree with these principles, but I'm also aware that Tainter's work urges us to prevent our societies from becoming more and more complex (or even to decrease their level of complexity, if we think we've been on an overshoot). As I understand it, on the one hand we sometimes have no choice but to add new layers of complexity (when we face new problems too big to be ignored), so that on the other hand we should desperately try to find out what "old" layers of complexity could be removed without causing too much harm, and how to remove them gently.<br><br>That is to say, I think that simplifying our institutions meets the <i>"need for change"</i> criterion just quoted. I guess it fits the <i>"benefits outweigh the costs"</i> criterion too, but I'm not sure (one could argue that trying to buy time before collapse is pointless). What I'm sure of, is that it would inevitably cause more disruption that reformists are usually willing to accept, and that it will involve discarding things that worked, at least in some sense.<br><br>After all, even the most bureaucratic systems grew <i>"organically out of history and experience"</i>!<br><br>Hence the question: what happens when Burke meets Tainter?<br><br>(By the way, I would be very happy to hear from Mr. Carr soon!)<br><br><a href=#c2150941363814801723 title="comment permalink">5/14/16, 1:00 AM</a><br><br>

I wonder, if the Corbyn camp actually realised this too, then it could become a powerful political strategy. I think many people would buy into the idea of 'going back to what worked' because many people have a sense that it's not working right now, and it's not like the Tories are really offering much of a grand vision either that people believe. Just like over there, our politicians are failing to offer a real vision that most people can buy into and thus of course UKIP, who whilst their vision is weak, at least have a vision, and of course are at least saying they'll address the issues of working class people. Whether they will - well that's another matter - they're still run by a an ex-Tory banker toff. Corbyn keeps keep getting branded by the media as a radical left winger, yet his policies are generally that of returning to the past (albeit a socialist past) - and perhaps there's the issue, he's getting branded as 'returning to the past,' and not 'returning to what worked' - there's a big difference between how people perceive those two ideas, when we're supposed to have progress. The Tories are winning the war on rhetoric.<br><br>Interestingly, I think the only chance Corbyn has of getting into power is if we vote to leave the EU, which could potentially see the capitulation of the Tories. Whilst I'd rather we 'bremain' it would make some very interesting watching to see what happens if we did leave. It would be a time to get the popcorn out for sure. (the 'brexit' camp are using the appeal to novelty fallacy. Most people don't love the EU, but then the alternative could be so much worse when our country could be turned into a massive neo-liberal tax haven with Murdoch pulling even more of the strings) <br><br>Whilst Corbyn won't stave off the decline of the West, I think 5 or 10 years of him could at least mean that the UK would maintain and keep its ailing infrastructure and public services - which will come very handy in the decades to come - that reason alone should mean everyone votes Labour (and I've never actually voted Labour before myself). 5 or 10 more years of the Tories, which terrifyingly is very possible, at least for 5 more years, and I don't think we'll have a rail system anyone can afford, an NHS, nor a steel industry and we'll probably be stocked to the brim with nuclear power plants and fracking (though perhaps when the fracking bubble bursts it would put an end to that, I hope), though doubt it. Corbyn would oppose all that and with a bit of PQE - we're printing money anyway, so may as well get something useful out of it, we could see our basic infrastructure and industries in decent shape for the decline.<br><br>But I don't think he'll get in. The Tories will lay on the fear of terrorism and the Middle East, and of immigration and when it comes to those topics, Corbyn is seen unfavourably by most people, and his comments don't help the issue. In a way his issue is that he needs to play a bit more politics, but then, it's his unwillingness to compromise on his principles that have led to his recent popularity. <br><br>I know you don't like to comment on the politics outside of the US much, but I'm wondering whether you might write a post about the fate of America's allies when the US empire finally collapses? That might be enough of a reason for you to write it ; )<br><br><a href=#c910598351297243534 title="comment permalink">5/14/16, 1:03 AM</a><br><br>

It's somewhat like our politicians who advocate making college education more "affordable" (and ignore the fact that every effort only allows the colleges to charge more tuition and fees). Relaxing pesky environmental and/or safety regulations to expand the supply of low-quality housing, all other things being equal, will make it more affordable. Debasing the currency, all other things being equal, will raise the prices of everything, labor and houses included. Do both, and claim victory!<br><br>What people really seem to want, though, is to personally occupy the "exclusive" neighborhoods that they currently can't afford. "Make THOSE houses more affordable for ME, but not for my obnoxious neighbors." When we hear the phrase "affordable housing" around here (Washington DC area), it's heard as "places to live for people who you don't want to live with". Affordable housing is a fine thing, as long as it's Not In My Back Yard. (By the way, I'm not representing my own attitude here, but the attitudes I see reflected in news reports when housing projects are proposed.)<br><br>With both housing and higher education, making it "affordable" now depends on making government-backed loans available to the consumer. I heard last night that about 30% of cars on our highways are now leased, not purchased, because people can't afford to buy the cars they want. Will people ever learn that if they can't afford to buy that car, they really can't afford to lease it, either?<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c7494971377393564054 title="comment permalink">5/14/16, 4:19 AM</a><br><br>

Keep 'em coming! <br><br>I was not at all acquainted with Burkean conservative thought, let alone the moderate version thereof, prior to you bringing it up in previous comments on other blog posts. You piqued my interest, and so I did a bit of research on Burke and how contemporaries frame him in defense of their ideological perspective. I was not impressed, but on the other hand, your commentary of Burkean principles and application to a contemporary social "challenge" achieved a nice "middle ground" that a majority of people from various ideological hues can understand, if not more than partially accept. <br><br>At first, I was quite intrigued that Burke defended the American Revolution and not the French Revolution, but can now understand why. A bit of a diversion here, but my own studies have led me to the view that the American Revolution was nothing more than a proxy war between continental European monarchs and financial interests versus the British Crown's imperial adventures in the New World. The mythologies built up around freedom and "fighting the man" are quaint, although one should not miss the irony in the suppression of both Shay's and the Whiskey Rebellions. Also, one must only analyze the interests and actions of more than a minority of founding fathers on the topic of land and property to see that the notions of greed and class warfare were just alive and well back then as they are today. (cf. Hutchinson, "Strictures Upon the Declaration of Independence, 1776)<br><br>Be that is it may (or may not!), Burkean's support of the American Revolution makes him seem less conservative, counterintuitively, to the esteemed Baruch Spinoza and his thoughts on revolution. I don't know much about the Neo-pagan scene or Druidry, but would be surprised if the core of Spinozan thought--the unity of Nature--doesn't strike a chord.<br><br>I would be interested in your views on the myths of American Revolution, revolution in general, and Spinoza, if time and space permits. <br><br>Thanks in advance for your thoughts :-)<br><br><br><a href=#c1835793402817922467 title="comment permalink">5/14/16, 6:44 AM</a><br><br>

It is a related subject and from your take on practical politics I surmise you favor some kind of consequentialism but there are many blanks to fill in. I suggest that though difficult, the subject of practical ethics is very relevant to your blog, since its theme is "...how should we then live?".<br><br><a href=#c2710564791285641302 title="comment permalink">5/14/16, 7:23 AM</a><br><br>

The reason I ask is that I am one of those folks who have already decided not to vote for HRC come November and while investigating alternatives, discovered that the Green Party reflects many (though not necessarily all) of my core views. So I am wondering if it would be worthwhile to get involved in the state party and perhaps work on organizing at the county level. Or do I stick with running for (non-partisan) local office and eschew party politics, which is what I've been doing. Acknowledging that this is ultimately a personal value judgement, I'd nonetheless appreciate input.

Imagine the Obama administration resisting the urge to do a superiority dance on the "problem" of trans-gender school washrooms and change-room facilities. <br><br>Is there anything that generates more anger than abortion rights? Can you argue that the US Supreme Court stopped the process of organic growth on the issue of abortion? Or is it the other way around, that the Supreme Court decision was the culmination of the process? But imagine the Supreme Court never hearing or deciding Roe v Wade. <br><br>On this side of the border our Supreme Court overturned legislation on abortion long ago. The court's intent was for legislatures to revamp those laws. But there's been nothing of the sort and, since that time, women, doctors and hospitals have been left to their own devices with no politician willing to pick up what is seen as a white-hot, no-win issue. I wish I could say that it's been a form of Burkean wisdom at work here. <br><br>What about organic growth on the issue of slavery? No doubt, slavery is a stain on the national honour (and, before Canuck commenters start doing our own little superiority dance, we have to remember our own calamities). But there are those that claim that slavery in the Unites States in the mid 1800s wasn't long for this world anyway (ie with the advent of mechanization) and maybe the civil war that came out of the dispute was the worst way forward. Imagine an alternative history where abolitionists were told to curb their enthusiasm because slavery is doomed as a business model and that in any case individual states each have to find their own way forward. So imagine as a consequence slavery going away on its own as a product of technological and economic change. And no secession and no war. Imagine present day politics without the legacy of that conflict. I suppose the main question is would economic and social circumstances of Black people have been better as a result? Or worse?<br><br><a href=#c7296518554027545358 title="comment permalink">5/14/16, 7:51 AM</a><br><br>

After a bit of reflection, I came to something similar to GermanDom, who said that this is not a political stance per se, which you could chalk up to semantic differences. To my mind though, this is a stance in the sense that it values certain things (what has worked in the past) and skeptical of other things (abstractions or untested innovations), but operates a bit more as a methodology. In our current political discourse, of course, a stance means you pick from the predetermined issues and choose a side, which works out to a political stance resembling a set of rules, closing down thinking.<br><br>What interested me during my reflections was the parallels this philosophy evoked in virtue ethics in the polytheist context (thanks for your intro to this via A World Full of Gods, by the way) and the scientific method. Both of these sort of teach you how to think rather than teaching you what to think. You could say that values are built into these systems, such that the results they produce have tendencies or patterns, but leave flexibility for context and the vagaries of reality and experience. (The scientific method, of course, also tends to value consistency, even when it can't have it.)<br><br>Whether or not these parallels hold true or not, this aspect has been what I appreciate the most about your tutelage over the years: teaching me how to think for myself with limits. As a 26 year old who spent some time in various radical movements, which necessarily require straightjackets on thinking, and left only to fall into nihilism, your writings have been a breath of fresh air, clearing away a lot of mental cobwebs while giving me useful constructs. If your writings continue to reach a larger audience, rest assured that they are not creating an army of clones, but rather moral agents able to act freely and competently in the world.

While it is true that this week's post did not in the least offend me, it is also true that I am not entirely in favor of gay marriage. I don't feel strongly enough about it to become very exercised, but it sort of niggles at me that something about it seems not right. It messes with my archetypes, Tom Bombadil and Goldberry...<br>In the end it boils down to semantics. I don't like calling something the same which is not the same. I suspect that as time goes on new words will be invented so as to differentiate the different types of marriage. I liked Deborah Bender's thoughtful and informed post very much. In the end getting govt out of the marriage business might be the way to go. But I think we do have to realize that this is a slippery slope that may lead to polygamy. Polyandry, of course, seems eminently practical and I'm in favor of it.<br>*********<br>On another note, while I'm something of an antivaxxer, I too have thought that much of my own objections are that they have become excessive in number, (which becomes a nonprecautionary practice), and that it was better left to the serious diseases. The problem is that there is hype about all the diseases including flu so that there are shrill cries and fear tactics being used to make all of them serious.<br>********<br>I have to agree with Ahavah about medicine being nonprofit. Even though I will not go so far as to call medical treatment a right, I think that as a society we should recognize that it is not just or healthy to have those human needs up for profiteering. That includes pharmaceutical companies - nonprofit. This does not mean that people cannot have lucrative careers as surgeons, pharmacists and researchers by the way. The highest salary allowed by nonprofit is one dollar shy of one million.<br><br><a href=#c8107969302600733263 title="comment permalink">5/14/16, 8:22 AM</a><br><br>

I'd call myself a progressive and liberal, but I have many times thought that it should be okay for a religious group/business to live by their own religious laws - with the caveat that they can't cherry pick! Ex: they can refuse to serve gay couples, but they also have to refuse adulterous ones (obviously, they'd have to have been "outed" somehow). But also, the business has to be seen consistently living up to their religion in all circumstances, as the halal and the strict Jewish businesses do (and I supposed Amish should be included here). But what is happening is that people are using "religion" as a handy excuse for bias... if there are crucifixes in the office or shop, and there are religious practices that don't happen in secular shops, I'm fine with allowing them a different workplace - Hobby Lobby doesn't qualify and neither does Melissa's Sweet Cakes... OTOH, unless the bias is having a huge effect on the minority group in question, I would go with a boycott and leave the legal force for things that threaten the community. Pick your battles, etc. I also think it's a little insane to force a "christian" therapist to work with a gay person if they think homosexuality is a sin... who could do any kind of decent work with that?? And there's no point in saying the therapist "has to change" their POV - legislating attitudes doesn't work. I'd say the therapist has to put up a large permanent sign proclaiming his/her bias - that way the straight folk who are unhappy with biased therapists can also go elsewhere.

A little reflection should show that having gay children is a positive boon to a family of more than one or two children. Perhaps especially in the case of males, which is more common. People who live in the city and towns, perhaps even in the country but with modern jobs and conveniences, have lost touch with the fact that male labor, and labor in general, is highly needed and can be in short supply when living the more old fashioned type of life. It's for this reason I said I am in favor of polyandry. For myself and my homesteading neighbors, the bottleneck in getting things up and running and in keeping them running is male strength and labor. A family with a couple of adults unburdened with their own children and willing to stay at home is a lucky family.<br><br><a href=#c4418702303747731118 title="comment permalink">5/14/16, 9:31 AM</a><br><br>

And I will reflect on that.<br><br>But I am still having trouble understanding how the "pragmatic agreement" is not itself an abstract principle. The word "should" is in there, and the word "reasonable" is of course subject to being read as an inkblot.<br><br>As applied in a particular case -- my straw protagonist, who presents as transgendered, walks in the door of a shop and the proprietor refuses on the stated ground of religious belief to provide goods and services otherwise available to the consuming public -- is that acceptable? to whom? or what pragmatic agreements might we as a community negotiate?<br><br>Apparently the community has already agreed -- provisionally, subject to the unfolding of additional pragmatic concerns in the future -- that the religious belief of the shop owner "should" be accommodated, "within reason." That agreement was of course negotiated at a time when transgendered people were largely excluded from the conversation.<br><br>Excluded how, the Socratic questioner (also straw) asks.<br><br>Well, it was not so long ago that the community denied transgender existed at all, except as a disease or a perversion. So okay, there were transgendered people out there, but they had as a practical matter no voice in framing these pragmatic agreements. Speak up and your position in the economy would be destroyed. And in most cases you would internalize the dominant narrative and view yourself as sick or perverted.<br><br>Which at one level is of course your own problem, gotta clear your own thinking, etc. But as you know from your own experience this is a long and difficult path.<br><br>One might say we have come a long way in changing the dominant narrative to accommodate (if you will) the perceived needs of the transgendered minority. Not all of it has been accomplished on a Burkean path, obviously, and it is partly because of this that we see the pushback. But I think the case can be made that grassroots efforts have also been instrumental here.<br><br>But -- and here I speak as something of an outsider to the specific problem, as I am fortunate to be able to present as a cis gendered heterosexual white male -- the actual, daily lived experience of the transgendered person is still fraught. People stare, people make comments, people refuse your custom on the purported (that word again: heated?) ground of religious belief. Sometimes they beat you up or kill you.<br><br>Well, but this is where you find yourself, kid. Transgendered in a community that is not ready for you. Deal with it. Burke is not saying it is acceptable to beat you up or kill you. Let's put away the straw men. The question is whether the shopkeeper should be compelled somehow to provide goods or services in exchange for your money. And apparently Burke says this is something for the community to work out through pragmatic agreements.<br><br>I guess my point is that if the pragmatic agreement as it presently exists allows the shopkeeper to refuse your custom, then the pragmatic agreement participates in a systematic oppression which tends to silence those whom it excludes. A positive feedback loop, if you will.<br><br>If the transgendered person is disabled as a practical matter from participating in negotiating the pragmatic agreement, maybe we need at least occasionally to employ other, more coercive tools.<br><br><br><a href=#c7842920764913301116 title="comment permalink">5/14/16, 9:40 AM</a><br><br>

You get a long history of worshiping these gods in this place, as part of the fabric of the culture. That's why we have Greek myths and Norse myths, after all. The modern era is something anomalous in most areas in that way. A lot of our ancestors, speaking for the USA, ended up here precisely because they were some uncooperative little group that wouldn't worship the right way according to the area they came from.<br>Religious tolerance being a rather marginal habit of prosperity, I expect we'll see less and less of it as time goes by. Now, in places like the USA, where it's fairly well engrained, we're already seeing less tolerance of religions that don't wear Christian trappings (no one seems to much mind the UU, the LDS, and the JW), then, say, we saw in the '90s and '00s. In areas where religious tolerance is less of a part of cultural identity, I expect religious discrimination will increase much faster and with much less resistance from the population.<br>I started referring to myself as a localist, as a political identifier, a while back. I expect that, as travel through the USA, was a dicey prospect before the interstate highway system (my parents pre-date it, and my mother's family in fact, were regular travelers, very unusual in the era) it will become a dicey prospect again, at least in the areas not serviced by passenger trains. It takes an awfully short time for roads to become impassible by auto. Travel is hardly an inalienable right, though Americans tend to think it is!<br>The best bet for most of us who are outliers in some way, is to be "Yes, they're XXX, but they're OUR XXX," whether it's gay, straight, mixed race, religion, or whatever. Most Americans seem to have a certain amount of ability to hold two contradictory ideas in their heads at once, where "All XXX are Evil, but those are OUR XXX and they're okay."

The usual cases quoted on corporate personhood derive from the 14th amendment's (1868) guarantee of rights to "persons," and hence the question of whether a corporation is a "person" in the sense of the 14th amendment. The Wikipedia article, as currently written, appears to ignore the critical case: County of Santa Clara v. Southern Pacific Railroad. (1886) In this case the court reporter wrote that the 14th amendment applied to the case, even though this does not appear anywhere in the published opinions.<br><br>Without knowing about this case and the 14th amendment connection, the rest of your comment makes no sense.<br><br>@Nuku<br><br>As a long-time student of the Michael Teachings, I'm going to weigh in to answer your question. That's going to take some background. I'm also going to simplify the terminology significantly to avoid having to go into unnecessary details.<br><br>One of the key factors in the MT is that the soul, over the progression of incarnations, accumulates experience that shows up as a progressive widening of horizons in lots of different directions. This is a linear progression: souls do not lose experience, although additional experience may cause major reevaluations.<br><br>Societies have facets that cater to the needs of souls in all different stages of their growth, just as they have facets that cater to people in all different stages of physical growth from infancy to old age.<br><br>If the spread of experience levels was a steady state, then history would indeed not have a direction; it would simply be a mosaic of Consciousness trying out different things to gain experience in how they worked.<br><br>However. Also according to the MT, there are a fixed number of souls (we call them Essences) in this particular branch of Consciousness, so the average amount of experience goes up over long spans of time, and the balance of factors needed in a society to support gaining the needed experience will change over long spans of time.<br><br>I look at this as a mosaic with pieces made up of several pictures. When pieces of one picture are replaced by pieces of another, the perception of what "the picture" actually is can change. There was such a change about 5000 years ago with the growth of villages and cities, and another about 2500 years ago with what some historians call the Axial Age. Are we due for another in the near future? Maybe.

Short of redefining the "Creator" as "community" or "consensus" or some Jungian "Collective Unconscious," it seems like we would need to start with a non-hatred of mankind, a kind of optimism about how people act when not under some external compulsion.

But that only applied to men who were bona fide members of a religion, like the Quakers, who had a strong tradition of nonparticipation in military duty. <br><br>The above is an example of socially agreed upon specific exemptions to laws that normally applied to all (men of draft age). Religious belief was grounds for exemption, but the onus of proving that the exemption applied was on you. <br><br>As a footnote, in my case I made application for objector status, even though I knew I wouldn’t qualify, simply as a delaying tactic; the application and associated appeal process took more than a year during which time I found a sympathetic shrink who was willing to write a letter stating that I was mentally unfit for military duty and, since that was also an exemption, I was excused from military service on those grounds. This is an example of gaming the system and having the resources to do so. Was it fair, I guess not, but I’ve got no regrets. I had a very deep objection to fighting in an unjust unnecessary war, but that wasn’t a socially acceptable exemption. I recognize that some poor and probably poorly educated kid went in my place and maybe ended up dead or scared for life, but equally, some Quaker kid didn’t have to compromise his deeply held religious convictions.

I’ve heard of the teachings and may even have browsed one of the books long ago, but don’t have any memory of the details. <br>From what you say, I gather that the sum total of experience of each of a fixed number of “souls” grows over long time spans. Ok, but does having more experiences automatically lead to these souls “progressing“ in something other than simply having a greater amount of experiences? Something like wisdom, moral purity, being a better soul, etc. <br>I would venture to say that this is the implicit assumption in MT: more experience=wisdom/better soul. In other words some sort of ethical, moral, spiritual growth/progress. That’s of course a possible opinion and an appealing one. I’m thinking, with a smile here, of the movie “Groundhog Day” yes? However I can also imagine a person/soul having lived a huge amount of experiences who doesn’t get any “better” whatever that means. Maybe some of the experiences change the soul in positive ways (however you define that), and maybe this is balanced by other experiences which change the soul in negative ways, so that in the end the soul just stays the same, in essence no progress just more experience. I don’t know, just exploring...<br><br><a href=#c309500397130652181 title="comment permalink">5/14/16, 11:38 PM</a><br><br>

As to whether they'll work in the real world, well, that depends on whether you believe that two plus two equals five - some people may believe that (a friend was fond of telling me that joke and adding in the side line: A guide to creative accounting).<br><br>As far as I can tell, and I may be wrong, the US is currently strengthening its buying power relative to other currencies.

It just can't happen. It is simply not possible. Nature provides negative feedback loops which limit the human population for free, without any real concern for individual wants, needs, or wishes. As individuals and also as a culture we have to be able to accommodate ourselves to those limits because they are real, and that is termed: "maturity".<br><br>What I reckon you lot are actually discussing with a great deal of unnecessary heat is accommodation of your own wants, needs, and desires without any particular reference to that of the greater ecological realities.<br><br>And I'm very uncomfortable that there are a whole lot of people living in glass houses and throwing a whole lot of rocks around.

It was basically the North that had changed through the industrial revolution, while the agrarian South remained the same. Of course, New England slave ships had basically dumped a lot of slaves on the South and flooded the market before the slave trade was outlawed. The tentative truce and balance of power between South &amp; North that brought the Union into being had basically been ripped up by the time of the outbreak of the Civil War. No sane person could imagine the Confederacy continuing human slavery into the 20th century. Every country in the world had emancipated its slaves by the end of the 19th century, and there is no reason to think the Confederacy any different. Even thoughtful Southerners were contemplating the end of the "peculiar institution", but the thing about the South is, when some self-righteous, hypocritical Yankee demands we do something, we reflexively dig in our heels and fight to the end for it. The worst case scenario of the Confederacy regarding slavery is that is becomes some kind of pariah state like South Africa and apartheid, and international pressure and embargoes finally force the Confederacy's hand, and they have to give up slavery to maintain their economy. The sad thing about the Confederacy is that its military generals, like Lee, were "honorable" men, who felt fighting a guerrilla war below them, so did not fight the North in the way that they could win. If the Confederacy had fought the North like North Vietnam &amp; Afghanistan and engaged in guerrilla tactics, they would have won.<br>Regarding the conservative nature of the American Revolution, one of the first things the new states did was codify English Common Law as the law of the land, thereby providing continuity of legal systems and rule of law.<br><br><a href=#c5180357514531840815 title="comment permalink">5/15/16, 8:01 AM</a><br><br>

Admittedly, the metastasis of the federal government has reached a point that that no longer really functions, and a breakup of the country is a real possibility as a result -- have you by any chance read my novel <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i>, in which that's one of the main plot elements? <br><br>Onething, the idea that most young women were virgins at marriage before the modern era is one of those "good old days" fantasies that social conservatives cling to. Teen pregnancies in the US peaked in 1960 and have declined ever since; go back a little further, and premarital virginity was pretty much exclusively an upper- and middle-class obsession, as it increased the marketability of young women in the largely commercial transaction of marriage. Outside the upper reaches of society -- and of course the middle classes were much smaller then -- the usual habit was that young people played around, and when a young woman got pregnant, she got married as promptly as possible, usually but not always to the father. A remarkable number of first pregnancies resulted in a healthy birth in a lot less than nine months...<br><br>Shane, I'll be satisfied if he enforces the immigration laws, chucks a few trade treaties, and walks away from the new Cold War with Russia. The policies of the recent past have been so disastrous that the bar for improvement is very, very low just now. <br><br>Justin, not yet. I mostly read books by dead people these days, though Atwood's trilogy is on the get-to list. <br><br>Lewis, I'll certainly pass that on. <br><br>HalFiore, you seem to think that a conservative would say, "We've made an awful mistake, and therefore we must keep making it!" There's nothing revolutionary about either Trump or Sanders -- neither one is suggesting anything that would have been surprising in the least before the Reagan revolution sent the US and its inner circle of allies into the current, and disastrously misguided, bipartisan consensus. We've got two candidates who want to go back to what worked, and one candidate who wants to keep on pursuing a failed set of innovations until it runs this country into the ground; that being the case, calling the latter the conservative choice is, if I may be frank, absurd. <br><br>As for your second question, a right is the legal expression of a value held by most people in a society. If I say, "I think legally competent consenting adults ought to be able to make marital choices without government interference," that's an opinion expressing a value. I can present various arguments in favor of that opinion, of course. If enough people end up sharing that opinion, then the institutions of government establish the right. You don't begin by establishing a right; you begin with a debate over values, and the establishment of the right is the final step in the process. <br><br>Mark, very much so. Classic liberalism and Burkean conservatism are complementary, and yes, there's a balance of idealism and pragmatism between them, with occasional strayings from either side. As for occasionally lapsing into idealism, why, yes -- my Retrotopia series (which will be picking up again next week) is, after all, an expression of my ideas about what a much better society would be like.<br><br><a href=#c3149886713513707376 title="comment permalink">5/15/16, 3:30 PM</a><br><br>

Jessi partly nailed it, I think, when she wrote, "I have a pet theory that the hippie generation was the first generation in which children's primary attachments were to each other instead of their parents." But in those days children's primary adult attachments were not only to their parents and close relatives, but also to adults in the much wider community. I dont think most people know, now, that this was a part of 'teen life back in those days.<br><br>I belong to the Silent Generation, and my 'teen years were the '50s. I had several good older adult friends, who were not part of our extended family or in our immediate neighborhood, with whom I would have long talks about all sorts of things that a 'teen really would rather not talk about with his (or her) parents. I would visit with them after school. I don't remember that my own parents ever so much as met met any of them. And this was not unusual for my generation. My age-mates had such friends also, different from mine, whom I hardly ever met. (And we didn't "run in packs" as much as young people seem to do now, but spent a lot of our time outside of any "pack" of our agemates.)<br><br>All this was rather decisively tossed out the window during the "Never Trust Anyone Over 30" years, tossed out voluntarily by most young people of the Boomer generation and the generations that followed that one. And eventually, during the several "moral panics" that surfaced in the later '80s and the '90s, it ceased to be a voluntary thing, and started to be enforced by the culture and its institutions. It also became risky, even legally dangerous at times, for older people to enter into such friendships with the young. <br><br>By the time I retired from my university (in 2005), I had occasionally heard undergraduates quite seriously discussing whether there could ever be a genuine friendship between a senior and a freshman: they were, the argument went, at such different stages in their lives as to have little common ground for friendship. And now some of the young parents in our immediate neighborhood seem to feel it is inherently wrong to leave their own children in the care of people who are not their own older relatives, even for a few hours. This appears almost to be a moral issue in their culture.<br><br><a href=#c421164419796382544 title="comment permalink">5/15/16, 4:38 PM</a><br><br>

To avoid some jargon that might lead to more heat than light, I'm going to say that the learning focus of each of the five stages is: survival, security, achievement, relationships and being oneself. For people looking for an "occult philosophy" hook, yes, there are two more stages, but they don't appear on the physical plane. When one of them does show up, you can assume that the situation is about to go to you know where, and an intervention is needed. People like Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed and a very small number of others are the emergency rescue crew.<br><br>The actual sequence is seven levels in each of the five phases, and moving from one level to the next has specific requirements that have to be met. It's possible to gain more experience without learning anything, but sooner or later gaining more and more of the same kind of experience gets rather old. It's not possible to backtrack, although it is possible for a lifetime to go horribly wrong and need several lifetimes to balance.<br><br>The current mean in the planetary population is toward the end of the achievement phase, which is why present-day societies, like those for the last couple of thousand years, have been set up to give lots of rewards to achievement, in terms of hierarchy, power, money, access to high quality mates and so forth. In the last century or so, there have been a lot of social facets coming in that support a relationship perspective. At present, there are roughly equal numbers of souls in an achievement and relationship perspective, but many of the ones with a relationship perspective still haven't shaken off the achievement imprinting.<br><br>To bring this toward this week's topic, this week's essay has to do with the fourth level of the relationship phase: right relationships within a specific society. The fifth level has to do with right relationships between the sexes/genders, the sixth has to do with right relationships among societies and the seventh has to do with right relationships with all the other species with which we share the planet.<br><br>One of the overall lessons is that you are not going to teach a soul a lesson for a level that it isn't ready for, than you're going to teach an 8-year old boy why his 16-year old brother is acting irrationally toward a giiiirl. That doesn't mean that someone in the security phase can't be taught that "the way" is to use Robert's Rules of Order and chuck people who won't follow procedure out the door; it just means that they won't understand why it works, any more than that 8-year old boy can understand *why* his 16-year-old brother is acting irrationally.<br><br>The "myth of progress" is specific to the achievement phase: progress represents an achievement.<br><br><a href=#c8441686237060621243 title="comment permalink">5/15/16, 6:57 PM</a><br><br>

Where Burke meets Tainter is, of course, in Retrotopia. Less aphoristically, the Burkean conservative approach to excess complexity is what I've elsewhere described as climbing back down the ladder -- replacing complex technologies with simpler ones that are already familiar and thoroughly tested, and centralized arrangements with decentralized ones that make use of existing structures and institutions, using arrangements like the tier system described in <i>Retrotopia</i> tnat allow people to choose how fast they climb down the ladder -- and, of course, how much technology they really want to pay for. As for Retrotopia, next week's post is in process, and Mr. Carr has plenty to say...<br><br>Alex, I talked a little about the fate of US allies in a post-American world in <a href=../../2012/11/in-twilight-of-empires.html rel=nofollow>an earlier post here</a>. US geopolitical strategy focused on building up a ring of subservient allies on the periphery of Eurasia -- Britain, Japan, and the small nations of the Persian Gulf are the major surviving examples -- and using those to play containment games against potential Eurasian rivals. When the US goes down, it's going to be payback time. Japan's getting ready for that with a military buildup; Britain seems completely clueless -- as far as I can tell, all three major parties are tacitly assuming that the protective umbrella of US power will keep Britain safe forever -- and so the payback is likely to be correspondingly worse. As for Corbyn, agreed -- the Tories are using the same playbook as both US parties, which focuses on reducing the lower 80% to Third World conditions so that the upper 20% can maintain their current comforts. Corbyn might well replace that with less shortsighted policies. <br><br>Mikep, that may just be the best explanation for the current social-justice frenzy I've heard yet. <br><br>Tripp, you'll get no argument from me. I have never darkened the door of a Mall*Wart and I have never shopped at Amazon, in both cases because I won't put up with the way their policies affect others. <br><br>Gottfried, any war's a complex thing, and simple explanations rarely stretch far. For France, sure, the American Revolution was an opportunity to stick it to the British Empire; for Britain, it was all about hanging onto a place to stick the business end of the imperial wealth pump; for the colonists, it was partly about detaching said wealth pump, partly about overturning a whole series of punitive and predatory legislation, and partly about overthrowing British treaties with Native American nations that restricted white settlement to the Atlantic coast. It was the predatory and punitive legislation that roused Burke's ire, as far as I know. Of course it wasn't about freedom in the abstract -- again, grand abstract principles count for very little in the real world, except as raw material for rhetoric; it was a matter of specific freedoms and specific burdens, as it always is. <br><br>Prizm, not next week's -- that's going to be the next episode of <i>Retrotopia</i> -- but shortly afterwards, yes, it's time for that. I recently fielded a news story on that subject that's far too delectable a handle to let pass. <br><br>Cris, hmm! That's an interesting idea, and one that I'll certainly consider. <br><br>David, depends on the party. If the party's corrupt enough, it's usually a waste of time; that said, without a party organization, a single individual has a hard time making much of an impact -- well, unless he or she happens to be a charismatic demagogue.<br><br><a href=#c6876740115589228627 title="comment permalink">5/15/16, 7:07 PM</a><br><br>

I've thought similarly about that issue (including the part about letting conservative Christians businesses serve who they will. I've never thought about it the particular way you came to it before, it's more just a general wariness about regulating people's private lives unnecessarily)<br><br>Having read recently some of the alt-right's opinions on social change, I'm wondering how Burkean conservatism tends to view social change in general (as opposed to purely political changes like marriage legislation). Something that I've found disagreement with in both the alt-right's ideas and much of traditional conservatism is the idea that social change in western cultures away from traditional western forms is inherently bad, and equates it with being taken over or conquered by a different culture. It seems to me that the distinction between two very different scenarios is often lost, the two scenarios looking something like<br><br>A) Cultural change that emerges within a society, coming from experiments with ideas imported from other cultures and homegrown new ideas.<br><br>B) Cultural change imposed of a society by outside forces, being dominated by another culture.<br><br>I personally see these as two totally different circumstances, scenario B is clearly not a good position to be in, but I can't see scenario A as being bad, especially at the present time when the course we're on is so disastrous. More people experimenting with different ways of living means there's more of a chance some of them will be adaptive to the changing times. If everything was going well, I could understand the appeal of a more hardline conservative position, but I can't see our present circumstances as a good time to be rigid on these things.<br><br>On the other hand, the left in America, by and large, seems so attached to the myth of progress and the idea of American supremacy (even if they don't think it's a good thing) that they can't imagine being subject to scenario B as ever being possible, and thus have a blind spot to the dangers of mass immigration and the like. So once again I don't find myself agreeing with any of the typical posttions of this. I'm wondering what the Burkean position would look like.<br><br>I wonder if you're planning on doing any posts on the whole issues of isolationism vs multiculturalism and the like, as it seems to be an issue that's soon to explode into the forefront and I don't have a firm position on it all at this point. If I look at the big view, it seems like similarly to biological evolution, diversity and isolation of cultures must both have their benefits and drawbacks in different places and different times. In the evolution of species, diversity within a species is good for resilience, but isolation is also important in the evolution of new species. I'd think cultural evolution is similar, but I don't really know how that applies to our current situation.<br><br><a href=#c815924343451741910 title="comment permalink">5/15/16, 7:18 PM</a><br><br>

Most problems can be solved in many different ways, and a way of solving them that develops organically out of past decisions and structures, and causes as little disruption as possible, reliably causes far fewer problems down the road than a way that imposes some abstract ideal on the grubby complexities of human life. I'll take your last example as characteristic. Every single nation that had slaves of African ancestry abolished slavery before the end of the 19th century; some did it well before the US. None of them had the ghastly aftermath we did, because in every other case it was done deliberately, without the frenzy and violence and toxic self-righteousness displayed by both sides in the struggle over slavery here. Should slavery have been ended here in the US? Absolutely. Could it have been done in a way that didn't produce the century-long nightmare of Jim Crow? Of course. <br><br>Barry, I'm quite a fan of Karl Popper, and would certainly agree with your description of his theory of the Open Society as drawing on Burke to some extent. Alexander -- that's a more complex matter. For example, I don't agree with his paradox; to my mind, it's not a paradox but a non sequitur. Given that an orderly collective transition is no longer possible, and we have limited time and resources, throwing more of both after the fantasy of an orderly collective transition is a waste we can't afford. At this point, it's up to individuals, families, local organizations, and communities to collapse now and avoid the rush -- and they'll need all the resources and time they have to spare. <br><br>Peter, you're welcome and thank you! In point of fact, the parallels have been much on my mind, too. Virtue ethics, like Burkean politics, starts from the assumption that there's no one right answer and that any decision has to be a compromise between contending interests -- in the case of virtue ethics, contending virtues, none of which can be wholly satisfied without rejecting the claims of others with equal merit. <br><br>Shrama, if you'll go back to my post, you'll find I didn't say that. I said that conservative Christianity is a minority religion in the West. That little adjective "conservative" really does matter! Not all Christians reject same sex marriage, you know -- in fact, many denominations have already accepted it, and many people who belong to denominations that haven't accepted it differ from the official viewpoint of their own churches. The subset of Christians who do reject same sex marriage is a minority in Western countries. <br><br>Cathy, agreed -- if you're going to claim a religious exemption, you can't pick and choose, any more than someone who's applying for a conscientious-objector exemption from the draft is allowed to say, "Well, I'm against this war, but not that one." As for the rest, of course; the whole point in saying "reasonable accommodation where that does not unduly infringe on the rights of others" is that it calls for case by case decisions about what's reasonable and what infringements are undue.<br><br>Onething, a refreshingly pragmatic point of view!

Are you sure it's only going to include those who think the way you do, about transgendered people, or about other issues? Au contraire, if you justify the use of coercion to pursue your social goals, after all, you provide exactly the same justification for others to use coercion to oppose your social goals. That's why liberty -- again, not as a grand abstract principle, but as a general agreement among members of a society not to use coercion to control one another's behavior except when a formal constitution, accepted by the great majority of people, authorizes it -- really is the best or, rather, the least bad strategy; while it inevitably permits injustices to happen, so does every other way of arranging human affairs, and the injustices tend to be somewhat less extreme and somewhat more easily remedied under the rule of constitutional liberty than under other arrangements.<br><br>Crow Hill, excellent! A useful reminder that current stereotypes about same sex couples may not be valid outside of narrow historical and cultural boundaries. (For that matter, I used to live not that many blocks from the J&amp;L Saloon, a gay leather bar in Seattle, and some of those guys could probably have stunned a rhino with a punch.)<br><br>BoysMom, I tend to see things a little differently -- obviously! Religious tolerance comes in when societies become sufficiently complex and cosmopolitan that choosing one's religion is an option, and it stays in place as long as that condition applies. In China, for example, the idea of religious tolerance came in with the T'ang and remained in place right up to the 1949 revolution, because China never thereafter lost the urban centers and social complexity needed to support that level of flexibility. When industrial civilization goes away, those parts of the world that retain cities and long distance trade -- even if both are vastly smaller and simpler than they are now -- are likely to retain religious tolerance, while those that contract to subsistence farming and the like will return to the sort of system where your religion is the one you grow up with, because that's the only option there is. More on this in an upcoming post. <br><br>Varun, it's an immense irony, no question! Thanks for the link; I'll have a look as time permits. <br><br>Hawkcreek, but I didn't say that we have no rights. I said that rights don't exist in some kind of abstract sense, separate from the fabric of social agreements that create and constitute them. Those "absolute rights" don't exist at all in a failed state, for example -- certainly not in any sense that means anything; anyone with a gun, presuming that you don't have one or are out of bullets, can deprive you of all three at any moment. Even in a settled society, you can be deprived of those rights by legal means: you can, after all, be arrested by the police for the commission of a crime, and deprived of your property, your liberty, or your life by a court -- so in what possible sense are those rights "absolute"? That is to say, I see that kind of abstract theorizing as of limited value when it comes to making sense of how rights function in the real world.<br><br><a href=#c6665026096178065127 title="comment permalink">5/15/16, 7:46 PM</a><br><br>

Having stated the Burkean position, that rights are created by a consensus of the members of a society in a particular place and time, are thus subject to change, and in an “ideal“ Burkean republic consensus comes about in part, by mature, respectful, meaningful discussion of issues (some of which are “hot button” ones at the time), JMG then introduces an issue or two as examples which he explores from the Burkean viewpoint. <br>What then happens of course is that various commentators who have a personal interest in the hot button issue express their opinions and a discussion actually starts around those issues; which of course nicely illustrates JMG’s thesis about how consensus discussions can happen. Since the tone of this blog is set by our thoughtful and mature moderator, and since the blog is to some extent self-selecting of mature thoughtful people, the discussion doesn’t descend into snarl words and pettiness. <br>Not all commentators are drawn to commenting on the specific hot button examples chosen by JMG to illustrate his main point. Some make comments on the main point itself either through logical argument and analysis, or through introducing their own experiences that bear on the theme of the post.<br>So, while I too have certain topics that are dear to my heart and which aren’t at times featured, I also find much of interest and enlightenment in following along both JMG’s themes and in seeing how all of you other commentators “run with the ball“. <br>Its a great pleasure to be part of this, dare I say it, community.

There are many households where these roles are reversed. Do remember, an adoption is always planned. That's an advantage over probably half the other babies in the population.

The one scrap of justification Jefferson put into the Declaration of Independence is the claim that people are "endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights" -- that's the theological justification for abstract rights, and as I noted in my post, it's the one way of making that claim that makes some degree of sense. (It's all the more ironic that Jefferson himself was basically an atheist; he never became a Freemason, unlike a lot of the other leaders of the revolutionary era, and I've long suspected that that's because English and American Freemasonry have always required belief in a supreme being as a basic condition of membership.) But there it is -- and it's worth noting that the Declaration of Independence has no binding force in American law, which is probably just as well. <br><br>Nuku, understood. You do what you have to do. <br><br>Jason, let's try repeating this again to see if it sinks in: "<i><b>reasonable</b></i> accommodation where this does not <i><b>unduly</b></i> infringe on the rights of others." It fascinates me that people seem to be unable to process those words "reasonable" and "unduly," and insist that any accommodation or infringement must be pushed to the furthest possible extreme. As for whether somebody's right and somebody else's wrong, that's as irrelevant as it's objectively undecidable: what we know is that there's a difference between strongly held opinions, and a need to work out some kind of compromise that allows people to live together in relative peace. <br><br>Pygmycory, oh, I wish they'd kept the name and the acronym! As for Progressive Conservatives, yes, I remember that from my first stint in college -- that was in Bellingham, WA, not that far south of the border.

It's fascinating to contemplate, and leads me to wonder if people really are desperate enough for something other than the same old nonanswers that they'll even listen to the ravings of archdruids!<br><br>Shane, Sanders has moved considerably over toward a populist stance since his campaign started, and his ability to attract a broad spectrum of voters is impressive as well.

One of the things I've valued most about my involvement in fraternal orders is the chance to establish friendships with men many years older and younger than I am. It's quite something to sit at a table eating pizza and talking with a guy who's just had both legs amputated as a long term result of frostbite he suffered in the Ardennes Forest during the Battle of the Bulge, when the guy sitting next to me wasn't born yet when George Bush Sr. launched the first Iraq war. I wonder what can be done to make such connections accessible to others? <br><br>Justin, no argument about the nuclear business. A sane US government, assuming we could get such a thing, would push for a nuclear treaty that would ratchet everyone down to 250 warheads, and take plenty of other steps to renormalize relations and stop manufacturing tensions. It'd be a slam dunk for the Nobel Peace Prize and would save everyone billions a year, but it wouldn't feed the fantasies of omnipotence that wash through too many heads inside the beltway! <br><br>Ozark, to my mind, a Burkean approach to social change would start by noting that every society is always balanced between pressures for change, in a galaxy of directions, and pressures to remain stable. In the case of each proposed change, a society needs to decide, by way of its political and cultural institutions, whether the change is a good idea or not. Thus lumping "social change" together as a single thing is unproductive; what matters is each specific change and its effects, so far as those can be determined, compared with the effects of leaving things alone. Yes, that means rejecting any of the typical positions on the subject! <br><br>Zach, the Burkean approach doesn't assume that a group of people with a view that happens to be unpopular at the moment is a "rearguard," since history isn't going in any particular direction. They're simply a minority, and in our society, it's customary to provide reasonable accommodation to the beliefs of religious minorities. Of course the state has the power to use coercion to enforce codes of behavior -- one of the goals of a society that values liberty, though, is to see to it that this power is used as little as possible, and then only to maintain the essential liberties and rights the nation has established.<br><br><a href=#c8969553211903252281 title="comment permalink">5/16/16, 12:03 AM</a><br><br>

It's wrong. <br><br>For most of its history, Pagan Rome was in contact with only one monotheistic religion, the Jewish one. <br><br>The Romans had a great respect for ancient religions and old customs of other peoples as long as those beliefs and practices were not seen as threats to public morals or the power of the state. They thought Jewish practices were somewhat exotic but not immoral. <br><br>During the Republic and the early years of the empire, Jews lived all over Roman territory, engaged in many occupations, and were permitted to proselytize. The Jews were pretty effective missionaries; they acquired converts and many Romans who weren't willing to adopt the full yoke of the Law (which included exacting standards of purity and circumcision for males) admired the teachings of Judaism to the extent of becoming "God fearers" which is to say, unaffiliated monotheists. A comparable phenomenon today would be Americans who decorate their yards with Tibetan prayer flags, meditate and believe in reincarnation, but don't formally convert to Buddhism. The Temple in Jerusalem was a tourist attraction to Romans like the Taj Mahal today.<br><br>The Roman rulers of Judea gave the Jews a privilege no other provincial nation received: Jews were excused from making offerings to the genius of the Emperor. For Pagans in the Roman Empire, this offering was the equivalent of reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and it was mandatory. <br><br>The High Priest and his family were confirmed in their authority by the Roman government and the Jewish royal family accommodated themselves to Roman rule to hold on to their position. Some rabbis supported nationalist revolts. The third Judean revolt against Roman rule caused the army so much trouble that the Emperor lost patience, ordered the Temple sacked and leveled, and exiled all the Jews from their homeland. That wasn't because they were monotheists and the Romans were polytheists. It was over who controlled the wealth of Judea. Following this there was a serious government-sponsored persecution of Jews throughout the Empire, with Torah scrolls being burnt and rabbis being executed. However, once the armed resistance had been thoroughly suppressed, the Roman authorities relented and teaching of the Torah resumed. Soon after this, the Talmud was written in Jerusalem and Babylonia while those places were under pagan Roman rule.<br><br>Christianity, once it split off from Judaism to become a separate cult, was a different kettle of fish. The Romans were suspicious of new religions.<br><br><a href=#c8011196649119021274 title="comment permalink">5/16/16, 1:14 AM</a><br><br>

I wonder what can be done to make such connections accessible to others?"<br><br>For one thing, a revival of some of the old fraternal orders would help, or the creation of new ones around current myths and symbols. Who now even knows the Biblical story of how King Solomon built his temple in Jerusalem well enough for the fine details to fire his imagination? It was that particular imaginal fire that gave the old Freemasonic rituals their power. Do we share even one such imaginal hearth now? <br><br>One of the things that used to be said about Freemasonry -- perhaps it is still being said -- is that it included the art and craft of "making good men better." That is important. I think that, by and large, only older men can pass this art on to younger men in ways that really stick. They share the same inner hormonal life. <br><br>In my 'teen years I was a member of the Order of DeMolay, as my father had been before me. (His was a Masonic family, but he had not gone on into the Craft himself.) I kept no friendships from my local chapter after I went to college, but I still regard the Order's rituals and meetings as a major formative influence in my life -- so much so that I later managed to find and buy on eBay copies of Demolay ritual books used in my day, the 7th editions of the secret _Ritual Degrees and Ceremonials_ and the even more secret _Book of Secret Work_. (The not-at-all-secret _Monitor of Ceremonies_ hadn't been published yet, but some of the texts in it were used in typewritten form.) <br><br>The Demolay meetings were also where I learned how _Robert's Rules of Order_ worked in practice. Later, when I became an academic, I found that hardly any of my colleagues understood anything of how to conduct a meeting under those Rules of Order.<br><br>There is a very interesting and perceptive African working the New Age circuits, named Malidoma Somé. His first, shortest book is (IMHO) by far his best: _Ritual: Power, Healing and Community_ (1993). In it he states that the great illness of modern Western society is its lack of profound common ritual activity, particularly the lack of initiations into the communities of adult (male or female) life for young men by older men and (differently) for young women by older women. He comes back to this favorite theme of his again and again in his later books and articles. From my own experience, I think he has put his finger onto something of the highest importance here.<br><br>But again, I do not see how this can be done effectively in the sort of fragmented society we have made for ourselves over the last century or so.<br><br><a href=#c6119276212825154944 title="comment permalink">5/16/16, 7:40 AM</a><br><br>

To me, that's a straightforward case of assault and should be treated as such. Especially in today's Topsy-turvy world where a schoolyard fight can bring felony charges and so can defending oneself against a bully. Or for that matter, a baby waving its rattle at a cop is considered Battery because "he was brandishing a weapon."<br><br>The second is the barber who told a customer that he doesn't cut black hair - and then pulled a gun on the customer. The first was his right. The second was way out of bounds. What's interesting was the barber's rationale: "He argued with me! (questioned his terminology. I read the story.)

Is this where we get to talk about Paul Feyerabend? Pretty please?<br><br>To my mind, he was the best of the postmodernists. He said what he meant, in plain English, and never took anything back just because other people didn't like it. And when he finally realized he had simply made the opposite mistake of the rationalists, he spent the last years of his life criticizing himself and reformulating his views to avoid the problems.<br><br>He titled his views "epistemological anarchism" but it was also epistemological populism -- what it really was was epistemological dissensus. We are better off if everybody thinks what and how they want to and has as much freedom to act on those beliefs as we can afford. Then we can see what ideas work and which don't.<br><br>A very similar philosopher was Richard Rorty, who started in the same way as Feyerabend -- a rationalist and eliminative materialist who broke ranks in favor of a flavor of postmodernism. By the end, their views are quite hard to tell apart, except that Feyerabend had a flair for the dramatic (he titled a book <i>Farewell to Reason</i> and I'm told the original edition of <i>Against Method</i> at one point compared science to prostitution) while Rorty preferred a quieter style.<br><br>All that said, I think I have an idea of the sort of "standard delusions and deceptions" you're going to talk about. Many of the more standard postmodernists managed to convince themselves that they were simply the cutting-edge, perhaps even final phase, of Progress and that Nature didn't really exist since everything was a social construct and we could pretty much decide what reality was for us.<br><br><a href=#c7751312877249177735 title="comment permalink">5/16/16, 8:23 AM</a><br><br>

When I dig through the deep strata of jargon, it seems to be trivial and obvious (everything is a product of a specific cultural and historical context and its meaning derives from that context, well, duh!). So I have never been sure whether I was missing something, or what. When I took some online quiz about "how postmodern are you?" I scored like 98%, but again I thought the questions were obvious and dumb, not insightful or revelatory. <br><br>About the concern for looming insurgency or war, yeah, I know there are alarming noises and deep tensions... but I remember the Civil Rights era in the South. I remember our Lieutenant Governor with his axe handle to keep the n*****s out of his restaurant. When MLK was assassinated I sat in the same second grade classroom as his youngest son in an Atlanta public school that had been unwillingly desegregated just a few years before. If forced desegregation and voting rights did not cause the entrenched upper class white power base to break away from the Union, what will? There was plenty of violent oppressive action, and of course abundant acts of lethal terrorism, but a full-fledged insurgency never came about, nor was there any second seccession. It did push the white racists out of the Democratic Party (their traditional home since Jefferson) and into the waiting arms of the Republicans, but that is the sort of political realignment has generally happened a few times in each Century. <br><br>The one Civil War we have had was about an institution that was at the foundation of the economy supporting the entire Southern power structure. The schisms we have now are of a different nature. And the economic forces that are driving the empire down are global and impersonal. <br><br>Of course forecasting "future history" is one of the most questionable things we bobtailed monkeys engage in, so only the coming decades will really tell.<br><br><a href=#c8135695291757343322 title="comment permalink">5/16/16, 8:49 AM</a><br><br>

Very provocative. <br><br>I think that the only thing that prevents me from more fully embracing a true "conservative" political point of view is the thorny issue of the commons. If there is one natural right that should be obvious, it should be the right to share and have access to unpolluted air, water and earth, after all that is the right that is granted to all living things by virtue of the Earth that is our home. I know that's a little different from the definition of "right" as you defined it, but when this fundamental right is taken away a society will collapse either through internal violence, depletion of resources or both. So maybe that's not a right per se, but when individuals act unilaterally based on self interest, it doesn't normally result it good outcomes. It certainly hasn't in this particular iteration of human history. <br><br>This, of course, calls into question the "right" to own private property in the first place and the implied threat (or real use) of violence to enforce it, which is ultimately the bedrock on which all conservative thought is founded, at least in my understanding of it. Granted, maybe I'm not fully understanding it. <br><br>On the other hand, I don't dispute that there are men and women of great talent and genius that leave behind enormously valuable legacies of tradition that do work, so to speak, and it's certainly in the best interest of our species to let those individuals have access to resources and for their legacies to be preserved in the various human institutions. And I also agree that it does appear that attempts to fix a broken system almost inevitably makes things worse. I think that many of us who have had a previous life as social activists come around to that hard reality sooner or later. <br><br>I haven't really come to any real conclusion on this. Maybe Stiner was correct in that as a species we'll have to slowly evolve toward a more workable synthesis, but that would require faith in the direction of history... so... I dunno. Maybe things just fall apart and that's okay. <br><br>Anyway, thanks for another great post, lots to chew on!<br><br>Jeff<br><br><a href=#c7137049235116111510 title="comment permalink">5/16/16, 11:41 AM</a><br><br>

One implication of this recognition is that when human beings insist that the tangled realities of politics and history can be reduced to some set of abstract principles simple enough for the human mind to understand, they’re wrong. Another is that when human beings try to set up a system of government based on abstract principles, rather than allowing it to take shape organically out of historical experience, the results will pretty reliably be disastrous."<br>- We not being as smart ... gives me the insight, that when so, I may exagerate only to shout down the minority-complex I am disturbed by.<br>- Simplyfying the complex entagled reality makes it easier to handle, but also more misleading.<br>- Last, but not least there is less benefit to rush. Just watch the steps I go. I can always do what I do. Reform it a little (or a lot, or not at all) as I see, what works. Rushing is a sign of emergency or panic ahead.

Positive and negative freedoms. The concept of positive freedoms and negative freedoms has nothing to do with any moral foundation or value system, only what can be added and what can be taken away, hence the name.<br><br> Negative freedoms are things that can be taken away from a person. So a person living on a deserted island has every conceivable negative freedom. That person can run around naked and screaming, smashing everything in sight with a big stick because there is no one around to prevent them from doing so.<br><br> Positive rights can only be added through cooperation. Broadly speaking, they are freedoms that can not be achieved without the help of others. For example going to the moon. It is beyond the scope of a single person to build a Saturn V rocket on their own in the course of a single lifetime.<br><br> Of course, these examples are extremes, almost everything lies somewhere in the middle. Libraries are a good example. A person gains access to books that that person doesn't own (a gain of a positive freedom) but that person is required to be quiet in the library (a loss of a negative freedom) in order to do so. In the broadest possible terms a limit of negative freedoms allows for the expansion of positive freedoms.<br><br> Where these lines should be drawn is the heart of the matter and that requires a value system. Different value systems will naturally draw the lines in different places. This framework isn't really helpful for deciding where the lines should be, but it is useful for discussing freedoms and rights with someone from a different value system.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br>PS Sorry for posting this so late.

Which, oddly enough Obama actually said in 2008.<br><br>This has become my litmus test for politicians. Trump comes closest to addressing it. Perhaps not close enough. Bernie comes in second, but has said a few things. The CAUSE of the high prices are a nontopic in the media. It's generally spoken of as if it were some weird storm (act of God) we were experiencing.

That is a testament to its orthodoxy, but the orthodox opinion is always truncated. Post-modernism (at least as handled by the best of its thinkers) is a mind-blowing philosophy. But then again, so is pre-modern thought if we give it space to be present. But the independent presence of different philosophical perspectives is the first victim of post-modern thought: their independent standing is denied by their submission to the mechanics of "cultural relativism." So post-modern thought becomes both hard to perceive in itself, and erodes the possibility of perceiving other systems of thought as well.<br><br><a href=#c8341512661887411152 title="comment permalink">5/17/16, 7:15 AM</a><br><br>

Let’s examine them from a pragmatic lens (call it burkean if you want).<br>1 – The Lottery.<br>It is an almost perfect portrait of our society.<br>Yes, the sacrifice of Mrs. Hutchinson is horrible, but she had no problem with it until it was her time to be sacrificed. The price wasn’t too high as long as it was someone else to pay the price. When Mrs Delacroix says : "Be a good sport, Tessie" one has to consider how many times did Mrs Hutchinson said the same or similar words.<br>And if you read that story again the most vocal advocate of the lottery is the man that has been reaping it’s benefits for the longer time, Old Man Warner, that has been present to seventy seven lotteries. When someone tells him that some places are considering to ditch the lottery he says : “Next thing you know, they'll be wanting to go back to living in caves”.<br>The burkean conservatives in the story are the progressives, the ones that live in the places where they have given up the lottery. The change, even if it implied eating chickweed and acorn stew implied less sacrifice than selecting a member of the village to die each year. And in true burkean style, if things really got to be too horrific it would  always possible to return to the lottery next year.<br><br>2 – Those that walk away from Omelas.<br>It is also a parable about today’s society. The right to be happy, the entitlement to live a blessed life. It is the absolute right of the people in Omelas to be happy. And someone else pays the price. And I wish that Omelas was real, because reality is so much worse. In real life it isn’t a child that is trapped in a room, suffering until it dies. It’s millions of children that become blind working in sweat shops under insufficient artificial light 14 to 18 hours a day, every day, with a single meal, it is the tens of thousands that work and die in the mines of Congo to harvest the coltan to our cell phones. The child in Omelas is sister/brother to the little girls and boys in Thailand that earn a living by sexually pleasing tourists.  Need I say more ? Being a real conservative would mean to make choices (and apply them) that would reduce the number of children that suffer a living hell. And I am personally peeved by this story. There are those that walk away from Omelas… I call them cowards. They walk away to clean their conscience but do nothing to prevent or reduce the suffering of the child. Not even a kind word.  N-o-t  e-v-e-n  a  k-i-n-d w-o-r-d.<br>TO HELL WITH THEM !!!<br> <br>Sorry for this outburst. Usually I am not this passionate.<br> <br>Now ... Regarding the real life examples that you gave … The genocide of native americans, the enslavement of africans, lynching, forcible sterilization etc.<br>Those were only possible because of irreducible rights.  Let’s be honest , as George Orwell has written so eloquently, all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.<br>For some to have all the rights, others have none.  I am not saying that this is a good thing.It isn't. No amount of rhetoric will ever change that. But I beg you to consider that the process that gave rights to people that had none was a burkean process. If MLK or Ghandi had been born 60 years before and tried to do what they did, the result would have been much different. It took time, it took a lot of effort and above all it took a lot of people to fight for it, And when you combine all of those elements you have change.<br><br><br><a href=#c7857584679119285022 title="comment permalink">5/17/16, 12:49 PM</a><br><br>

Not that they are wrong nor about unimportant themes; they are important and your insights are very good. Rather I think they miss the bigger picture.<br><br>I very much agree with your analysis that the current elite are out of touch, and more than willing to throw more and more of us under the bus to support their privilege. In fact I strongly suspect that many of them would be willing to toss their own parents and children to the wolves if it saved them. The question I wonder about is whether this is all that different than other human societies in the last 10K years.<br><br>With few exceptions, most large societies in recorded history (and I suspect even earlier) had elites. And those societies had developed dogma, laws and other social structures to hold their social orders in place and continue their wealth pump from the many to the elite. Whether monarchy, castes or whatever there were always some elite with a hierarchy (big or small) directly under them who wielded more power and had more wealth than the "common folk".<br><br>What you have been showing us, in very precise detail, is what the social and political symptoms of a breakdown of that wealth pump looks like, and how the elites usually deal with it (or not). While interesting and timely, I can't help but wonder if we should not be spending time on the bigger picture and how to avoid this pattern for the future.<br><br>Perhaps there just has not been enough examples of these transitions to assess how and where previous societies went wrong when they allowed themselves to fall into the same setup yet again. Or perhaps it is just my "sense of entitlement" that makes me want to think that there is a solution to this problem. I do accept that there no more needs to be a solution to this than there NEEDS to be new energy source which will let me continue driving and jetting all over the world (not that I do). <br><br>Still I can't help but wonder if it is just the "natural order" of things that humans seem to fall into this organization every time. Or if there is some fatal flaw in how we do things which promotes this solution.<br><br><a href=#c8873287134396640673 title="comment permalink">5/17/16, 5:40 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c2985375712210003374></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/09189466855334778278 rel=nofollow>Robert Mathiesen</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Thank you, nuku, for the links to the initiatory programs in New Zealand. They seem fairly "tame" and don't take all that much time to complete, compared to what the old fraternal orders offered, to say nothing of some of the more archaic tribal initiations. But they are clearly better than nothing. Also, anything that was more intense and less overtly psychological might be more than modern adults could safely administer to adolescents in our modern Western world, and more than would be safe under modern legal prescriptions for raising children. <br><br>Let me give two examples of what I have in mind when I say this. <br><br>#1. A good friend, the wife of an academic colleague of mine, was born and raised in Sweden in an elite family that included ministers to the Crown, ambassadors, and other kinds of high-level government service. Her father was a Mason in the Swedish Rite of Freemasonry, which is a rather different thing from English and Aemrican Freemasonry, with far more esoteric teaching. In strict accord with his oaths, he never said anything to his family about what happened in lodge -- except for one night, when he came home late and shaken to his very core. By accident, my friend was up late that night also, and saw her father come home in such a state. Naturally she asked what had happened to him. His answer, as he shook and trembled, was along the lines of, "I died, and I heard the entire funeral service read over me, and I was buried, and I was completely forgotten by my brothers as the years rolled by over my grave." He never would explain further, even that night, and he regretted the next day that he had said as much as he did. -- And that was just one degree ritual, one night, out of a substantial number of degrees that he took as a Swedish Mason. <br><br>My friend's father was a man in the prime of his life, tough and strong and very well seasoned in the unpleasant real world of professional diplomacy, when this happened to him. He came through the experience (whatever it was) OK in the end. But I can easily imagine that a ritual in which one vividly experienced these particular things in one's own body might completely undo a more fragile man, and render him unable to function as an independent adult afterwards.<br><br>#2. As Malidoma Somé tells it, his tribal initiation took a number of weeks. He and the other young men were completely removed from village life for those weeks, and camped in the bush with several older men as initiators. During these weeks the young men had a number of demanding and challenging experiences. Some of thee experiences, by our scientific, materialistic standards of judgement, were physically impossible and could not have happened, except as hallucinatory experiences. But the point I want to stress here is not about those weird experiences, but that at least three of Malidoma's age-mates died while having some of these impossible experiences, and their deaths were real deaths. Despite their deaths, the initiation continued to its end without any interruption. The survivors were welcomed back as adult men. The young men who died were mourned, and then forgotten. To judge by what Malidoma said, some of the young men always, or almost always, die during their weeks in the initiation camp. <br><br>These are examples of the sort of physical or psycological risks that initiation has always entailed in other cultures and in past centuries. Our modern society would not allow any sort of initiation to be practiced that was so risky.<br><br>(to be continued)<br><br><a href=#c2985375712210003374 title="comment permalink">5/17/16, 6:03 PM</a><br><br>

I had misjudged a risk climbing a cliff by myself and without ropes. I had climbed myself into a place I could not climb out of, under an overhang. I hung there on the cliff face for a long while, waiting to fall and die on the jagged boulders below me. But as it happened, I didn't die. Hanging there, waiting to fall to my death whenever I tired and my grip loosened, all of a sudden my senses sharpened enormously and my strength became far greater than usual. It was a sudden thing, like a light-bulb switched on without warning. Then I could see and feel finger-nail cracks in the rock, and use them to drag myself upward and outward over the lip of the overhang that had me trapped, and save myself. I would never have known that a human body had such resources in extremis, had I not stupidly put myself in such a lethal situation. -- Decades later, I read how John Muir, climbing alone in the High Sierras on Mount Ritter, made a similar mistake while climbing and had exactly the same kind of experience, which saved his life, too. -- For me, it was a transformative experience.<br><br><a href=#c8678815025313956972 title="comment permalink">5/17/16, 6:03 PM</a><br><br>

I'd have commented last week but I was laid off from my job a few weeks ago and with all of the turmoil it took me until yesterday to catch up with the last three posts and all of their comments! Such good stuff. Your comments to anthropocentrism laid the groundwork nicely for the beginning of your series on Burkean conservatism! Your "not half as smart" comment reminded me of something Richard Tarnas said in a lecture I attended on C.G. Jung: "Half of what I am going to tell you today is wrong, I just don't know which half" - it stuck with me!<br><br>I also commend you on the ADR as a remarkable example of disciplined discursive, meditative, practice. You are inspiring, and it motivates me to develop consistency in my own practice. I think I was made aware of your blog when the Long Descent came out. I was hitting the permaculture textbook hard and its recommended reading at the time and I'm afraid that the same review in Permaculture Activist which someone else mentioned last week left me with the misguided notion that I could wait to read it. When I finally got to it however in 2012 with the Druidry Handbook, and then with Decline and Fall, it was a breakthrough. I started reading your blog then regularly but it was your dark age america series that got me hooked, reading all of the comments and finding the wonderful community that has gathered around your work. One of the most memorable posts in my mind was The Last Refuge of the Incompetent, where you said "The struggle to delegitimize the existing order has to be fought on cultural, intellectual, and ideological battlefields, not physical ones, and its targets are not people or institutions but the aura of legitimacy and inevitability that surrounds any established political and economic order." You are doing a fine job of that as well as of "subject[ing] the... [powers that be] to sustained and precise attack from constantly shifting positions, engaging in savage mockery one day and earnest pleas for reform the next". This latest post is just another excellent example, but it is one that I have been eagerly anticipating as how to bring a political philosophy to guide the work of challenging the anthropocentric privilege, prejudice, and acts of injustice that our culture accepts as normal.<br><br>(cont.)<br><br><br><a href=#c1738439142430204288 title="comment permalink">5/17/16, 7:27 PM</a><br><br>

He was a geologist, a surveyor, the captain of an artillery unit in WWII and gods forbid a CONSERVATIVE. Being raised in a liberal (albeit Mormon) household I never could understand why he affiliated himself with the "conservatives". My Grandmother on the other hand was always a staunch democrat, but the two of them together wrought some serious conservationist magic along the marshlands and riverways of the Utah Lake watershed, and accomplished some significant victories. I was working for him when he died at 97, helping him sort through all of his files, rock collections and WWII pictures and I asked him once why he would be in favor of G. W. Bush et al and he, typical of a man of VERY few words, simply said that he wasn't: those who were running the party were very different from the what conservatives used to stand for... I now sorely wish I could have talked to him more about his thoughts instead of having been trapped, tongue tied, in a state of typical and fashionable binary cognitive dissonance. So hat's off to you for expressing this very unfashionable and wonderfully pragmatic and logic laden approach to managing rights within a considerate and cosmopolitan society. It has helped me to see how many of old Keith O'hAodha's quirks were in fact virtues (in the Nicomachean sense).<br><br>There are so many things your work has introduced me to, from a classical approach to rhetoric and learning, to C.S. Lewis the neoplatonist (as opposed to the apologist), to Druidry, and so much more... (I have also leaned to use Grandpa Keith's slide rule!) My world is much richer and wilder, so thank you! A toast for working towards the re-enchantment of the world - may its future be blessed with a Precautionary Party (or some such grassroots political organization or other working to delegitimize the existing order and preserve something of what can still be preserved from this enchanting wer-eold).

I think what I am arguing is that if gays want to marry, which I don't necessarily think I am for or against--or it's not something I think on too much--why not say: here's a disclaimer: your marriage is not the same as a heterosexual marriage because you won't be protected from discrimination based on your decision. As for the words you want to sink in, they seem relative--especially in the world we live in now, where everything is questioned/doubted. If a gay married couple decides it's unreasonable that a christian business won't hire one or the other of them, and that they are being unduly set upon, and they choose to act out violently, let's say, and burn something down, then democracy has failed in an absolute sense. No? I think it boils down to the idea that democracy is the best we have. But, I'm skeptical. Either way, thanks for helping me to clarify my thinking on this (I am not too prone to thinking about how democracy might work). It is VERY useful, given the culture and society we live in.
