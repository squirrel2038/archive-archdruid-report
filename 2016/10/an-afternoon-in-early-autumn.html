I think it was the late science writer Stephen Jay Gould who coined the term “deep time” for the vast panorama opened up to human eyes by the last three hundred years or so of discoveries in geology and astronomy. It’s a useful label for an even more useful concept. In our lives, we deal with time in days, seasons, years, decades at most; decades, centuries and millennia provide the yardsticks by which the life cycles of human societies—that is to say, history, in the usual sense of that word—are traced. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Both these, the time frame of individual lives and the time frame of societies, are anthropocentric, as indeed they should be; lives and societies are human things and require a human measure. When that old bamboozler Protagoras insisted that “man is the measure of all things,” though, he uttered a subtle truth wrapped in a bald-faced lie.* The subtle truth is that since we are what we are—that is to say, social primates whow have learned a few interesting tricks—our capacity to understand the cosmos is strictly limited by the perceptions that human nervous systems are capable of processing and the notions that human minds are capable of thinking. The bald-faced lie is the claim that everything in the cosmos must fit inside the perceptions human beings can process and the notions they can think. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
(*No, none of this has to do with gender politics. The Greek language, unlike modern English, had a common gender-nonspecific noun for “human being,” <i>anthropos</i>, which was distinct from <i>andros</i>, “man,” and <i>gyne</i>, “woman.” The word Protagoras used was <i>anthropos</i>.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It took the birth of modern geology to tear through the veil of human time and reveal the stunningly inhuman scale of time that measures the great cycles of the planet on which we live. Last week’s post sketched out part of the process by which people in Europe and the European diaspora, once they got around to noticing that the Book of Genesis is about the Rock of Ages rather than the age of rocks, struggled to come to terms with the immensities that geological strata revealed. To my mind, that was the single most important discovery our civilization has made—a discovery with which we’re still trying to come to terms, with limited success so far, and one that I hope we can somehow manage to hand down to our descendants in the far future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The thing that makes deep time difficult for many people to cope with is that it makes self-evident nonsense out of any claim that human beings have any uniquely important place in the history of the cosmos. That wouldn’t be a difficulty at all, except that the religious beliefs most commonly held in Europe and the European diaspora make exactly that claim.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That last point deserves some expansion here, not least because a minority among the current crop of “angry atheists” have made a great deal of rhetorical hay by insisting that all religions, across the board, point for point, are identical to whichever specific religion they themselves hate the most—usually, though not always, whatever Christian denomination they rebelled against in their adolescent years. That insistence is a fertile source of nonsense, and never so much as when it turns to the religious implications of time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The conflict between science and religion over the age of the Earth is a purely Western phenomenon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Had the great geological discoveries of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries taken place in Japan, say, or India, the local religious authorities wouldn’t have turned a hair. On the one hand, most Asian religious traditions juggle million-year intervals as effortlessly as any modern cosmologist; on the other, Asian religious traditions have by and large avoided the dubious conviction, enshrined in most (though not all) versions of Christianity, that the Earth and everything upon it exists solely as a stage on which the drama of humanity’s fall and redemption plays out over a human-scaled interval of time. The expansive Hindu cosmos with its vast ever-repeating cycles of time, the Shinto concept of Great Nature as a continuum within which every category of being has its rightful place, and other non-Western worldviews offer plenty of room for modern geology to find a home. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Ironically, though, the ongoing decline of mainstream Christianity as a cultural influence in the Western world hasn’t done much to lessen the difficulty most people in the industrial world feel when faced with the abysses of deep time. The reason here is simply that the ersatz religion that’s taken the place of Christianity in the Western imagination also tries to impose a rigid ideological scheme not only on the ebb and flow of human history, but on the great cycles of the nonhuman cosmos as well. Yes, that would be <a href=../../2013/04/the-religion-of-progress.html>the religion of progress</a>—the faith-based conviction that human history is, or at least ought to be, a straight line extending onward and upward from the caves to the stars. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You might think, dear reader, that a belief system whose followers like to wallow in self-praise for their rejection of the seven-day creation scheme of the Book of Genesis and their embrace of deep time in the past would have a bit of a hard time evading its implications for the future. Let me assure you that this seems to give most of them no trouble at all. From Ray Kurzweil’s pop-culture mythology of the Singularity—a straightforward rewrite of Christian faith in the Second Coming dolled up in science-fiction drag—straight through to the earnest space-travel advocates who insist that we’ve got to be ready to abandon the solar system when the sun turns into a red giant four billion years from now, a near-total aversion to thinking about the realities deep time ahead of us is astonishingly prevalent among those who think they’ve grasped the vastness of Earth’s history. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve come to think that one of the things that feeds this curious quirk of collective thinking is a bit of trivia to be found in a great many books on geology and the like—the metaphor that turns the Earth’s entire history into a single year, starting on January 1 with the planet’s formation out of clouds of interstellar dust and ending at midnight on December 31, which is always right now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That metaphor has been rehashed more often than the average sitcom plot. A quick check of the books in the study where I’m writing this essay finds three different versions, one written in the 1960s, one in the 1980s, and one a little more than a decade ago. The dates of various events dance around the calendar a bit as new discoveries rewrite this or that detail of the planet’s history, to be sure; when I was a dinosaur-crazed seven-year-old, the Earth was only three and a half billion years old and the dinosaurs died out seventy million years ago, while the latest research I know of revises those dates to 4.6 billion years and 65 million years respectively, moving the date of the end-Cretaceous extinction from December 24 to December 26—in either case, a wretched Christmas present for small boys. Such details aside, the basic metaphor remains all but unchanged. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s only one problem with it, but it’s a whopper. Ask yourself this: what has gotten left out of that otherwise helpful metaphor? The answer, of course, is the future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s imagine, by contrast, a metaphor that maps the entire history of life on earth, from the first living thing on this planet to the last, onto a single year. We don’t know exactly when life will go extinct on this planet, but then we don’t know exactly when it emerged, either; the most recent estimate I know of puts the origin of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>terrestrial life somewhere a little more than 3.7 billion years ago, and the point at which the sun’s increasing heat will finally sterilize the planet somewhere a little more than 1.2 billion years from now. Adding in a bit of rounding error, we can set the lifespan of our planetary biosphere at a nice round five billion years. On that scale, a month of thirty days is 411 million years, a single day is 13.7 million years, an hour is around 571,000 years, a minute is around 9514 years, and a second is 158 years and change. Our genus, <i>Homo</i>,* evolved maybe two hours ago, and all of recorded human history so far has taken up a little less than 32 seconds. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
(*Another gender-nonspecific word for “human being,” this one comes from Latin, and is equally distinct from <i>vir</i>, “man,” and <i>femina</i>, “woman.” English really does need to get its act together.)</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That all corresponds closely to the standard metaphor. The difference comes in when you glance at the calendar and find out that the present moment in time falls not on December 31 or any other similarly momentous date, but on an ordinary, undistinguished day—by my back-of-the-envelope calculation, it would be September 26. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I like to imagine our time, along these lines, as an instant during an early autumn afternoon in the great year of Earth’s biosphere. Like many another late September day, it’s becoming uncomfortably hot, and billowing dark clouds stand on the horizon, heralds of an oncoming storm. We human mayflies, with a lifespan averaging maybe half a second, dart here and there, busy with our momentary occupations; a few of us now and then lift our gaze from our own affairs and try to imagine the cold bare fields of early spring, the sultry air of summer evenings, or the rigors of a late autumn none of us will ever see. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With that in mind, let’s put some other dates onto the calendar. While life began on January 1, multicellular life didn’t get started until sometime in the middle of August—for almost two-thirds of the history of life, Earth was a planet of bacteria and blue-green algae, and in terms of total biomass, it arguably still is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first primitive plants and invertebrate animals ventured onto the land around August 25; the terrible end-Permian extinction crisis, the worst the planet has yet experienced, hit on September 8; the dinosaurs perished in the small hours of September 22, and the last ice age ended just over a minute ago, having taken place over some twelve and a half minutes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now let’s turn and look in the other direction. The last ice age was part of a glacial era that began a little less than two hours ago and can be expected to continue through the morning of the 27th—on our time scale, they happen every two and a half weeks or so, and the intervals between them are warm periods when the Earth is a jungle planet and glaciers don’t exist. Our current idiotic habit of treating the atmosphere as a gaseous sewer will disrupt that cycle for only a very short time; our ability to dump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere will end in less than a second as readily accessible fossil fuel reserves are exhausted, and it will take rather less than a minute thereafter for natural processes to scrub the excess CO2 from the atmosphere and return the planet’s climate to its normal instability. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Certain other consequences of our brief moment of absurd extravagance will last longer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On our timescale, the process of radioactive decay will take around half an hour (that is to say, a quarter million years or so) to reduce high-level nuclear waste all the way to harmlessness. It will take an interval of something like the same order of magnitude before all the dead satellites in high orbits have succumbed to the complex processes that will send them to a fiery fate in Earth’s atmosphere, and quite possibly longer for the constant rain of small meteorites onto the lunar surface to pound the Apollo landers and other space junk there to unrecognizable fragments. Given a few hours of the biosphere’s great year, though, everything we are and everything we’ve done will be long gone. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Beyond that, the great timekeeper of Earth’s biosphere is the Sun. Stars increase in their output of heat over most of their life cycle, and the Sun is no exception. The single-celled chemosynthetic organisms that crept out of undersea hot springs in February or March of the great year encountered a frozen world, lit by a pale white Sun whose rays gave far less heat than today; the oldest currently known ice age, the Cryogenian glaciation of the late Precambrian period, was apparently cold enough to freeze the oceans solid and wrap most of the planet in ice. By contrast, toward the middle of November in the distant Neozoic Era, the Sun will be warmer and yellower than it is today, and glacial eras will likely involve little more than the appearance of snow on a few high mountains normally covered in jungle. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus the Earth will gradually warm through October and November.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Temperatures will cycle up and down with the normal cycles of planetary climate, but each warm period will tend to be a little warmer than the last, and each cold period a little less frigid. Come December, most of a billion years from now, as the heat climbs past one threshold after another, more and more of the Earth’s water will evaporate and, as dissociated oxygen and hydrogen atoms, boil off into space; the Earth will become a desert world, with life clinging to existence at the poles and in fissures deep underground, until finally the last salt-crusted seas run dry and the last living things die out. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And humanity? The average large vertebrate genus lasts something like ten million years—in our scale, something over seventeen hours. As already noted, our genus has only been around for about two hours so far, so it’s statistically likely that we still have a good long run ahead of us. I’ve discussed in these essays several times already the hard physical facts that argue that we aren’t going to go to the stars, or even settle other planets in this solar system, but that’s nothing we have to worry about. Even if we have an improbably long period of human existence ahead of us—say, the fifty million years that bats of the modern type have been around, some three and a half days in our scale, or ten thousand times the length of all recorded human history to date—the Earth will be burgeoning with living things, and perfectly capable of supporting not only intelligent life but rich, complex, unimaginably diverse civilizations, long after we’ve all settled down to our new careers as fossils.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This does not mean, of course, that the Earth will be capable of supporting the kind of civilization we have today. It’s arguably not capable of supporting that kind of civilization now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Certainly the direct and indirect consequences of trying to maintain the civilization we’ve got, even for the short time we’ve made that attempt so far, are setting off chains of consequences that don’t seem likely to leave much of it standing for long. That doesn’t mean we’re headed back to the caves, or for that matter, back to the Middle Ages—these being the two bogeymen that believers in progress like to use when they’re trying to insist that we have no alternative but to keep on stumbling blindly ahead on our current trajectory, no matter what. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What it means, instead, is that we’re headed toward something that’s different—genuinely, thoroughly, drastically different. It won’t just be different from what we have now; it’ll also be different from the rigidly straight-line extrapolations and <i>deus ex machina</i> fauxpocalypses that people in industrial society like to use to keep from thinking about the future we’re making for ourselves. Off beyond the dreary <i>Star Trek</i>
fantasy of metastasizing across the galaxy, and the equally hackneyed <i>Mad Max</i> fantasy of pseudomedieval savagery, lies the astonishing diversity of the future before us: a future potentially many orders of magnitude longer than all of recorded history to date, in which human beings will live their lives and understand the world in ways we can’t even imagine today.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s tolerably common, when points like the one I’ve tried to make here get raised at all, for people to insist that paying attention to the ultimate fate of the Earth and of our species is a recipe for suicidal depression or the like. With all due respect, that claim seems silly to me. Each one of us, as we get out of bed in the morning, realizes at some level that the day just beginning will bring us one step closer to old age and death, and yet most of us deal with that reality without too much angst. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
In the same way, I’d like to suggest that it’s past time for the inmates of modern industrial civilization to grow up, sprout some gonads—either kind, take your pick—and deal with the simple, necessary, and healthy realization that our species is not going to be around forever. Just as maturity in the individual arrives when it sinks in that human life is finite, collective maturity may just wait for a similar realization concerning the life of the species. That kind of maturity would be a valuable asset just now, not least because it might help us grasp some of the extraordinary possibilities that will open up as industrial civilization finishes its one-way trip down the chute marked “decline and fall” and the deindustrial future ahead of us begins to take shape. </div>

I suppose one reason we're so bad at this is partly the convention that most of our future-thinking (and much of our thinking) is done through story-telling. And stories about unfathomable aliens or weird post-humans just don't make for riveting story telling (unless you have your human narrator toddling about being buffeted by it all). So our imagining is narrowed to the point of absurdity when we think about these things. (Stapleton's future men or Wells' sojourn with the End-crabs are the kinds of exceptions that prove the point, I think.)<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c8339213594929227450 title="comment permalink">10/12/16, 3:13 PM</a><br><br>

It's a shame that we find it so hard and uncomfortable to consider deep time past and present; the vastness is beautiful, and the perspective is salutary. <br><br>The beauty and perspective of deep time doesn't contradict genuine Christian faith, I find. Yes, God likes us, but there's no saying he doesn't like other parts of creation, too. One naturalist opined that he must be very fond of beetles, and who wouldn't be? God keeps his own counsels. He has revealed tiny bits of his relationship with us, but there's no saying that he doesn't have relationships with others. Why would he show us the otter or the clam bible? It's not our story, as Aslan would say. I disagree with people who think that God's favor to us involves our being able to do whatever we want with the otter's and the clam's bit of creation. That's a bit childish. <br><br>Anyway, I agree absolutely with your points here, but I just want to note that the loud voices shouldn't be allowed to define Christianity for the rest of us. The dithyramb toward the end of Lewis' Perelandra is a much better thing to meditate on than past and present broadsides on man's sovereignty. (And this time I mostly mean man, given the religious and social beliefs of those who espouse that concept.)<br><br>Let me add a shout-out to Frank Landis' book, Hot Earth Dreams, which I think I first heard of on this site.

I agree with most of what you say but I think you are an optimist. <br>We can agree that the environment will be very different after the extinction pulse burning through the biosphere now. Combine that with the poverty of remaining ecosystems and we can assume a high rate of speciation. Normally, brainy animals have an advantage in changing environments, but brain uses a lot of energy. Some scientist consider our big brain the result of runaway sexual selection, like the peacock's tail.<br>According to the biologist Ernst Mayr, in a famous debate with Carl Sagan: "Intelligence is a lethal mutation" (http://todayeco.com/pages/630328-human-intelligence-environment).<br>Either way, it seems that our species will be changed fast in geological terms and the daughter species will not have much use for big brains.

So I feel it must be noted here that Barack Obama, who I don't think is necessarily a bad person, <a href=https://www.wired.com/2016/10/president-obama-guest-edits-wired-essay/ rel=nofollow>offered us this dream of progress</a> in <i>Wired</i> magazine today:<br><br>"I imagine the girls who discover a new fuel based on only sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide; the teenager who makes voting and civic activism as addictive as scrolling through your Twitter feed; the boy from Idaho who grows potatoes from a plot of soil brought back from our colony on Mars. And I imagine some future president strolling out on the South Lawn with a student who invented a new kind of telescope. As the president looks through the lens, the girl turns the telescope to a planet she just discovered, orbiting a faraway star at the very edge of our galaxy. Then she says she’s hard at work on another invention—one that will take us there someday."<br><br>Everyone, take note of this. The <i>best</i> Obama can do is a very weak version of the dreams of cheap energy, terraforming, and space travel that the 1960s were chock full of. (This is still supposed to be "20 or 50 years" away-- can we wait that long?) There is a reason people have moved on from the dreams of the 1960s, to more 2016-appropriate dreams like the grand conspiracy against Zero Point Energy, the flat earth, or the secret alien-Illuminati war. These are early examples of the kinds of "fauxpocalypse" that will do a good job distracting us for the next few decades.<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c5037243137851638523 title="comment permalink">10/12/16, 5:20 PM</a><br><br>

If life and the universe is eternal as taught by Buddhism, then like you mentioned early in your essay referencing Asian religions, deep time is not only to be taken in stride, but also used as an inspiration. In the Lotus Sutra, Shakyamuni Buddha explains, when asked how many lifetimes ago it was when it was he first attained enlightenment, that it was countless lifetimes extending eons into the past expressed as the number of dust particles one would produce if you crushed countless galaxies into dust [and this 2000 years before Copernicus]. When asked where it was, he said that it was on a mundane world much like earth. When asked how, he said through a Buddha greater than he (meaning the eternally existent potential to express enlightenment inherent in all sentient beings). When I read your essay imagining the brief blooming and decay of human life on earth instead of depression I find a kind of beautiful joy imagining this cycle repeated endlessly throughout the eternal universe. To live with compassion and contribution in this mundane world is to live a valuable existence within that beautiful process. How wonderful it is to be alive on this earth! How wonderful still to be able to continue to build the good fortune necessary to repeat the process on other such wonderful worlds in the future! To deal with the problems facing our species we will indeed need to develop a deep appreciate for our good fortune to be human and build a new civilization based upon that appreciation.<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c4279747067891542477 title="comment permalink">10/12/16, 6:29 PM</a><br><br>

Plenty of readers find stories about really different future societies utterly entrancing -- consider Cordwainer Smith's "Instrumentality of Mankind" stories, or on a different but equally lovely plane, John Crowley's <i>Engine Summer</i>. The difficulty is simply that over the last thirty years or so, science fiction -- our main source of future narratives just now -- has been stuck in a dreary rut, rehashing a potted future in which all the societies are just like ours, but with starships. With any luck, though, that will change.<br><br>Sven, delighted to hear it! <br><br>Damaris, that's why I noted in my post that the reduction of time to a human scale wasn't found in all versions of Christianity. Yes, I was thinking of Lewis's Deep Heaven trilogy among other things when I wrote that! I hope that more Christians realize that the heavens do an even better job of declaring the glory of God when it's realized just how vast and ancient they actually are...<br><br>Thomas, not at all -- it's an image of the future about two days in the future, and very nicely handled. Thanks for the link! <br><br>RogerCO, I certainly recommend it to all and sundry! You're right, of course, that a certain <i>adaequatio</i> is needed to make sense of deep time, but it's worth cultivating. <br><br>Repent, nah, I said it was entering a death spiral, not a death grip! What's good in it will be passed on to a future movement, the way that New Thought handed down its better achievements to the New Age -- and the way that our civilization might just manage to hand some useful things down to the civilizations that follow. <br><br>Patricia, it's really a pity that wer, cognate to Latin vir, dropped out of use. It would have cleared up a lot of nonsense. <br><br>NomadicBeer, of course I disagree. It's precisely because of our problem-solving abilities that human beings have been able to spread through so many diverse ecosystems and become the apex predator in most of them. We're a superbly adapted generalist species, right up there with the rat and the cockroach, and just about as difficult to exterminate; I expect we'll be around for a good long time to come. <br><br>David, exactly. <br><br>Wendy, you're welcome! I also find this sort of thing comforting in difficult times; it helps to know that in the grand scheme of things, the turmoil of today really doesn't matter that much. <br><br>Tidlösa, autumn is my favorite season, and long autumn afternoons have a special place in my memories, thus the choice of timing...<br><br>Drhooves, megafauna like us always run a risk of sudden extinction. Still, as I noted to NomadicBeer above, we're a tough, adaptable species, and even a 95% dieoff would leave a lot of breeding populations in place. <br><br>Justin, Evola's a very mixed bag, but if he's got you thinking about alternate ways of conceiving of time, I'm glad to hear it.<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c4618355520158126037 title="comment permalink">10/12/16, 7:55 PM</a><br><br>

You make a big assumption when you treat human as like any other species of vertebrate in the history of life. There is something different about creatures that figure out their place in cosmic history. It hasn't happened before as far as we know. We don't know what happens to that kind of creature. Maybe they self-destruct. There is lots of evidence to suggest that is likely in our case. But if they do not self-destruct or forget the main features of what they have learned, then their future is likely very different than other creatures. I know your objection...'why should it be different this time?'. But sometimes it actually is different. When the first reproducing organisms appeared on earth, they represented something different that has totally changed the planet. I personally suspect that intelligence is another such change. Maybe it will die out. But if it doesn't, I think it makes a permanent change as dramatic as life made when it appeared on earth.<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c2647821204849409491 title="comment permalink">10/12/16, 8:06 PM</a><br><br>

You say we probably won't go to the stars, a notion I'm inclined to entertain. <br><br>But - I think there might be one way in which we could have the Star Trek style future - Hundreds of years ago it hundreds of years to build a cathedral like Notre-Dame. In other words it took many human lifetimes. If that sort of thinking could be bought back it might make the sliver of hope of going to the stars meaningful/possible all be it remotely. Weather or not a human culture could survive long enough in the de-industrial age to build a statistically meaningful number of such craft outlined bellow is another question. Sending up one module every 10 or 20 years it'd take maybe 200 years to build the ship. <br><br>Even if our technology is limited to what we have available now, or to be more realistic for the long term future say no more advanced than say the 1950s, if we took hundreds of years to build a really good/sturdy/self-suciffent/well-stocked mutligenerational spaceships in Earth orbit we could send them out on journeys that would take thousands of years. Nuclear Fission is a suitable energy source for getting a spacecraft to say 1/100 the speed of light. That snails pace would be enough. You wouldn't need a big crew on each ship because enough genetic diversity to start a community can fit in the palm of a hand, in the form of gametes.

It's tempting to think it will all only get worse and worse and worse, but you've helped me to realize that it's likely to look again as it once did (with a few variations). More people will find it less practical to live there -- still-abundant fossil fuels are the only reason it's feasible to live there now, with high heating costs and cars the only transportation mode -- and, after a few seconds of deep time, the natural world will, or at least quite possibly could, regain its footing.

No doubt something elegant and immediately impactful could be done by somebody with more talent than I.<br><br>What compels me to comment today is the season. I live in New Zealand, where we've been to coming out of a mild winter into a topsy-turvy spring. Bright days, rain, and unusually late snow falls. The increasing temperatures, a certain flowering of previously dormant things, the coming of the butterflies, and the changeable weather of September seem to me to be apt metaphors for the situation we find ourselves in (despite being the opposite of yours).<br><br>The contrasting seasons have always been curious to me. Colonialism brought with it the Northern Calendar, amongst other things, and it's always struck me as odd how we celebrate rebirth at midsummer, halloween in Spring, fertility in Autumn and so on. Further, astrology has always felt a bit wonky too. I can understand people born at different times being profoundly affected by their early environment in the world and womb, but I don't see how these effects would be at all similar to those born on the opposite side of the world. I suspect there's a lot of work that Paheka (settlers) need to do over the coming years and generations to come to terms with the profoundly different land they now find themselves in. That's a small part of the reason I feel truly respecting and uplifting the indigenous Maori is so important - their sense of connection to place and its natural rhythms is far in advance of our own, despite our sneers at the local legends. As somebody with ancestors from both sides, it's been an interesting journey.<br><br>Ngā mihi nui.<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c7939101698371199865 title="comment permalink">10/12/16, 9:40 PM</a><br><br>

This conflict would actually not have arisen within the pre-modern, Aristotelian-Thomist framework, since the reductive fundamentalist perspective on the Bible was not in place, and there would have been no need to problematize the notion of deep time (which indeed is not as much of a modern novelty of the West as one might think, something which is obvious if one considers e.g. the scholastics' musings on eternity, the writings of the Desert Fathers, or the Book of Ecclesiastes in the Hebrew Bible which basically hammers the point of mankind's finitude and smallness, and the futility of our deeds and actions in the world). In brief, the conflict is not only a Western phenomenon, but a strictly modern one.<br><br>Thus, it is my contention that the inability to grasp eternity, death, and our own almost infinite smallness in the grand scheme of things, was in all likelihood not endemic to pre-modern Western culture, where death was all but sanitized and uncommon, and the Divine eternities a recurring theme of religious narratives, Christian as well as pre-Christian.<br><br>Also, with Damaris, I'd emphasize that the perspective of Deep Time, far from contradicting genuine Christian faith (not that you're at all claiming this) is actually an important aspect thereof, and that the self-aggrandizing perspective of modernity and ascription of immeasurable importance to ourselves and our society is indeed inimical to the core beliefs of Christianity. To be sure, mankind is indeed important in the eyes of God, but we cannot begin to imagine the meaning of this in our fallen state, other than through the revealed hints of our roles as stewards of creation and our calling to sacrifice and self-giving love. Indeed, our cities, armies, economies and civilizations are a mockery and a perversion of our stewardship - a common contention throughout the Bible as well as Church history.<br><br>On a related note, I'm apt to consider H.P. Lovecraft's particular theme of horror which you've previously discussed at length, as precisely the result of this internal, conceptual conflict between modernity's special form of hubristic exceptionalism and self-aggrandization, and a basic ontology that disavows transcendence and posits actual infinities of time and space. I think you've previously identified something similar.<br><br>The fundamental, nauseating clash between such an identity and such a worldview, seems to be at heart of many, if not most, of the cultural, ideological and political issues and neuroses of the contemporary late-modern era.<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c1701395933137732719 title="comment permalink">10/13/16, 2:52 AM</a><br><br>

Kurzweil is a clever man, and the things he writes are -technically- feasible to the best of contemporary scientific knowledge. They will just never happen.

What a grisly fate. Of course they feel their humanity is lacking, that they need to transcend their current biological limitations, when they feel obliged to take control of every aspect of existence on earth (and beyond) for the rest of eternity.<br><br>It sounds like a psychological disorder, worrying about things you cannot control, and forsaking the things you could affect positively in the process. I wonder if they find time to live their lives at all.<br><br>I'd like to see the world two hundred years from now, if only to see the little oak saplings I sprouted and planted all grown up.

I got up a few times last night to check on the weather, mainly to see if the wind had started to blow. The first time was around midnight. As I peered around at the trees an owl ghosted on by, heading through our clearing to the river. I could not see the species, but by its size it was probably a Great Horned. Anyway, a few hours later I repeated the effort and as I stepped out on the porch the owl flew back the other way. I asked myself if seeing the owl two times out of two was a good omen or a bad one, (if I believed in such things). I concluded the experience was pure magic and that I was lucky, very lucky to have seen it. That is how I am trying to view life these days. I don't want to miss anything. What I do see and experience, I am trying to take the time for gratitude and respect. I am also enjoying music from my past.

Your prose is second to none, and ability to think in entirely new ways is unparalleled. <br><br>I have often pondered on both the past and the future of our planet. In my younger days, I was an avid junior astronomer and follower of Carl Sagan. Some evidence in our solar system got me thinking about a new theory regarding the planets. Astronomers have often described Mars as being like a very old Earth and Venus being like a very young Earth. What would explain that phenomenon?<br><br>As the sun continues to convert mass to energy and spew particles out into space (the solar wind), it loses mass. As it loses mass, its gravitation decreases. Therefore, Kepler's theory that planets move in ellipses may be flawed. Perhaps planets move in elliptical spirals, gradually moving farther away from the sun. That would explain why Mars used to be more like Earth is now. Perhaps a billion years ago, it was much closer to the sun.<br><br>I realize that theory has nothing to do with the points made in your essay, but your trip through the geo-year reminded me of my old theory.

First, you were born. This in itself is a remarkable achievement. Did you know that each time your father ejaculated (and frankly he did it quite a lot) he produce roughly twenty-five million spermatozoa – enough to repopulate Britain every two days or so? For you to have been born, not only did you have to be among the few batches of sperm that had even a theoretical chance of prospering – in itself quite a long shot – but you then had to win a race against 24,999,999 or so other wriggling contenders, all rushing to swim the English Channel of your mother’s vagina in order to be the first ashore at the fertile egg of Boulogne, as it were. Being born was easily the most remarkable achievement of your whole life. And think: you could just as easily have been a flatworm. . Second, you are alive. For the tiniest moment in the span of eternity you have the miraculous privilege to exist. For endless eons you were not. Soon you will cease to be once more. That you are able to sit here right now in this one never-to-be-repeated moment, reading this book, eating bon-bons, dreaming about hot sex with that scrumptious person from accounts, speculatively sniffing your armpits, doing whatever you are doing – just existing – is really wondrous beyond belief. . Third, you have plenty to eat, you live in a time of peace and “Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree” will never be number one again. If you bear these things in mind, you will never be truly unhappy again – though in fairness I must point out that if you find yourself alone in Weston-super-Mare on a rainy Tuesday evening you may come close."<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c1805256314998282650 title="comment permalink">10/13/16, 6:11 AM</a><br><br>

Sure, in theory, it would be possible to build generation ships to head for other solar systems -- but who's going to cover the astounding expense? The American people baulked at continuing to pay the vastly smaller cost of the Apollo program, which is why we have such a shoestring space program these days; how are you going to convince the people of the world that the notion of interstellar travel is so important that resources desperately needed for other purposes ought to be devoted to no better purpose than making the fantasies of science fiction fans come true? <br><br>Harverster, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Joe, and if those animals do go extinct, give it a couple of million years and other animals will evolve to fill the vacant niches. Our current bears evolved from ancestral ursids about five million years ago, and if you go back a couple of days in the Great Year, you've got more or less canid critters about the size and shape of a sheepdog; since canids are unlikely to do extinct any time soon -- the coyote, coywolf, and coydog are doing very well indeed -- even if the bears don't make it through the current extinction crisis, something bearlike will evolve to fill the niche in due time. That's the great thing about evolution! <br><br>Yucca, you're most welcome. <br><br>Unknown, it's a matter of probabilities. If the cosmos is only six thousand years old, it's entirely plausible that our species really is as important as we like to think. If life on Earth has a five billion year span, on the other hand, what's the probability that one species of social primate temporarily (and unsteadily) perched on top of the food chain is the be-all and end-all of existence? What about the intelligent beings that may arise in the distant future, or those that may have lived in the distant past? Our ignorance about those possibilities makes an argument for our species' supposed importance excruciatingly hard to defend. <br><br>Adam, no argument there. I note that China, India, and the native civilizations of central America each evolved their own astrologies, all of which are significantly different from the western Eurasian model. <br><br>James, I rather like "Deep Time Day" -- though it might end up moving a day or so in either direction as estimates of the beginning and end of life on earth change. <br><br>Peter, I'd be inclined to agree -- and it interests me that some people have Lovecraft's reaction to it, and others have Robinson Jeffers' reaction, a sense of homecoming and laying down the burden of our supposed uniqueness. <br><br>Lordyburd, that's my take -- the Faustian ethos, to use Spengler's term, isn't just about infinities, it's about the individual human being soaring up and out to embrace and conquer those infinities. Most other societies aren't anything like so intoxicated by their own hubris. <br><br>Tortoise, if deep time is in the being of God, does that also allow it to exist in the created cosmos?<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c1700942802575834906 title="comment permalink">10/13/16, 7:31 AM</a><br><br>

As for the conflict between science and Christianity, that's entirely the product of the mistaken notion, on the part of some Christians, that the Bible is a geology textbook. As far as I know, nowhere in the Bible does it say that everything in the Bible must be taken as a statement of fact in the most pigheadedly literal sense...<br><br>Seb, I'd love to see those numbers! <br><br>Spanish Fly, that does sound Stoic! As long as you remember that you, too, are an animal, it's a good thing to keep in mind. <br><br>Phil, I'm enjoying the ambiguity in that last sentence of yours. Do you mean that everything in recent posts here brings up an example of Taleb's IYI thinking? Or do you mean that the author of these posts is an IYI? Inquiring minds want to know... ;-)<br><br>John, that seems plausible enough; I recall the medieval archbishop of Paris who, in criticizing Aristotle, proclaimed as Christian doctrine the idea that God could have made as many inhabitable worlds in the cosmos as He wanted to. Everything I've read about Christian eschatology before modern times, though, seems to presuppose a timeline for the cosmos measured in thousands of years -- six thousand from Creation to the Second Coming, followed by the Millennium, was iirc the usual medieval figure -- so I suspect that what you've described as a modern perversion has older roots. That said, as suggested in my response to Damaris, there's nothing in the core beliefs of Christianity that necessarily conflicts with the perspectives of deep time -- quite the contrary -- and, as I noted in <a href=../../2013/07/the-quest-for-common-language.html rel=nofollow>a post back in 2013</a>, the current crusade against evolution on the part of some Christians requires them to ignore some of the basic presuppositions of their own faith. I hope that many centuries from now, Christians will look back on the whole creationist business the way most Christians today look back on the flagellants of the Middle Ages: one of those odd things that apparently made sense in the context of the time. <br><br>Brigyn, good! I remain skeptical that Kurzweil's computer-Jesus is technically feasible at all, and even more so of the notion that human personalities can somehow be uploaded to robot bodies -- but you're right, of course, that those were never meant to be realistic predictions. They're myths, which -- as Sallust points out -- always are, but never actually happened. <br><br>SMJ, dark ages vary in intensity, and some Asian cultures -- China in particular -- have been through several of them; but on the whole, yes, the dark ages in the western end of Eurasia have tended to be more severe. <br><br>Brigyn, thanks for the data points! <br><br>Cortes, nope.

Adaptability is certainly a good heuristic but human adaptability, unlike cockroaches, is dependent on our continued ability to innovate technologically and that depends in turn on a great many things that may well fail in a mass extinction.<br><br>Second, for the longer term, the effect of the warming sun on earth biosystems is much less linear than you seem to presume.<br><br>James Lovelock theorizes in 'Ages of Gaia' (and other books) that the living systems of the Earth together work to moderate the temperature and other conditions to keep them favorable for themselves. He doesn't ascribe conscious intention to these systems but shows in simulations that it is nevertheless possible and claims that this 'Gaia' theory fits the observed data.<br><br>He also discusses the sun's gradual warming over its lifetime and says that living systems have sequestered more and more carbon from the atmosphere to keep the temperature livable. But there is a limit to that method since plants need CO2, etc. Eventually he says a tipping point will be reached, the systems will fail, CO2 released, and Earth will enter a runaway greenhouse condition, similar to what we observe on Venus. Lovelock also says that Earth's 'recent' cycle of ice ages may be a symptom that CO2 removal is reaching its limits.<br><br>Lovelock, like you, guesses that time is far in the future. But what if it is closer than he expects? Perhaps human activity freeing up CO2 is about to push it over that tipping point far sooner than would naturally occur. Wouldn't a mass extinction lead up to that tipping point?<br><br>Maybe we are mayflies and we don't matter in the long run. Maybe the planet has no awareness. Or maybe we are an essential part the planet's consciousness. What if our collective intelligence is (was?) in some sense a last ditch effort by Earth to stave off a runaway greenhouse effect like the one may have that killed her sister planet?<br><br>You can say that all this is speculative, guesswork, and of course it is since we can't observe other planets and intelligent species in similar circumstances. We can only test it as Lovelock did with thought experiments and simulations, but at least that is some basis. <br><br>To be clear, I'm not saying that humans will probably go extinct soon or that the Earth warming tipping point is at hand -- nobody really knows. But assuming that those events are distant is unwarranted and possibly perilous for our and our planet's future. If you have a better basis for your optimism than what I see as 'hand waving', I'd love to hear it. We all could use some of that kind of optimism.<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c7776043325321709447 title="comment permalink">10/13/16, 8:47 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you. When I was a teenager fresh out of creationism trying to reconcile my new-found worldview with my deeply held reliefs, the thing that helped me conceptualize deep time and transform my emotions surrounding it from unease and helplessness to enthusiastic excitement was a documentary that began with the premise that humans had gone extinct at some point in the interval between the present day and ten million years from now and left no traces behind… covering the types of ecosystems that could possibly emerge over the next 200 million years. It was a rare gem and something that completely changed the way I thought about the distant future. It’s something you might enjoy looking at if you haven’t encountered it (there’s a book so you wouldn’t have to watch anything): http://www.thefutureiswild.com/future-worlds/ . (unfortunately, it seems that more recently the media made them plaster over the usual hackneyed sci-fi stuff and kind of ruined it (it’s now exodus rather than extinction and there’s some stupid looking cartoon… but if you ignore that the original concept is still there. )<br><br>----------<br><br>One thing I’ve been thinking about in relation to both this week’s essay and last week’s is the relation the world around us has to shaping mythologies… Among the fringe conspiracy theory community (of the fringe that includes flat-earthers), there’s apparently a new narrative emerging of an earth that was once vibrant and alive before humans came along… according to them, the massive trees that once covered the ancient world were all torn down by the machines of a long forgotten civilization, mountains being their charred and fossilized stumps. Valleys are wounds in the earth torn open in search of resources, and the trees we know today are really only shrubs. The narrative was interesting to me because it suggested the beginnings of the sort of narrative I could see shaping into something much more mainstream in coming generations… It’s as though they’re superimposing the memory the middle future will have of the present onto the ancient past… with ancient landforms becoming mythologized as remnants of the events described in painful memories by future poets (in much the same way landforms in Ireland are attributed to the doings of Patrick, that were before that attributed to the doings of Cuchulainn, before that Lugh, and on back). A mythic landscape of decline. The physical remnants of our civilization will be reduced to a few scattered ruins that fade into the backdrop… and the ecological devastation we’re wreaking will bounce back, but the poorer world our descendents will inhabit for at least another minute or two is one that people living today are already beginning to turn into a mythic landscape. It can be enticing to think about how long such stories could stay within human consciousness and transferred onto a mythic landscape by some future civilization. Since I read this article, it’s been something that’s been bouncing around in my head as a possible story idea https://www.inverse.com/article/21098-flat-earthers-trees .<br><br>----------<br><br>In other news more relevant to the present political moment than to any notion of deep time, I’m wondering if you’ve heard about a recent federal law that got passed that effective Monday will take the entire lower end of the salary class (everyone with an income under a little less than 50,000 a year), and make them all hourly wage earners. It’s supposed to be to protect overtime (but most wage earners know that you get in big trouble with your boss if you actually try to log overtime), and in reality basically just gets rid of paid vacations for low income salaried workers… so now the salary class is exclusively people making over 50,000 a year. Things are about to get –really- interesting as far as class tensions go.<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c7023175911051732746 title="comment permalink">10/13/16, 9:14 AM</a><br><br>

It never quite made sense to me. Isn't it just as reasonable to claim that "I" would still exist with some different characteristics? (Perhaps that "I" would find coffee palatable, as most people seem to do.)<br><br>That question leads in some difficult directions, as suggested by the scare-quotes around the words that might purport to distinguish between what we regard as ourselves and what as others. Especially because as a philosophical materialist I'm not positing a pre-existing unique soul-self poised to glom onto whatever zygote happened to form either. So if a different sperm might still result in a superficially altered "me," why not a different sperm and a different egg in different parents at a different time? I've tentatively concluded that what I think of as my own individual identity arose mostly from the world, this very physical September 26th world, based on my physical self's trajectory through it. We seem to think we're framed self-portraits in oil on canvas (every one an irreplaceable masterpiece), but we're really more like mirrors.<br><br>Your point that there are plenty of reasons to be happy and appreciate the gift of life still stands, of course.

Humans could work though using it means pluralizing which makes it sound more like a group activity than a singular instance of a general archetype. “Humans are the measure of all things” is changed in that regard. However using human singularly results in “Human is the measure of all things” which sounds weird. After common and repeated use, it’ll be fine, but it’ll be hard to get to that point.<br><br>As for Deep Time, my first brush with it (other than existing) was when I found out the age of the granite boulders I used to play around growing up in Georgia. The granite there is about 300-350 million years old which means they are a little over 3 weeks old on the Grand Year. However I realized since they’re exposed to the elements, they were going to erode quite quickly, an “hour or two” at most.

Technically human kind has nearly perfected the actual accepted sound of music to the 99 percentile. We can auto tune and edit and adjust a note to perfection with our machinery. We can record and manipulate across a huge spectrums of simulated effects. As you say, "collapse now and avoid the rush" an interesting phenomena is that people are reverting to building primitive instruments and playing them for the here and now experience. Primitive roots music sessions with crude 3 string and 1 string guitars made out of cigar box bodies and broom handle necks. Rhythm section from whatever. The un-amplified human voice.

Loved every word of it.<br><br>I have been reflecting more recently on "deep history" and how in the long-run a lot of the things folks are getting worked up about mean nothing.<br><br>Regarding the US elections, a few random dots have been popping up in my brain, and I would like to hear your feedback.<br><br>In 2007, you wrote a superb post on the dawn of Scarcity Industrialism, and whether the United States would successfully transition to this new era without imploding (http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2007/10/age-of-scarcity-industrialism.html?m=1)<br><br>Re-reading the blog now, it is quite frightening to see how angry and unprepared America is in facing the huge challenges coming its way. Significant sections of each side of red and blue America consider the other candidate to be unacceptable. I will be shortly be posting a scenario on my blog, called "The Rise of Caesar", in which I outline a scenario where Trump, after narrowly losing the GE, accuses the establishment of rigging the result and refuses to accept his defeat. Trump goes on to call on his supporters to go on the streets, armed, to protest against the result.<br><br>Events start to spiral out of control. Inner city tensions explode, police (who will overwhelmingly vote for Trump) are sympathetic to the pro-Trump protests and refuse to crack down. Trump escalates by ordering his armed supporters to march on Washington to prevent Hilary Clinton being inaugurated. Police, army and Homeland Security personnel (again, pro Trump) refuse to stop the protesters entering Washington, and in some cases join the protests, and chaos erupts. After protracted negotiations with the US general staff,the establishment blink - they do a face-saving deal with the self-styled President-Elect Trump, effectively handing him power as the Caesar to avoid civil war.<br><br>I think this is a remote prospect but the idea of the story will be to explore how close America is to such a thing happening. Ian Welsh has made a similar point in his blog (http://www.ianwelsh.net/why-poor-white-males-are-the-core-of-trumps-support/)<br><br>Your thoughts?<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c4841143771604860900 title="comment permalink">10/13/16, 1:33 PM</a><br><br>

Offhand, my non person of color observation is that black folk are too busy fighting for a bigger share of the pie, having been disenfranchised for so long, that they're failing to realize the pie is shrinking, or that the pie is rotten to begin with. Of course, not attracting a black readership should not mean JMG alters his message to attract black readers, but I'm curious to speculate nonetheless.<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c6174602603838422831 title="comment permalink">10/13/16, 1:43 PM</a><br><br>

Deep space too...our current astronomical science suggests that there are at least 100 billion galaxies each containing at least 100 billion stars! These revelations help me to accept and know that I am an inseparable part of All That Is (literally Om Tat Sat).<br><br>I especially liked David, by the lake's comment "There is so much more to existence than humanity, and so much more to humanity than our present narrative." and that our brief time here is best spent doing the best we can within our spheres of influence. Simple as that...very Stoic.<br><br>It seems our species must have stories; so deep our need to understand, to belong, to know meaning. I recently read the novel The Human Stain by Philip Roth and marveled at his phrase "the pointless meaningfulness of living"...I find it koan-like and quite deep in it's implications.<br><br>Finally, as we all contemplate deep time let's not forget the late, great Yogi Berrananda's customary response when asked what time it was: "You mean NOW?"<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c6439995572794901911 title="comment permalink">10/13/16, 3:55 PM</a><br><br>

It’s supposed to be to protect overtime (but most wage earners know that you get in big trouble with your boss if you actually try to log overtime), and in reality basically just gets rid of paid vacations for low income salaried workers… so now the salary class is exclusively people making over 50,000 a year."<br><br>Mr. Greer's distinction between wage and salary classes is useful shorthand, but not very accurate. Unprotected class and protected class is much better, but harder to say and write. A lot of salaried people are not in the protected class. And for them Management has never been shy about requiring the extra time, and the supposed compensation of letting you take off early when things are slow does not happen. You can be fired for not putting in 40 hours a week (or more) even if there is nothing to do. Take a half day off, that costs you a half day of vacation. Sick days are counted as vacation days. One of my coworkers quit in disgust when he added up the extra time and came up with 400 hours of unpaid time in a year. <br><br>The color of your hard hat may be different between exempt and non-exempt, but the company policies are about the same. In the end, my Ph.D. in engineering gets me about the same pay as a chemical plant operator but without working a rotating shift. And both of us have electronic leashes. If the operator gets called out on his off shift (oddly, there are no women working rotating shift in the unit) he gets four hours pay even if he just has to remove a padlock on a tagout. I get nothing. <br><br>Today I just got a new pair of Company paid for safety shoes, standing in the same line as the hourly workers. Don't get hung up Salary vs Wage. Wage class may be cut and dried, at least under Federal labor law, salaried status is not. There is even a salaried non-exempt class, a rare class because it leaves Management with the worst of both worlds, a minimum weekly pay rate and having to pay overtime as well.<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c7689239261091443204 title="comment permalink">10/13/16, 6:19 PM</a><br><br>

It is our ability to imagine alternatives to what is in front of us that has brought us to this evolutionary point. It is not intelligence that is lethal it is our use of imagination.

Quite the contrary, technological progress has already passed well into the realm of negative returns; it won't be those humans who are dependent on increasingly brittle and dysfunctional technosystems who are likely to survive the crisis of our near to middle future, but those outside the technosystem, who know how to get by with a few simple tools and a lot of personal resilience. Second, Lovelock's claims about CO2 are not supported by other research, and he himself has already had to walk back claims of the same sort more than once. Third, it's always possible to come up with a chain of unsupported speculation that leads to the end of the world in the near future; you might want to ask the people who pinned all their hopes and fears on December 21, 2012, how that worked for them. <br><br>Google, fusion isn't a game changer at all. The one thing we know from fifty years of fusion research is that even if it turns out to be technically possible to run fusion power on a scale smaller than a star -- and the odds of that aren't looking so good just now -- it's utterly unaffordable; no nation on earth will be able to pay the bills for electricity from fusion. You might want to read Charles Seife's excellent book <i>Sun in a Bottle: The Strange History of Fusion and the Science of Wishful Thinking</i> before pinning any more of your hopes on that phantom. <br><br>Anthony, I tried to factor in deep crustal bacteria into my time scale, but yes, there's some wiggle room on both ends. <br><br>SweaterMan, of course! There's deep time and then there's deeper time...<br><br>Eric, many thanks for the report from the fringes! That's absolutely fascinating -- the notion that everything was once much bigger, that the ancients were giants and we are dwarfs by comparison, is common in dark ages, and it makes perfect sense that it would be showing up by now. I'll look forward to the story. As for the federal regulation, why, yes, we're moving toward an explosion, aren't we? <br><br>Dammerung, excellent. You've brushed up against the dark heart of human egotism -- "we're so bad we can mess up the whole planet!" -- that drives so much of our current passion to pollute. <br><br>Chris, remembering that boulders are temporary is a very good start! <br><br>Martin, I'm pretty sure it's a common trope in folktale, perhaps going back to some Indo-European origin. <br><br>Kirby, I consider it highly optimistic. When you realize that in due time, nobody will ever have heard of Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, that to me is something to celebrate...<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c436405142004484814 title="comment permalink">10/13/16, 7:57 PM</a><br><br>

In general, the expression 'creationist' is usually used pejoratively, at least in the place where the real scientific debate is taking place, which is between Darwinian evolution and ID. <br><br>You may not mean it that way, but I am perplexed that you seem to ignore the place where the interesting arguments are actually going on. As to whether creationists have some good arguments I do not really know; I think they do have some but I don't spend much time on them because I consider it tainted. Not that I have any problem with belief in God, of course, but if you try to fit evidence in compliance with prior scriptures, you've got at least a bit of a bias, no?<br><br>I have seen where you have been frustrated with people for thinking in grooves but this meme that it is either Darwinian evolution or Biblical creationism really just describes two rigid extremes. It's not cutting edge, not current. Darwin himself might be called a creationist by some of the more strident atheistic types. After all, he made references to a creator more than once, perhaps breathing life into a few forms or one, and he said in some correspondence that he thought life evolved due to "designed laws."<br><br>If he thought that the creator started life (or may have) and that laws of life's unfolding were designed, that would make him quite acceptable in ID circles. Some ID people indeed go as far back as the Big Bang as the place where the input was frontloaded into the universe.<br><br>Just as you've said that Progress is a kind of religion, some people hold onto Darwinism as a religion substitute, those being atheist and scientism types who need an origins belief system. And it has to be mindless, purposeless and without any will or input. For this reason I had thought you were an atheist for a long time and still struggle with whether you "really" are not one. Because the thing which slows down the progress of science in this arena, the feet dragging and bullying behavior, is due to a very strong emotional attachment to the philosophy of mindlessness and purposelessness. This is the actual battle ground.<br><br>It puzzles me why someone who has used a phrase like the transcendent divine and written world full of gods defends a cosmos that looks exactly the same as the one that the atheists inhabit, that the divine will or wills has/have no interest or input in the unfolding of the cosmos which is its emanation or body, nor its life forms, which are the most complex thing in it.<br><br>Oh, and what do you refer to in the above quoted sentence, that the crusade against evolution ignores some of the presuppositions of their own faith?<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c1242420499076417305 title="comment permalink">10/13/16, 8:50 PM</a><br><br>

It is only with symbology (here known as mathematics) that we can even begin to get a handle on the immense scales involved. Such understanding is simply not part of our make up. But then I had second thoughts.<br> Anybody here found themselves staring into a star-filled night? Or looked at immense natural vistas like mountains or open plains? Astronauts that go into space spend a lot of their free time looking down to the immensity of earth as it revolves by. Archaeologists that hold in their hands artifacts used by people thousands of years earlier do so with keen excitement.<br> Why do we do it? Why do we find ourselves drawn to deep space &amp; time? Other people may have their own answers but I truly believe that the reason we do so is because we know in our hearts that in contemplating that beyond our reach that it is good for the spirit. <br><br> Just as a data point as I saw JMG mention technology complexity in one of his replies, I will mention a story that I found which shows how far down the rabbit hole we are being unwillingly pulled.

Primates have been around for on the order of 50 million years, but birds are older and significantly more diverse and there were some pretty enormous ones in the early Cenozoic.<br><br>My favorite crazy and almost definitely wrong speculation about older intelligence on Earth is in regards to the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum 50 million years ago. It was a 200,000 year pulse of high CO2 levels and high temperatures that came after a sudden release of carbon into the atmosphere that definitely took less than 10,000 years to happen, possibly less than 1,000 years, and from its isotope ratios looks like the carbon came ultimately from plant matter, living or long dead (as opposed to volcanoes). <br><br>The only place on Earth that hasn't been extensively surveyed for fossil fuels is Antarctica, the vast majority of its landmass being under two kilometers of ice and it being utterly uneconomical to cart them to the rest of the world. Meaning we don't actually know a lot about the geology of the continent and its complement of these fuels. What if all these fuels were burned by someone 50 million years ago, followed by some natural positive feedback to get the full effect of the maximum? Someone who never left that continent? Two kilometers of glaciers for the last ten million years would scrape away just about all evidence that anything was ever there.<br><br>Antarctica was pretty much where it is now then, making it some of the coldest land on Earth, but the Earth was much warmer then so it was pretty temperate (with the tropics a steambath and the mid-latitudes like the tropics today). We evolved in the tropics and can keep ourselves warm near the poles by wrapping ourselves up in clothes. It's a lot harder to keep something adapted to cold temperatures alive in the stifling supertropics...<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c3921124447483704648 title="comment permalink">10/14/16, 12:14 AM</a><br><br>

From hindsight it appears to be rather obvious, but I did not see it. I'm pretty certain that I once saw Carl Sagan using that particular metaphor too. Surely he would have known? It does make you wonder.<br><br>I did have to laugh when you had the usual space debris taking out the human artefacts on the moon too, over a huge period of time. :-)! I mean it is not as if it won't happen... I read about peoples hopes for that gear in last weeks comment section and just went off and did something else. What is with those hopes? It is not as if people can't do something today to make the world a better place for the future. Just sayin...<br><br>A very talented but very also very eccentric musician down here once made the claim that: "Out front of a rock n roll band is where I hide". It is quite a profound understanding of the lead singers own inner nature don't you think? And the day / year metaphor has many subtle correlations as it provides an entertaining show, but obscures some serious fundamentals.<br><br>I don't get all the hang ups about human exceptionalism. I just don't get it at all. We wouldn't have a clue if in between the extinction of the dinosaurs and the current day - a period of 65 million years, mind you - if another species had arisen that were every bit as smart as we are. Certainly humans would have done their very best to wipe them out both physically and in memories...<br><br>Anyway, we only ever borrow the minerals and compounds that go into making us. I mean, it is not like they go away and disappear after we bite the dust. All of those borrowed minerals and compounds then go into making something else despite our best efforts to the contrary. And when the sun finally swallows the Earth in that far distant future some of those minerals may even escape into whatever is out there in deep space. How exciting is that? And who knows what happens in a Black Hole? I mean honestly, it is not as if Black Holes do not serve some sort of a purpose. Just because we can't understand them, doesn't mean that they are not doing something very useful and necessary...<br><br>Well that's my rant for the week, I guess. It was quite a pleasant day here, the air was warmish at 63'F and the sun delivered heat that sunk into your bones. The insects buzzed around enjoying the many flowers. You can hear them too as they are quite loud and all of them were going about their insect like business. <br><br>The trains have been replaced by buses this month as the government removes train and road crossings and replaces them with underpasses - which is a very good thing as the two different vehicles do not mix well.

SpaceX has already delivered on their most immediate goals, lowering the price to orbit and rocket landing, and shaken up the industry. The “Space Industry” is littered with ambitious projects that endure shadowy lives with enough funding to continue but never getting past mockups, animations, and the occasional works-in-progress. The big example is the Space Launch System, but there’s many others like VASIMR, Blue Origin, and Skylon. They aren’t scams per se, but their reach exceeds their grasp. If Elon was a scam artist, it would have been easy to be just another example of one of those projects. Instead, he’s done things.<br><br>In addition, he almost certainly would have gone or going public with SpaceX when it is / was so popular in the public eye. He’s unlikely to do better if the ITS stalls in development. It’s clear he’s in it for the long haul which isn’t a common trait of scam artists. He could be waiting till the first steps on Mars are planted before cashing out, but at that point would it be a scam? <br><br>None of this means he’ll be successful much less meet his target dates. He seems to be more like colony prompters like Sir Walter Raleigh, Stephen Austin, John Winthrop, and the Virginia Company. They were sincere, but had different levels of success / failure.

My annual salary didn't change much from what I'd been making before, but it meant that when the office was closed for a holiday, it wouldn't cut into my vacation time, which was the one perk that separated someone making a 30,000 a year salary from someone making a 15 dollar an hour wage. Now I have to use PTO even on the days when my office is closed if I want to still get paid, and I earn the same number of PTO hours per year than the office is actually closed, which means if I want to take any days off at all for myself, or if I have a sick day, it'll have to come out of my pay check. As for the overtime the law is supposed to give me: non-billable overtime isn't allowed at all, and billable overtime has to go through such a convoluted bureaucratic mess of signatures and waiting that the extra 10 or 20 dollars you'd get from trying to log the extra time just isn't worth the trouble, and certainly wouldn't make up for the pay now being lost from sick days and such. I haven't been in the salaried position long enough for going back from a situation I hadn't even fully adjusted to to something more familiar to affect me. And there's doubtless a vulnerable class of people who will benefit, and other people who won't be affected at all, but there are going to be enough people whose interests and concerns shift going forward, that in a culture where the relationship between the system and the working class is already tenuous, and populist movements are already on the rise, a sudden burst in the number of people who just went from making 30,000 a year to 15 dollars an hour is not going to be a non-factor going forward.<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c8378100869421164504 title="comment permalink">10/14/16, 9:19 AM</a><br><br>

In order to make these changes, we sometimes need to close existing volunteering roles so that we can move forward with the new processes.

Your comments about "average lifespan of mammalian genus" was, in my mind, woefully discarding the evolutionary advantages of intelligence, but on your responses to "NomadicBeer" and "Drhooves" you alluded to it. <br><br>The way I see it, intelligence is such a evolutionary advantage, even sans anything technologically more advanced then rock-tipped spears and arrows (and I don't suppose we will run out of those), that we managed to become the most sucessful large predator in most, if not all, of the world's ecosystems BEFORE we invented agriculture. Right now we are, by far, the most sucessful large-mammal by total bodymass, with the only close contenders being our livestock. And, as you alluded, we are master generalists, omnivirous, unlikely to be wiped out by local ecosystem change or something happening to our main prey-species or something like that. <br><br>I really don't see anything killing off humans, unless some radical change that completely prevents the existence of warm-blooded omnivore animals of about 50kg or so, everywhere. Mind you, this MIGHT happen, but it seems unlikely to happen in the near future (taking the deep time view of "near future" here), let's say at least a week in your timescale, maybe two. The main thing I would worry about would be meteor strike or gigantic volcanism. I just can't see any scenario, barring some truly catastrophic global ecosystem collapse, where a human with a stone-tipped spear still isn't a dominant species. The only such scenario I could conceive, I guess, is the emergence of a even more intelligent species that outcompetes us. Presumably, such a species would have it's own civilization, and history, and culture and whatknot, so, it would not be the end of those things in the Earth, anyway.<br><br>I have always laughed at the common idea that some militant environmentalists use to say that "we are destroying the Earth". Not only there's virtually no chance of us actively rendering the Earth uninhabitable (barring one exception, see later) for life in general, I do not even think we could do anything to extinguish the human race. Even a 99% die-off due to some crazy Holywood-scenario manmade catasthope would still leave us as the most sucessful large mamallian species on the planet. This kind of talk is actually pretty representative of the hubris of modern culture, that you've been talking about. Or maybe blindness. It's certainly possible that we might destroy current civilization by pursuing the path we are going, and maybe subconsciously what these people are saying is that they equate current civilization with human life, or even the entire ecosystem. <br><br>P.S: I can see a way we might purposedly extinguish life on Earth, as a thought experiment, but not due to "careleness" or anything like that. We would need to dedicate considerable effort, resources and time to do so. Basically, we would need to spray the Earth with huge ammounts of highly-radioactive isotopes, with half-lives in the order of a few thousand years, probably by detonating a couple thousand very large "salted" nuclear devices. That would probably extinguish multicellular life and would have a somewhat decent chance, IMO, of wiping out even the bacteria :)<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c4145172736965486905 title="comment permalink">10/14/16, 4:26 PM</a><br><br>

There is a fair bit of logic that would fit a short lived civilization, that caused the spread of mammals, among other creatures, across most of the globe. The interesting thing is the Kimberlite pipes found in Northern Canada, which are currently being mined for diamonds, are considered a possible source of the required carbon to cause the temperature change. A possible explanation would be a civilization that left behind these Kimberlite pipes, loaded with their most enduring product, diamonds, and all other traces were destroyed by the glaciers or are still under the ice. The chimps mentioned could have been members of this civilization, or merely a breed that oversaw the ranches of primitive horses. Our ongoing fascination with diamonds is a memory left over of their original purpose. here is the link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene%E2%80%93Eocene_Thermal_Maximum <br>It would be a great starting place for a Scifi story, where the production of diamonds to power their civilization causes a giant carbon release, climate change and retreat to the south pole of remaining civilization.<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c6895444407908666419 title="comment permalink">10/14/16, 8:15 PM</a><br><br>

First, I challenge your claim that our survival depends on our ability to continue piling up technological complexity. Quite the contrary, technological progress has already passed well into the realm of negative returns; it won't be those humans who are dependent on increasingly brittle and dysfunctional technosystems who are likely to survive the crisis of our near to middle future, but those outside the technosystem, who know how to get by with a few simple tools and a lot of personal resilience."<br><br>No, we agree on all this. By "technological innovation" I mean to include not only medium and high technology but also the most basic sort as practiced by our hunter-gatherer ancestors. We are a highly specialized species that achieved our adaptability through our ability to flexibly model the physical world in our collective minds (as opposed to with our genes, like most other organisms). As specialized organisms our ability to survive depends on our ability to model, which depends on our ability to form (at minimum) stable 'tribes' of 150 or so people, cooperating to feed, clothe and shelter each other, raise children, accumulate and refine knowledge (models) and pass it on to new generations. The question is whether even the conditions supporting that minimum requirement will be met during and in the wake of the 'crisis' of a mass extinction. Or, better for us, will the mass extinction be averted either through human efforts or through the demise of industrial civilization.<br><br>JMG: "Second, Lovelock's claims about CO2 are not supported by other research, and he himself has already had to walk back claims of the same sort more than once." <br><br>I will look into it. Apparently the Gaia model has been refined by Lovelock and others (as one would expect) and CO2 is still a key component. Also, despite some criticism, it is apparently still the best explanation for the extraordinarily stable temperatures that have persisted on Earth for hundreds of millions (billions?) of years despite the sun's gradual warming.<br><br>JMG: "Third, it's always possible to come up with a chain of unsupported speculation that leads to the end of the world in the near future; you might want to ask the people who pinned all their hopes and fears on December 21, 2012, how that worked for them." <br><br>Speculation is good -- essentially asking 'what if?', i.e. modeling, trying to figure out the shape and size of what we cannot yet observe. It's what humans do to survive and prosper. It's our evolutionary niche, how we see the coming storms and the reefs and pilot our way through them. And it's how we have achieved so much (for good and ill). Of course using unsupported predictions to guide future activity is not good though sometimes it is the best we can do.<br><br>The existence of the current mass extinction is not in dispute as far as I know. Neither is the theory that the sun's warming will in the future end life on earth nor that it would be accompanied by a mass extinction. The question is when and what will lead up to that. 2012 predictions of great change were scientifically unsupported. Predicting that humans will survive a great extinction or that the current one will extinguish itself soon seem unsupported based on past events. Asserting that this extinction event will definitely not be the final nail in Earth's coffin likewise seems unsupported. <br><br>Ignoring possible reefs is a good way to run a ship aground. I prefer to decide based on intelligent modeling -- extending observations with networks of supported speculation. Modeling is what separates humans from other species. It is what has brought us to this point of crisis and, besides *maybe* dumb luck, is I think our best hope of surviving it. Do we disagree?<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c7261788783290973679 title="comment permalink">10/15/16, 5:59 AM</a><br><br>

Felt much comfort over the thought that Deep Time will erase all Trump/Clinton/Musk vestiges. <br><br>Two other random thoughts:<br><br>I've previously posted about the lack of political signs in my very conservative town. No one has any at all on their lawns, other than for a few local elections. I have seen exactly zero Clinton signs anywhere at all, or bumper stickers. I've only seen a few Trump yard signs, mostly out in the much more rural areas. What I do find interesting is that the Trump signs that are posted on street corners and random road signs in town here have all been defaced or smashed. This is extremely unusual for such a conservative area. I know that he is not popular (to put in mildly) among some members of the Hispanic community, but I live in the white part of town (we're about as divided here as it gets), so am not sure if the sign destruction has racial origins or not. No matter, really, but it is rare for any sign to be vandalized here, especially for Republican candidates. (Not to outdone, the Trump people finally built a handmade wooden sign, put in with huge stakes, and covered the "Trump" painting on the front with some sort of plastic that can be cleaned! So far, that one is still standing and un-defaced...) <br><br>On a second note, I have had a few friends go to Standing Rock to support the No-DAPL efforts. It's some really telling s*** going on there with the security forces and the police. Regardless of how one feels about DAPL, it's important to note that the protestors have all made commitments to not carrying any weapons and to remaining peaceful and prayerful. They have been (are being) met with armored tanks, multiple assault rifles, attack dogs, tear gas, and more. Government and corporate mercenaries. Out. Of. Control. I mean, seriously, the protestors are unarmed and unarmored...how many weapons do you need?<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c7066003203054277364 title="comment permalink">10/15/16, 9:55 AM</a><br><br>

There’s thousands of government contractors who do that It’s the essence of the military-industrial complex. If Elon Musk was a scam artist, the logical and quite successful scam would have created one of those. Instead he took a large risk and tons of effort on actually attempting to change the rocketry market, instead of saying he would. <br><br>Likewise, you’re right that a Mars colony is risky and expensive with at best uncertain returns. That’s why I consider Elon Musk a true believer and not a scam artist. Otherwise selling out via IPO before the hype dies down would be too enticing. If SpaceX is a huge money spinner, that would make it even better since the market loves large returns, though most estimates put SpaceX at respectful but not insane profits. He even could continue lead SpaceX as it became a traditional aerospace business which would almost certainly happen if he did go public. <br><br>Instead, he’s pushing for Mars colonies which he knows doesn’t have a good case for returns in years if ever. That’s the choice of someone who wants Mars colonies for its own sake and is strong evidence that Elon Musk is being sincere when he says the purpose of SpaceX is to put a human presence on Mars.

In my case, I've long been distressed by the lust for profit but for most of my life (until I started reading this blog) I was enthralled by the Myth of Progress.

The only relevance he has to current evolutionary biology is that he’s a good read. As it is said: “We honor the pioneers because they were first, not because they were right.” Darwin was wrong in a lot of ways, and trying to take anything he said as typical of current thought in evolutionary biology is simply attacking a straw man.<br><br>@Thomas Yelton<br><br>Re the “Gaia hypothesis.” As far as I’m concerned, it’s an arm-wave. To get a hypothesis accepted, one needs evidence, and so far, there’s no evidence. Talking about CO2 levels and so forth is modeling; models can establish possibility, but for anything beyond that they need to be supported by evidence. So far, there’s no evidence that distinguishes the Gaia hypothesis from other attempts to solve the problems caused by rising solar insolation. In fact, I’m not sure there are any direct or even proxy measurements of solar insolation over that time frame.<br><br>Yeah, I’m not impressed by the 2012 thing.

Unless it’s a deliberate hoax (see Sokol Affair), I can’t imagine it being accepted by any reputable journal.<br><br>As far as I’m aware, none of the questions that she’s attempting to answer are currently considered as so difficult that they require a really radical hypothesis. Radiations after an ecological collapse happen simply because there are a huge number of ecological niches to fill.<br><br>The big problem that this version of “panspermia” needs to answer involves the genetic coherence of all living beings that have been studied - and that’s a lot of them. They all appear to have a common biochemical basis, which is highly unlikely if there were two different origins of life, one on each planet. Another interesting question that this paper brushes by is the unlikelihood of any highly complex (that is, multi-cellular) life-form surviving the size of impact needed to blast chunks of a planetary surface into space, and then the similarly stressful impact on Earth.<br><br>Comment to JMG: it’s interesting that occultists have been claiming that <i>intelligent</i> life came from Venus a very long time ago. (I’m emphasizing the word intelligent here.) You may find it amusing that the Michael Teaching says we came from Sirius, which is implausible for other reasons. If we take both “Venus” and “Sirius” as placeholders, though, the scenario fits within the general framework of the MT, and doesn’t involve any of the biological or physical implausibilities that “panspermia” involves.<br><br><br>The astronomical charts of stellar evolution are all very pretty, and I have no doubt that they’re in the right ball park, but it seems like every few months there’s a discovery that means pieces have to be rethought. Right now, the big problem is the “dim young Sun” issue. If we take the standard 10% per billion years number for how much the Sun should have been brightening, and then project it backwards, the Sun at the time Earth formed should have been at least 40% dimmer, which means that Earth and Venus would have been iceballs. This is not what geology tells us. So far, all attempts to solve this have come up short.<br><br><br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c1954293856810529870 title="comment permalink">10/16/16, 3:46 PM</a><br><br>

Of what? <br>More like heavy than lite...ID deals with data and its interpretation, and while the inference that an intelligence had to be involved certainly could have metaphysical implications, it doesn't deal in faith or philosophy. All it says is, given the complex and specified information in the cell/DNA, could that have arisen by chance? Or is it mathematically plausible for random mutations to give rise to irreducible complexity? What are the differences between the kinds of complexity that natural forces can give rise to and the ones that minds like ours can?<br><br>It's difficult to do the topic justice without some actual study. Not to say that it is boring or over an intelligent layperson's head but because when you look, really look, at the details of how biological processes work, Darwinian mechanisms don't look adequate. <br><br>What exactly is going on with the accusation of “creationism”? If a creationist is not necessarily a Christian religious person but anyone who thinks there is a divine or eternal consciousness that has anything to do with us or this universe, well, then that just shows what this whole argument from the Darwinian side is really about – atheism. The sticking point is not that earth and then life unfolded slowly over great time, but that it did so utterly by accident through chemical molecular forces. <br><br>To state that life unfolds without mind or purpose is a speculation that has strong metaphysical implications. That should be understood. It isn't neutral.<br><br>Although many religious people (think they) have made peace with Darwinian evolution (other evolutionary understandings are possible!) they are required to think that we live in a divinely originated universe but that its entire existence and unfolding and life forms (with souls) had no input from the divine and arose just the same as if She weren't there. Quite odd.<br><br>Some people are going to cry foul no matter what if there is any hint from any kind of research that we live in a universe that has a spiritual aspect. But we either live in a purely materialist universe or we don't. And if we don't then clues to that fact may be found. But one side wants to discredit the other if they ever state that there are indeed such clues. Which means that they limit the discoveries of science to that which they have already decided it will be limited to, and reality can take the hinder most.<br><br>I recommend Darwin's Doubt or this essay:<br>http://www.discovery.org/a/2177<br><br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c5102212840550385865 title="comment permalink">10/16/16, 8:28 PM</a><br><br>

I'd like to point out that the West actually does have an ancient intellectual tradition of deep time, though it certainly never wove its way into the West's mythological foundations.<br><br>There is the Platonic Year, the great cycle of humanity and nature. The planets cycle, maddeningly, in both regular and irregular patterns. Plato says that unimaginably far in the past, when everything was new, the stars and human society were in perfect regular order, but as with Human society the stars, in steps, lost their ancient alignments. They are mathematically destined to cycle back to regular patterning in the unimaginably far future.<br><br>I read Aristotle's theory of the Unmoved Mover similarly. God and objective reality both existed forever, and may once have perfectly coincided, but must have been static. Motion or change is impossible without a motive force, and this force the Mover exerted on material reality was something like magnetic attraction, or the force the beloved exerts on the beloved to make him move hither. The action of the universe and the bubbling all around is ultimately the expression of love... of the consciousness-less material world for the pure consciousness of the the self-thinking thinking.<br><br>One might also read Thomas Aquinas on the nature of infinity, and his critique on Anselm in this matter. I have found the sophistication to be impressive.<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c8733006850916434136 title="comment permalink">10/16/16, 9:19 PM</a><br><br>

Only one reported feeling depressed by it, and he was the one with the most realistic sense of what a societal collapse would entail, and therefore doesn't want to contemplate such stuff.<br><br>I was completely away from nearly all viewable forms of screens for the past week, attending the big annual festival of the Kompira Shrine in Shikoku. When I came back home, all sorts of mayhem was happening, but would have been regardless of my viewership or lack thereof. Some things of note: during Prime Minister Abe's recent visit to presumed winner Ms. Clinton in the US, the Japanese TV put forward sob stories about Aleppo, but once he'd returned, they abruptly ceased that, and none of the disinformation I hear from the US press is being broadcasted here. They haven't mentioned the Middle East at all recently when I or my husband have been watching. There has been a certain amount of talk about negotiating with Russia regarding matters between the two countries, including return of islands Japan claims and possibly extending train service via Sakhalin. About two weeks ago during Sunday night prime time, I forget the details, but they provided an honest picture of events in Aleppo and on a subsequent weekday morning declared that the American press was heavily biased against Trump and he wasn't quite the ogre that people had been led to believe. Twice now panelists on an Osaka-based political discussion program expressed a surprising degree of support for Trump versus Clinton. This distancing from the US shadow elite has been much much quieter and gentler than that of Philippines' President Duterte.<br><br>Oh, and the second meeting of the Kanto Green Wizards went really well, with University of Tokyo scholar Avery Morrow attending as well as Murray Gilbert, who came to the first. The Kompira picnic we are sort of hijacking had been straggling along I am told, but has suddenly blossomed, and we had folks with guitars, and Priestess Ikeda and I put together an impromptu Shinto ceremony. So I will continue to invite anyone in the area who wants to join us, and am thinking of adding a short show-and-tell style Green Wizardry lecture series. My translation of highlights of your explanation of the Green Wizardry concept was useful.<br><br>Quin Arbeitman, who also attended the big festival in Shikoku (I'm encouraging him to set up a Kansai Green Wizards Group, but getting a suitable venue may be hard), says his wife thinks "Midori no Mahotsukai" is the best translation. There is the alliteration, and the image of "mahotsukai" is similar to the modern western image of "wizard."

Charging more and under-delivery would be the obvious route instead of extreme undercutting and competent delivery. My point was that if SpaceX was public like his other companies (including the one that made his fortune, Paypal), there’s no way he could fund the clear moneysink that a Mars colony would be. Elon’s said as much when asked about this very topic and his other actions make me think he’s telling the truth. This doesn’t mean he’ll succeed. After all, history is littered with ambitious failed colonies despite sincere backers. <br><br>Cherokee Organics- Thank you for your response. Civility is important and is one of the many reasons I’ve enjoyed this site even as a long-time lurker. The radiation risks both to and on Mars are a concern though often overstated. They’re generally on the order of increased risk of cancer over a lifetime (though even at worst better than smoking), than immediate painful death. As for why people would want to live on Mars, I’ve discovered lots of people who live in ways I couldn’t imagine myself living even when they have options. In addition with Mars, romanticism is a powerful force, and there’s always been people who’ll suffer hardship to leave home for truly new lands. They often go bust, but there’s always been more.<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c5403886007307465960 title="comment permalink">10/17/16, 10:00 AM</a><br><br>

The word just means a low pressure system. The wind circles around all of then, clockwise in the south, counterclockwise in the north unless they are very small. The tiny dust devil a few meters across is a cyclone.<br><br>Was that system a bona fide tropical cyclone? This means that it has warm air and strong convection (thunderstorms) at its center, and has no cold or warm fronts attached to it. Temperat cyclones are extremely abundant at the higher latitudes, and can be larger and more powerful than many hurricanes. They can look very similar in a satellite image too, to the casual,observer. And tropical cyclones often wander away from the equator and evolve into non-tropical cyclones, losing the warm core and growing a set of fronts. <br><br>You'd also need to check the records as to how unprecedented such a system is.

I know that my friend is a shy Trump supporter but what was fascinating was that it become very clear that our mutual friend's girlfriend was also clearly a shy supporter of the Donald, despite the fact that her boyfriend was very hostile. Every time his name was mentioned she got very excited and when I said that I thought he could still win this election, she could hardly suppress her excitement!

I was trying to figure out why you spoke as you did. I'm not too sure how to answer the rest, though, because you've said you have not looked into it as you're afraid it would be a waste of time, yet the topic of irreducible complexity is dealt with in some detail, and of course it does not amount to "because I said so." As I have read entire books by, for example Behe, on the topic and also watched him extensively on live video and read his testimony about it, I find him highly intelligent and an excellent explainer. For you to accuse him of dishonesty seems quite premature.<br><br>Sigh. This is how it goes or so it seems to me. The anger coming through your posts is palpable, and why?

A modification of an organism would be different. ID focuses more on information than IC, but again, that applies to all organisms and their DNA.

But I have a couple of criticisms of his week’s analysis.<br><br>Hitler was well aware of the threat that the U.S. industrial capacity posed for German European/global hegemony. I believe that good evidence exists to support the argument that this calculation played a significant role regarding the timing of Operation Barbarosa. Hitler was well aware of the need to capture, control and utilize the resources of the eastern Soviet Union (food, crude oil and strategic minerals). He regarded this as crucial, primarily to be able to ramp up Germany’s industrial capacity to the level of a global power equal to that of Great Britain and the United States in order to be able to compete against and prevail against those powers in the immediately upcoming continuation of conflict.<br><br>In other words, Operation Barbarosa was not just an end in and of itself. It was also the critically necessary prep for successful prosecution of “phase two”; conflict with the U.S.<br><br>Second point, for sure you are correct that Russia and China understand the mortal threat that the U.S. dollar/global reserve currency hegemony posses to their continued sovereignty. And this is a powerful driver for their cooperation and mutual military interests. But over a twenty year time frame, it is difficult to see the U.S. dollar being replaced by any alternative particularly in light of the trillions of dollars now extant in global debt. No question, this WILL end, perhaps spectacularly, but it appears to me (although I HOPE I’m wrong) that the global reserve banks have the capability to keep this game rolling onward for at least another ten years and probably another twenty.<br><br>I liked your comments regarding warbands. I think it might be worthwhile to point out that at least one warband culture has already emerged right here in the U.S. right now. I am referring, of course to the inner city black, drug mafia/black market/”No Snitch” economy and culture that is already well established as the accepted social structure in many large U.S. cities. This is a pretty clear rejection of the “official”, mainstream, white economy, social and legal structure.<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c7204030543317266883 title="comment permalink">10/20/16, 5:37 AM</a><br><br>

Happy to be a regular reader of yours. Keep making magic for us.<br><br>I recently read an article by Damon Linker titled "After Trump loses: An ominous American future imagined" which left out a good many important points. The one I thought was most blaringly obvious though, was his mistake of thinking a president Hillary Clinton could impose martial law or have any success with effective command of the military at home or abroad. Your first point in the JOE-35 revision speaks directly to this. Every veteran that I have met in the last 10 years, including the 20 or so that I currently work with, all lean heavily republican, own guns, come from meager beginnings, and many whole-heartedly support the views of Trump. I'm speaking from Massachusetts, which everyone still thinks is solidly blue. The Kennedy Catholic Democrats in this state are getting old and the air is changing everywhere. It would not take much to ignite the powder keg that you describe.<br><br>I'm so glad you touched on this. It validates that I'm not crazy or the only one thinking about it. All it would take is one respected general to disaffect for things to change dramatically. I have often wondered what the breaking point is for our servicemen and women when it comes to issues in the homeland. This is something I like to bring up to the conspiracy theorists when they talk about the U.S. turning into a police state and forcing citizens into containment camps and things of that nature. Our country has never been more divided. Our presidential candidates have never been so equally loathed by both sides respectively. At what point does some faction of the country say enough is enough and refuse to be ruled by the president elect? I think Trump might be hitting on this deliberately by keeping us "in suspense" about whether he will support Hillary or not. It's very telling that many newspapers in this country ran this as a headline today over anything else in the last debate.<br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c2946958485500235643 title="comment permalink">10/20/16, 8:26 AM</a><br><br>

I often think about the disparity between what I read in your (and other collapse related) posts and official planning scenarios used by DoD. At one time I wondered whether high level officials knew the truth and were just hiding it so I've poked around a little and asked flag/general level officers about things like fossils fuel reliance and climate change (lightly to test the waters) and as far as I can tell, they are truely clueless about the empirical decline we are going through. <br><br>On the other hand, most of the acquisition program managers I've spoken to have assumptions that their budgets will only shrink and that that adversaries will take advantage of asymmetric tactics that limit the return on investment on expensive and complex systems (that was actually one of the reasons that motivated the LCS concept --cheap, modular, flexible, and extremely rapid acquisition process). Also you should be aware that all the unclassified planning documents ( especially those cleared for public release) are intentionally vague and limited in scope since we don't want our adversaries to know what our assumptions are. Even the broad, high-level guidance DoD puts out to the services to guide their program and budget requests (Defense Planning Guidance) is classified at the secret level. <br><br>So, from my perspective, society at large including military leadership is clueless about the decline of America and does not even think about the possibility of a domestic insurgency or revolution (maybe they leave that to DHS??).

This requires a mobile phone, albeit not a so-called smart one, any dumb phone that can do all fashioned SMS (aka text) messages will do.<br><br>I assume you wont be happy to get a mobile plan just to keep your blogs going, but if your wife or some very reliable friend already has one that you can borrow, this may help you to set up your google account in such a way that you can access your blog from elsewhere. The usual way two-factor authentication works is that a confirmation code is sent to your mobile when you sign in from a new computer, but up to 10 emergency codes can be generated beforehand and be kept in a paper notebook that you can carry around with your person while travelling. This way you don't even have to bother the owner of the phone to give you the codes.<br><br>Please be sure to test this option before it is actually needed. I have used it with no troubles for many years, but some non-technical people whom I have recomended it have run into issues in the past, so it is not a trivial setting.<br><br><br><br><a href=an-afternoon-in-early-autumn.html#c708102731863605711 title="comment permalink">10/25/16, 9:58 AM</a><br><br>
