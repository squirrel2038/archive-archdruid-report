<div class=MsoNormal>
Well, it’s finally over, and I think it’s fair to say I called it. As I predicted back in January of this year, working class Americans—fed up with being treated by the Democratic Party as the one American minority that it’s okay to hate—delivered a stinging rebuke to the politics of business as usual. To the shock and chagrin of the entire US political establishment, and to the tautly focused embarrassment of the pundits, pollsters, and pet intellectuals of the mainstream media, Donald Trump will be the forty-fifth president of the United States of America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Like millions of other Americans, I took part in the pleasant civic ritual of the election. My local polling place is in an elementary school on the edge of the poor part of town—the rundown multiracial neighborhood I’ve mentioned here before, where Trump signs blossomed early and often—and I went to vote, as I usually do, in early afternoon, when the lunch rush was over and the torrent of people voting on the way home from work hadn’t yet gotten under way. Thus there was no line; I came in just as two elderly voters on the way out were comparing notes on local restaurants that give discounts to patrons who’ve got the “I Voted” sticker the polls here hand out when you’ve done your civic duty, and left maybe five minutes later as a bottle-blonde housewife was coming in to cast her vote. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Maryland had electronic voting for a while, but did the smart thing and went back to paper ballots this year, so I’m pretty sure my votes got counted the way I cast them. Afterwards I walked home—it was cloudy but warm, as nice a November day as you could ask for—and got back to work on my current writing project. It all made an interesting counterpoint to the nonstop shrieking that’s been emanating for months now from the media and, let’s be fair, from politicians, pundits, and a great many ordinary people all over the world as well.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I don’t see a lot of point just now in talking about what’s going to happen once the dust and the tumult settles, the privileged finish throwing their predictable tantrums, and the Trump administration settles into power in Washington DC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There will be plenty of time for that later. What I’d like to do here and now is talk about a couple of things that were highlighted by this election, and cast a useful light on the current state of US politics and the challenges that have to be faced as a troubled, beleaguered, and bitterly divided nation staggers on toward its next round of crises. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of those things showed up with rare clarity in the way that many readers responded to my posts on the election. All along, from <a href=../../2016/01/donald-trump-and-politics-of-resentment.html>my first post on the improbable rise of Donald Trump</a> right up to last week’s <a href=../../2016/11/the-last-gasp-of-american-dream.html>pre-election wrapup</a>, I tried to keep the discussion focused on issues: what policies each candidate could be expected to support once the next administration took office. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To my mind, at least, that’s the thing that matters most about an election. Four or eight years from now, after all, the personality of the outgoing president is going to matter less than an average fart in a Category 5 hurricane. The consequences of policy decisions made by the presidency over the next four years, on the other hand, will have implications that extend for years into the future. Should the United States pursue a policy of confrontation with Russia in the Middle East, or should it work out a modus vivendi with the Russians to pursue the common goal of suppressing jihadi terrorism? Should federal policy continue to encourage the offshoring of jobs and the importation of workers to drive down wages, or should it be changed to discourage these things? These are important issues that will affect millions of lives in the United States and elsewhere, and there are other issues of similar importance on which the two candidates had significantly different positions. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Quite a few of the people who responded to those posts, though, displayed no interest in such mundane if important matters. They only wanted to talk about their opinions about the personalities of the candidates: to insist that Clinton was a corrupt stooge, say or that Trump was a hatemongering fascist. (It says something about American politics these days that rather more often than not, the people who did this were too busy slandering the character of the candidate they hated to say much about the one they planned to vote for.) Outside the relatively sheltered waters of <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, in turn, that tendency went into overdrive; for much of the campaign, the only way you could tell the difference between the newspapers of record and the <i>National Enquirer</i> was by noting which candidates they supported, and allegedly serious websites were by and large even worse. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This wasn’t the fault of the candidates, as it happens. Whatever else might be said for or against Hillary Clinton, she tried to avoid a campaign based on content-free sound bites like the one Barack Obama waged against her so cynically and successfully in 2008; the pages of her campaign website displayed a laundry list of things she said she wanted to do if she won the election. While many voters will have had their disagreements with her proposals, she actually tried to talk about the issues, and that’s refreshingly responsible. Trump, for that matter, devoted speech after speech to a range of highly specific policy proposals. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yet nearly all the talk about both candidates, in and out of the media, focused not on their policy proposals but on their personalities—or rather on nastily distorted parodies of their personalities that defined them, more or less explicitly, as evil incarnate. The Church of Satan, I’m told, has stated categorically that the Devil was not running in this year’s US presidential election, but you’d have a hard time telling that from the rhetoric on both sides. The media certainly worked overtime to foster the fixation on personalities, but I suspect this is one of those cases where the media was simply reflecting something that was already present in the collective consciousness of our society. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All through the campaign I noticed, rather to my surprise, that it wasn’t just those who have nothing in their heads that a television or a website didn’t put there, who ignored the issues and fixated on personalities. I long ago lost track of the number of usually thoughtful people I know who, over the course of the last year, ended up buying into every negative claim about whichever candidate they hated, without even going through the motions of checking the facts. I also lost track months ago of the number of usually thoughtful people I know whose automatic response to an attempt to talk about the issues at stake in this election was to give me a blank look and go right back to ranting about the evilly evil evilness of whichever candidate they hated. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It seems to me that something has been forgotten here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We didn’t have an election to choose a plaster saint, a new character on <i>My Little Pony</i>, or Miss (or Mister) Goody Two-Shoes 2016. We had an election to choose the official who will head the executive branch of our federal government for the next four years. I’ve read essays by people who know Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump personally, and claim that both of them are actually very pleasant people. You know what? I literally couldn’t care less. I would be just as likely to vote for a surly misanthrope who loathes children, kicks puppies, and has deviant sexual cravings involving household appliances and mayonnaise, if that person supports the policies I want on the issues that matter to me. It really is that simple. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d like to suggest, furthermore, that the fixation on personalities—or, again, malicious parodies of personalities—has played a huge role in making politics in the United States so savage, so divisive, and so intractably deadlocked on so many of the things that matter just now. The issues I mentioned a few paragraphs back—US foreign policy toward a resurgent Russia, on the one hand, and US economic policy regarding the offshoring of jobs and the importation of foreign workers—are not only important, they’re issues about which reasonable disagreement is possible. What’s more, they’re issues on which negotiation, compromise, and the working out of a mutually satisfactory modus vivendi between competing interests are also possible, at least in theory. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In practice? Not while each side is insisting at the top of its lungs that the other side is led by a monster of depravity and supported only by people who hate everything good in the world. I’d like to suggest that it’s exactly this replacement of reasoned politics with a pretty close equivalent of the Two Minutes Hate from Orwell’s <i>1984</i> that’s among the most important forces keeping this country from solving any of its problems or doing anything to brace itself for the looming crises ahead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus I’d like to encourage all the citizens of my country to turn off the television and the internet for a few moments, take a few deep breaths, and think about the tone of the recent election, and to what extent they might have participated in the bipartisan culture of hatred that filled so much of it. It might be worth pointing out that you’re not likely to convince other people to vote the way you think they ought to vote if you’re simultaneously berating them for being evilly evil with a double helping of evil sauce on the side, or sneering at them for being too ignorant to recognize that voting for your candidate really is in their best interests, or any of the other counterproductive habits that have taken the place of reasonable political discourse in today’s America. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second point I noticed in the course of the election campaign connects to the one just discussed. That’s the hard fact that the United States at this point in its history may still be a single republic, but it’s not a single nation—and it could be argued on reasonably solid grounds that it never has been. Facile distinctions between “red” and “blue” states barely touch the complexity, much less the depth, of the divisions that separate the great urban centers from the rest of the country, and the different regions from one another. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I think it was Pauline Kael who, in the wake of Richard Nixon’s landslide victory in 1972, commented that she didn’t understand how Nixon could have won—after all, nobody she knew voted for him! The same sentiment is currently being expressed in tones ranging from bewilderment and baffled rage from all corners of the affluent left and their hangers-on among the mainstream media’s well-paid punditry. The 20% or so of Americans who have benefited from the jobless recovery of the last eight years, and the broader neoliberal economic agenda of the last four decades, very rarely leave the echo-chamber environments where they spend their days to find out what the rest of the country is thinking. If they’d done so a bit more often in the last year, they would have watched Trump signs sprouting all over the stark landscapes of poverty that have spread so widely in the America they never see. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
But of course the divisions run deeper than this, and considerably more ramified. Compare the political, economic, and social policies that have the approval of people in Massachusetts, say, and those that have the approval of people in Oklahoma, and you’ll find next to no overlap. This isn’t because the people of one state or the other are (insert your insult of choice here); it’s because they belong to different cultures, with incommensurable values, attitudes, and interests. Attempts, well-meaning or otherwise, to impose the mores of either state on the other are guaranteed to result only in hostility and incomprehension—and such attempts have been all too common of late. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Ours is a very diverse country. That may sound like a truism, but it has implications that aren’t usually taken into account. A country with a great deal of cultural uniformity, with a broad consensus of shared values and attitudes, can afford to legislate that consensus on a national basis. A country that doesn’t have that kind of uniformity, that lacks any consensus concerning values and attitudes, very quickly gets into serious trouble if it tries that sort of legislation. If the divergence is serious enough, the only way that reliably allows different nations to function under a single government is a federal system—that is, a system that assigns the national government only those powers and duties that have to be handled on a nationwide basis, while leaving most other questions for local governments and individuals to settle for themselves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
My more historically literate readers will be aware that the United States used to have a federal system—that is, after all, why we still speak of “the federal government.” Under the Constitution as originally written and interpreted, the people of each state had the right to run their own affairs pretty much as they saw fit, within certain very broad limits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The federal government was assigned certain narrowly defined powers, and all other powers were, in the language of the Tenth Amendment, reserved to the states and the people. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Over the first century and a half of our national history, certain other powers were assigned to the federal government by constitutional amendment, sometimes with good results—the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws to all citizens, for example, and the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments’ extension of voting rights to black people and women respectively—and sometimes not—the Eighteenth Amendment’s prohibition of alcohol comes to mind here. The basic federal structure remained intact. Not until the aftermath of the Great Depression and the Second World War did the metastatic growth of the federal government begin in earnest, and so in due time did the various attempts to impose this or that set of moral values on the entire country by force of law. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those attempts have not worked, and they’re not going to work. I’m not sure how many people have noticed, though, that the election of Donald Trump was not merely a rebuke to the liberal left; it was also a defeat for the religious right. It’s worth recalling that the evangelical wing of the Republican Party had its own favorites in the race for the GOP nomination, and Trump was emphatically not one of them. It has not been a propitious autumn for the movements of left and right whose stock in trade is trying to force their own notion of virtue down the throats of the American people—and maybe, just maybe, that points to the way ahead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s time to consider, I suggest, a renewal of the traditions of American federalism: a systematic devolution of power from the overinflated federal government to the states, and from the states to the people. It’s time for people in Massachusetts to accept that they’re never going to be able to force people in Oklahoma to conform to their notions of moral goodness, and for the people of Oklahoma to accept the same thing about the people of Massachusetts; furthermore, it’s time for government at all levels to give up trying to impose cultural uniformity on the lively diversity of our republic’s many nations, and settle for their proper role of ensuring equal protection under the laws, and those other benefits that governments, by their nature, are best suited to provide for their citizens. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We need a new social compact under which all Americans agree to back away from the politics of personal vilification that dominated all sides in the election just over, let go of the supposed right to force everyone in the country to submit to any one set of social and moral views, and approach the issues that divide us with an eye toward compromise, negotiation, and mutual respect. Most of the problems that face this country could be solved, or at least significantly ameliorated, if our efforts were guided by such a compact—and if that can be done, I suspect that a great many more of us will have the opportunity to experience one of the greatest benefits a political system can bestow: actual, honest-to-goodness liberty. We’ll talk more about that in future posts.<br>

In unrelated and rather less serious news, I’m pleased to announce that the second volume of my Lovecraftian epic fantasy series <i>The Weird of Hali</i> is now available for preorder. Once again, H.P. Lovecraft gets stood on his head, and the tentacled horrors and sinister cultists get the protagonists’ roles; this time the setting is the crumbling seaside town of Kingsport, where Miskatonic University student Jenny Parrish is summoned to attend a certain very ancient festival... </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<i>The Weird of Hali: Kingsport</i>, like the first book in the series, <i>The Weird of Hali: Innsmouth</i>, is being released first in two signed and numbered editions, one <a href=http://www.miskatonicbooks.com/THE-WEIRD-OF-HALI-KINGSPORT-by-John-Michael-Greer-Limited-Edition-Hardcover-ADVANCE-ORDER.html>one merely gorgeous</a>, the other <a href=http://www.miskatonicbooks.com/THE-WEIRD-OF-HALI-KINGSPORT-by-John-Michael-Greer-Signed-Deluxe-Leather-Bound-and-Traycased-Lettered-Edition-ADVANCE-ORDER.html>leatherbound, traycased, and utterly over the top</a> for connoisseurs of fine printing and binding. There will be a trade paperback edition in due time, but it’ll be a while. Those of my readers who find eldritch nightmares from the crepuscular beginnings of time itself better company than the current crop of American politicians may find it worth a read. </div>

This, because the terms are most commonly used today, as derogatory epithets. In researching this, there seems to be as many opinions about what they mean as there are people expressing them, which made me wonder if the terms had any objective meaning at all. Then, I recalled your comments from an earlier essay, about "interests" and "values" and I was wondering if "left" could describe those positions that considered "values" as more important, while "right" is a position that considers "interests" as paramount.

I don't know whether they'll actually choose to learn and listen to what working-class people have to say, but they have been decisively shown that their "divide and conquer" approach of winning over a coalition of urban liberals and overwhelming majorities of ethnic minorities, while trampling on the white working class, really doesn't work. They're going to have to start caring about regular people of all colors, shapes, and sizes, or they will lose the Rust Belt and the election with it. I am extremely happy that the normally blue-tinged states of the Rust Belt were the states that revolted and made it abundantly clear that they are justifiably angry and can't be taken for granted anymore.<br><br>The most striking thing to me about the results is that it's impossible to dismiss them as racism or white nationalism. Trump actually did better among ethnic minorities, in particular Hispanics, than Mitt Romney did four years ago. And there were patches of solid Democratic support in a few rural parts of the Midwest, especially in parts of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota, that went solidly for Obama twice but completely flipped red this year. Iowa was solidly in Obama's camp in 2012 but flipped a full 13 points, from Obama by a 5% margin to Trump by 8%; Wisconsin is the same story but a few points more Democratic. A whole lot of Obama voters all over the Rust Belt, both white and minority, went for Trump. The Dems won't win the presidency again until they figure out and address the real grievances of the voters who left them this year.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c6196398679668512880 title="comment permalink">11/9/16, 5:17 PM</a><br><br>

I grew up in the segregated South, went to white-only schools, and lived in the white part of town. How does one draw the line to determine mutual virtue in situations like those? Many Southeners viewed legal segregation as our "unique institution" and actively resisted civil rights efforts.

I may have had a few too many. There may be a few people I know who fit that profile. I wonder if most voters voted for there own self interest, viewed through the lens of (two) party politics. Looked at county level election returns, regardless of what they were told, the left behind and the top 20% went two different ways. Half the country didn't vote; 30% went Republican, Libertarian, Green, or other, and 20% went Democratic. Millennials read the writing on the wall and decided, "we are so fracted,". (actual quote of 29 yr old friend, modified for publication in your blog). The upshot being that, without consciously voting their interests, and without having to defend their reasons, they get to vote against a human being without any redeeming qualities. Perhaps it has always been thus, but Internet Technologies seem to exacerbate the predisposition. This type of inter-manipulation wasn't a problem for the Lakeland Republic. It wasn't so necessary to control the minds of the citizens, be it government control, media control, or social network control. How did the Lakeland Republic reduce the need to control others thinking to such a low level?<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c2073469374572786680 title="comment permalink">11/9/16, 5:38 PM</a><br><br>

Going by the red/blue county pictorial, it was even more lopsided. Going by the popular vote, though, Trump lost. This is something all Americans need to consider as we try to stitch back together a nation from a vile, divisive campaign. The supporters of both major candidates have results to support their position of where we politically go from here. How we reconcile those different results will say much about us as a nation.<br><br>From the invective and spittle I’ve seen in all sorts of media, I agree with you that we probably cannot forge a nationwide consensus on much of anything. If we can somehow devolve the federalist system to emphasize true states rights, I also agree that a nationwide consensus really isn’t necessary except for those few things listed in the Constitution as federal responsibilities. Unfortunately, I don’t believe for a moment that the Federal government will relinquish one bureaucratic minutia to the states unless it is forcibly removed, either by constitutional amendment or actual armed force. Not only would the ruling elite oppose such transfer, but the 16th amendment also blocks the way. Most of the taxes collected in the US funnel through the federal government. Regardless of how much of the money is funneled back to the states, the monetary power is held by the Federal government. And, as the old saw goes, whoever has the gold, makes the rules.<br><br>I don’t find the overt focus on personalities inconsistent with how Americans act. We are, by and large, a nation that worships celebrities, thrives on sound bites (or tweets), and prefers a rousing round of he said/she said over stolid discourse. Throw in a bit of narcissism and coddling, and you have the makings of an electorate that will actively avoid issues. Issues make you think. Issues make your positions susceptible to reasoned debate. Issues make you look beyond your own insular, entitled cocoon to the wide, uncaring world. Issues paint the world in shades of grey instead of the politically correct black/white. And issues can make you have to admit you’re wrong. All of these and more are why we celebrate the cult of personality, not the triumph of reason.<br><br>Perhaps one other thing has lead to the dearth of issues in our national political discourse - the political promise. Much of what I have read or heard from candidates has been presented as “here’s my position, and here’s what I’ll do if elected.” The follow thru is usually lacking, if not completely upended. The usual joke is for a book to be published labeled “Promises I Have Kept” by Some Politician. It’s blank. I have one from Bush II and Obama, and no doubt many others exist. Why engage in a discussion of issues when you know the person you’re talking to will turn around and stab you in the back whenever convenient. On a more positive note, I can and do have discussions on issues with most of my acquaintances. But they’re not politicians.<br><br>Household appliances and mayonnaise??? Now that’s an image that’ll take a while to eradicate. I may have to resort to chocolate therapy.<br><br>On a completely different topic, I’ve noticed that the book links on your blog take me to a couple different sellers. As I have a Kindle and it’s easiest to feed the beast from Amazon, I’ve looked at your books there as well.

I suspect they are the old-school residents who are fed up with the haughty, anti-social tech workers who have flooded the area during the present Federal Reserve-fueled asset bubble.<br><br>Several people took the day off to "process" the outcome of the election. The fact that people in Ohio and Michigan are scraping by while office workers on the coast can take a day off to pout is indicative of the overall problem, but the SF Progressives are too clueless and self-absorbed to understand this.<br><br>As you predicted, the elites and SF office workers are coming up with a litany of just-so stories to explain Trump’s victory. Everyone who voted for Trump is a racist! Facebook did it – if only we had an approved news source which supplied the “facts”! Rural America is soooo dumb you guys! If only everyone went to college and received the approved talking points in exchange for thousands of dollars of debt!<br><br>The more I hear this, the more I realize that modern Progressives (the Obama stalwarts) sound exactly like Stalinists too clueless to realize that Prada was full of lies. This is more frightening to me than Donald Trump.<br><br>Lastly, to bring things full circle: early on you said the Progressives would make a serious mistake by implying ALL Trump supporters are bigots (even though some totally are). This turned out to be true. Likewise, I was sometimes called a bigot because I support states’ rights (only racists like that!) and secession, as a last-ditch response to tyranny.<br><br>But now that Trump is in office, wouldn’t it be great if California could secede!? This coming from the elites who mercilessly mocked Northern California’s “State of Jefferson” movement for decades – and who called me a neo-Confederate for pointing out, like you do JMG, the importance of federalism and how it was the Framers’ intent from the beginning.<br><br>The statists destroyed federalism, enlarged the federal government, and now must live with the consequences of Donald Trump controlling leviathan. You reap what you sow.<br><br>While I do not support Trump, I am enjoying the elites eating a buffet of crow.<br><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c233940278247615514 title="comment permalink">11/9/16, 5:51 PM</a><br><br>

That being said, I think you're off the mark on this one. I will grant that people voting for Trump have been thrown under the bus for the last 40 years. They can't find jobs or economic opportunities because of immigrants, outsourcing, automation, neoliberalism in whatever form. I get it, I really do. They have needs that aren't being met and that could be met and should be met. But along with those unmet needs breeds fear and hatred of the "other" that have taken those things from them. And what Donald Trump's personality does is legitimize those feelings. "Hey, if he's saying it, it must be ok." People will rally around a charismatic leader, you know this. People rallied around Churchill when he called for shared sacrifice. People rallied around Hitler when he told them the Jews were responsible for their discontent. And people rally around Trump when he says it's ok to blame Muslims, Mexicans, and women for their problems. That's why his personality matters. You keep insisting that it's only the policies that matter, all that other stuff is irrelevant. Tell me this, how hard do you have to look to see that Trump will not actually give his supporters what they need in terms of economic opportunity? I know, I KNOW that it will not be different with Clinton. More of the same, I get it. But Trump has been hobnobbing with political insiders for decades. The man comes from more privilege than most of us can imagine. He has no idea, none, what it's like to live life like one of his "deplorable" supporters. Just today it was announced that he's looking into Rudy Giuliani, Chris Christie, and Newt Gingrich for his cabinet. Honestly, how different are Trumps policies going to be, really? The small chance that he rises to the occasion and actually delivers something different is not worth the hate and the vitriol that we already know come along with it. It feels like cutting off our nose to spite our face.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c4469484065312207287 title="comment permalink">11/9/16, 5:58 PM</a><br><br>

How were we supposed to counter "Make America Great Again" when we've been the ones saying America wasn't great? And I wonder if the impact of the Access Hollywood tape and allegations of rape and sexual assault against him weren't significantly blunted by the fact that the last time we had a sexual predator in the White House were the last halfway decent years for many working class people in this country (not to mention the fact that said predator was his opponent's husband).<br><br>Philosopher Richard Rorty, a self-described "decadent liberal" politically, often argued that the Left's lack of old-fashioned patriotism has been one of our greatest weaknesses, and at least once even argued that our elitism and ignoring the issues faced by the working class was going to be our undoing.

Congratulations!<br><br> To my mind, one of the most fascinating essays that you have ever done was the one on Trump predicting his eventual success - but not about the man himself. It was your analysis of how much of the West was coming down to a salary versus wage class struggle in it that has let me understand a lot of what I was witnessing across the world, especially here in Oz. It was like how changing the focus on a set of binoculars brings everything into sharp focus. That essay is going straight to the trophy room!<br><br> It was weird watching the reaction to Trump's win from several thousand klicks distance. The pearl-clutching, the wails, the tears, the accusations - and that was just the men! Perhaps Brexit led the way but it was the courage of average Americans to take a leap into the unknown rather than accept more of the same misery and victimization that gives me hope. The knock-on effects are going to be massive across the world.<br><br> Huge sections of American society have just been rendered irrelevant - the pundits, the pollsters, the media, celebrity opinions, Republican &amp; Democrat HQs. Only now are they waking up to the possibility that they have only been playing to an echo chamber. God knows what the effect will be on the upcoming French and German elections next year. Probably the jihadists in Aleppo are now wishing that they had taken up the Russian offer of evacuation. Being a New Yorker Trump will have no sympathy for their ilk.

At best, I got an acknowledgement that perhaps the candidate had a point about X or Y, but they were so utterly evil that only evil could possibly proceed from them, thus rendering their respective policy stances ultimately irrelevant. <br><br>Admittedly, I expressed my fair share of disgust, sometimes serious but often petty, with the characters and demeanors of the candidates (and was known more than once to declare that I had met potatoes more inspiring than Hillary Clinton), so I am not guiltless. I will keep a better eye on myself in future as regards my own tendency to engage in the "politics of personal vilification," as you term it.<br><br>What concerns me most about the whole trend is not so much its application to the candidates themselves, unfortunate and obstructing as it is, but its extension to anyone who chooses to vote for one of them. Never have I felt so strongly that my choice of candidate was functioning as a sort of litmus test, in the minds of my fellow citizens, of my worth as a human being. Moreover, the degree to which I was assumed to be identified with the candidate I chose was disturbing--as if I were personally putting on their every fault, and should be punished in proxy for their every sin. I felt like an effigy about to get burned on more than one occasion.

Everyone was chatting, but I think they absorbed what I was trying to convey. It was too shady on the mountain to demonstrate the dehydrator, but they could all see me making it and they asked a lot of questions. There was talk among them about farming. The nearly constant rains starting in August ruined most people's crops, and the only fermented food I had on hand to bring were anchovies (which I don't share for fear of mistakes being disastrous) and extremely hot peppers, which seem to love the rain. Still, they found fresh, unstrained tabasco to be quite good. They noted that some experienced farmers managed to get some degree of produce despite the rains.

I agree that moving more towards state, even regional power, would help the Republic. There are already rumblings from rich techies in California about secession.

We do talk about policies and usually find common ground there. <br><br>I note with hope that at the state and local levels people are finding agreement on issues as diverse as cannabis, gun control, and campaign financing. There are problems at the state level such as gerrymandering but the courts have been addressing this at least here in Florida.

I agree that we are a nation comprised of many cultures but I'm not sure if the cultures are always regional. Having recently visited the camp that has sprung up to resist an oil pipeline being built just north of the Standing Rock rez I witnessed a remarkable clash of cultures based upon very different views of our relationship to land and water and the life it supports. On the one side is an industrial culture that views land and water as "resources" to be exploited without constraint and turned into profit, on the other a much more ancient culture that views them as living relatives that we've been entrusted to care for, as they care for us. This latter view is shared by native people who have come to this place from all over the continent and beyond, drawn to the stand that has been taken here. The highly militarized police forces have also arrived from many states and are serving as the hired goons of the pipeline company for all I can tell. The pictures coming out of there have been quite dramatic, with native people on horseback being chased by riot police in humvees, ATVs and helocopters and unarmed "water protectors" being maced, shot at with rubber bullets or mauled by dogs. I don't know how all of this will end but I don't really see much room for compromise, as one culture- the industrial one- has always viewed the other as an inconvenience at best, something that needs to be cleared away along with the forest to make way for the march of progress. One thing I do know is that the natives and their allies have dug in for the long haul and have no intention of giving up the fight. The pipeline company is equally determined to push this project through, especially now that they have a powerful ally about to move in to the white house.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c8330830422797678035 title="comment permalink">11/9/16, 8:36 PM</a><br><br>

Thank you all for your comments; since there's kind of a mass of them, I'd like to start by thanking everyone who posted congrats about the success of my prediction. When I was walking to the polling place, yes, it occurred to me that I'd be eating a nicely seasoned dish of crow if Clinton won by a landslide; still, it was pretty clear to me that the polls were wrong, for the same reason they were wrong about Brexit -- and of course they were. <br><br>Now, on to individual comments: <br><br>Bootstrapper, I'm rather startled by your suggestion that "left" and "right" are derogatory epithets; last I checked, they're common labels routinely used by the people to whom they're applicable. No, the division doesn't correspond to that between values and interests. If you go out and ask people whether they're politically to the left or to the right, then ask them to explain their political beliefs, I'm sure you'll figure it out promptly. <br><br>GreenEngineer, I'll be discussing that in upcoming posts. The phrase "equal protection of the laws" has been stretched and bent embarrassingly out of shape of late, and requires a bit of resizing. So does the concept of justice, which you'll notice I didn't reference. The law is not there to enforce somebody's abstract notion of justice; it's there to maintain those minimum standards of behavior without which civilized life is impossible. More on this as we proceed! <br><br>Tom, I'm sorry to hear that it isn't just an American problem. Sigh...<br><br>Donalfagan, obviously I disagree. <br><br>Cortes, fascinating. I've suspected for some time that the brash blowhard persona is basically an act...<br><br>Dale, thank you. The funny thing is that some Trump supporters were saying that a vote for a third party candidate was a vote for Hillary! <br><br>Grebulocities, exactly -- though the establishment Dems will try to spin it as racism as long as they can. <br><br>Philip, that's one of the things that a refederalization of the country would have to address. Since the Fourteenth Amendment gives the federal government the right to intervene against legal or institutional inequalities on the part of state governments, I don't think it's unreasonable for federal law to continue to prohibit segregation of public amenities, businesses open to the public, and the like. <br><br>Notes, I suspect that's behind a lot of the frantic attempts to legally impose this or that system of values on the whole country -- the fear that somebody else will impose an intolerable system on you. I would agree about drugs, and a great many other things; those are best left to state and local governments, and to individual choice. <br><br>Cherokee, thank you. I was unsure of my prediction for a while in the later part of the summer, when Trump made a lot of gaffes on which Clinton's people were able to capitalize; I thought it was possible he would crumple in the stretch -- but as it turned out, he managed to recover, regain control of the narrative, and win. I was pretty sure by the beginning of October that he was going to take it, and the louder and shriller the Clinton camp and their pet pundits got, the more sure I was that they were desperately trying to convince themselves that the inevitable was impossible.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c6513511486692741772 title="comment permalink">11/9/16, 9:04 PM</a><br><br>

Back when Obama was nominated, it was only at that moment of feeling some racial healing that I understood the pain that all of us live with due to racism. And I'm white. So although I wasn't gung ho for Hillary, as the prospect of a woman being elected president seemed likely, I began to feel the relief of the pain of long-term, deeply-conditioned gender discrimination. I became aware of how deep the pain has been, for me as a woman, and how deeply it affects the dynamics between all of us in this country, maybe even more so than racism. But we're so used to it, we usually don't even see it. It's like having a toothache for so long you just think it's normal. Well, many women in this country finally felt the depth of that pain and anticipated the relief of that pain that a Hillary victory would bring. Instead, to have a p***y grabbing man elected to the highest office in the country feels not just disappointing, and not just painful, but humiliating. Mutual respect you say?<br><br>So I do feel for the stark landscapes of poverty. Their plight is one of loss. And please be aware, the women of this country are still waiting to ever have the thing they lost.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c4387237411046793655 title="comment permalink">11/9/16, 9:05 PM</a><br><br>

I guess it's gone to the ether now.<br><br>Anyway, I'm always impressed by your druidic prediction powers. It almost makes me believe you have supernatural powers :)<br><br>And for a post that could have been just a "Told ya!", which you would be entitled, I appreciate the excellent discussion and thoughtful arguments.<br><br>I'll have to question some of your assumptions, though. As one of the first commenters asked, how do you square things like the Civil Rights Act? Or even slavery in the South pre-1860? Do you think Abraham Lincoln over-stepped the boundaries of the Federal government? Did Lyndon Johnson when he signed the Civil Rights Act? I mean, there WAS widespread popular support (from whites, that is) for Jim Crow in the South. On the other side of the fence, I bet there would be enough popular support in a few of the more liberal states to essentially revoke the Second Amendment locally, and if the divide keeps growing, in the future they might view "the right to keep and bears arms" as intolerable interference by the central government. At a certain point, the diferences are so great that moving from state to state would feel like crossing a international border. <br><br>I mean, there's some issues that are fairly ameneable to being decided in a more local manner, for sure, but there's some stuff that's non-negotiable as long as you're trying to maintain any kind of political union. Large multi-cultural, multi-religion, multi-national political unions existed in the past for sure, but they tend to be unstable and usually held together by a degree of force from the dominant religion/ethnicity. One of the great criticisms lobbied against the Europpean Union is precisely that it's too difficult to balance the interests of the different states within and even the extremely weak degree of central coordination they have is seen as intolerable intereference by a growing number of people in the continent (Brexit comes to mind, of course!). I seem to recall you not being very sanguine about the future of the EU as a political entity. <br><br>What I'm saying is that, yes, there's some issues that could and should be easily devolved to the individual States, but there's some things that either you can agree upon or you can't and no ammount of federalism will help and it's likely that the political union will dissolve at some point, with or without violence. <br><br>I'm also slightly more sceptical about the benefits of extremely descentralized government, but that's a huge topic and I'm not the one who's blogging here, so, I'll just end here;<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c4136302736331381520 title="comment permalink">11/9/16, 9:14 PM</a><br><br>

You certainly deserve to pat yourself on the back with your prediction. I must admit, however, that I felt immense relief as the results came in. With Trump's attempt to "drain the swamp" and fight against the globalists most likely a smoke screen about bigger problems, at least there's a slim chance we'll see some Rule of Law restored. With Hillary, there was zero chance.<br><br>I think you're spot on with the view to devolve the Federal government, which goes hand-in-hand with the decentralizing the Long Descent will impose anyway. You noted the increase in size of .Fed along with FDR's terms, and I believe you've mentioned that he was one of three American "dictators", and we're about due for another. If so, I see the table being set for this dictator to come to power in 4 or 8 years (if by "election"), and that event being in direct conflict with any attempts to devolve the Feds...<br><br><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c8231018342376677057 title="comment permalink">11/9/16, 9:23 PM</a><br><br>

I wonder if the Democrats will get around to taking that into account. <br><br>Tripp, funny! No doubt it was a mineral deficiency. ;-)<br><br>ChemEng, exactly. That's one of many reasons why I think a renewal of federalism and a devolution of powers are worth pursuing. <br><br>Varun, remember that a lot of these people have spent the last year or so convincing themselves that Donald Trump is Satan incarnate -- I suspect this was at least in part so they could overlook the more dubious aspects of Clinton's record -- and now they're terrified that the bogeyman they imagined is going to come and eat them. You're right, though, that there's a lot of emotional fragility these days. It's a stressful era. <br><br>JacGolf, I probably should have, but it wasn't until I fielded some trollspittle in response to last week's post that the penny finally dropped. <br><br>Mark, no, it wasn't me, but it's a valid point. As for Retrotopia, one of the points of that story is that you give people good jobs at good pay, a relatively fair and democratic government, and other such amenities, you don't have to control them -- they take care of themselves and their society just fine, thank you! <br><br>John, I hope you enjoy it! As for Oklahoma, I thought of it because I've been to Guthrie a couple of times for Masonic speaking gigs, and found the very different culture there interesting and by no means unpleasant. <br><br>Unknown Joel, I'm sure you're right about the Unaffordable Care Act. That really rubbed the noses of a lot of people in just how little affluent liberals care about what happens to ordinary Americans -- and Clinton, who'd promised to keep Obamacare, was the logical target for their wrath. Even so, that was simply one more straw atop an already overburdened camel. <br><br>Kevin, I can understand Hispanic Americans and Muslims feelng threatened by Trump's "stated intentions," but the others you named? I think some serious demonization is at work there. <br><br>Mark, so noted! Ah, but what about the household appliances? ;-)<br><br>Lucius, I wonder what the first group is going to do when it finally sinks in that the black vans are entirely figments of their imagination. The third group -- those are the future. I wish them wisdom, persistence, and ultimate success. <br><br>Canon Fodder, that's why I think it's important to begin pushing political discourse back toward issues, and holding elected officials accountable for their promises. It'll take a lot of work, but it can be done. As for books, please don't patronize Amazon or any other discount retailer if you can avoid it -- those discounts come straight out of the authors' income. The links I provide are mostly publishers, and buying from them gets me the largest royalty. Thanks for asking!<br><br>Ray, Blake's usually a source of good advice. <br><br>K Sc, politicians go back on their word because they know the voters won't throw them out of office for doing so -- so again, it comes back to the voters.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c1527750959081378947 title="comment permalink">11/9/16, 9:37 PM</a><br><br>

Probably because you weren't paying <i>attention.</i> But while I hoped you were wrong, I do see you were right - and within the "margin of error" lurk battalions of ninja assassins. Thank you for being thoughtful and gracious with entirely justified "I told you so's.”<br><br>I have been lavishly quoting you, especially your thoughts about the plight of the wage class under thirty plus years of neocon foreign policy and neoliberal economic policy.

And many of them apparently dislike and despise Donald Trump’s personality and (forgive me) deplorable business record, but voted for him ANYWAY, as their fury at thirty years of maltreatment by Washington “Trumps” his liabilities. Some of the cognitive dissonance among pundits and more attentive observers is that despite his disturbing rhetoric and behaviors, he still managed to be the only candidate, once Bernie Sanders was safely disposed of, to speak directly to the concerns of this cohort. Unfortunately, he also adroitly spread his outreach exploiting racial resentments and religious intolerance. So his campaign has swept up racists, bigots, sexists, and authoritarian proto-facists among his supporters and normalized their views, which distorts the perception of the legitimate and very real anger of the Ordinary Citizen.<br><br>There were two other thoughtful humans that saw this coming, Kevin Drum wrote in MotherJones back in 2011 –<br><br>"If politicians care almost exclusively about the concerns of the rich, it makes sense that over the past decades they've enacted policies that have ended up benefiting the rich. And if you're not rich yourself, this is a problem. First and foremost, it's an economic problem because it's siphoned vast sums of money from the pockets of most Americans into those of the ultrawealthy. At the same time, relentless concentration of wealth and power among the rich is deeply corrosive in a democracy, and this makes it a profoundly political problem as well.” <br><br>- Kevin Drum, <i>Why Screwing Unions Screws the Entire Middle Class, Mother Jones</i>, March/April 2011<br><a href=http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/02/income-inequality-labor-union-decline rel=nofollow>www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/02/income-inequality-labor-union-decline</a><br><br>And of course, the deeply missed George Carlin – <br><br>"Because the OWNERS of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners, now. The REAL owners. The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You HAVE NO CHOICE. You have OWNERS. They OWN you. They own everything. They own all the important land.

Of course its a non-US, Non-Corporate, <i>Independent</i> News organization, so they are occasionally allowed to practice a little actual journalism. It’s a grim picture, but they deserve some credit for trying to inform people.<br><br>But whatever policy, or crisis management, comes out of the Trump Presidency, I agree with your assessment that the two-party system is in some trouble, and even the pundits are coming around to this view. Among disturbing possibilities, the GOP is a MESS, fractured, consumed by the anti-establishment insurgency, and spent the campaign in all but an internal civil war. The smell of power will more than likely hold them together, unruly as they might be.<br>However, the Democratic Party may very well also be quite finished as a poliitcal force in this Nation, and along with it any legitimacy of the American Left, especially as conceived by affluent elites. And this was entirely self inflicted, and utterly avoidable. But the store is bare, the varsity bench is empty. The DNC in it’s obsession to coronate Sec Clinton, utterly abandoned both their rank and file, and democratic principles. This has cost them the House, Senate, and now the White House, and in January, The Supreme Court, likely for a Generation - should the Republic endure that long. <br><br>More immediate casualties may likely be the Affordable Care Act, with all it’s flaws, the rolling back of Environmental Protections, and any legitimate response to Climate Change. But as you have remarked, the Paris Accords were all but a PR photo op in the first place.<br><br>As for ordinary folk - we’re still on our own, and have been for a while now. I found it interesting that Trump in his acceptance speech was pledging to do all the things the GOP absolutely stonewalled for eight years. This is going to be a lot MORE interesting if he tries to stick with the high sounding stuff he's tossed out there last night. <br><br>But he got there setting every thing in sight and in his path on fire. Now that he's triumphant, he's being all gracious and Presidential. The Man rather has a thing for “winning." We'll see how that lasts when it's time to actually govern, or the first crisis comes across his desk, or hits some blowback in the GOP or Congress. Who knows, maybe he’ll actually help, but his record in business is not reassuring.<br><br>My plan is to remain a citizen of this Nation, and act like one. With everything that implies.

I am looking forward to the repeal of NAFTA, should it come to pass, and I do hope that we will in fact take a step back from the brink of war. I identify as a socialist and am very hopeful that the elitist neoliberal consensus may in fact be broken. Nonetheless, I am struggling to integrate the prospect of a President Trump. I do recognize that the bulk of Trump's voters are not the kind of caricatured racists that some present them as. I am an early millenial living in a red state, earning beneath the national median income and struggling to get by financially and I have no time for the old political consensus, and never had. Nonetheless, the majority of those who are in fact virulently racist have gleefully gravitated to Trump. I am sit here with a pit in my stomach as I watch reports of assaults on people of color, Muslims, and LGBTQ, including small children, roll in by the dozen from all over the country today, most of which were perpetrated by individuals proclaiming Trump's victory as their justification, and people I love describe the sheer terror they are experiencing today, and I don't know what to do or how to feel. I was raised to watch for just this kind of behavior as a dangerous prelude to pogrom and atrocities, and I can't just dismiss that. I can't help but fear that Trump, acting as a demagogue (rather explicitly so, as described in his own book The Art of the Deal), has unleashed something terrible from within the id of this colonial settler state, something that will not rest without a blood sacrifice. These kinds of things do happen with some regularity.

Although I've also been caught up in the enormous emotional swings of the past few days and I have to confess that I just posted an anonymous comment on Reddit alleging that the forum was being overrun by bots/paid shills, so the hate and anger is mine to own as well... but here's something a bit more interesting. <br><br>Some old left archivists and I were looking through the demographics of the vote. The Washington Post made a handy chart of all the counties won by Obama in <i>both</i> 2008 and 2012 that switched to Trump in 2016. And <a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/obama-trump-counties/ rel=nofollow>there's a huge block of them</a> stretching from Peoria through Mason City, through La Crosse, all the way to northern Wisconsin. <br><br>I was interested by the fact that I had heard nothing about this, and did some sleuthing. It appears that the entire upper Mississippi survived through 2008 through some kind of sustainable economic development, then was hit by a flood of factory closings since then. There's no outright proof of this, only <a href=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/2016/09/22/disappearing-factory-jobs-driving-iowa-voter-angst/90666442/ rel=nofollow>scattered references in papers</a>. <br><br><br>It's fascinating to me-- when the Rust Belt started to rust, it was major national news and a theme for articles that persists as a stereotype today. Pundits and journalists who wanted to dig into the Trump phenomenon went to west Pennsylvania-- and not without reason, as they produced a surprise upset. But the economic failure of a similarly sized Midwest region, what appears from the polls to be an entire new Rust Belt, didn't even make a mark on the topics of national concern. Colbert never put them on notice. Jon Stewart never had a laugh about them. There's not much to laugh about anyway.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c7640369903872796696 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 12:59 AM</a><br><br>

In India , we have repeatedly seen that to get votes candidates say that they will support whatever policy which is currently demanded by voters. After winning election they do practically nothing to enforce this promised policy but on the contrary they continue to enforce same old existing policy which were in existence before theirs election in election. And this done by not one or two candidates but all of them and every election. You will see one party promising one policy in one state, an opposite policy in other state and a mix of them in 3rd state , and finally adopting none of them after winning election in any of the state or in whole union and maintaining status quo. Due to this a I believe it is necessary to to ensure that candidate whom you support atleast have basic characteristics such as honesty. Without it in U.S. will just become like India, i.e. electing one person only to get disappointed and elect another person in hope of change only to get disappointed again and then electing a third and then forth and then fifth and the loop goes on.

It's the same reason why the alauties in Syria (Assad II's group) are fighting to the death: they rode the tiger during the Assad Dinasty and know what will happen should that dinasty falls. The same thing is happening here in Brasil. The sexual minorities used the long leftist cycle from the mid-nineties up to 2016 to push as much legislation as possible, to use the State to achieve their aims. Some of them got quite rich in the process as "defenders of the minorities".

This would have yielded exactly the reverse result in the Electoral College, thus putting Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Oval Office. I looked at the tallies for the states that flipped in this projection and saw that in each case, a substantial minority of Johnson and Stein voters going for Clinton instead could have caused this flip. <br><br>And the primary issue that I believe decided this minority of third-party voters who could have given this election to Clinton, of whom I am certainly one?

Anyway, thank you for calling it in January and sharing your thinking so I could prepare and watch the unraveling.<br><br>There is a Micah White, PhD who claims to be co-creator of Occupy Wall Street and lives in Oregon. He is called on activists to move to the "red" areas of the country and take over local city governments. Oh, and he's asking for donations from people to do it, because you know, there is no work there and it will take money to move and all that. This is the weirdest thing I read since the results came in.<br><br>People are protesting "Not my President" in the streets. More are being organized tonight. It is so childish to be protesting in anger against something. Isn't this why you said the left has failed? They have no proposal for what to do instead.<br><br>AlthoughI did see a talking head media person post that we need to have all the election all over again, leaving off all the 3rd party candidates. It would only be fair of course to do it this way, he said. And I thought, ah, he's gotten to the "bargaining" phase of dealing with grief. Lots of shock and anger out there right now.

I have yet to speak to my friend who said it was impossible for him to win - should be an interesting conversation! Interesting, I'd missed the correlation between Orwell's Two Minutes Hate, and what's going on, but quite right. It seems that the most hateful of them all are my leftie friends. People I thought were quite intelligent - and indeed are most of the time - seem to be taking it really hard, even though these same friends equally despise neoliberalism - why is that? How could they go from supporting Sanders to supporting Clinton with such lack of cognitive dissonance? That I don't quite understand. <br><br>I think people should be relieved that we are far less likely to see a WW3 between US/The West and Russia (and no doubt China and Iran). That's all I've said to people about it.<br><br>The thing I've had to observe in myself is my desire to want to 'convert' others, persuade them, tell them they're wrong (about Trump that is) etc. And that is why I've imposed a ban on myself of either a) posting anything on Facebook espousing the alternative view to the media, or b) even going on Social media. It's tempting, but I've learnt from the aftermath of Brexit that there is little to be gained by it, and perhaps indeed that desire is the problem with politics at the moment - everyone's trying to put their opinion onto others (albeit by most by yelling and screaming and wailing). Facebook I've come to realise, from spending a little bit of time on it again recently, against my better judgements, is nothing more than a stream of consciousness and one-upmanship of the least conscious sort, and it's not worth getting worked up over. Then again much of the everyday discourse around politics has become that. There seems to be too many 'knowing' opinions these days. Too many armchair experts, and I don't want to become another one. Any historical examples of it being the same? And besides on Facebook and the internet in general all social norms, and values go out of the window meaning it descends into playground mentality (actually that's insulting to school children) - perhaps because its a dehumanised form of communication.<br><br>But finally what is it in me that gets to riled when I see everyone acting like children on Facebook? Why can't I let it wash over me? Why does it frustrate me? I'd be spending my time better answering those questions I think, otherwise I am merely projecting my shadow onto my Facebook 'friends.' And besides, it really has become quite boring discussing politics all the time - can we not find something else? Can we not explore the range of human emotions beyond that of injustice and rage? Can we not have friends that have different thoughts, views and beliefs to ourselves? Do we have to become so monoculture? <br><br>About government now being too big, and too cumbersome, I can only agree. The UK is less diverse and smaller, and I think even here it's needed. Different people have different needs and different contexts, so why not allow for that? Perhaps trying to force everybody to live by everybody else's values isn't such a great idea. I think society needs to become more human-scale again, which in practice means local government.<br><br>I'm thankful there are people like you in the world prepared to tell a different story and go against what the cultural mainstream would prefer. We need more of it.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c587725775219614181 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 3:59 AM</a><br><br>

You know, if you do not have to suffer the tax cuts for the rich, abolition of health care, gay marriage turnaround, racism, etc. the whole thing does have some bright sides. <br><br>I identify myself as dark green, at the same time fiercely in favor of individual civil liberties and equitable societies, I am also homosexual - so not a natural bedfellow of Trump. I think, this whole election just shows how weird, unpredictable and erratic reactions to our predicaments have become. Now that it is so hard to paper them over any longer - and I mean that on both ends of the voting booth.

Then again, my area has tons of Trump signs and I have only seen a few Clinton bumper stickers. I don't even live that far from NYC. Poughkeepsie is the last stop on the MTA North (commuter line).<br><br>I could not agree more about the insane focus on personalities in politics. My younger brother told me that he knew people who worked with both Clinton and Trump. I could not give him anything but a blank look when he told me how people say she is very nice and he is a jerk. Who cares. Frankly, I find her affable enough and I find him incredibly crass yet entertaining. Comedians who don't like him have admitted that he kills as a performer.

You totally called it.<br><br>I have to admit to 1) a definite schadenfreude and 2) a certain admiration for Mr. Trump -- he had a sense (I can only envision it as an intuitive sense) of the path that took him from being a fringe-candidate in a crowded Republican field chock-full of insiders to President-elect, and he stuck to that path in the face of derision and dismissal. (And the flanking maneuver through the Rustbelt was masterful, I have to concede.)<br><br>I've had to point to out to e number of folks (on the left and the right) that Trump is not (or did not run as) a standard Republican. Rather, he took the Republican label and ran off with it. So the Republican party's "control of government" is something of a misnomer if Trump's policies are anything akin to what he offered in the campaign. It will be interesting to watch what he actually does, particularly those aspects where he (and the voters who sent him to the White House) is at odds with the Republican establishment (trade comes to mind).<br><br>I agree with you that the federalism you describe is our best chance to hold the nation together. Essentially, we have to (re)adopt a much looser structure among the states and between the states and the federal government. I wonder, however, whether such a structure would last in the face of our very human tendency to get in other people's business. Perhaps devolving into the collection of more culturally-homogeneous nations is a more effective way. I guess I suspect that so long as there is an over-arching power structure, someone is going to reach for it and try to use it to impose their values across the board, so the best way to prevent that is to not have that over-arching structure in the first place. Just my (admittedly still-evolving) thoughts on the matter.<br><br>Re the "if you're not voting for Hillary, you're voting for Trump" meme -- I was told that more times than I could count. After a bit, I tried to point out that the logic was nonsensical, but with little luck: if, given the two major candidates A and B, a non-vote for A is a vote for B, then likewise a non-vote for B is a vote for A. Since I voted for neither A nor B, by that logic I therefore voted for both A and B, and everything cancels out nicely. <br><br>I saw that Kingsport was up for advance order early yesterday and immediately got my order in. Cannot wait until March :)<br><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c6581011535060812337 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 5:16 AM</a><br><br>

His economic policies are 100% chamber of commerce Republican.<br><br>Against Andy Barr they ran an elderly wealthy white woman who proudly proclaimed in her ads that she was a single mother. Guaranteed not to go over well with struggling families who can't get any help from welfare benefits due to being married.<br><br>At the state level, Republicans came iut with full control of both houses of the legislature, giving Bevin a de facto mandate to turn us into Kansas redux, though it would be hard for our educational system to get worse since we're already fourth from the bottom in the nation. That won't stop them from wrecking the economy worse than it already is and shredding what's left of the social safety net. Welcome to thurd world America. <br><br>As someone else noted, the two urban countries here were islands of blue in aw of red. Places that actually supported Obama last time refused to vote for Hilary. <br><br>And I am sure that skyrocketing ACA premiums are a bit pay off the blame. There are lots of people whose stories are like mine - can't get any medical care all because we don't have money to pay the ridiculous deductibles (which for our family is actually more than I make a year) yet our premium is already higher than our mortgage payment before any 2017 hikes. It's insane to think families can afford this. Yet they was the Dems main supposed selling point.<br><br>The SJWs here are in complete shock. One of the secular orgs I work for had a "safe space cookie social" yesterday. I am curious to see if the local Federation office will do anything useful. A few years back I wrote an article for the local Shalom newsletter saying we need to return to more traditional Federation programs such as having a community doctor, lawyer, accountant, etc funded by the Federation as well as an agressive program to help people get out of debt, a community garden, tool and appliance library, etc. They refused to publish it. And now here we are, looking Bevinistan in the face. It is depressing, though I don't think cookies are going to help.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c2980257157855199186 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 5:24 AM</a><br><br>

Here in OHIO the Strickland/ Portman race was the presidential race writ small. An energetic politcal newcomer PG Sittenfeld was passed over and former Governor Strickland was anointed by the dems even before the primary. Strickland (like HRC) had his chance and it was over, but the dems refuse to let in new blood to build up a serious back bench of future candidates, instead giving the slot to the person who "paid their dues" and "who's turn it was" instead of letting the cream rise to the top. After watching this debacle I really think I would get better representation by a coalition of parties instead of a single party. Now I hear murmurs of "Michelle in 2020". The next heir apparent, I hope they learn from this. I honestly hope Trump delivers what he promised with respect to immigration, trade and globalization, and I think it is wise to stop "poking the bear".

The culture in some ways has changed.<br>To be clear; Oklahomans are by and large still closet racists with a strong authority-loving/theocratic streak, and I feel that's too bad for a state that gave America Woody Guthrie and Will Rogers.<br>HOWEVER, I think even here, the times are a changin'. We continue to elect people to state government who think that a day of prayer for higher oil prices are a solution to a billion dollar budget shortfall, so that's disappointing. But, we voted on a number to amendments to the state constitutions, and the results were largely encouraging.<br>Without going into too much detail; we voted to change the states outdated liquor laws, we voted to keep the death penalty, we approved two amendments aimed at reforming criminal justice by reclassifying drug possession to a misdemeanor, and we rejected a 'right to farm' amendment, a penny sales tax to support public education, and, most shocking to me, we rejected the removal of the separation of church and state clause from the state constitution.<br>I find this last one particularly shocking, and it is my hope that, even if we keep electing corporate tools to state government, at lease the people themselves seem to have chosen economic interest over values. My guess is that many Okies rejected the sales tax for education because of how regressive it is. I also guess that they embraced criminal justice reform because drug laws have economically crippled many communities. And modernizing our liquor laws took place in spite of opposition that claimed that doing so would increase alcoholism destroy public morals. <br>I sincerely hope this represents a shift in the political culture towards pragmatism over moral policing. Having grown up here though, I'm not holding my breath.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c5294933486026203213 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 5:39 AM</a><br><br>

It seems to me that this split is a fundamental part of any ONE nation. What does seem new though (speaking historically, not about 2016 specifically) is the suburb/exurb phenomenon. I know you like the model of dispossessed working class and others like the model of racist rural rednecks as the archetypal Trump voter. But the stats show that the majority of his voters were comfortably middle class, not especially exposed to the deprivations of the disposessed working class, and living in suburbs and small cities. Sure my rural county voted 3:1 for Trump, but that was about 4000 total votes cast countywide (my own candidate, chosen based on policies, received 42 votes in the county). In contrast, Williamson County, the "hard-red" affluent outer suburb of Nashville, cast many tens of thousands of votes, also mostly for Trump. It is a land of shopping malls, acura dealerships, suburb after suburb, and constantly snarled traffic. THAT is the true heart of the "Trump Nation," not rural America. <br><br>If you listen to Trump voters talking now, they have absurdly ridiculously mind-bogglingly high expectations for their man. Many of his base see him as a savior who is going to fix everything, absolutely everything. This may only be about half his supporters, but that is an awful lot of people. It seems to be more extreme than what I remember from Carter, Reagan, or Obama supporters on the morning after their wins (those are three other candidates I can personally remember who were swept in on a tide of emotional and political opposition to the status quo -- Watergate, Stagflation, and Cheney's "Long War"). It's gonna get ugly when reality hits them in the face. There is potential for a massive backlash in the 2018 midterm, with angry motivated Democrats and disappointed bitter Republicans. There is almost always a backlash 2 years into a presidential first term; this one might be a doosey! And then we get divided government and gridlock, continuing... and perhaps a steadily shrinking Supreme Court. <br><br>Don't forget, the Evangelicals got the VP spot. And living here in Evangelical land, in a truly rural area, Trump voters are not especially gloating. I actually think I saw fewer trucks flying flags yesterday, Union or Confederate, than is normal for this town. The evangelical prominence may account for the lack of Trump yard signs that I and other rural ADR readers here noted in our neighborhoods in contrast to your experience in an old mill town. They voted for him overwhelmingly, but they don't love him, and I'm not sure how much they trust him either.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c2484999855248700534 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 5:54 AM</a><br><br>

YEARS of being neglected by both parties, the anger and the need for revenge against the system only grew. Along came a TV star they liked whose plan was to destroy both parties and tell them all “You're fired!” Trump’s victory is no surprise. He was never a joke.

Second, regarding federalism: some advocates of uniform standards across the states, such as the trucking industry (as an example), oppose what they call "a patchwork quilt of contradictory regulations." For example mudflaps legal in one state may not pass muster in the adjacent state. They hate that. Not that I'm a fan of the trucking industry - far from it! My own concerns relate more to the "race to the bottom" between states competing to attract businesses to their locales, and competing not to attract poor people seeking better benefits.

And they posted 5 scenarios for how the election would turn out based on quintiles of probability from their forecast models. These ranged from Clinton electoral landslide, to Trump electoral victory while Clinton maintained a small plurality of the popular vote. The actual outcome was almost exactly in line with this last quintile. Those who thought this election was a done deal based on polling were indulging in ignorance (willful or otherwise) of probability and statistics. Same is actually true of Brexit - polls were within the margin of error on the eve of the vote. Trump's victory may have defied punditry, but it fell well within the 95% confidence range of the polls and the models based on them. <br><br>Many analysts fall into several errors. Biggest is that they forget that states are not independent. If North Carolina goes heavier for Trump than expected, Florida and Wisconsin are more likely to also. And polling has a sample size. People will look at the theoretical "normal" distribution for an infinite sample size. But the real t-distribution of means based on smaller sample sizes (samples of DIFFERENT POLLS, not the number of people sampled within a poll) has much fatter "tails," i.e. events that appear unlikely are actually more probable than they might seem. Throw all this together, and even based on existing polling Trump's odds going into Nov. 8 were more like 30%, not the 5% or 2% some people gave him. And 30% is pretty good odds, nearly anyone would take those chances on such a huge prize. <br><br>Maybe we need to teach probability and statistics in grade schools? It might save millions of poor people a bundle on lottery tickets they can't actually afford. <br><br>Obama in 2012 outperformed the polls to the same extent that Trump did in 2016. The difference is that Obama was already favored to win, so he just won by a larger margin than expected.

There is another alternative-media writer whom I follow who also correctly predicted a Trump victory - Brandon Smith of Altmarket.com. I read everything you both write so it was intriguing to see you both predicting this for months. The curious part is that the rationale behind your predictions was so different.<br><br>Brandon believes the world is run by the "elites," what some would call the deep state. I believe he is correct about that, but perhaps not so all-encompassingly powerful that they could influence the presidential election. Brandon's theory was that the elite wanted a Trump victory so that they could blame the coming collapse (when Yellen raises rates in December) on conservatives. The theory was that the ship is sinking, so best to put the right scapegoat in as captain before the ship slips beneath the waves. That reasoning was also behind his correct prediction of the Brexit.<br><br>I find your reasoning more persuasive. I too have sensed that the affluent liberal class has completely missed why Trump was so effective. He is a rejection of the status quo. There is no small number of us ordinary white folk, who as you correctly note are the only group it is acceptable to hate in this country, who are fed up with the pandering and political correctness that permeates everything in this country. The left were claiming Trump was a maniac who couldn't be trusted with nuclear weapons. But Clinton represented more of the same - endless wars, provocation of Russia (she advocated a no-fly zone over Syria, which is an overt act of war), continued over-spending on the military industrial complex, etc. When Putin stated on the record that a vote for Trump was a vote for peace, he was right. Yet none of the affluent liberals gave any credence to that.<br><br>I am now busily unfollowing a number of my affluent liberal friends on social media who simply can't leave it alone. The evilly-evil evilness discussion has become tiresome.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c3209634605442792318 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 7:16 AM</a><br><br>

It certainly appears hopeful that a coalition of embittered old Bernie supporters and dismayed Millennials might now have a shot at putting a stake through the heart of the Democratic Party. <br> <br>Unfortunately, it now looks as if the Republicans may be perfectly happy to set aside their many fundamental differences with Trump for the sake of being in power with him.

Your post this week was spot on as usual and I agree with it. I was amazed myself at how no one wanted to talk about the issues during the election. Everything focused on the candidates' personalities or a very generalized expression of negative results if the bad candidate won. I hope to see the nation return to critical thinking and thoughtful debate of issues and policies that may address those issues, but I'm not holding my breathe. <br><br>I also noticed that some family members and friends would also resort to calling certain ideals and beliefs the opposite of what they were b/c those ideals and beliefs they either liked or didn't like. The main example I have in mind is that people called Hillary a socialist b/c she advocated for a global economy. The ideal of a single free market where capital, goods, services and labor could move freely without excessive interference from governments in the way of tariffs, immigration quotas, etc. When I pointed out to people that those ideals have been on the wishlist of the arch capitalists of the West since the end of WWII and are actually capitalist ideals, their eyes would just glaze over. In their mind, since immigration and free trade had hurt their fortunes those things deserved to be labelled with the cold prickly label of: Socialism.<br><br>The flip side of that was also true. When I'd point out to those same people that Trump was campaigning on the very same talking points that the international Left (socialists included) had for decades, they just wouldn't get it. I pointed out how the socialists said that free trade / free markets destroys the working class and creates mass unemployment and immigration into and out of certain areas depending on the flows of capital. They had advocated for protectionism and trade barriers to protect jobs,etc. Of course a huge distinction b/w the international Left and Trump is that the Left correctly laid the blame at the feet of the wealthy and powerful business interests. While Trump for the most part blamed any convenient scapegoat for the policies; which he had to do, lest he sound like a socialist. So since he advocated for things they felt would be beneficial to their fortunes they were labelled with the warm and fuzzy label of: Capitalism. <br><br>Lastly, a lot of the same sort of warped thinking happened in the Hillary camp. All of her campaigning for hyper global capitalism was worded and viewed instead through the warm and fuzzy rhetoric of an "open, accepting, egalitarian, global society". Instead of what it actually advocated for: tearing down borders, pry open new markets and unleash the predatory corporations upon the world with ever more force. Of course she couldn't speak so honestly lest she sound like a big mean ol' capitalist.<br><br>Up is down, left is right and America stumbles along to the next set of crises.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c1265482584214642900 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 7:19 AM</a><br><br>

Everything that they ran from when they came to West Virginia - she's Monsanto, and Big Pharma, and Nafta, Wall Street banking,  TTP, and a neocon war hawk. <br>It's like JMG said a few months back.

I have wondered for years how you do it, but I think I finally figured it out looking back through your old posts, you predict the future using the time machines you taught us how to make using the power of organic gardening and the magic of green wizardry ;-) <br><br>http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2010/08/care-and-feeding-of-time-machines.html. <br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Anyway, on to the actual substance of the post:<br><br>You said “it’s time to consider, I suggest, a renewal of the traditions of American federalism: a systematic devolution of power from the overinflated federal government to the states, and from the states to the people. It’s time for people in Massachusetts to accept that they’re never going to be able to force people in Oklahoma to conform to their notions of moral goodness, and for the people of Oklahoma to accept the same thing about the people of Massachusetts”<br><br>I think there’s another angle to that as well… and it’s a situation I’ve been having a much harder time figuring out the solution for… you’re quite right that Oklahoma and Massachusetts are different cultures… but the same cultural division exists between Baltimore and Cumberland, Austin and Waco, and so on, and that has had just as drastic implications as the cultural division between regions. Most recently that played out in North Carolina, when Charlotte tried to pass a city ordinance that was voted in by its people, and the state government proceeded to impose the values of North Carolina as a state on the very different values of Charlotte as a city (which led to a nation-wide circus). There does seem to be some sort of correlation between certain aspects of culture, and its expression in human ecology, and I’m not sure what the best answer to addressing that is… because if imposing New England culture onto the Southwest is a mistake, it’s just as much of a mistake to impose the culture of Iredell North Carolina onto Charlotte or Asheville.<br><br>I think the suggestion is the right one, but it almost seems like it would have to be taken a step further in order to really account for cultural distinctions… It looks like what would have to happen is a distribution of power in which the United States federal government has roughly the level of power that the UN currently does, with the state governments having similar power to the federal government as it currently stands and individual counties being able to do the things state governments can currently do, that way Charlotte is still able to pass its city-wide antidiscrimination ordinance without getting it shut down by the governor, and without it having to be imposed on the very different culture you see in surrounding rural counties. <br><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c1611044208830947348 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 8:32 AM</a><br><br>

It’s going to be a different world…<br><br>However, while Trump the person may guide the policies that define the next era of history, but there is also a cultural element to what Trump’s America will become, and there are some people who are apprehensive about what that will look like. I’ve had friends of mine in vulnerable demographics already receive threats online from Trump supporters talking about what their new America is going to do to them… And there are some people who are feeling… empowered by this in ways other than hope for jobs. it may be the working class and legitimate policies that pushed Trump to victory, but that does not erase the existence of a shadow contingent of his supporters who were motivated by things other than international trade. To the people here who did support Trump though, the ball is in your court now, and Trump’s America is your responsibility, and I imagine there are a lot of apprehensive people looking to you to prove their worst fears about what that world will look like wrong. It’s an extreme example, but I think about Oswald Spengler voting for Hitler for legitimate policy reasons, and speaking out as soon as he saw lines being crossed and spending his final years under house arrest as a result.<br><br>That’s an extreme example of course… Trump’s obviously no Hitler… at best he’s a Reagan, at worst a Berlusconi… but I would say that that sort of prescience and caution from people who have supported Trump’s ascendency is important, as is keeping a finger on the pulse of the country closely in coming years, just in case people do begin to slip into that all too familiar and all too enticing collective madness that can so easily when a tired and broken country is rescued from the jaws of collapse by a charismatic and unconventional leader. We may be too big and diverse a country to that sort of madness to become universal, and of course it’s just as likely to inspire an equally ugly resistance, but that sort of mentality can still affect enough people to feel justified in acting out in terms of some internalized idea they’ve projected on to Trump that it could still be a significant force… bringing the fringe I have been following the conversations of on forums like Stormfront off of the internet and out into the street. It feels to me like we’re entering into an era of history that is as precarious and dangerous as it may be necessary.<br><br>(Note… I’m not calling Trump a fascist, or calling all or even most of his supporters racists or any of that… I’m basically saying that there is a possibility (and in some cases already a reality) of a noticeable uptick in things like assaults and harassment directed towards certain visible and vulnerable demographics by a fringe who has dragged a few Trump quotes out of context and used them to justify itself and decide it is no longer a fringe… and that it is the supporters of Trump who supported him for legitimate reasons and are not that who are in the best position of power to speak out against such things when they happen.)<br><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c2589983196890484583 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 8:37 AM</a><br><br>

I have not met anyone who was anti-Trump, did not haaaaaate Hillary, a fair few who were absolutely pro-Trump; and true enough, most people just didn't talk about it. I don't know if this matters, maybe it does, but they were all white, non-immigrants who would never be affected if the scapegoating which swirled around his campaign are pushed further into action. Many were women who already live in a world most of my previous cohorts in Liberal Elitistan would consider abusively misogynist. "Grab 'em by the p***y" is not unusual or out of bounds talk. They hear stuff like that all the time, "It's just talk, what's the big deal?"<br> OTOH: They can afford to dismiss that angry rhetoric as just inconsequential bluster. ((Well, so can I, but I'm not sure I want to.)) They can afford to dismiss the vitriol of his more extreme supporters as justified economic angst, or well, OK, maybe some of them ARE racists, but of course not all, so not to worry, nothing is going to happen. No Kristallnacht is on our horizon. Don't worry, ignore it, Calm down. <br><br>There are some people who cannot afford to ignore it, but they don't live out here in rural WY or rural/suburban NV. They are not in our sphere.<br><br>There are policies of Trump's that I like and agree with: cooperation with Russia, a move to isolationism, (dismantling US hegemony), trade tariffs, the goals of encouraging manufacturing to come back, (although I disagree that they are laid out in any specificity, as a commenter said above, the goal is stated, but the path is missing), rebuilding infrastructure. Some I think are problematic because they seem to me to be very open to graft, corruption or abuse: Rounding up 11 million illegal immigrants, a ban, (temporary or not) on people based on their (Muslim) religion, building a giant wall that Mexico will, (but has refused to) pay for, "fixing" the healthcare debacle by simply opening up cross-state competition between insurance companies, more trickle-down Reaganomics.<br><br>Personally, my biggest concern is that if we are headed for some big fractal collapse, some big chunk of our glass dome falling in, like another 2008 or something, President Trump will abandon those problems and the hard work on them in favor of the easier path that strongmen throughout history have taken to regain their popularity and public approval: just scale up the scapegoating. I don't know why, I keep thinking in this respect of Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe more than the funny little man with the mustache. Demonizing a clear, targeted minority group to coalesce different factions of the majority. Laying waste to the country and the people in the process.<br><br>JMG: I'm pretty sure you will disagree with or also dismiss this fear. You have written about this a bit before. I wish I had your faith in the goodness of humans, but I don't. IMHO: Yes, we are headed for a collapse that has nothing to do with civil rights or how we cut the pie, but I do foresee as a part of that collapse, a large or complete rolling back of civil rights. When not personally affected, I predict people will just not care enough or think "We've fought that fight, we've won, It can't happen here". It can. I think it will.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c1889429768421591331 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 9:54 AM</a><br><br>

Williams is a thoughtful person, I believe, and there is some basis to what he, among many others, is bearing witness to here: https://twitter.com/anthoknees/status/796763632964993025<br><br>Further down this thread, he muses: <br><br>"A win for Trump and a win for Clinton would have been a win for white supremacy. But Clinton didn't embolden bigots like Trump does. There has been some serious evil brewing from rhetoric that Trump continually used. White supremacy has been here but now it's on the hunt... When you dehumanized a group it's very easy to justifiably commit various forms of violence and abuse on them. You don't see us as equals. We're tired. We just want to live another day and that ain't even promised."<br><br>This is certainly a time to resist the pull of tribalism, and to really have one another's backs in the face of violence... solidarity is not about saying the "correct" words (especially if you don't mean them, or if they disguise your investment in the status quo). But it IS a matter of doing the right thing, especially when it comes to the protection of the weakest and most vulnerable, and there are some people (not the vocal or affluent, by the way) who are especially vulnerable at this very fraught time when things hang in the balance and can still go any way. <br><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c3052152531652830917 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 9:57 AM</a><br><br>

I remember when, as an 18-year-old in 1978, I arrived in the US from a childhood spent in Latin America to go to college. I thought I knew what "left" meant then - to me it meant economic redistribution - putting a floor under the poor lower than which we would not let one another fall. It meant resisting the predations of the rich upon the poor. I grew up among poor people, so much poorer than us, that I never realised until many years later that my own family was (in US terms) working class. In any case, I couldn't find any economic "left" (as I saw it) anywhere in the US at that time. Not in any of the churches I visited, or among the other college students I met. I had to settle for "liberals" who seemed to get "some" of what I was on about, though almost nobody could grasp how the US and its policies and interests looked to people when viewed from the other side of its southern border... (not for want of me trying to explain). Mostly these liberals were in favour of more inclusivity, and less prejudice, but never spoke of class or economics. After that, though, what I mostly noticed was that discourse in the US became more and more polarised every time I returned, and that polarisation ran right through my own family. It took me years to appreciate how class shaped this phenomenon within my family and in the greater society. And its effects were more pernicious precisely because it could never be spoken about. It was taboo.<br><br>In any case, I think it is fair to say that at this point there is an "insider left" and an "insider right" (the established core of both party organisations and their connections in business, media, finance, etc), for whom status quo still works. There is an "outsider left" (Bernie Sanders movement) and an "outsider right" (Tea Party movement and Trumpism). These are the populists on both sides for whom the status quo is not working. And right now there are ways in which the "insider" versus the "outsider" dichotomy is so pronounced that it can blur left and right. That is to say, the outsiders may sometimes have more in common with each other, at least just now, than they do with their respective "established" wing.<br><br>I think you can also find "interest/based pragmatists" and "values/based idealists" on both the right and the left. And again, there are times when the pragmatic/idealist dichotomy is more pronounced than the left/right one. <br><br>As for myself, in puzzling over where my best "fit" is, I'd say I'm definitely an "outsider" and will always lean left, and I know I've never been a "liberal". As to values v interests I am learning that my values are for guiding me alone, while pragmatism must guide my search for a workable common ground (as much as that may ever be found) with my fellow human beings. <br><br>And then there are days when I decide, flip all that nonsense. At heart, I'm a barbarian, I live on my wits, my courage, and my honour, as best I can, among people who, believe it or not, are just people, like people everywhere. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c8504907560089180541 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 10:29 AM</a><br><br>

(For example, would an effective trade union movement not have prevented/softened the effects of NAFTA, or a great deal of offshoring, and prevented the working classes from being as easily divided from each other's support by race, ethnicity?)<br><br>If all our discussion revolves around who can be trusted, we never get around to thinking about what issues we care about them, and more to the point, what we are prepared to do to advance them.

In recalling this exchange, I’m reminded of what we were told (in RFK’s day) was the Kennedys’ motto: “from those to whom much is given, much is required”.<br><br>Part of what the Kennedys did to live up to that motto was to give their opponents a FAIR hearing. (Perhaps I was spoiled by growing up in a time of such great men as JFK and his pal Goldwater!) However, as you vividly emphasize in this post, this ethos has suffered hugely this year. <br><br>Part of giving others a fair hearing involves restraint from the urge to straw-man, rather than faithfully represent, the views of one’s opponents. A particularly egregious instance of this was the Media’s charge that Trump had called (all) Mexicans rapists, when a fair reading of his (rather famous) actual words about them belies that caricature. (This is similar to the degenerate hatchet job on Gore’s supposed words about “inventing the internet”.)<br><br>And part of this urge to straw-man stems from isolation in ideological or social echo chambers, where those trying to correct the record on the words etc., of Gore or Trump, are intimidated (into silence or withdrawal), e.g. via the sorts of diatribes which you so vividly decry. It’s the Media’s job to correct such misinformation, but, starting (?) with the hatchet job on Carter’s “malaise” speech, the Media has been increasingly MIA. <br><br>As long as the Media gives many of those practicing these demagogic tactics free passes, I fear that debate in this land will continue to deteriorate. We once had folks like Irv Kupcinent and Bill Buckley, who tried to mind the store in this regard, but they got replaced by smarty-pantses like Tim Russert, Rush Limbaugh, and Rachel Maddow.

Just today, I learned that a Muslim woman was assaulted and robbed of her hijab at my alma mater university by a group of men in white Trump hats. A friend related that her elementary age schoolchild, who is multiracial, was bullied by another child and told that she was going to be deported. I’ve seen many more such events related on social media and in the news. Obviously bad actors aren’t limited to just one side of the political spectrum, as demonstrated by riots breaking out at some anti-Trump rallies in California and other places, and certainly not all Trump supporters are violent prone white nationalists, but his campaign does seem to have emboldened them. Unlike many on the left, I’ve watched many of his rally speeches online, where his demeanor, cadence, and subtext is a bit too much like a few 1930’s style dictators for my taste. <br>And even here, reader Trippticket says:<br>“Notice how the arc of blue counties in the southeastern U.S. follows the fall line, the geographic transition from piedmont to coastal plain around the South. What? Why? Why would that occur? Seems odd, doesn't it? Could it be some sort of common mineral deficiency or something?? ;o) oink, oink!”<br>Maybe trippticket can comment as to what he meant by “common mineral deficiency…;) oink oink”, but a good knowledge of geohistory tells us why those counties went blue: that transition from piedmont to coastal plain has some of the best soils for growing cotton, and thus was the place where lots of African slaves were imported to grow it for their white masters. Their descendants still live there and vote blue from a loyalty to the party that helped deliver ensure their right to vote in the 1960’s.<br><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c1400155490650902862 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 12:12 PM</a><br><br>

Several people have thanked me for sharing my thoughts on the widespread appeal and positive potential of a Donald Trump presidency, saying it helped them and is helping them to think more for themselves and with more complexity and to be more calm and less filled with fear. Living in Massachusetts, speaking somewhat openly about this sort of thing has filled me with no small amount of anxiety of reprisals, but doing what I can to help maintain political legitimacy seems well worth the risk at this point. <br><br>I wonder if it has occurred to others that political legitimacy is a shared commons? Watching the debates, and listening to people speak of their hated candidate I was filled with a sense of foreboding; if everyone seeks to delegitimize the other, than the results are a delegitimized political process. This is a tragedy of the commons. I doubt very many people who engage in this behavior truly want the sort of future that they feed by trying to taking the initiative to demonize the other.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c6201932582527844386 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 12:38 PM</a><br><br>

Obama very clearly promised opposition to the Iraq War and the Wolfowitz Doctrine in the Middle East. I saw him speak live about this, and watched him talk about it in countless debates. These policies were nearly 100% under his authority as CiC, he didn't have to get congressional authority or anything. Yet, except for the late term deal with Iran, all he did was double down on neoconservative tactics, as you yourself have pointed out on this blog.<br><br>This left a sour taste in my mouth for politics. Since then, I feel like my first priority is to figure out how much each candidate can be trusted at all to even try to implement their promises in office. Thus, character evaluation must play a part. In this election, I felt like Trump both had more character and policies more compatible with my politics (with major caveat being climate change), so it was an easy decision. <br><br>Hope to hear your opinion on this.<br><br><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c8355631564660779415 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 12:52 PM</a><br><br>

Your analysis of why he would win was very powerful and influenced and sharpened my own analysis on why the Donald could go all the way to the White House.<br><br>I have been a little surprised about how limited the reaction has been to a Trump victory. Most people seem to have taken it, in the UK, in their stride. Maybe Brexit has already used up the capital of emotional hysteria among the Brits or just maybe the average voter is a bit more clued up than our elites.<br><br>One thing that did cross my mind is what I call the "orphaned generation", the 18-25 year olds who were brought up under Abundant Industrialism but their early adulthood has been shaped by the Great Recession and the emerging era of Scarcity Industrialism. <br><br>This cohort, the first to be raised in the era of "progressive" politically correct identity politics, seems unable to cope with the emergence of a post-liberal politics. Their response seems to be bitterness, anger and a strange kind of nihilism. <br><br>Will this generation be forever orphaned... unable to adapt to the reality of late industrial civilization in decline? <br><br>Out of interest, in my summer post "winter is coming" I noted that the likely election of Donald Trump would herald the start of the era of Scarcity Industrialism.

Well, this week's post looks as though it's going to be a contender for most comments, just as last week's is a contender for highest all-time readership -- and I have some commitments over the next few days that won't give me time to respond to every comment in the usual way. Thus I'd like to thank everyone who's commented so far, but will be responding only to direct questions and a few other comments that, to my mind, really do call for a response. <br><br>Ducky, go compare the change in the rate of permanent unemployment with the change in the working age population from 2000 to today. That'll show you just how jobless the "recovery" has been. <br><br>Llmaiwi, sure thing. There are three basic rules for staying out of the self-reinforcing groupthink of our time: <br><br>1. <i><b>Get rid of your television</b></i>. This is the most important step of all, because television makes you stupid. I mean that quite seriously; the "plug-in drug" puts you in an alpha state, turning off your critical faculties, and then fills your head with a torrent of mind-numbing imagery. The sooner you get rid of it, the sooner your capacity for clear thinking will return. <br><br>2. At least once a month, read a book that was written before you were born. This helps break you out of the unexamined presuppositions of the present. <br><br>3. Schedule time every day for solitary, silent thinking. You can call that "meditation" if you want to, so long as you're using your mind, not turning it off. Have mind food handy -- books and other resources, that is, that give you interesting things to think about, and then think about them. <br><br>There are other things you can do, but those three are the basics. Give 'em a try. <br><br>Brett, I think it's an either-or situation. Either we begin moving deliberately toward a renewal of federalism, or the centrifugal stresses at work in this country will tear it apart, with or without benefit of civil war. <br><br>Amy, you certainly may quote me on that! <br><br>Revere, yesterday was an ordinary day here. I think a lot of people are glad that Trump won but they want to see whether he'll actually make a difference. <br><br>KL Cooke, only the ones I use to brew my morning cuppa. The tools I use for forecasting are a close study of historical parallels and a location outside the bicoastal bubble of affluence.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c4444285984342514192 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 1:30 PM</a><br><br>

For although a lot of women voted for DT, there are also many, many thousands of women (and possibly some men too) for whom the election of a man like DT to the highest position of authority in the land has inevitably triggered a deep, visceral pain that goes way beyond shock and disappointment. These are the people - and they are legion - who have been sexually abused by male authority figures and, as a result, carry ancient emotional wounds, often from childhood. As a psychotherapist (long since retired) I have counselled many abused women and I know how easily such painful memories can be triggered and how easily those old wounds can bleed again. Not only that, but millions of women still carry a race memory of abuse by male authority figures from way back in the burning times. <br><br>So it is not just the 'glass ceiling' issue that makes Hillary's failure so painful for so many women. This other, darker layer of pain should not go without a mention. There are thousands who spent yesterday in floods of tears. And have spent a lot of today processing it all with their friends. Tomorrow, maybe, they will read your column, and others like it, that will help to return them to a calm rationality. And, in time, on hopes, to constructive action.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c2719947183853441105 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 2:31 PM</a><br><br>

That was the best response to the election that I have read so far. You were right about the underestimation of the working class dissatisfaction with politics as usual. And your admonitions are right on track: stop arguing about personalties and motives to instead focus on policies and actions, and get the federal government out of telling people how to live. <br><br>The problem of course is that people don't do a very good job of figuring out how to live on their own, and (as you have written about over the past few years) many of the traditional networks (churches, extended family, neighbors, fraternal organizations, etc) that helped guide people about how to live have become very weak. Liberty is really quite a bad thing without a strong culture that helps you make many key decisions. Humans just are not smart enough to go it alone.<br><br> Return of control of policies like welfare and abortion to state control might be a step forward. It also produces complexities and inefficiencies and it allows injustice like Jim Crow laws to remain longer than they would otherwise.

Will it work? Good question; I hope so. <br><br>Blue Sun, good question. Does anyone know if actual telegraphy is involved here? <br><br>Patricia, thank you, but I don't sell my own books -- I'd have to have a business license and jump through a whole series of hoops. You might go to the links on the right side of the blog and see which publishers ship overseas. <br><br>Zach, you might try <a href=http://www.npr.org/2016/11/09/501451368/here-is-what-donald-trump-wants-to-do-in-his-first-100-days rel=nofollow>this link</a> for a summary of the specifics. <br><br>Bryan, if he's reading this blog, he's kept quiet about that -- but I understand it's fairly common these days for reporters to "borrow" ideas from the blogosphere and present them as their own. Ah, journalistic ethics...<br><br>Peakfuture, a lot of people on the left as well as the right are in love with power. They want to make everyone in the world follow their ideas of how people ought to behave. That's the thing that has to be let go of. <br><br>Unknown, understood, and I hope that the Democrats learn the obvious lesson of this defeat and come back in 2020 with somebody who's actually electable, not to mention less of a clone of George W. Bush when it comes to policy stances. I'd be delighted to cast a vote for Tulsi Gabbard, say, or Tammy Duckworth, to name only two of the rising stars in the Democratic firmament. For me, though, and also for the tens of millions of American women who cast their vote for Donald Trump or simply sat the election out, Hillary Clinton's gender didn't outweigh her loyalty to an intolerable status quo. <br><br>Guilherme, those are among the issues that will have to be worked out in the process of a renewal of federalism -- and please note that I'm not proposing to pass all powers to the states! The 14th Amendment to the Constitution, for example, gives Congress the right to pass laws governing voting rights, so that's in the federal bailiwick. <br><br>Drhooves, not at all. It's entirely possible that Trump himself will turn out to be the divisive and transformative figure who kickstarts the next major realignment of the US, and the shape of that realignment need not be in the direction of increased centralization of power in Washington bureaucracies -- quite the contrary, since those bureaucracies are Trump's natural enemy right now. Still, we'll see. <br><br>Mario, "race" is a very blunt instrument to make sense of today's fractured US. According to the statistics I saw, roughly a third of Hispanic men and around a quarter of Hispanic women voted for Trump, so it's hardly accurate to split things up on a simplistic white/nonwhite basis. Different ethnic communities in the US have different interests, and voted on those interests -- but I'd point to those predominantly working class demographics in the upper Midwest who voted for Obama in 2008 but for Trump in 2016 as evidence for my thesis that the destruction of the working class is a major issue here.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c8563678520586172541 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 6:05 PM</a><br><br>

You can call me a downwardly mobile wage class worker who only ever joined the salary class twice in my entire life. Most of my working life has been in the so-called "precariat" class. And yes, all this even with a BA. Got the degree but the salary job disappeared when the corporation I was with got bought out and "right-sized" (this happened to me more than a few times in several other corporations). <br><br><br>In Texas there is strong pressure for corporations to prefer temp workers like me over permanent ones because temp workers are exempt (usually) from receiving unemployment benefits. The IT industry in this city is filled not only with H1 B1 foreigners but when they are actual U.S. citizens the corporations often prefer "professional temps". Not all U.S. IT workers are temps of course but a non-trivial number in Texas definitely are. There's just too many federal and state laws that favor these types of employment instead of old fashioned full time employees from my parents and grandparents generation. <br><br><br>I checked out the county by county voting map of Texas. In Texas the primary cities (all of which have a lock grip on wealth) all went blue (Democrat). My metroplex - DFW went blue. EVERYTHING else in the state that was not one of these wealthy cities slam-dunked Red (Republican). Even cities that were not one of these 5 wealthy ones voted red. The county voting map doesn't lie. Where ever there was concentration of wealth it voted Blue. Where ever there was ever increasing decline and poverty it voted Red. <br><br><br>Foreign readers should check out a county by county map of Texas' voting then imagine that same thing happening across the whole continent to get a better sense of what the other night's vote meant.<br><br><br>*****Extra! Extra! Read All About it!*******<br><br><br>factoid No. 1: <br>According to census data as of 2010, 7 in 10 DFW residents moved here within the last 15 years. That comports with my own anecdotal experience. Whenever I meet new people only once in a blue moon do they say they were born and raised here like me. Even my BF is not from here. He's from upstate NY but came here because he was tired of our long-distance relationship and DFW has IT jobs whereas Upstate NY is starved for them.<br><br><br>Factoid no. 2. <br>As of 2016 Dallas proper (not including the surrounding suburbs which have a similar story to tell) now has 60 homeless tent cities each averaging 300 - 400 *families* a piece. Texas is in the top 5 wealthiest states in the nation according to federal government rankings but is 49th when it comes to social safety net benefits. <br><br><br>Factoid no. 3: <br>According to some government statistics 78% of the so-called "recovery" since the 2008 Derivatives and Sub-Prime Mortgage Debacle went to just 20 counties nation-wide (Dallas and Houston were among them according to the report). Just 20 counties across the entire U.S.A. saw a rebound worth being called a rebound. All other counties were either stagnant (if they were lucky) or actually in on-going decline (if unlucky). Yes, you read that right - ALL other counties in the U.S. are stagnant or in on-going decline.<br><br><br>I wish I could find the link where I read that. Readers may take it with a grain of salt obviously since I'm unable to find that report anymore but for me - when I read it originally I sat back stunned. It was like..."wow, just wow...JMG is right. If this report is correct then this country is much closer to insurgency explosion than even I thought. And I was already convinced because I've been reading him since 2010 and see much of what he talks about around me every day."<br><br><br>I think the old Chinese curse is coming true.

This does seem to be one of those ultra-pivotal 1860/1932 type elections. I wonder how much Trump is aware of this. Obama does appear to be following in Herbert Hoover footsteps. You pointed out that that some of the economic policies carried out early in Obama’s tenure were basically updates of what Hoover tried. So could Trump be thinking of himself as the next FDR? Could his ego be telling him that he cannot be just some run of the mill President, but one of the Greats? Actually, I kind of hope so. He has the opportunity – although so did Obama who didn’t take it. However, it’s ultra-early but so far what I see isn’t inspiring. He will try to kill Dobb-Frank, but is the re-installment of Glass Steagall in the works? From what his economic advisor team appears to be, I’m not holding my breath.<br><br>And, of course, even if that is what he is going for, there is that very slight issue that the resources that enable FDR to accomplish what he did have been burned up, washed out to sea or otherwise used up. Ilargi is right; America is the Poisoned Chalice for the next President.

Only because of a 200 year old strange and weird idea of an Electorial College can a person win the election, but not win the office. There is a movement going on now called the National Popular Vote Compact in which states pass a law saying that their Electors must vote with and for the majority vote. 11 states have passed this so far. If the states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Ohio had passed this law, Hillary Clinton would now be President-elect.

This is why all of us, on all sides of the political landscape, need to get past the politics of demonization and stop insisting that all evil belongs to the other side...<br><br>Avery, fascinating. That would make a lot of sense. <br><br>Ron, "the establishment" isn't a unified thing. It's a loose aggregation of competing power centers aligned in loose alliances, all scrabbling for more wealth and power at one another's expense. Trump assembled one such alliance to displace another, which has been sitting at the top of the heap since 2001. If you read any good book on the internal politics of a baboon troop, you'll understand more about the power politics of Washington DC than you ever will from any other source! <br><br>Sleisz Ádám, I'll be addressing that in an upcoming post. The short form is that Spengler focused on the overall governance of societies, and to my mind paid too little attention to what happens closer to the ground.

I'm not sure that counts as a prediction of a Trump win, since <a href=../../2015/08/the-suicide-of-american-left.html rel=nofollow>the post in question</a> predicts that Clinton will lose but doesn't actually say that Trump will win.

Whether it fell this way or the other, your insights into the mechanisms at play during this election were on point. And I thank you for sharing them with us so that we could view the past months' events with open eyes.<br><br>An interesting anecdote of the last week. After Sunday, when the FBI cleared Clinton and she was supposed to win, there were posts on several of the more right boards I follow about which country folks were thinking of moving to when Hillary won. As I am sure you heard, the night of the election the Canadian immigration website crashed due to the traffic load. LOL, it would seem that both sides have much the same thoughts on how bad the opposing candidate is. Mostly, it is really telling about the depth of the divisions in the country.<br><br>Thinking ahead to what Trump will be able to accomplish I think it will fall far short of his promises (what candidate doesn't), but he will get some major changes through congress. ObamaCare will be repealed, and to some extent he will relax clean air rules and allow more coal and oil burning (although how much will have to be seen, since once a plant is converted to NG, converting it back makes little sense unless coal is being virtually given away). The solar/alternative energy sector will go into a tail spin as he limits and allows to expire rebates and incentives. Repealing NAFTA and the other trade agreements will flop IMO, since the majority of the Republicans in congress are not on his side on this, they are pro "free trade". Similarly nogo with the wall on the southern border, although increased funding for immigration control is likely.<br><br>I have to say that I never really believed the line on how Donald was so much better than Hillary in keeping us out of WW3. The neocons, for all they have done in the last 40 years, are if one thing very aware of not wanting to get in over their heads (not that they were in the past always, but they have been humbled). That is why Obama always skirts around direct troop involvement. Donald appears to have a less confrontational approach, but IMO is more likely to be manipulated into something (the classic move would be for Russia to manipulate the US to go to war with China, leaving Russia out of it to pick up the pieces, or China to do the same with the US and Russia). Neither is out of the question, given enough planning and clever minds on the wrong side. <br><br>But we will have to see about all this. It will be an interesting few years...<br><br>All in all, I suspect Trump's legacy will be in worsening CO2 and methane emissions at a most critical point in climate change. All of the other stuff (even a war or two) will not be significant down the road (as much as it may effect those of us living through it). <br><br><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c2265352151687889492 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 8:30 PM</a><br><br>

The point I was trying to make is that this exists alongside many other divisions. Consider the sharp differences we've discussed between our respective regions -- both poor corners of the shallow South, and yet the cultural and political differences are not small. Moving here from the Pacific Northwest felt very much like moving to another country! <br><br>ThisOldMan, I've discussed this, and climate change generally, many times in this blog. The Democrats under Clinton and Obama have talked the talk about climate change but they have done nothing to actually decrease the rate at which greenhouse gas pollution is <i>increasing</i> year over year. Hillary Clinton's policies were simply more of the same. Trump is the same thing without the green rhetoric. Since there was no effective difference between the two, I'll be discussing climate change again in a later post not linked to the election. <br><br>James, yep. For what it's worth, it's on both sides of the aisle. <br><br>Caryn, I do indeed disagree with you. I have, of course, a very different take on the timing and trajectory of collapse; I'd argue that we're already collapsing, and that a lot of the dissolution of old bigotries we're seeing these days is a normal part of the disintegration of established hierarchies that normally accompanies collapse. More on this in an upcoming post! <br><br>Steve, thank you! <br><br>Ric, the United States is effectively bankrupt; it can print money to cover the short-term shortfalls, but the national debt is never going to be paid and there are trillions of dollars of corporate and personal debt that will never be paid either. If Trump can use his experience with bankruptcy to get America through the necessary reorganization, that might just be a good thing...<br><br>SOF, I've written at great length about anthropogenic climate change on this blog and in my books. This post is about politics, not climatology. <br><br>Revere, the destruction of the biosphere has proceeded unhindered under Obama, despite a certain amount of green tokenism. That'll stop, as <i>The Limits to Growth</i> demonstrated, when the costs of growth rise faster than the profits and bring the economy to its knees. Mind you, we may not be that far from that...<br><br>Ray, that's promising; now that the Democratic Party apparatchiks have been utterly discredited, I think it's quite possible that something constructive could come out of it. Yes, I've also been watching Tulsi Gabbard, also Tammy Duckworth, who just beat the stuffing out of a GOP incumbent to take Obama's former Senate seat in Illinois -- another mixed-race combat veteran, and a first-rate campaigner who can fire up a crowd and pound the bejesus out of her opponents. I could see either or both of them going very far indeed.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c5293703352464752930 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 8:36 PM</a><br><br>

Assessing a candidate's track record and likelihood of keeping promises, though, is worlds away from insisting that your candidate is perfect and the other candidate is evil incarnate, which is of course what I was talking about. <br><br>Lordberia3, my take is that the transition from abundance industrialism to scarcity industrialism is a gradual one, and proceeds at different rates in different places. In the US, it began around 1974, and took a big jump forward after 2008. Here in the north central Appalachians, we're already in it, while the affluent coastal regions are still in abundance industrialism. That said, depending on what he does, Trump could certainly accelerate the process. <br><br>Unknown Justin, welcome to the Omphaloskeptic Order of Prophetic Seers (note the acronym: OOPS) which is hereby founded to include all those who predicted this election's outcome in advance. ;-)<br><br>Elderwoman, did the women you mention have the same reaction when Bill Clinton was elected President? He has exactly the same reputation as Trump, you know. <br><br>Rapier, corporations become dominant during eras of relative peace, open borders, and free trade.

As government withdraws, I expect to see such things resurgent -- and it's worth noting, by the way, that some lodge organizations are already seeing a growth in membership for the first time in decades, as it becomes clear to Millennials that they've been left twisting in the wind by society. So I think it may work out better than you expect. <br><br>Doctor W., we'll see. I think it's quite possible that Trump will turn into the sort of pivotal figure who catalyzes a major change in US politics; certainly he's being vilified just as fiercely as the last two examples of the species were! But it's always possible that the change in question will be the collapse of the Union, with or without civil war...<br><br>Unknown Aaron, I'll consider a post on that as we proceed. <br><br>Rputnam, I'm going to propose a constitutional amendment, one of several, which will address that issue.

As always, it gives great fodder for thought that will help move us all beyond this traveling circus of an election. There was a very good question posted by one of your readers here in the comments page that I would very much like to hear your response to. I feel like you glossed over this issue in your post. The question is in regard to a real difference in the rhetoric of HRC and Trump when it comes to minorities, immigrants, and protesters at rallies.<br><br>"Jordan said...<br><br>Long time reader of your blog, I always appreciate your wide perspective and historical insight on matters of the day. That being said, I think you're off the mark on this one. I will grant that people voting for Trump have been thrown under the bus for the last 40 years. They can't find jobs or economic opportunities because of immigrants, outsourcing, automation, neoliberalism in whatever form. I get it, I really do. They have needs that aren't being met and that could be met and should be met. But along with those unmet needs breeds fear and hatred of the "other" that have taken those things from them. And what Donald Trump's personality does is legitimize those feelings. "Hey, if he's saying it, it must be ok." People will rally around a charismatic leader, you know this. People rallied around Churchill when he called for shared sacrifice. People rallied around Hitler when he told them the Jews were responsible for their discontent. And people rally around Trump when he says it's ok to blame Muslims, Mexicans, and women for their problems. That's why his personality matters. You keep insisting that it's only the policies that matter, all that other stuff is irrelevant. Tell me this, how hard do you have to look to see that Trump will not actually give his supporters what they need in terms of economic opportunity? I know, I KNOW that it will not be different with Clinton. More of the same, I get it. But Trump has been hobnobbing with political insiders for decades. The man comes from more privilege than most of us can imagine. He has no idea, none, what it's like to live life like one of his "deplorable" supporters. Just today it was announced that he's looking into Rudy Giuliani, Chris Christie, and Newt Gingrich for his cabinet. Honestly, how different are Trumps policies going to be, really? The small chance that he rises to the occasion and actually delivers something different is not worth the hate and the vitriol that we already know come along with it. It feels like cutting off our nose to spite our face."<br><br>I'll just note that you did respond to a similar question by another one of your readers. In that response, you pointed out that there were anti-Trump protesters who were promoting hate and violence too. That answer doesn't apply here because the question is about the behavior (i.e. personality) of the candidate himself, not his supporters. Doesn't personality matter when a candidate says things that are undeniably racist and meant to foment racism and perhaps even violence in his supporters (even if this is just being used as a political tool)? Don't the personalities of our leaders have any effect in shaping the opinions or views of the electorate? Couldn't such talk directly lead to the creation of a political landscape where unjust policies targeting the "other", not to mention outright violence, become more palpable?<br><br>One of many examples:<br>http://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-2016-donald-trump-defends-calling-mexican-immigrants-rapists/<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c5128721295897572147 title="comment permalink">11/10/16, 10:07 PM</a><br><br>

As a UK citizen its always easy to watch from a distance and be amazed by the vitriol that politics in the US seems to create - although as ever we seem just a few short steps behind you. I know you said you didn't want to speculate about what happens next, but I do wonder.<br><br>Many comparisons were made between the Brexit vote here and the rise of Trump. The number of stickers, signs etc endorsing the cause being a better indicator of the result than the polls is one. The other is the view that the result is a rejection of liberal elites, a view espoused loudly by the victors. But in the UK those victors are mostly the products of some of our most elite public schools and/or Oxford University, are drawn from the wealthiest sections of society and as such have had the ear of the powerful for much of their adult lives. Are Trump and his team really any different? While they may reject parts or even much of classical liberalism, they can hardly disown their status as part of the 'elite'(I read this morning that among other establishment figures he's considering for cabinet positions he's looking at an ex Goldman Sachs banker or possibly Jamie Dimon as Treasury Secretary). <br><br>When it comes to delivering for the people who voted for them I wonder if Brexit might provide a clue as to how things may go. The Brexiteers campaigned saying that the UK sent £350 million a week to the EU (a misleading figure because its gross and doesn't count what we get back) and that this money could be spent on the NHS instead (very popular). That apparent promise was quickly dropped and the money not sent to the EU now looks likely to be spent maintaining agricultural subsidies that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest landowners and possibly paying the EU in order to maintain passporting rights for the financial sector - plus ca change. Of Trump's policy promises my guess is that it's his massive tax cut (that will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest) that he'll implement first and with greatest success. Well if the rich getting richer was really going to benefit ordinary people you'd think we'd have some evidence of that by now. Apparently this tax cut will stimulate investment, but I suspect that will simply provide a feeding frenzy on Wall St. rather than a resurgence on Main St. Should he fail to deliver on many of his other promises how will the American people respond? I've seen you use the term "strip-mining idealism". That seems like a dangerous game but strip-mining anger seems more volatile.<br><br>Whatever one's political leanings its hard not to feel a little glee when the political establishment gets a kick in the teeth. However it seems to me that these inflection points take decades to bear fruit. Nafta, TTIP, the offshoring of jobs and rising inequality were simply the logical conclusions of the neo-liberal turn instigated by Reagan and Thatcher almost 40 years ago; With hindsight its easy to see the second world war as the logical outcome of the Treaty of Versailles (which was much praised at the time). Now we seem to be at another inflection point: we have Brexit and Trump and I expect nationalist parties to come to power in France and Austria in the next few years - that wave is growing in power and confidence. I wonder what fruit our current inflection point will bear in 20 or 30 years time?<br><br>As an outsider the greatest tragedy of this election seemed to be that the Democratic party rigged it's primary race to keep Bernie Sanders off the ticket. He has a far better record than Trump of opposing (as opposed to profiting from) the machinations of the neo-liberal elite. Viewed from afar he seemed like the candidate with the strongest ethical core. More importantly for me he had a plan to tackle climate change as part of his wider platform. <br><br><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c7733990507613325106 title="comment permalink">11/11/16, 1:34 AM</a><br><br>

Once such behaviour becomes tolarated by political elites, the society starts to get more and more immersed in intolerance and callousness. There are good expamples of this from the history of Europe in 20th century as well as from the rise of populist right wing of these days.<br><br>I don't think either that the vote of the American people can be actually justified in terms of rational thinking even of the basic form that is depicted in this blog. After all, it has been well documented that people simply do not act rationally and that they are easily manipulated (by the way, this is a very nice article on a related topic: http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/why-were-living-in-the-age-of-fear-w443554). I simply cannot see what they could expected from Trump, although I agree that the present state of affairs is quite terrible.<br><br>I can see this also on the example of my compatriots from the Czech Republic who practically cannot complain of declining stantards of living or security or whatever. Since 1989, we have had a tremendous rise in these standards, in real wages, we have 5% unemployment rate, we have free health care and a robust system of public services, we are now amongth the most secure countries in the world, and we have very few immigrants. Despite of this, you can see the same right-wing populist psychosis as anywhere else, all that talk about the evil EU, NATO, corrupted traitorous "pseudoelites" (which involve also poor university teachers, unemployed enviromental activists, or whoever who is not willing to abandon liberal values), and you can feel the completely irrational hate rising everywhere - pure hate and intolerance to any kind of minority. <br><br>It must be really for a large part because we are living in the post-factual world where objective data and information are of less value than emotion and animal instinct, and also because for many politians it is extremely useful to incite these moods of the crowd and then to channel them in support of their aganda and personal power.<br><br>It has been stressed in this blog repeatedly that not every change must lead to something better, and it has been discussed quite recently that gradual prudent reform may be better than "revolution" - but this step into the void is precisely that - how could people, oh my god, have come to the conclusion that Trump could help them with their problems? Someone proposing partially policies that go right against the interests of the poorest and partially having no realistic ideas how to keep his promises? And, for a large part, having no real ideas at all?<br><br>It is not accidental that Trump's victory has been appreciated by European far right, celebrated by Russian (real!) neo-nazis, welcomed by Russia's and China's regimes both shifting right now from authoritarian to totalitarian.

I know it may be a bit different in the USA, but still - here, a vast majority of the liberals I have ever met are not affluent all, on the contrary. All those people who still believe that anything is better than authoritarian rule of hatemongers and who still support the basic ideas of the Englightenment and of the emancipation story, who engage in enviromental protection, who are oftern various volunteers, who are simply the basis of civic society here, have never been affluent. Traditionally underpaid teachers, precariat journalists, more generally cognitariat, educated but badly paid or unemployed people. But still, they hold to these values and institutions, as they can see that there is there is no good in the return of conservative authoritarian rule - not that is not good for the "affluent liberal elites", but that it is not good precisely for common people withouth money and power.

A truly effective politician has to say the right things AND mean it. <br><br>Voters were looking for two things in this election - the repudiation of the current status quo w/ respect to trade and immigration and honesty/authenticity. Clinton offered neither so her loss makes sense. Trump offered a big break from business as usual and I do like some of those ideas. He was smart to see that the media and establishment politicians were both seen as inauthentic and dishonest and the smartest way to establish his own authenticity was to get attacked by them. You said as much in your essay on the politics of resentment. However, during the last debate I watched him deny saying several things of which there is video record. This is clearly dishonest. Time will tell whether this was part of the act he needed to perform in order to fool the usual gatekeepers of power or part of his personality. <br><br>Sanders was an interesting addition to this election. His policy proposals were pretty consistently far left, antiglobalization but still pro-immigration. He only had half the recipe, but he also seemed to be very authentic and had a voting record that was consistent. I supported him ardently not because he offered everything I was looking for but because enough of his policies did sound right AND because I believed he would try to make good on what he said. <br><br>The ultimate distinction regarding personality/character of candidates that crystallized for me during this election was that the desire for power exists on a spectrum. Towards one end there are people who believe they are the best and most important and seek confirmation of that fact by getting voted to the most powerful position in government. Towards the other are people who believe their cause is the most important and seek the power of office to help them help their cause. In the future I will look for a candidate that shows evidence they seek to be a good steward of their office and the power that it temporarily bestows.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c8748572213598032828 title="comment permalink">11/11/16, 6:21 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c6159823622127140068></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/14967468853039843329 rel=nofollow>Herbert Pagg</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>A few comments and observations on this elections and where we are heading, for what it is worth:<br><br><br>As for the urban-rural divide; what hasn't been mentioned is the fact that many "left-wing issues"-ballot measures passed even in "red states" (mass transit proposals in Atlanta and Indianapolis, higher min-wage in Arizona and South Dakota etc). These results implicate to me that when it comes to issues of interest, the "left-wing liberals in the Dem" do have viable proposals among a majority in many places (but for many other reasons they'll never capture the majority of seats in most state houses). <br><br><br>With HRC nothing would've been done as the congress would still be split (the Dems never had a viable chance of capturing the House of Rep. ). For the first time in years, the legislative process can work as designed under the constitution (even if there'll be some terrible laws that pass). This fact alone gives the political system a chance to breathe and maybe even think ahead.<br><br>As for devolving powers from federal level down, Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts basicaly argued for this in the ACA decision:<br>http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf<br><br>"State sovereignty is not just an end in itself: Rather, federalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power.” New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 181 (1992). Because the police power is controlled by 50 different States instead of one national sovereign, the facets of governing that touch on citizens’ daily lives are normally administered by smaller governments closer to the governed. The Framers thus ensured that powers which “in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people” were held by governments more local and more accountable than a distant federal bureaucracy.[...] This case concerns two powers that the Constitution does grant the Federal Government, but which must be read carefully to avoid creating a general federal authority akin to the police power."<br> <br>Under the decision, Roberts held that the federal government could decide to not increase Medicaid funding for states that did not expand Medicaid. That is like a contract – take our money, accept our rules. But it could not take away existing Medicaid money from the states that did not expand Medicaid. That is more like telling the states what to do. Hopefully more people will consider this in earnest.<br><br><br>Kind of bizarre that in the year 2016 you could still run a campaign based on "vote for me as a X because I am a X!". Next year I expect these people to endorse Marine le Pen in France's presidential election (she's a woman! And women should always support and look out for each other, you know?).<br><br><br>Lastly, an important part of the problem in the rust belts is that free trade and deregulated and effective capital markets have made it easy for politicians to pursue policies of de-industrialization. The policies has often been dressed up as "environment friendly" and so on, while in reality they have only served to move production or extraction to China, Mexico or hundreds of other places. The effects of the process have been largely invisble in the large metropolitan centers, because the policies have in no way affected consumption. In fact, they have worked quite the other way around, as prices have fallen and benefited city consumers. This is why you can get elected on a "non-environmental friendly" platform in "the red states". The environmental groups have never analyzed these policies seriously but all too often resorted to blame games ("They don't understand their own good!") and being taken hostages by those who talk the talk (DNC).<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c6159823622127140068 title="comment permalink">11/11/16, 7:44 AM</a><br><br>

Bragging about this is like bragging that you bet on the right horse in the race when the other horse was in the lead and had an aneurysm 50 feet from the finish. If you have an interest in how power actually works in this this country, please read the Podesta emails. You will learn that the Trump phenomenon was fostered by the Clinton team and the DNC as part of a strategy to win the election by using their immense power in the media to create a Republican candidate that was extreme and unelectable. <br><br>The Trump phenomena did *seem* to gain a life of its own, but everything was going according to plan and Clinton was set to coast to a relatively easy victory until the leaked emails gave voters enough of a sense that she was a dangerous and manipulative psychopath to shy away from voting for her. Few have looked into the emails, and the media white wash/black out is truly a conspiracy theory come true right in front of our faces, but without the disclosure of the emails Hillary would have won. <br><br>Though we know—again, from the emails—that the democrats have ways of massaging the polls to show a lead that isn't there, she was still pretty far out ahead, farther out ahead than they can fake. Also, even with the revelation of massive election fraud, treason, media manipulation, bribery, and corruption...she still almost won. That's almost the biggest news to me...she still almost won. For anyone who has spent some time with the emails, this is a chilling fact indeed and cause to question the entire project of democracy. God knows what would have happened if she actually was elected. <br><br>Incidentally, we also know from the emails that Clinton and the DNC also killed the Sanders campaign from the top down and if he was competing on a level playing field he would have won the nomination and then probably won a landslide against Trump. I haven't gotten much love from my liberal friends in pointing out that the Clinton and the DNC, with their media allies, created the Trump phenomena, buried Bernie's run, and then handed the election to Trump by being sloppy and careless with a gigantic record of her crimes. I don't know why this is, since I have merely helped them see that there is precisely one person above all that they should be angry at...and that is the person they voted for. And to top it all off, when democratic voters perceived that she had rigged the system against Bernie, she created another mini media blitz to show how they were a bunch of moronic wack-jobs for even thinking such a thing! <br><br>I purposefully will be lazy and not cite my sources. The exciting part about the leaks is that it is true mass journalism: anyone can look at them and search them, and for much of the body of documents this is truly original work, with material that in many cases may not have been read by anyone since they were read by their original recipients. Part of the revelation is going down the rabbit hole yourself...though its not really so much a rabbit hole as an endless sewer. <br><br>Its incredibly ironic, stranger than fiction, and sounds totally insane. but—its turns out that is actually the world we live in. Hillary Clinton pulled all the strings she possibly could...and the result was to get Donald Trump elected when he wouldn't have otherwise had a chance! And now, with Trump's victory, we have for perhaps the first time since LBJ took his oath of office, a truly spontaneous and unplanned event in a presidential election. Turns out the nut-job conspiracy theorists were pretty right all along; turns out that people were crazy for NOT believing that elections and public perception are completely manipulated by a global elite who may or may not be satanic pedophiles (the jury is still out on this one, but its kinda looking bad....)<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c1746426588230664445 title="comment permalink">11/11/16, 9:16 AM</a><br><br>

One incident occurred in a girls’ restroom, where on a hanging piece of paper someone wrote “I Love Trump,” a derogatory comment about people who are gay, and drew three swastikas. In a different girls’ restroom, someone wrote the following graffiti directly onto a toilet paper dispenser: “If Trump wins, watch out!” In a boys’ restroom, two swastikas were drawn directly onto a restroom stall. In addition, a Latina student found that a note had been placed in her backpack telling her to return to Mexico.

So please accept the feedback below as a note from sympathetic reader, trying to remind about the best of your qualities – being able to be an impartial observer drawing on long-time cycles and patterns. <br><br>This is the first time I post here and my reaction is triggered by your last post, as it – surprisingly for me – seemed to be in quite fundamental contradiction with some of your best (and most discussed and shared) essays. <br><br>Your key point from the last post can be summarized as “no worries, nothing serious happened and we can some good stuff" . <br>To illustrate my point, let me quote this:<br><br>“When fascism succeeds in seizing power, in other words, it’s not a right-wing movement, or for that matter a left-wing one. It seizes the abandoned middle ground of politics, takes up the popular causes that all other parties refuse to touch, and imposes a totalitarianism of the center. That’s the secret of fascism’s popularity—and it’s the reason why an outbreak of full-blown fascism is a real and frightening possibility as America stumbles blindly into an unwelcome future. “<br>This is your own words from some time ago and I find it strange you didn’t see it appropriate to use them now. <br><br>Secondly, Trump’s victory is not a defeat of the religious right - he’ll have to work with Republican dominated Congress, as he can expect fiery opposition from Democrats. The first documents posted on his transition website prove this direction, as his transition team - staffed with long-time Washington and K Street folks, from "swamp" he has pledged to drain.<br><br>Further on, you may forget about any voluntary devolution of power under Trump – I live in Europe and had seen Trump predecessors approach to that topic. From Turkey through Hungary to the UK after Brexit, leaders elected on the same wave which brought Trump to power crushed all attempts of self-determination. It’s quite simple - any leader of the nation “great again” cannot let "his" nation get divided, can he?<br><br>Finally (and most importantly), Trump’s policy on climate and energy will go directly against what you hold dear; climate change is currently unstoppable, but I hope you admit that there is quite substantial difference between 2C and 4 or 6C, also in terms of our ability to save the best institutions and inventions worth to pass on to the future “ecotechnic society”. <br><br>Summing up, you’re right that personality does not matter in comparison to policies. But you, JMG, should know better than others that declared policies have nothing to do with real ones, especially at the twilight of the empire. The election campaign circus is not what I’d expect you to take seriously.<br><br>Trump, as someone said, “is the wrong answer to the right question”. Your past analysis and writing was pointing exactly this direction long before Trump himself decided to run. I sincerely hope you can get back to sharing with us your insights on decline of current civilization with clarity not muddled by the current mess in your country. <br>In the turbulent times ahead it will be badly needed. <br><br>Take care,<br>MM<br><br><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c7408950804748155493 title="comment permalink">11/11/16, 1:49 PM</a><br><br>

In the meantime , I read each week's post in a timely manner along with just about every comment (through Sunday). Even though I am a European-Christian-heritage (white) left-coast liberal who wanted Bernie Sanders but Democrats imposed on me Hilarious Rodham Clinton. I voted for Clinton. I was, however, 95% emotionally prepared for Trump to win, thanks to your blog. <br><br>As a female in my early 60s, whose health was permanently ruined by an idiosyncratic reaction to a relatively common prescription drug 35 years' ago, I cannot change the outer trappings of my life. After being "no religion" all my life, due to the info I gleaned from this blog, I came up with a personal blueprint for change, one which I am physically and financially able to implement, fragile as my health is. <br><br>I need to do my bit "making America a great place to live." For a year, I have given a great deal of thought to this, if not exactly in Trump's terms. <br><br>I decided to become Christian (after a long search, Episcopal/Anglican), returning to my Christian-European roots, which Americans en masse abandoned starting around 1970. I plan to go to church weekly, which I already started doing. I plan to learn from elder church ladies who never stopped practicing Christian charity — to follow their lead on what it means to take care of others (at least scratching the surface), changing my intention to being other-centered rather than (the default) self-centered (having never learned anything else thanks to secular, de-Christianized school system of the 1960s). I plan to help those who are local to me. It will be rough road for me. <br><br>This autumn, I have made many personal changes which will help me succeed in helping others who live locally. My plans include INCREASING energy output coming from my home by way of home-cooking (food to give away to those hungry). Increasing one's home's output of energy seems to be universally dumped on here. I apologize for being able to afford to cook for, and donate to, locals who are hungry. It is the best I can muster. I recognize many cannot afford to donate much, but as a (new) Christian, it is my Christian duty to do so, to my ability. Increasing my fuel usage does not make me "different," not better. Our household does what it can to conserve and recycle. I posit that increasing one's household fuel expenditure (electricity, natural gas, heating oil, whatever), if it benefits community, is not bad. <br><br>The following book has eminently helped me through this arduous search and process. It gels beautifully with most everything I read in posts and comments here, not to mention is an easy and fun book: <br><br>"On the Shoulders of Hobbits: The Road to Virtue with Tolkien and Lewis" <br>[J.R.R.

Keeping in mind that the previous odds they gave were 99% Obama on election morning 2008 and 91% Obama in 2012, it actually made one call that was very good: it correctly showed a far higher uncertainty about this election than the two before it. And really, there's nothing more you can do if your model is fed garbage data but spit back the garbage while showing a large amount of uncertainty. Garbage in, garbage with high uncertainty out is even better than the normal garbage in, garbage out.<br><br>In the other corner, we have Sam Wang's model. Even when the election tightened during the last couple of weeks, it kept predicting a &gt;99% chance for Clinton. I took one look at it and saw an extremely narrow variance, with all sorts of huge red flags about model overconfidence. If it were an undergrad stats project about something nonpolitical, it would have flunked, but yet here it was being published by Princeton and taken seriously by liberals everywhere. Some people were even wondering if Nate Silver would be displaced as the election modeling guru by Sam Wang.<br><br>Luckily I didn't believe it for a second, because I know a magic spell against model overconfidence.

The Dem primaires were very lightly attended outside the 2 blue (out of 120 total) counties. Bevin's was elected running almost exclusively on a promise to get rid of gay marriage, and the 118 red counties literally ignored the fact that he also intended to get rid of their health insurance (which he did, cancelling the well received and heavily used Kynect exchange). For good measure he enacted more barriers to prevent them from getting unemployment and food stamps which are, again, heavily used in the rural red counties. In short, they voted to destroy their own financial security JUST because he promised them he would stop gay marriage. It's one reason my son and his partner now live near Minneapolis. There was absolutely no way Gray could win no matter how republican his policies are. All of us could see it clearly but the party officials here live at the top of a very stratified society that has little to no contact with struggling people in rural counties. The 118 counties who consider Kim Davis a local hero are never going to vote for him, unless something huge changes. The backlash was strong enough to hand the entire state govt over to Republicans who had never had such an advantage in nearly a century. This really is a case of bigotry, especially since Gray's policies are essentially republican.

I have had many relationships of people in my life who had been abused before I met them and there was always something I could not connect with them on until they let me know that. It is indeed the worst thing you can do to another human being. However, in Mr. Trump's case (or every powerful male celebrity in America) there is a different factor that may be in play. The groupie. That hanger on who, for whatever reason, wants to be connected. While I do not condone, approve or wish to emulate Mr. Trumps behavior, I offer that the women who were around him may have been 'making themselves available' for his advances, especially after he became rich AND famous. Therefore, while he may be overstepping the bounds of civility, there was a quid pro quo on the table. Again, not justifying, just, as a victim of survivors of actual abuse, wanting to make a distinction between actual abuse and two opportunistic people.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c4846361994868566659 title="comment permalink">11/11/16, 7:41 PM</a><br><br>

And no matter the rational choices I was making, it was (and continues to be) unsafe in many communities to voice that opinion. <br>Mr. Silver, who, though I detest his political stance and overt bias, overcame that and showed himself to be honest on the fact that this election was a 2 point difference with a 12-13 point uncertainty...It is too bad his critics cannot admit that he actually acknowledged people like me who may not have been entirely open about our choices.

I know these soils and the people who tread them well, and I'm hypervigilant about expressions of white nationalism at the moment. It didn't take long after the seating of the nation's first black governor, P.B.S. Pinchback in 1872, until the "White Leagues" (self-described as the paramilitary arm of the Louisiana Democratic party) intimidated black voters, officials, and elected leaders from political life altogether. In 1989 a new constitution was passed, effectively disenfranchising black voters in the state until the end of Jim Crow.

Since I’m not privy to your library/recommended list of books (--Would it be possible to have one on your blog like Daniel Quinn’s with his? http://www.ishmael.org/Education/Readings/ ), if I didn’t know any better, you prophesied Nov. 8 with your seeming ability to use “predictions magic,” if you don’t mind my crude statement (I sometimes read your other blog).<br><br>- 3rd: Your last paragraph in “Reflections on a Democracy in Crisis” reminded me of a passage in a book by Bill Clinton’s history professor about how any achievement happens over time in a communal cooperative effort through competition. Our nation was jumbled together out of many obviously incongruous parts (interests-wise, not geography-wise) through compromise via conventions, negotiation via public discourse, and mutual respect via the “Full Faith and Credit Clause” (Article 4, Section 1). There’s no reason we can’t make a U-turn and return to that compromising road abandoned long ago, whether as what we are now (a united federal republic), or what we once were (a confederation (--or, as imagined by _Retrotopia_, a collection) of sovereign states).<br><br>(In case anyone is wondering about the passage I’m referring to, it’s _Evolution of Civilizations_, pp. 339-40, by Carroll Quigley)<br><br>- 4th: As for the question you posed in Comments as to whether your Aug. 5, 2015 blog post qualifies as a prediction, I believe it is Part 1 of 2. Part 2, your Jan. 20 post, completes the prediction, but Part 1 was a necessary prelude to part 2. Moreover, your question made me want to evaluate Michael Moore’s predictions as well.<br><br>http://www.businessinsider.com/michael-moore-interview-2015-12<br><br>In a Dec. 2015 interview, Moore doesn’t go through a satisfactory analysis as to why Trump will be the Republican nominee. He just seems to have extrapolated, and Trump had secured enough delegates only on May 26. And in this interview, he explicitly states that “there’s just not enough angry white guys anymore over the age of 35 to put Trump in office.”<br><br>http://michaelmoore.com/trumpwillwin/<br><br>I believe Moore posted this after July 20, given his reference to his HBO appearance. I feel that your blog post had room to account for the female Muslim naturalized U.S. citizen “life-long liberal“ Trump supporter cited above, as well as other non-white Trump supporters. Moore’s post did not.<br><br>- 5th: This section is mainly addressed to the other commenters and readers, because I am aware JMG does not watch TV, although I don’t recall if he wrote exactly when he stopped watching TV.

I see an instability of roles as different story tellers push for Trump supports to be classified as persecutors or as victims. Of course either narrative would crush a vast amounts of variance into a very tiny package.<br><br>Specifically the victim game which has been used by the left so intensively in recent years is being, I think, over used to make sense of the rising Trump phenomenon. By pointing out the economic interests which motivated many to vote for Trump, those who are already habituated to thinking in the Victim game are left in the situation of casting the working class or rural class as victims of urban elite persecution; and too many from both sides of this divide seem all to willing to play their parts with gusto. Though it is true that a very large element of Trump's electoral success does come from groups voting in a kind of Hail Mary pass, hoping to break the Washington consensus of ignoring their economic interest, using the victim narrative to explain the popular uprising of support for Trump seems to have stark limits.<br><br>Though the number of people voting for him our motivated by economic survival might very well have put Trump into the oval office, the same thing is true of any category of voter numbering even a fiftieth of his votes. After all it was a close election, and there for each of many motives for voting for Donald can claim credit. That is to say there are many applicable narratives; of which the poor and despite worker is only a voice in the chore. The victim game is key to either of the two dominant versions of the story I sense settling into explaining Trump supporters to his critics, whether the Trump voter is a victim of elites or are persecutor of the vulnerable. <br><br>In Greer's post on the victim narrative he points out that abuse of the narrative is vulnerable to turning into a circular firing square and the different ways of casting the Trump voters go around each other.<br><br>I close with an offer of another partial explanation (again only referring to an aspect of the election) for Trumps rise. A change in belief, I think that Trump's win required lift from voter voting for a crash landing, who no longer believe the story of Progressivism, and are looking for ways to cut out.<br><br><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c6072303761910254629 title="comment permalink">11/12/16, 6:00 AM</a><br><br>

The polls correctly showed a wide range of uncertaintly, more than is typical, and a sharp shift from undecided to Trump in the final weeks. I still think this second thing likely reflected Obamacare rate hikes at least as much as having anything to do with e-mails, but the e-mail story fits the orthodox narrative better, that Clinton's loss was all about overhyped scandal and smear campaigns. <br><br>538 predicted about the same odds for a Cubs win in the worlds series as a Trump win in the election, about 25-30%. A model is not "wrong" when it predicts a priori a probability in that range for an outcome that really happens. It about the same as flipping two coins and having them both come up heads. Try it. It happens all the time. Only a fool would say "the laws probability predicted this would not happen, but it did! They were wrong!"<br><br>Now as for some other models using simplistic and inappropriate methods, whether out of laziness or a desire to skew the results, their predictions were indeed "wrong" and based on bad math. But that is because they actively ignored the demonstrable and well-known ucnertainties in the polls and the polling methods. <br><br>FYI, getting information out of "garbage" is kind of what statistics is all about.

Many of the exact same people who said they were going to go load their muskets if Clinton won are now screaming in outrage about the behavior of anti-Trump protesters. They might not have been organizing marches, but there sure was a whole lot of "He ain't my president" going around in these parts after the November 2008 election, by the same people who are now saying "He won, he is everybody's president, shut the heck up" right now.

You have made me look forward to Wednesdays. I have spent the past few days debating whether to write this as I expect it will just be dismissed as drivel. However, I'm speaking from the heart and not from ideology. I was greatly dismayed by the exultant tone of your last post. I am old. I understand that political rhetoric comes and goes. But the last six months have been different in a way that has shaken me to the core. I have spent my adult life believing that I was free to express my opinions and that sometimes they had value. I now understand that half of the country thinks it's ok to brand me as a c**t if I disagree with them. This isn't a matter of political correctness -- these are words laden with violence and contempt. They are dangerous. They have power. I now understand that my president and half of the country doesn't think that sexual assault is a big deal. Like most women, I have been sexually assaulted, but that doesn't define me and I don't see myself as a victim. More importantly, I don't need to have experienced it myself to have a sense of the pain that women feel when they are told that being violated isn't a big deal. It is a visceral punch in the gut. I'm also Hispanic, but I was born in the US. The thought that people might not consider me a real American has honestly never, ever occurred to me in all of life until this election. In these past few months, I have been told that I'm a Mexican and part of the problem. It's hard to describe the deep sense of fear and dread that arises when you suddenly realize that your fellow citizens see you as the enemy. I'm not immune to the struggles and pain of people who live in other parts of the country. I lost my job during the recession. I was unemployed for a long time and understand that fear and uncertainty (try being a 60 year old woman trying to find a job in a different vocation). I never dreamed I would be in such a precarious financial state in my retirement years, but it has never, ever occurred to me during that time to fix the blame for my circumstances on a group of people I didn't know who just happen to be different from me. Nor has it occurred to me to be bitter and angry about my changed circumstances. I'm just trying to make things better. I'm too old to have any hopes or expectations that any government can or will make things better. I have little regard for any political leaders on any side. However, our current leaders have come to power by encouraging hatred, bigotry and misogyny. Nothing good can come of that. I'm speaking of my experiences here, but I know that many people in the US are experiencing similar feelings because of their ethnicity or religion or whatnot. This is no time for exultation. No need to comment. While I greatly admire your intelligence and vision, I am sad to say that I now expect that comments from you on this subject will only cause more hurt. I wish you well.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c1486499835210227979 title="comment permalink">11/12/16, 7:23 AM</a><br><br>

Let go of the need to be perceived as "intelligent", particularly by the people who seek to dominate and take advantage of you, but also by the masses in general.

Those who go one step beyond and attempt to think their own thoughts without giving up the approval seeking (approval is, after all, the most deeply coveted prize sought by little children inhabiting adult bodies), get stuck in between in a kind of no man's land where they try to no avail to negotiate with the collective stupidity.

The polling data during this election was incredibly volatile and unreliable -- a friend of mine attributes this to "the McGovern Effect", where if the media and other politicians demonize a candidate like Trump on moral grounds, his support doesn't dissappear, instead his supporters lie to the pollsters and deny supporting him... so the input data was garbage, but the campaign kept right on letting ADA schedule rallies that were attended by a half-dozen people, and put ground support into locations that turned out not to matter... apparently this was their ace in the hole and they went right up to Election Day thinking their magic computer would pull a rabbit out of the hat and outsmart Trump and 54 million of his voters. Seems like a story that hits all JMG's points: clueless, out-of-touch, senile elites relying on the Myth of Progress instead of paying attention to the evidence in front of their actual eyes. <a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/09/clintons-data-driven-campaign-relied-heavily-on-an-algorithm-named-ada-what-didnt-she-see/ rel=nofollow>Washington Post</a><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c1341055433462317332 title="comment permalink">11/12/16, 10:36 AM</a><br><br>

On the call, Clinton surrogates who have supported the campaign from the outside for the past 18 months offered their thanks to the Brooklyn-based operatives. The mood was light and supportive, with Podesta and Palmieri expressing gratitude for everyone’s hard work."<br><br>This reveals a rot that goes much deeper than Clinton, her managers, or even the elites in and around the Democratic Party. This is about a ruling class that has lost all sense of responsibility, all sense of ownership, for the nation it rules or aspires to rule. Contrast this sense of reckless, almost wild, removal from the consequences of their actions—this refusal to accept ownership over the world they have created (you can think of that in narrow ways, i.e., the election, or in broader terms, the social disaster of this country)—with the generation that created an international order after World War II. I don't say that in any nostalgic sense: those men were quite willing to destroy much of the more humane and progressive forces around the world. But they sensed that the world, not even simply the nation, was their responsibility. These people today—and this extends from one end of the Democratic Party to the other end of the Republican Party—see themselves and their fate as bearing no relationship to that of the country they govern.

But this hasn't been a normal election. Because one of the candidates, the current president, didn't actually have policy proposals. Let's clarify the point: his policy proposals varied alarmingly with who he was talking with. I think he said about every possible thing you can say about the minimum wage, for example. Throughout, Donald Trump has behaved like a used car salesman: his policy proposals often would be whatever the people listening to him at the time seemed to approve of. <br><br>Some Republicans put together his comments and wrote documents that looked like sound policy proposals, at least from a Republican perspective. But Trump didn't stick to what his own proposals said. He said he believed other countries should take care of their own defense and rely less in the USA. Then the first thing he did as president-elect was talk with a bunch of countries that were anxious at precisely those comments, and reassure them it would be all as usual. To give a simple example.<br><br>I've seen and heard this all before. In gangsters when I lived in a rough neighborhood, and in stories from my family about Franco. Don't talk about Trump as if he was a normal politician, because your assumptions about the guy following his stated policies, or even standard democratic procedure, can prove to be way off the mark.<br><br>We'll see who was right. I did wonder if JMG would be helpful on my magical path when I posted on the other blog. It seems pretty obvious that he won't be.

One friend who identifies as queer wrote a long post about how everyone who voted for Trump "wants to kill me." He shared a something about increased suicide among gay and trans youth immediately after the election. I posted to gently suggest that perhaps if young gays are over reacting in such extreme ways their community elders should calm down the rhetoric. I won't quote myself but basically suggested that if these gay youth believed the next knock on the door would be storm troopers come to drag them to conversion camps the fault was in the adults who told them this. I added a bit of commentary on things that were actually likely to happen and the limitations of a president's actual power. In return I was attacked for being snarky and dismissive. I think I've been 'tone policed', a dread sin in social justice circles. Others seem unable to believe that there was anything wrong with Hillary as a candidate--every thing is right wing lies. It is amazing how prescient the right was in planning for almost 25 years to keep Hillary from becoming president. Maybe we need such far-sighted people in office (insert sarcasm font). I am coming to feel that no sane person would run for the office. <br><br>In very conservative states and nations large cities have often served as de facto free zones. Of course police crackdowns, anti-vice campaigns and so forth disrupt communities of sexual, ethnic or other minorities. And in some times and places such enclaves have been forced to be squalid ghettos. It would be interesting to consider how one might create a legal system that would allow clearly delineated areas to live under different laws than the surrounding countryside without turning the whole country into a crazy quilt of conflicting laws and standards.<br><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c4742991950722046157 title="comment permalink">11/12/16, 3:33 PM</a><br><br>

Based on what I've heard and read, a lot of Berniecrats made the same choice, and I think it was a smart one. Long after Trump's presidency is a memory, the Democratic Party is going to remember what happened the last time it tried to force an unpopular candidate down the throats of its constituencies -- and that will indeed make it the last time, for a good long while. <br><br>Confuseious, as I pointed out back in January, Trump has very carefully crafted his political persona to appeal to those people who feel shut out by the status quo, and one aspect of that persona is his use of language that has been labeled offensive by the Left. That benefited his campaign, because a great many people in America today see the Left's language policing as intrusive and biased. You can see his choice of language as a reflection of personality; I see it, as I noted in that original January post, as the workings of an exceptionally clever man who knows that whipping up the Left into a tizzy will strengthen his position with the voters that matter to him. <br><br>Nestorian, there's a crucial difference between personality and character, and an even bigger difference between personality and the kind of hostile parody I discussed in my post. When Trump voters describe Clinton, and when Clinton voters describe Trump, their descriptions have little to do with the personality of the targets of their respective hatred, and everything to do with that process Jung called "projecting the Shadow." I have no particular reason to think that either Trump or Clinton has any integrity worth mentioning; both have been wallowing for all their lives in the culture of kleptocracy that pervades the upper end of American society today; thus character isn't even an issue here -- and I would still assert that a person of character who supports bad policies, and can be counted on to carry them out, can be a worse choice than a genial scoundrel who seems likely to support good policies, even for the wrong reasons. <br><br>Inohuri, well, in that case by all means cast your vote as you see fit. I think it's really likely we'll see her in a national election before long. <br><br>Lei, affluent liberals may be rare in your country, but they're extremely common here. The upper end of the middle class pretty much dominates the Democratic Party, for example -- which is one of the reasons they lost so much of the working class vote. <br><br>Nicolas, welcome to OOPS!<br><br>Herbert, brilliant! Likewise, I don't recall many people insisting that we all had to vote for Sarah Palin because she's a woman...<br><br>Matt, to my mind that's far too simplistic an explanation for Trump's win. We know from those same Wikileaks email dumps that the reason a great many of the polls showed such high scores for Clinton is that they were deliberately oversampling Democratic voters to try to generate a bandwagon effect. It wasn't "further than they could fake" by a long shot -- as I recall from statistics classes in college, a ten per cent lead is easy if you can pick and choose the demographics of your sample. Mind you, I won't argue that the Clinton campaign basically stole the nomination from Sanders, and may well have helped Trump get started in the hope that he'd be unelectable -- if you've read my novel <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i>, you might remember that a similar gambit blew up in the face of the political establishment in that story -- but the fact that Trump won even though nearly the entire political establishment rallied around Clinton speaks to far more than the effect of a series of leaks that Clinton's followers consistently dismissed as meaningless.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c2474985794820157329 title="comment permalink">11/12/16, 9:10 PM</a><br><br>

Do you remember when Obama was elected in 2008, the entire GOP had a mass histrionic temper tantrum, and the Dems laughed at them and told them to get over it? What goes around, comes around...<br><br>Jerome, I was born in Bremerton but moved to the south Seattle suburbs at the age of eighteen months, and lived there until I went off to college. I don't know that Burien, WA has a habit of producing people like me generally, though. As for Divine, no, not consciously, though I laughed my way through "Pink Flamingos" back in the day!<br><br>M M, obviously I disagree. Trump is a populist, no question, and he's made his reputation as a vulgarian -- I refuse to speculate about the length of his fingers. ;-) I keep on asking people who insist on portraying him as a fascist strongman, though, to show me some evidence that he's any more prone to authoritarianism than Hillary Clinton, and so far, nobody has done so. Do you have any to offer? <br><br>M Smith, I won't argue. I suspect a lot of the histrionics going on now are mostly for show -- again, exactly equivalent to the shrieking and wailing from the Right when Barack Obama won in 2008. I get the impression that at least for the next few decades, every time the White House passes from one party to another, the losing side is going to have an epic meltdown and emote all over the place. No, it's not an edifying spectacle!<br><br>Larz, if you've found your spiritual home, that's excellent news. Thanks for the book reference, btw -- as you know, I'm a major Inklings fan!<br><br>Cherokee, that's an interesting possibility. Peak thaumaturgy, maybe -- if anything, we've been at the bottom of the curve for theurgy for a while now. Maybe once the thaumaturgies fail completely, more people will realize that the work has to start with yourself! <br><br>Zach, no, that's not what I'm saying at all. Under the terms of the 14th amendment, the federal government is in the business of enforcing the equal protection of the laws, and since that amendment was properly ratified, it's the law of the land; nor would I want that repealed. What part of the constitution, though, justifies the Department of Education? What justifies the Unaffordable Care Act? What justifies the hundreds of other federal programs, offices, and departments that enforce, through an assortment of carrots and sticks, a galaxy of federal agendas on the states and the people? To keep the US functioning as a nation, I'm suggesting that those programs, offices, and departments can and should be terminated, and their functions returned to those states that want them. More on this in an upcoming post.<br><br>Grebulocities, brilliant. Your counterspell just won tonight's gold star. <br><br>NomadicBeer, most of the stats that relate to the real economy of goods and services are sliding hard, so I suspect you're right.

I did post one <a href=../../2009/02/deindustrial-reading-list.html rel=nofollow>quite a while back</a>, but at that time the focus of this blog was rather narrower than it's become since that time. <br><br>Hamish, I'm not sure where you found an exultant tone in this week's post; I noted that in fact, I'd called the election correctly, and then went on to talk about two major and ugly problems with, ahem, <i><b>both sides</b></i> of the political landscape and offer some suggestions about how those problems might be dealt with.

I'll definitely want to read that. <br><br>Genepaul, on the other hand, maybe it's just that my views consistently vary from the conventional wisdom, and since disagreeing with the conventional wisdom does generally imply thinking that it's, ahem, wrong, it's often useful for me to draw the distinction between my views and the views I'm disagreeing with.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c2688995872843494169 title="comment permalink">11/12/16, 9:58 PM</a><br><br>

And how do we pick and choose what gets left up to the states? What are we really talking about, here?<br><br>Two of my friends, a same-sex couple, both native here, recently married under a tree in front of the courthouse. Our state would have dragged its feet for years before granting gay people the right to marry. In a states' rights situation, should people have to leave their native towns, homes, families and all their friends in order to enjoy the benefit of something as basic as getting married? <br><br>Change does come here -- when it's forced, people adjust and over a generation or two, it kinda-sorta gets accepted. We have a lot of multiracial families now. Many are the proud grandparents of a biracial child who, ten years prior, would have been dropping the n-word like you and I say "and" or "but." My friends' extended family members would never have voted to legalize gay marriage. Yet they're quite happy, now that the decision has been made for them, to bless the couple -- who married in broad daylight in the presence of any townies who happened to stroll by. <br><br>The real issue comes down to neoliberalism's four-decade ravaging of our economy. If we as a nation were genuinely prosperous with a lot of medium-to-modestly-large businesses, industries, and farms (as opposed to the Borg-cubes of corporations now); and if our children could still expect to get a decent education without going into massive, lifelong debt, then there would be less pushback on many of the social issues, because the fundamentalist religions that stoke intolerance thrive where people have the least satisfaction and the most despair. The problem is not too much federal government interference. The problem is that the Democrats have helped engineer the economic gutting of our country, and said it was good for us when clearly it's not, while simultaneously pressuring conservative people on the social issues.<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c3251634003331304003 title="comment permalink">11/12/16, 11:21 PM</a><br><br>

One of the advantages of being from Latin America is that I've seen my share of anti-establishment presidents (both left and right side). They all have ran their campaigns like Trump's, saying things then denying them. Using a group of people as scapegoats to unite the rest of the vote. After they win they make appeals to national unity and act like your "father/mother" while slowly doing everything they can to silence dissenting voices and making corruption even worse than it already was while those who voted for them begin to realize they are not going see things improve for them. By that point populist figures begin to slowly loose support and they increase the crack down on anything that slightly smells of opposition. Then they crash and burn when an establishment candidate with enough chances uses their own election tactics against them.<br><br><br>Real life example of that story, my own country. In 2003 Nestor Kirchner is elected president. Four years latter his wife (Cristina) wins the presidential race*. By a twist of fate Nestor Kirchner dies one year before the next election, and Cristina is forced to run again. After she wins, because there were no candidates that could defeat her at that moment, she goes mad with power, declaring they were going for everything. On January 2015, an attorney that declared he was going to process Cristina for Treason to the Country is found dead in his home a few days latter. That's the last straw that broke her populist train and all her candidates for the last election end up loosing, even on states were her party always won.<br><br>For some of the things they did:<br><br>- Tried to destroy any media voice that dissented with them, while establishing a party media that only said good things about the government, and attacked everybody else.<br><br>- Aligned our country with the worst dictators in the World (Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, the Theocracy of Iran, North Korea).<br><br>- Stole public money to fill their pockets in a way never seen before in this country. They were so pathetically inept at hiding their tracks that she and her cabinet might become the first ex-president condemned for corruption. They didn't try harder because their belief was that they were going to die of old age with all the power.<br><br>- Constantly speak (even now) about how they made the low class better while the rate of unemployment they left was over 30% (and we were unable to know because they destroyed the institute of statistics in 2007) and caused an annual inflation over 40%. They always denied both the level of poverty and inflation, but now they blame the current president for it when he's been in power for less than a year.<br><br><br>*) Our system allows anybody to compete again for re-election once (like USA). But the greatest difference is that once you had two periods you can compete again if you wait for one four year period between terms. So in order to become president-for-life without changing the laws they were going to switch places on each election.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c4932013911237579617 title="comment permalink">11/13/16, 5:41 AM</a><br><br>

Each occurrence challenging the outcome of an election erodes the legitimacy of our governing institutions just a bit more; with each round of rejection of the results, the 'Mandate of Heaven; recedes slightly. There will be a tipping point reached one day, and we will see a usual round of protests produce an unexpected and sudden result.

There's a vast amount of Federal interference with local and state self-governance that has nothing to do with human rights, you know, and in my experience such things as federally mandated educational curriculums and the Unaffordable Care Act are much more hot-button issues in flyover country just now than a lot of the affluent realize. More on this in an upcoming post. <br><br>Nicolas, so noted, but I'm far from sure the parallel holds. One of the reasons I don't post much about politics in other countries is that each country and each part of the world has its own political patterns, which don't necessarily translate across borders. For example, our president Franklin Roosevelt came from the same sort of rich background, with the same sweeping populist promises, as the folks you're talking about -- but his career went in a completely different direction. <br><br>Renaissance, the one thing I'd point out is that the Left does have a narrative -- it's just a narrative that goes out of its way not to appeal to anybody outside the echo chamber. As long as they cling to that narrative, yes, they're going to lose. <br><br>Mister R., bingo. People need hope the way they need food, and the Democrats have gone out of their way to deny hope to the people who voted for Trump. <br><br>Cherokee, there's something extremely fishy going on with the Unaffordable Care Act. The annual premiums go up by huge amounts year over year, and yet insurance companies are struggling to break even on their Obamacare business (they're making their absurd profits on other lines of business) and the exchanges are going broke. Somebody is raking off an astonishing amount of money, and where is it going? I don't pretend to know. <br><br>Roger, nah, he's not an asteroid. The thing to remember, though, is that the American oligarchy is not a monolith. It's riven with quarrels, power struggles, and disagreements over policy. I'll be arguing shortly that globalization has passed the point of diminishing returns for the US, and I doubt I'm the only person who noticed this; it's entirely possible that the people who backed Trump came from a faction of the elite that recognizes that pulling the plug on the globalization project is the best option they've got at this point. <br><br>Matt, if I discuss it on "The Well of Galabes" it'll be a while from now, when the initial yelling has subsided. As for your questions, 1. I wonder if the riggers drank their own koolaid and failed to rig enough of the election to matter; and 2. we don't have a democracy, we have a republic, and there have been iirc four other times when the popular vote went one way and the electoral college went the other.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c5036481702072411444 title="comment permalink">11/13/16, 3:39 PM</a><br><br>

I agree that the media and many elites, especially on the left, have looked past the working class, or at best talked to them in a condescending manner. But there is plenty of cartoon version typecasting going in all directions. <br><br>In terms of class and political category, here's a way you could categorize me: didn't go to college, always did physical jobs, an outdoor guy who owns rifles and shotguns, lived in small towns all but a few years of my life because I prefer it, older white guy with declining income and an old F-150, and after I write this I'm putting on my Carhartt coat and going to the bar to watch the Patriots game. I'm the archetype of a Trump voter, right?<br><br>Wrong. I voted for Clinton, and I know lots of others like me who did. I am on the left on nearly all issues, and I lament the fact that the party of FDR has become as bought and paid for by the oligarchs as the Republicans. I saw the election as an unsatisfactory choice between continuing the incremental decline we've been on for decades or a more tumultuous, unpredictable and probably more dangerous decline. In my opinion the option of a more dangerous, faster decline won. We all agree that the ship is sinking, so if I am right it means less time to build lifeboats. (I really do hope I am wrong)<br><br>Not all the people who voted for Clinton are urban elites. On the other side, I've been trying to tell my more affluent friends for years that the working class is becoming dangerously alienated, for good reason, and that the real elites don't get it even when they think they do. When I read the op-ed page of the NYT this is obvious. The plight of the working class is an abstraction to them, even if they know the facts they don't understand the significance of those facts in our daily lives. <br><br>I don't know where we go from here if conversation is impossible between two tribal ideologies. A return to federalism makes sense to me, like an amicable divorce where we could still be friends. I think this would require some "cultural cleansing" as people moved to other states, and then we could have the 50 state experiments, or groups of states, that de Tocqueville described. That would take care of domestic issues.<br><br>I think it would have to go further though. We are going to have an entire federal government that thinks climate change is a hoax and most people in my part of the country disagree with that. I would rather see complete autonomy of states or regions, with a mutual defense pact, like NATO perhaps, that would require a response only when there was a direct military threat to the homeland, and not defending supply lines all around the globe. That way, people in my part of the country would not be getting dragged into endless wars that have nothing to do with defense. We would be on the way to LESS.<br><br>I know I am dreaming, but it would be interesting.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c6817181015980156863 title="comment permalink">11/13/16, 6:39 PM</a><br><br>

To me, Hillary was unacceptable, and there was no way I was going to vote for her. The issue of breaking the neoliberal consensus was far more important to me than any of the other rescue game/politically correct distractions. Yes, I would have been way more comfortable casting my general election vote for Bernie, but he sold out to Hillary and was not an option, so Trump was the only acceptable candidate left on issues of foreign intervention, trade, and the economy. I accept that our first past the post system is inherently bipartisan and does not accommodate third parties except when they replace existing parties, as the GOP did when it replaced the Whigs, so third party was not an option for me.<br>As a queer person, I find it totally baffling that the most gay friendly GOP presidential candidate is getting tarred as being the most dangerous to the LGBT community. It defies logic. From the Pulse nightclub shooting to the convention and beyond, Trump has refused to pander to right-wing homophobia and has reached out to the LGBT community. I am concerned about his court appointments and how he will conciliate evangelicals and the LGBT community, but he's no George W Bush or Ted Cruz. Of course, I know that Reagan opposed the Briggs initiative (banning gay teachers in Calif.) only to pander to the religious right and do nothing about AIDS as president, so time will tell, but there is nothing in Trump's past or his campaign that indicates the homophobia that protestors are tarring him with. Same with the African-American community. Trump reached out and campaigned to the black community in the same way that Democrats had previously campaigned to the black community: conditions in the inner cities are deplorable, and someone should do something to improve them. Now, his defense of "stop and frisk" is questionable, but can be somewhat forgiven based on his political inexperience. Seeing the reaction of the liberal SJW set is very telling. This is all about the rescue game and keeping minorities "in line" and lumped together. The Democrats got very defensive about the black community, even though they campaigned previously in the exact same way that Trump did (Obama did not even bother to campaign for the black vote, for obvious reasons). Now, because of the most gay friendly and LGBT inclusive GOP candidate ever, queer folk must fear for their lives? It boggles the mind. Because my sexuality was not an issue this year, I was free to vote with my class instead, which is what I did. I am hopeful that this election has put to rest the myth of the "classless society" once and for all, and that the US can accept that it is as class riven as Great Britain, if not more so.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c38685210156698104 title="comment permalink">11/13/16, 7:00 PM</a><br><br>

Our management (salary class) was "with Her" while the wage class, except for an African-American coworker, an upwardly mobile college grad w/a fiancé in law school, and possibly a woman in an interracial relationship, were all Trump supporters. There have already been antisocial media recriminations between a member of management and the wage class as she unfriended some coworkers and refuses to speak to them after they posted positive Trump messages.<br>I could not disagree more with Ahavah's assessment of the election in our state and the tolerance of our people. Ahavah, you have created a "straw redneck", if you will, that is a scapegoat onto which you are projecting your shadow, and it does not reflect the reality of the rural wage class of our state. It is not fair. Honestly, if you would spend only a fraction of the time you spend cultivating the wealthy urban liberal SJW set going out into the rest of the state and getting to know the rural wage class, you could not maintain your scapegoat. It is not fair for you to tar these people based on things you read on internet forums. I challenge you to go to places like Pineville, Cynthiana, Beaver Dam, and Russell Springs (just to name a few), find the most popular diner in town, and sit down and actually get to know these people. I can assure you that most people outside of Lexington probably don't even know Jim Gray's sexuality! Certainly, Rand Paul never made an issue of it. I have the misfortune of living with a TV watcher, so was subjugated to way more political advertising in passing than I cared to, and other than occasional transgender bathroom references, sexuality was not an issue. The Democrats, including Jim Gray, did not lose on sexuality, but on the "War on Coal"™ Hillary's "we're gonna put a lot of miners out of business" ran nonstop on ads, and it cost the Democrats the statehouse, and racked up big GOP totals. Now, we all know on here that coal is dead because of peak coal, not Democratic regulation, but the voters of this state still don't understand that.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c1501811200767362436 title="comment permalink">11/13/16, 7:29 PM</a><br><br>

Most of the wage class people I work with could care less about the Medicaid expansion, because they don't qualify for it. They, like most people on here, are concerned with increasing premiums for care that the still can't afford due to outrageous deductibles. As for the supposed homophobia of our state, how does that correlate with all the trendy hipsters flowing in to Lexington and Louisville from blue states, particularly California?<br>The wage class people I work with in my red county (we voted Trump over Hillary 7000 to 4000, a 3000 vote margin) could not be more accepting of gay people, save one individual. They want to go to the gay bars and see drag shows. They have gay friends. They voted for the openly gay man running for Frankfort City Council. And yes, they voted for Trump. Regarding Jim Gray, in order to prove that his sexuality was an issue, you'd have to prove that he did worse than other Democrats, yet he won more counties than Hillary. Jim Gray ran a poor campaign that was not really helped by his "wild a*s" commercials, but he didn't fair any worse than any other Democrat in KY. The true test will be when we have an openly gay Republican run for statewide office, and I expect that day will be sooner rather than later.<br>As for the statehouse, I wait with trepidation. I will lobby against any RFRA (religious freedom restoration act) or Fairness rollback. The only silver lining is that our 4-lane highway speed limits will probably be raised to 65, 20 years after the repeal of federal caps--the Democratic House Transportation Chair was an opponent of speed limit increases.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c4629196893808862357 title="comment permalink">11/13/16, 7:48 PM</a><br><br>

I see the really vile evangelical activists as the opposite side of the coin as the sort of person who trolls bakeries into making homosexual wedding cakes (in some cases, the requested cakes also had some seriously NSFW symbolism on them, it wasn't just "Adam and Steve" and some hearts) and then takes them to court if they say no.<br><br>In any case I think it is kind of amusing that many of the populations that the Clintonites of the world seem hell-bent on having move to North America and Europe have a rather dim view of homosexuals, or for that matter, women.<br><br>The "we're going to put a lot of coal miners out of business" line was a huge disaster.

None of it. You know why? Because whatever is taught is ignored and forgotten by its audience, school children. Why? Because we insist on using the least ineffective methods of educating children and preparing them for adult life.<br><br>I know I never learned anything worthwhile sitting at a desk staring at the head of the person in front of me while having a textbook open. And most of the country didn't either. Remember that show "Are you Smarter Than a 5th Grader?" I never watched it but I gather than adults were regularly beaten by 10 and 11 years olds on knowledge test of 5th grade curricula in math, history, science, etc. Did 5th graders suddenly become geniuses? No. It was just that everything they learned was completely irrelevant to adults over the age of 25.<br><br>Here's what people do learn in the school system -<br>Sit down, listen to the expert, and wait your turn.<br>If you want to ask a question, signal it, then the expert will answer (doesn't matter if right or wrong)<br>The textbook is the ultimate authority (doesn't matter if right or wrong)<br>The way math is taught will change every decade or so, so parents look like complete idiots trying to help children with homework.<br>You will work all day and all night on assignments given to you by those in authority.<br>Your free time is dictated by authority.<br>There is one correct method for everyone to learn the material. Just one way we all learn.<br>The bell rings and you stop doing what you are doing and go to the next thing, no complaining or hesitating.<br>You are alone in doing your work. Don't ask for help from classmates, that's cheating (interesting in office work these days, it is absolutely necessary to work in teams and yet we never give people a chance to do it)<br>You will be rated and ranked against your classmates (if everyone got an A there is something wrong)<br>You will be rewarded based on your rank.<br>Those of lower rank must never socialize with those of higher rank. (remember high school?)<br><br>Its not the content of school that is ruining this nation, it is the context in which schools run. We desperately need young people who can work together in groups to come up with a menu of solutions and try them out together. Figure out what works for their community given their resources. <br><br>So anything that breaks the school monopoly I am all for it. It is insane how much people defend the school system when they hate it so much at the same time.<br><br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c3690974390923747886 title="comment permalink">11/14/16, 4:49 AM</a><br><br>

In 6th grade, middle school, the school did their suicide prevention classes. The parent had to sign off on it, a vague description of what would be presented, but it was conducted out of sight of parents. Now everyone is for zero children committing suicide - we all agree on this goal. However what was taught to the 12-13 years olds was graphic step-by-step directions with photos and diagrams of the different methods people commit suicide, along with with effectiveness rate of each method. So children got to see arms slit, dead people in bathtubs, gun shot wounds, and hanging by rope. The experts determined this was an effective way to prevent suicide. My friend who told me this story was upset and said "Well if you weren't sure how to do it before, this class certainly outlined it for you. No need to use the internet."<br><br>Now one would say, why don't the parents complain? Well, parents who complain to school administrators are "trouble-makers" and their children will be punished with the lower quality teachers, less random awards (Citizen of the Month kind of thing), and be shunned by the school staff. So the parents stayed silent. And school just goes on and does whatever it wants.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c7944586928444666255 title="comment permalink">11/14/16, 5:15 AM</a><br><br>

In my list of populist heads of state, besides Trump, he's the only one I remember who came from the elite. He was educated, and his wife (an idealist with a complementing outlook to his) influenced a lot of his policies during that time. He also had another thing that most populists lack, he wasn't insecure about himself.<br><br>Peron, Chavez, Kirchner, Castro and the grand majority of the last 100 years populists came from the lower and middle class. They rarely had enough education due to the circumstances of their lives. In the case of Cristina Kirchner, she also held a very deep resentment for her father and the life she had as a kid. So she had a lot of insecurity, and bipolar disorder. It was well known that you couldn't contradict her, or even suggest a slightly different alternative to her plans, if you wanted to keep your position in the government. <br><br>The result of 12 years of a populist government is 34% of unemployment, 40% of annual inflation (only Venezuela is worse than us), drug mafias were able to get a foothold here for the first time in our history and the justice system was nearly gutted (I'm glad to say not completely) so she and her children could avoid going to jail for the most massive system of corruption Argentina saw.<br><br>So in the collective experience of my country, a snowball in hell's survival is more probable than electing a populist who can actually fix things, instead of abusing power for their benefit.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c5937641413112183719 title="comment permalink">11/14/16, 5:48 AM</a><br><br>

The house insurance here goes up by roughly 12% each year and this is an unsustainable increase. Incidentally, I believe it is driven by the government demands that insurers cover flood events. Fire strangely is not as high a risk factor. I'm pretty sure many people up here are simply not insured.<br><br>The interesting thing that I'm seeing is that the insurers are crying poor here too. Of course low interest rates and poor bond yields have a lot to do with that too.<br><br>It has been my experience that it is very difficult to continue running an unprofitable business for more than a year or three. And yet, we all know of plenty of large businesses that are doing exactly that. I'm pretty sure I understand how they are doing that too, as there have been quite a bit of publicity about the goings on in that regard - if anyone actually cared to read the articles.<br><br>I'd be very interested to read your current take on the world of economics? The strange desire that people exhibit about houses and economics is just weird. The fact is a house should be worth less every year due to the actions of entropy. I mean, they just sit there and break down every single day. How people can expect them to be worth more than the previous year is one of the strange riddles of our time. It certainly feels like wishful thinking to me. And yet there it is... And the consequences of that wish is really starting to play out down here. It is ugly.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c4199250192253071451 title="comment permalink">11/14/16, 1:01 PM</a><br><br>

I am not an every week reader, but come in and out as time and my current lines of thinking allow, and I am always appreciative of your perspective. I have a couple of thoughts related to the ideas you shared this past week. <br>Let me begin by saying that I agree with almost everything that you are saying in your post. But I wonder if the emotional charge of this election has a bit more to it than just people not being thoughtful, insulting on repeat, and not talking about the important issues. <br>Perhaps there is something larger at work here, something that is rather hard to talk about- particularly in a “rational” way- powers at work that move in and out and around typical rational discourse. A larger story unfolding that we of short memories, limited language, and a general nervousness around all things beyond the rational tend to miss. That is one avenue of contemplation to pursue… <br><br><br>Another path for contemplation is the possibility that by asking for a putting aside of the moral aspect of the two candidates we run the risk of ignoring what seems to me to be a legitimate social concern- and that is that regardless of where it comes from, the derogatory energy spilling forth directly from President-elect Donald Trump’s mouth and then spun by all sorts of media outlets and individuals is just not right. Misogyny is not right. Racism is not right. Homophobia is not right. Mockery of the disabled is not right. If statements made by Trump or his strategists that are abusive can somehow be dismissed intellectually in order to get at what is “really important” like jobs and foreign policy, then what is the state of the society in which we find ourselves? <br>The way that the election was experienced through the media was so strange and gross and pornographic that the thought of blinking and instantly being on a tropical island with a small group of loved ones, a little tribe of goats, a small garden and a few guitars crossed my mind more than once in recent months. But to say that all that was focused on was the evil evilness of the others, and that we should drop all of that and discuss platform issues, dismisses the understandable frustration and fear of people of all sorts. To oversimplify, there are those that are oppressed by an economic system which has made them feel unimportant and there are those that feel oppressed by systemic racism and sexism. All of these people deserve to feel the negative emotions associated with abuse and to dream of creating a world where they are no longer treated this way. Yet the latter category- those experiencing some form of systemic racism and sexism- must be given some degree of precedence. We need to embrace our diversity in all of its messiness if we are to really be a free society and also if we want to get anywhere in terms of working on the oppression of the former group- the economically disadvantaged. Both of the candidates can be questioned ethically in my opinion, and that spills into policy no doubt (the ignoring of NoDAPL and indigenous rights in general to give just one example.) But the intentional stirring up of white nationalism has historical precedent that is worthy of attention if not alarm. <br>Again, I know that I am oversimplifying the concerns of those that are feeling frustrated and oppressed right now. And I know that regardless of these things, there still needs to be intelligent discourse about the other issues at hand for the nation, but hopefully you can see what I am getting at…<br>I’m not endorsing any sort of moral legislation- I love the idea of promoting Federalism and State’s rights- but endorsing a human consciousness that says no way to racism, sexism, etc. is not only okay, I believe it is necessary for us to evolve as a species and grow more beautifully in our expression of humanness. <br><br><br>With respect,<br>Stephen Lenhart<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c8295258419138799889 title="comment permalink">11/14/16, 1:14 PM</a><br><br>

It is just as easy to argue that Clinton's well known unpopularity lost her the election than that Trumps working class support won it for him.

To win the Whitehouse the Republican needs the support of one other group beyond the white middle class mostly male base. Bush II did this with middle class white women. Reagan also did it with the working class, especially in the South. Romney, McCain, and Bush I in 1992 got neither of those, and lost. But in every case including 2016, the core support of white middle class males is the foundation on which these marginal groups are placed.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c7197157511163557128 title="comment permalink">11/14/16, 3:31 PM</a><br><br>

I truly believe what JMG said about the wage class giving government one last chance with Trump, and I thought, "man, we've been given a reprieve! The republic lives another day!" I am somewhat perplexed by Trump's cabinet appointments, and I certainly hope that he doesn't turn out to be a GOP Obama, because his supporters are way too far down the insurgency path, and way too impatient w/the status quo to tolerate any kind of sellout, unlike the left.<br>Regarding wage class Trump supporters, I'm really taken w/how many of them have favorable attitudes towards Bernie and may have actually won some of their votes had he been on the general election ballot, based on character alone.<br>Regarding secession, I'm an avowed secessionista, and if Trump is the catalyst for breaking the nation down into more manageable units, it's a good thing. If at first you don't secede, try, try again. Besides, national borders will help protect the livable parts of the country from climate refugees from areas that will either be too dry or underwater. Regarding immigration, I considered it a non-issue in this election. The US is about to undergo a precipitous decline, and Mexico has a bright, shiny future ahead as the premier scarcity industrial power in North America. I must admit, I'm envious that Mexicans have a Mexico to go home to, while us Americans have nowhere to go once things go south.<br>I hear where Trump has already phoned Putin and they've promised cooperation and closer relations. Hopefully, Trump can reestablish the "Nixonian/Kissenger wedge" between China and Russia by simultaneously conciliating Russia while being tough on China. As JMG has mentioned, cluelessly pushing China &amp; Russia into each other's arms has been one of the biggest disasters of neoconservative foreign policy.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c3019055433585721639 title="comment permalink">11/14/16, 5:02 PM</a><br><br>

I saw Republicans doing the shrieking when Clinton and Obama took office, and Democrats doing the shrieking when Bush II did the same thing; it should come as no surprise that the same amateur theatrics would be all over the news now. That said, it's not exactly an edifying spectacle. <br><br>Izzy, you're assuming that your side of the culture wars will retain control of the Department of Education. Consider the following scenario: Trump dies or gets impeached, and Pence becomes president. As a good Bible-believing fundamentalist, he issues an executive order requiring every public school in the nation to teach creationism or lose its federal funding. (He can do that, you know.) Does federal control over education still sound like a good idea to you? <br><br>Joeln, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Fred, of course it was Portland that threw a fit. It may be the whitest city in America, but it's also pretty much the furthest left, with a really overdeveloped sense of entitlement. (I spent a lot of time there when I lived on the left coast, and though I enjoyed the place, the holier-than-thou political posturing was way over the top.) Since the protests don't actually affect anything, and Donald Trump knows perfectly well that he can ignore them, it's an irrelevancy -- though I suppose it's good aerobic exercise for the participants. <br><br>Other Tom, I'm not sure where you're sensing stereotyping; I didn't say that all working class people by definition vote one way -- as contrasted, say, to the pundits who insisted that women wouldn't vote for Trump, as though all women share the same concerns and political views! I'd caution you, though, against thinking that there are only two tribes in America today. There are many of them, some more or less allied, some more or less opposed, and what happens in each presidential election is that we get to see how many of them line up with each side. <br><br>Shane, and let's also note that these same people are insisting they're less safe with a candidate who wants to pull back from a military confrontation with Russia, as opposed to a candidate who spent her time in the State Department pushing regime change on foreign countries and spent much of the campaign threatening to get the US military even more deeply involved in the Syrian quagmire. I remember when Democrats were against reckless military adventurism; it seems like a distant dream now...<br><br>Phil, fascinating. If Bardi grasps the trouble that science is in, we may have a better chance to save it than I'd expected. <br><br>LatheChuck, true enough. <br><br>N=ro, <a href=../../2014/09/dark-age-america-senility-of-elites.html rel=nofollow>I've already discussed that</a>. <br><br>Nicolas, ah, but you've just pointed to one core reason why Trump may be more like FDR than like Kirchner; he comes from an affluent background, so doesn't have the pervasive hatred of the wealthy that so many populists have. Still, we'll see.<br><br>RCW, no argument there at all. As I noted a few weeks back, American liberalism has its roots in Christianity, and still retains the underlying Puritan mindset -- it's just that they've found something other than sex to be holier than thou about. <br><br>Trippticket, no argument there at all. <br><br>Lynn, this matches what I've heard from a lot of people who voted for Trump.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c445716965515485608 title="comment permalink">11/14/16, 5:03 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, that will help a great deal, if the process can be done at a basement-tech level. <br><br>Cherokee, yes, the economy is something I should probably address sooner rather than later, as the spread of zero- and negative-interest bonds and the like is a very large flashing red light. Thanks for suggesting it. <br><br>Fern Hollow, it seems to me that you're missing a central point. It's not as though the moral evil was all on one side, after all; Clinton's support of regime change projects that have plunged whole nations into chaos and misery is also something that deserves ethical condemnation, wouldn't you say? Furthermore, both candidates and both campaigns went out of their way to insult and denigrate American minorities; it's just that they targeted different minorities, and the one that the Clinton campaign targeted, white working class Americans, are the one minority in this country the Left thinks that it's okay to hate. If you want to criticize Trump for his comments about Mexicans and Muslims, by all means; are you going to criticize Clinton for her dismissal of white working class Americans as deplorables and dupes? If not, it's worth asking whether your ethics have been subordinated to your political passions...<br><br>Bill, what you're saying could be said equally well by pointing out that each party has its core constituencies, but must add other constituencies to that core in order to win. You're focusing on one of the GOP core constituencies; I'm pointing out that the strategy of also appealing to the downwardly mobile working class is a significant shift for the GOP, and brought voters into Trump's side who voted for Obama in 2008.

Reagan appealed to this same consituency in 1980 during the stagflation era, when wages were effectively falling because of high inflation and unemployment, and was able to keep them in 1984 because the economy had improved. "Are you better off today than you were 4 years ago?" was his question, both times. That they were ignored by the GOP in 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012 I will not disagree with. I'm suggesting that Trump resurrected Reagan's strategy along with his campaign slogan. But this still means he is not a radically new thing for the party, rather he is an attempt to return to a strategy that served them very well 36 years ago, after being out of power for 16 of the last 24 years. <br><br>I realize 1980 probably seems like a long time ago to some, but to those of us of a certain age, that presidential campaign remains as vivid as if it happened in 2012.

There isn't going to be any "and they lived on their egalitarian multicultural communes happily ever after" future for most people. You know where I was last Sunday? At the rededication of the Chabad house near UK, which had been violently vandalized recently. Not a kid's prank, serious violence. They kept the dedication quiet so as not to attract the/more thugs back. The Rabbi's wife had twins lately and has no way to defend herself. The veneer of civilization is quite thin, and it didn't take much to break it. My own out-freyn Eastern Ky relatives don't accept my gay son, nor does my husband's southern Baptist family. His family (formerly of Owenton, now living here in Lex) tolerated me only as long as they thought they were going to "save" me. When it became clear that wasn't going to happen they excluded us from their lives. Now that my husband has converted they won't give us the time of day. Don't tell me there's no bigotry in Ky, I've seen plenty of it, up close and personal. Are you familiar with the term Melungeon? It means foreigner/not-white (enough). Mixed-race. Miscegenation. Jews only got the privilege of being considered white recently, and in the case of white supremacists we still aren't. And you think the vandals won't throw Molotov cocktails when things get worse? You think they won't throw them at gay hangouts? If you think polite society and political correctness are going to survive a serious crisis, you are dangerously naive. And you don't know the people in the mountains and hill country at all. I was raised there the biggest part if my life. If you listened to anyone talk but yourself, you might recall I'm half Scot-Irish, from E Ky. My relatives and my first husband's family (and until just a few years ago my daughter) live in Flatwoods, Russell, Greenup, Argillite, Catlettsburg, Grayson, Carter City, Olive Hill and Ironville. And have I mentioned I find your sanctimonious pontificating tiring? You had a Lily white middle class suburban upbringing in metropolitan central ky. But your holier than thou attitude belies an obvious insecurity. Methinks thou doth protest too much about how accepting everyone is. Maybe you'd have an easier time being included in some community or other if you at least tried not being obnoxious. Want to take a wild guess why nobody here is interested in continuing with the GW group? You don't shut up and you talk down to people and creep them out wanting to get all cozy with people you just met. That's not how things are done. Nonetheless, being part of some community with people who will have your back in a pinch is the only viable survival strategy in the long run, so you really should try not alienating people. That's as close to telling people how to live as I've ever been, and it will be my last advice to you. Or you can try clicking your heels together and saying "there's no bigotry in ky" 3x. Let me know how that works out for you.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c8799189791542575518 title="comment permalink">11/15/16, 5:46 AM</a><br><br>

I know, everything about this reeks of the opposite sentiment and ideas for which this blog is known for.. but I digress!) It caught my attention as an ESL teacher because it points at the differences between American and British English and how a lot of it is connected to culture. The title of the song suggests conflict. Then I got to thinking how today's contemporary culture is predominately urbanized, which is a relatively recent phenomena, as the majority of the worlds population now lives in cities. That means many people have already been born and raised in urban environments, with many more to follow.<br><br> This whole election, what preceded it and the events unfolding after it, seem closely linked to this division. A division of cultures within a society. And something which seems, as it was partly the result of globalization, and becoming more globalized, poised to cause such divisions around the world, as is perhaps evident in the Brexit, in the US elections, in Bulgarian and Moldovan elections, and upcoming elections in France and Australia.<br><br><br>My question is, is it likely that these events are linked to the disconnect between urban and rural lifestyles? The implications if such is the case, are huge. That is building up for a massive meltdown of the global society (although in slow, but consistent steps), just as you've been long been making the case for.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c6825155262124983084 title="comment permalink">11/15/16, 6:14 AM</a><br><br>

You steem to strongly attached to your beliefs to seek any common ground and we are borrowing space from the main conversation. Please noto, though, that I am perfectly willing to let you be and not mess in your affairs, even if I consider them misguided.

I don't have any complaints about my condition, declining as it is, quite the contrary, I feel deeply grateful to be here. I just don't see the situation for fathering as being fruitful in any near term, or far term scenario. Bodies, like houses, suffer entropy; and yet, the waves that wash pearls and corals onto our sandy beaches for free, that figure in our own consciousness, somehow, the life we experience as our own, these waves, and life are infinite, and eternal as is the universe.

A few of these themes I actually pull from JMG's writing here. I might do a bit of research to get started or prime the well, but the bulk of this time is spent alone, without outside input or stimulus, exploring my own thoughts on the subject and teasing out its implications. I often do this with pen and paper, although I tend to naturally do a purely mental follow up before I sleep which is less structured but often more insightful or surprising, although this is less deliberate than just a natural result of having some thinking time as I wait to drift off. I usually end my oen and paper session with plenty of material for further research as well as the next day's reflection, and a fairly robust immunity to the perils of social media and the unfortunate discourse around this election and politics in general (actually, calling it a discourse lends it unwarranted nobility). That immunity extends to muddled thought more generally, I have found. Also it has curbed my unworthy tendency to contribute to the horror by stringing together a bunch of plausible-sounding but shallowly-understood arguments to convince others/myself that I am right when a belief of mine is challenged.<br><br><a href=reflections-on-democracy-in-crisis.html#c1310303569157645350 title="comment permalink">11/15/16, 7:02 PM</a><br><br>

Coal River Valley, Midlands, the area out to the SE of Devonport are examples, and there are more coming on line including one for the Smithton area. I have relatives who purchased a large dairy in the Smithton area last year and have installed a centre pivot they do not yet have enough water for on the basis of a scheme that is being constructed now. That scheme and the pivot effectively drought proofs that farm, and a drought proof dairy farm is worth at least 20% more than one that cannot avoid that risk vector, all other factors being equal.

They know they need to exercise, balance their checkbook, drive under the speed limit, whatever, and yet they don't do it. <br><br>It's habits and attitudes that impact people the most, and therefore this country. Many of us are now in the habit of only communicating with other people via typed messages through computers. For some their real self is only shown through these messages, and for others they make up a whole persona online. What will that habit lead to in five years? Ten years?
