As longtime readers of this blog know, it’s not uncommon for the essays I post here to go veering off on an assortment of tangents, and this week’s post is going to be an addition to that already well-stocked list. Late last week, as the aftermath of the recent election was still spewing all over the media,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was mulling over one likely consequence of the way things turned out—the end of at least some of the free trade agreements that have played so large and dubious a role in recent economic history</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the major currents underlying 2016’s political turmoil in Europe and the United States, in fact, has been a sharp disagreement about the value of free trade. The political establishment throughout the modern industrial world insists that free trade policies, backed up by an ever-increasing network of trade agreements, are both inevitable and inevitably good. The movements that have risen up against the status quo—the Brexit campaign in Britain, the populist surge that just made Donald Trump the next US president, and an assortment of similar movements elsewhere—reject both these claims, and argue that free trade is an unwise policy that has a cascade of negative consequences. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s important to be clear about what’s under discussion here, since conversations about free trade very often get wrapped up in warm but vague generalities about open borders and the like. Under a system of free trade, goods and capital can pass freely across national borders; there are no tariffs to pay, no quotas to satisfy, no capital restrictions to keep money in one country or out of another. The so-called global economy, in which the consumer goods sold in a nation might be manufactured anywhere on the planet, with funds flowing freely to build a factory here and funnel profits back there, depends on free trade, and the promoters of free trade theory like to insist that this is always a good thing: abolishing trade barriers of all kinds, and allowing the free movement of goods and capital across national boundaries, is supposed to create prosperity for everyone. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the theory, at least. In practice?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well, not so much. It’s not always remembered that there have been two great eras of free trade in modern history—the first from the 1860s to the beginning of the Great Depression, in which the United States never fully participated; the second from the 1980s to the present, with the United States at dead center—and neither one of them has ushered in a world of universal prosperity. Quite the contrary, both of them have yielded identical results: staggering profits for the rich, impoverishment and immiseration for the working classes, and cascading economic crises. The first such era ended in the Great Depression; the second, just at the moment, looks as though it could end the same way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Economists—more precisely, the minority of economists who compare their theories to the evidence provided by the real world—like to insist that these unwelcome outcomes aren’t the fault of free trade. As I hope to show, they’re quite mistaken. An important factor has been left out of their analysis, and once that factor has been included, it becomes clear that free trade is bad policy that inevitably produces poverty and economic instability, not prosperity. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To see how this works, let’s imagine a continent with many independent nations, all of which trade with one another. Some of the nations are richer than others; some have valuable natural resources, while others don’t; standards of living and prevailing wages differ from country to country. Under normal conditions, trade barriers of various kinds limit the flow of goods and capital from one nation to another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Each nation adjusts its trade policy to further its own economic interests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One nation that’s trying to build up a domestic steel industry, say, may use tariffs, quotas, and the like to shelter that industry from foreign competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Another nation with an agricultural surplus may find it necessary to lower tariffs on other products to get neighboring countries to buy its grain. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Outside the two eras of free trade mentioned above, this has been the normal state of affairs, and it has had two reliable results. The first is that the movement of goods and capital between the nations tends toward a rough balance, because every nation uses its trade barriers to police hostile trade policy on the part of its neighbors. Imagine, for example, a nation that tries to monopolize steel production by “dumping”—that is, selling steel on the international market at rock-bottom prices to try to force all other nations’ steel mills into bankruptcy. The other nations respond by slapping tariffs, quotas, or outright bans on imported steel from the dumping country, bringing the project to a screeching halt. Thus trade barriers tend to produce a relative equilibrium between national economies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice that this is an equilibrium, not an equality. When trade barriers exist, it’s usual for some nations to be rich and others to be poor, for a galaxy of reasons having nothing to do with international trade. At the same time, the difficulties this imposes on poor nations are balanced by a relative equilibrium, <i>within </i>nations, between wages and prices. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When the movement of goods and capital across national borders is restricted, the prices of consumer products in each nation will be linked via the law of supply and demand to the purchasing power of consumers in that nation, and thus to the wages paid by employers in that nation. Of course the usual cautions apply; wages and prices fluctuate for a galaxy of reasons, many of which have nothing to do with international trade. Even so, since the wages paid out by employers form the principal income stream that allows consumers to buy the employers’ products, and consumers can have recourse to the political sphere if employers’ attempts to drive down wages get out of hand, there’s a significant pressure toward balance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Given trade barriers, as a result, people who live in countries that pay low wages generally pay low prices for goods and services, while people who live in countries with high wages face correspondingly high prices when they go shopping. The low prices make life considerably easier for working people in poor countries, just as the tendency of wages to match prices makes life easier for working people in rich countries. Does this always work? Of course not—again, wages and prices fluctuate for countless reasons, and national economies are inherently unstable things—but the factors just enumerated push the economy in the direction of a rough balance between the needs and wants of consumers, on the one hand, and their ability to pay, on the other. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now let’s imagine that all of the nations we’ve imagined are convinced by a gaggle of neoliberal economists to enact a free trade zone, in which there are no barriers at all to the free movement of goods and capital. What happens? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When there are no trade barriers, the nation that can produce a given good or service at the lowest price will end up with the lion’s share of the market for that good or service. Since labor costs make up so large a portion of the cost of producing goods, those nations with low wages will outbid those with high wages, resulting in high unemployment and decreasing wages in the formerly high-wage countries. The result is a race to the bottom in which wages everywhere decline toward those of the worst-paid labor force in the free trade zone. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When this happens in a single country, as already noted, the labor force can often respond to the economic downdraft by turning to the political sphere. In a free trade zone, though, employers faced with a political challenge to falling wages in one country can simply move elsewhere. It’s the mismatch between economic union and political division that makes free trade unbalanced, and leads to problems we’ll discuss shortly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course free trade advocates like to insist that jobs lost by wealthier nations to poorer ones will inevitably be replaced by new jobs. History doesn’t support that claim—quite the contrary—and there are good reasons why the jobs that disappear will never be replaced. In a free trade system, it’s more economical for startups in any labor-intensive industry to go straight to one of the countries with low wages; only those industries that are capital-intensive and thus employ comparatively few people have any reason to get under way in the high-wage countries. The computer industry is a classic example—and you’ll notice, I trust, that just as soon as that industry started to become labor-intensive, it moved offshore. Still, there’s another factor at work. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Since wages are a very large fraction of the cost of producing goods, the overall decrease in wages brings about an increase in profits. Thus one result of free trade is a transfer of wealth from the laboring majority, whose income comes from wages, to the affluent minority, whose income comes directly or indirectly from profits. That’s the factor that’s been left out of the picture by the proponents of free trade—its effect on income distribution. Free trade makes the rich richer and the poor poorer, by increasing profits while driving wages down. This no doubt explains why free trade is so popular among the affluent these days, just as it was in the Victorian era.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a worm in the bud, though, because a skewed income distribution imposes costs of its own, and those costs mount up over time in painfully familiar ways. The difficulty with making the rich richer and the poor poorer, as Henry Ford pointed out a long time ago, is that the wages you pay your employees are also the income stream they use to buy your products. As wages decline, purchasing power declines, and begins to exert downward pressure on returns on investment in every industry that relies on consumer purchases for its income. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Doesn’t the increasing wealth of investors counterbalance the declining wealth of the wage-earning masses? No, because the rich spend a smaller proportion of their incomes on consumer goods than the poor, and divert the rest to investments. Divide a million dollars between a thousand working class family, and the money’s going to be spent to improve the families’ standard of living: better food, a bigger apartment, an extra toy or two around the Christmas tree, and so on. Give the same million to one rich family and it’s a safe bet that much of it’s going to be invested. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This, incidentally, is why the trickle-down economics beloved of Republican politicians of an earlier era simply doesn’t work, and why the Obama administration’s massive handouts of government money to banks in the wake of the 2008-9 financial panic did so little to improve the financial condition of most of the country. When it comes to consumption, the rich simply aren’t as efficient as the poor. If you want to kickstart an economy with consumer expenditures, as a result, you need to make sure that poor and working class people have plenty of money to spend. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a broader principle here as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Consumer expenditures and capital for investment are to an economy what sunlight and water are to a plant: you can’t substitute one for the other. You need both. Since free trade policies funnel money away from expenditure toward investment by skewing the income distribution, it causes a shortage of the one and a surplus of the other. As the imbalance builds, it becomes harder for businesses to make a profit because consumers don’t have the cash to buy their products; meanwhile the amount of money available for investment increases steadily. The result is a steady erosion in return on investment, as more and more money chases fewer and fewer worthwhile investment vehicles. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The history of free-trade eras is thus marked by frantic attempts to prop up returns on investment by any means necessary. The offshoring fad that stripped the United States of its manufacturing economy in the 1970s had its exact equivalent in the offshoring of fabric mills from Britain to India in the late Victorian era; in both cases, the move capitalized on remaining disparities in wages and prices between rich and poor areas in a free trade zone. In both cases, offshoring worsened the problem it was meant to fix, by increasing the downward pressure on wages in the richer countries and further decreasing returns on investment across the entire spectrum of consumer industries—then as now, the largest single share of the economy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A gambit that as far as I know wasn’t tried in the first era of free trade was the attempt to turn capital into ersatz income by convincing consumers to make purchases with borrowed money. That’s been the keystone of economic policy in the United States for most of two decades now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The housing bubble was only the most exorbitant manifestation of a frantic attempt to get people to spend money they don’t have, and then find some way to pay it all back with interest. It hasn’t worked well, not least because all those interest payments put an additional downward pressure on consumer expenditures. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A variety of other, mostly self-defeating gimmicks have been put in play in both of the modern free trade eras to try to keep consumer expenditures high while wages decline. None of them work, because they don’t address the actual problem—the fact that under free trade, the downward pressure on wages means that consumers can’t afford to spend enough to keep the economy running at a level that will absorb the available investment capital—and so the final solution to the problem of declining returns on investment arrives on schedule: the diversion of capital from productive investment into speculation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Any of my readers who don’t know how this story ends should get up right now, and go find a copy of John Kenneth Galbraith’s classic <i>The Great Crash 1929</i>. Speculative bubbles, while they last, produce abundant returns; when free trade has driven down wages, forced the consumer economy into stagnation or contraction, and decreased the returns on investment in productive industries to the point of “why bother,” a speculative bubble is very often the only profitable game in town. What’s more, since there are so few investments with decent returns in the late stages of a free trade scheme, there’s a vast amount of money ready to flow into any investment vehicle that can show a decent return, and that’s exactly the environment in which speculative bubbles breed most readily. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So the great free trade era that began tentatively with the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, and came into full flower with Gladstone’s abolition of tariffs in 1869, ended in the stock market debacle of 1929 and the Great Depression. The road there was littered with plenty of other crises, too. The economic history of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is a cratered moonscape of speculative busts and stock market crashes, culminating in the Big One in 1929. It resembles, in fact, nothing so much as the economic history of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, which have had their own sequence of busts and crashes: the stock market crash of 1987, the emerging markets crash of 1994, the tech-stock debacle of 2000, the housing bust of 2008, and the beat goes on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus free trade causes the impoverishment and immiseration of the labor force, and a cascading series of economic busts driven by the mismatch between insufficent consumption and excess investment. Those problems aren’t accidental—they’re hardwired into any free trade system—and the only way to stop them in their tracks is to abandon free trade as bad policy, and replace it with sensible trade barriers that ensure that most of the products consumed in each nation are made there.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably necessary to stop here and point out a couple of things. First of all, the fact that free trade is bad policy doesn’t mean that every kind of trade barrier is good policy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The habit of insisting that the only possible points along a spectrum are its two ends, common as it is, is an effective way to make really bad decisions; as in most things, there’s a middle ground that yields better results than either of the two extremes. Finding that middle ground isn’t necessarily easy, but the same thing’s true of most economic and political issues. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Second, free trade isn’t the only cause of economic dysfunction, nor is it the only thing that can cause skewed income distribution and the attendant problems that this brings with it. Plenty of factors can cause a national or global economy to run off the rails. What history shows with painful clarity is that free trade inevitably makes this happen. Getting rid of free trade and returning to a normal state of affairs, in which nations provide most of their own needs from within their own borders and trade with other nations to exchange surpluses or get products that aren’t available at home readily, or at all, gets rid of one reliable cause of serious economic dysfunction. That’s all, but arguably it’s enough to make a movement away from free trade a good idea. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finally, the points I’ve just made suggest that there may be unexpected benefits, even today, to a nation that extracts itself from free trade agreements and puts a well-planned set of trade restrictions in place. There are plenty of factors putting downward pressure on prosperity just now, but the reasoning I’ve just sketched out suggests that the destitution and immiseration so common in the world right now may have been made considerably worse than they would otherwise be by the mania for free trade that’s been so pervasive in recent decades. A country that withdraws from free trade agreements and reorients its economy for the production of goods for domestic consumption might thus expect to see some improvement, not only in the prosperity of its working people, but in rates of return on investment. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the theory I propose. Given the stated policies of the incoming US administration, it’s about to be put to the test—and the results should be apparent over the next few years. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

<div class=MsoNormal>
On a different and less theoretical note, I’m delighted to report that the third issue of<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> <a href=http://intotheruins.com/ >Into The Ruins</a>, </span>the quarterly magazine of deindustrial science fiction, is on its way to subscribers and available for sale to everyone else. The Fall 2016 issue includes stories by regular authors and newcomers alike, including a Matthew Griffiths tale set in the universe of my novel Star’s Reach, along with book reviews, essays, and a letter to the editors column that is turning into one of the liveliest forums in print. If you’re not subscribing yet, you’re missing a treat.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
On a less cheery note, it’s been a while now since I proposed a contest, asking readers to write stories about futures that went outside the conventional binary of progress or decline. I think it was a worthwhile project, and some of the stories I received in response were absolutely first-rate—but, I’m sorry to say, there weren’t enough of them to make an anthology. I want to thank everyone who wrote a story in response to my challenge, and since a good many of the stories in question deserve publication, I’m forwarding them to Joel Caris, the editor of <i>Into The Ruins</i>, for his consideration.</div>

During the Lochner Era, the Federal Government was prevented from passing laws setting national labor standards. The result: as the railroads made interstate transport relatively fast and inexpensive, industries moved to low-labor cost states.<br><br>Look at the child labor law cases: when states such as Massachusetts passed laws regulating child labor, firms in the timber, furniture, and textile industries moved to the Southern states where no such laws existed. Attempts to set a national standard for child labor were struck down by the Supreme Court as an unconstitutional restraint on the freedom to contract. Any effort by states with child-labor laws to ban the import of goods produced with child labor would have been struck down as unconstitutional restraints on interstate trade.<br><br>We see the same thing in global "free trade" agreements where no protections are set for labor and/or environmental laws.

Allowing all societies to have wide and wider differences in life expectations stuck cheek to jowl.<br><br>Also it reduces pressure on all participants to base their way of life on the realities of their natural habitat. <br><br>Recently my imagination has been enthralled with a world building project. A great saga of the rise of a successor civilization in the climate changed rocky mountains. I don't know if much of it will be turned to a story, this project is very tailored to my most unique of tastes. Still though the research I have been doing is relivent to this discussion.<br><br>This morning I was reading a book on the ways of life of the Rocky Mountain natives before white settlers got here. They had a life that was clearly tailored to make the best of very rarefied resources. Though brutally exposed to many pains of poverty that even the poor in industrial society can expect some protection from; they had kinds of wealth that were fulfilling with in those contexts. Even though they were poor, their way of life made complete logical sense in the context of mountains far far from any ocean influence on climate. A wealthy way of life that doesn't make sense is satisfying in strange ways.<br><br>Next week I will be herding sheep on the Dineta (Navajo land) Black Mesa. I look forward to it strongly, even though herding and living in a crude shelter is harsh, I know from last years experience how well it counter acts the imbalances that seep into a persons spirit from living industrially in a land with especially little patience for such non-sense.<br><br>I observe something from comparing my time in sheep camp to the lore of Ute times past. Even with only a tiny amount of industrial remains available, certain tasks can be simplified from a major part of the economic life to a minor chore. The question to my mind, anchoring the imaginary world, is what things will fill that time.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c3770849548501764491 title="comment permalink">11/23/16, 12:17 PM</a><br><br>

Economists refer to this as the "China Shock" and observe that regions quickly exposed to foreign competition have not recovered; in other words, the costs of free trade are disproportionate and concentrated, while benefits are diffuse. http://www.ddorn.net/papers/Autor-Dorn-Hanson-ChinaShock.pdf<br><br>Voters in economically-depressed areas used the Electoral College to call B.S. on neoliberalism and free trade. In other words, the EC performed as intended by allowing the Rust Belt bloc to check the destructive economic policies favored by other regions.<br><br>My gut feeling is that free trade <i>eventually</i> works over sufficiently long periods of time, but it deals so much real damage so quickly that it's impossible to stay the course before the political backlash occurs. As the paper above notes:<br><br>"Labor-market adjustment to trade shocks is stunningly slow, with local labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and local unemployment rates remaining elevated for a full decade or more after a shock commences."<br><br>Theoretical economists deluded themselves by assuming labor force adjustments in response to free trade would be smooth, or that people could move for a service sector job 100s of miles away like it's no big deal.<br><br>Lastly, while I enjoyed <i>The Great Crash</i>, I think any treatment of bubbles is incomplete without examining the role of the Fed and its arbitrary manipulation of interest rates. Indeed, some economists have made the argument that free trade actually causes <i>even more</i> when paired with the Fed's expansive monetary policies. To keep my comment brief, if outsourcing is one pincer, the Fed is the other.

Of course, you can only play that game for so long; the result being the recent financial crisis, the inevitable culmination of the free trade and deregulation era. Just basically a looting mechanism to extract money from the system and channel it upward, both on the way up, and then again when the system reset is needed. Then they loot the assets. (See foreclosure crisis, fixed by sending all the owned homes into the rental market, via cash rich investors picking them up on the cheap.)<br><br>In the same way, the new administration looks to be a shining example of the type that puts corrupt right wing billionaires in positions of power simply for their own enrichment (see Ms DeVos for education secretary, for example. Knows nothing about education, simply wants it privatized, ya know, because markets.) <br><br>While I fully agree with your analysis of what was wrong with this country and what brought Trump to power, he is not the solution. He is a different sort of problem, but not completely different from the mess the neoliberals made. I could never vote for Clinton as I could not vote to reinforce the disgraceful status quo. But we'll have a serious mess on our hands soon with the bunch that is coming to power. For now, the looting will continue until morale improves. :) But I suspect this will end badly.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c2960604008600768691 title="comment permalink">11/23/16, 1:21 PM</a><br><br>

Not a guarantee, of course.<br><br>As I read this week's essay, I also considered your model with respect to internal US dynamics. By constitutional fiat, states cannot regulate interstate commerce -- though what exactly this means is open to debate -- which restricts their ability to control for the kinds of effects you mention. We have, of course, seen the very things you've described occur -- companies register in DE b/c of favorable laws, banks have operations in ND b/c they can "export" usurious interest rates, production shifts to right-to-work states w/o unions, etc. I wonder if this is not another element of internal conflict that continues to slowly build within the structure of our federal system. Of course, the analogy is not exact, as there is that overarching federal representation for the disaffected which is not present in the international case you described.

In the current era, the US has maintained an effective empire in Latin America but less so in Asia, and the balance of power continues to shift.<br><br>In the absence of empire, the low-wage countries that dominate production will eventually leverage this for economic advantage. China is the best example currently, as more and more Chinese manufacturers are selling directly to the global market rather than producing goods for US corporations. Furthermore, control of manufacturing in a free trade market allows for the sort of "dumping" you describe - market manipulation to drive foreign competitors out of business. <br><br>The resulting trend of wealth creation ultimately advantages corporations that directly control production (i.e. those in manufacturing nations) over corporations in wealthy nations that subcontract production elsewhere and siphon off the majority of the profits. Thus the exponential trend of Chinese buyouts of US corporations, e.g. http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/09/chinese-firms-go-on-a-buying-spree-for-american-companies.html<br><br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c7056030177358474332 title="comment permalink">11/23/16, 2:47 PM</a><br><br>

In the absence of political control over low-wage nations, however, free trade also allows these nations to gain control over production and sell directly to consumers worldwide, undercutting corporations in high-wage nations that are dependent on outsourcing and generating sufficient capital to ultimately bankrupt and/or buy out the competition. <br><br>The endgame of this would appear to be a shift of global economic power from the US and Europe to China and southeast Asia, which is well underway. Once that happens, free trade policies will enable a now-high-wage China to extract wealth from a now-low-wage America. This is already beginning, as we are exporting raw natural resources like timber and grain - at rock bottom prices - to China and Japan for processing into goods that are sold worldwide. <br><br>I think our current movement away from free trade - though couched as a populist movement to garner political support from the frustrated and disenfranchised - is actually being driven by a growing cadre of the corporate elite who are seeing where this is going. Two questions then arise:<br><br>1. If it is now in our interest to abolish free trade and in China's interest to continue it, does China have enough political/economic/military clout to enforce its interest over ours? and<br><br>2. If a movement away from free trade in the US is driven not by populism but by a corporate elite, will that movement ultimately succeed in improving the lot of the working class?<br><br>As for the first question, I don't know the answer. For the second, I would postulate that yes, rejection of free trade will of necessity ultimately restore an equilibrium that allows workers to afford the products of corporations. I don't see that happening, however, without a massive collapse of speculative investment wealth followed by an extended depression/recession. Such a recession may of course provide overseas corporations with an opportunity to exploit American labor, in which case we effectively become a third-world country. Perhaps a careful crafting of trade barriers can prevent that...<br><br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c1385371124314478289 title="comment permalink">11/23/16, 2:47 PM</a><br><br>

Protectionism is also a much less attractive option for a small, densely-populated country heavily dependent on international trade than it is for a continent-wide nation like the USA that is still rich in natural resources and has a huge internal market.

Most people only have their labor to trade, but if their nation's real wages are depressed, they either have to suffer or move. If they move, including illegally, it brings suffering to their families and sometimes the cultures they move into. It causes social tension. Few cultures, if any, are so cosmopolitan that they can accept large numbers of immigrants without tension or even violence. <br><br>These forces don't just apply to "rich" countries. Under NAFTA, US corn undercut Mexican corn. Yes, labor was and is cheaper per man-hour in Mexico, but highly mechanized and subsidized US farmed corn cost much less labor per bushel. It drove rural Mexican farmers and farm laborers out of work, and they migrated to the USA for jobs. They undercut lower-skilled US laborers and began changing the culture of smalltown America, even as better jobs in manufacturing went to Mexico first, and then to even cheaper labor markets in China and the rest.<br><br>Lessons?<br>1. Laborers have much less flexibility than capital to adapt, and so the potential for wage depression, migration, and suffering is greater under free trade.<br>2. As migrants and jobs shift around faster than labor can adapt, potential for inter-labor and cross-cultural conflict is heightened.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c966328110594079925 title="comment permalink">11/23/16, 3:36 PM</a><br><br>

I've just downloaded Autour et al. and will be reading it as time permits. As for the role of central banks, how would you explain the fact that stock market crashes came more frequently before the Fed was created than they have since that time? The stock market crashes of 1873, 1893, 1896, 1901, and 1907 took place when interest rates were completely unregulated, and that of 1873 ushered in a depression comparable to the one in the 1930s, the Long Depression.

I wonder, though, whether the people who insist that trade barriers failed in Ireland in the 1930s have really thought through the other factors at work. When your nation has just pried itself loose from an empire that spent most of a thousand years stripping it to the bare walls, and then piles the costs of a bitter civil war on top of the revolution that won it its independence, at a time when the global economy has gone gurgling down the drain -- why, yes, you're in for hard times no matter what!<br><br>As for the left's insistence that protectionism causes war, here again, they've missed the point that free trade also drives down wages...<br><br>Mark, as I see it, it's not an either-or thing. Most political issues are supported by a lot of people for a lot of different reasons. So, yes, there are likely to be affluent interests supporting an end to free trade, but there are also populist groups with the same agenda, just as the proponents of free trade come from various points on the income spectrum and have different reasons for supporting it. <br><br>JacGolf, look at the way the free movement of laborers across national boundaries has pushed down wages in Britain. Whether you move the jobs to the low-wage workers or the low-wage workers to the jobs, the result is a decrease in wages. <br><br>Bicosse, whatever the pro-Brexit Tory politicians thought, there's good reason to think that a lot of the voters who chose "Leave" were acting on a clear sense of the way membership in the EU drove down their wages and increased the disparity in income distribution -- though they'd have phrased it differently! <br><br>Vanholio, there's one set of problems with free trade when the laborers can move, and another when they can't. Your own example shows that letting people move from one country to another en masse has its own cascading problems. <br><br>Bill, why, yes, I remember that too. It's funny how many policies that people want used to be Democratic policies, until the Democrats turned their back on their old constituencies...<br><br>Inohuri, yes, it's true. The trade agreements are intended to give corporations the power to overrule national governments. That's another reason they need a good stout wooden stake driven through their hearts. <br><br>Shane, I think it comes from the same place as the frantic insistence that voters couldn't possibly have voted for him. <br><br>Tom, exactly.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c6526705590606893421 title="comment permalink">11/23/16, 5:06 PM</a><br><br>

Manufacturing that is easy to automate is in the process of being returned to the US, but without the labor that goes with it. I'm aware that technology has been replacing workers since the beginning of the industrial age, but in the past, technology had also led to enough new jobs appearing that the surplus labor could find somewhere else to work. Today, however, this does not appear to be happening: Google has a greater market capitalization than GM did in its heyday, but less than 10% of its workforce, and other tech companies are even worse. Furthermore, they don't spin off anything like the number of programming or tech support jobs that auto manufacturing created in its satellite industries such as auto repair. All the while, they are actually succeeding at eliminating jobs, and now that self-driving vehicles and machine vision are becoming cost-effective, there is a substantial chance that truck drivers and many clerical jobs will be eliminated as well. <br><br>I'm not disputing that we will eventually end up in an age of scarcity industrialism and a new demand for human labor, but we don't seem to be headed there quite yet, at least for the owners of capital. Are we simply headed toward an era of steadily increasing long-term unemployment no matter what is done with respect to trade policy? I do recall the idea you presented in Retrotopia to switch the tax incentives so that capital used for automation is taxed while human labor is incentivized, but even this seems that it would only slow automation a little bit.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c3984110549923445519 title="comment permalink">11/23/16, 6:21 PM</a><br><br>

Unhindered trade within the US has not caused excessive impoverishment, though it does exist. Before objecting that the polity of the US does not constitute a “free trade agreement” across states, consider that the US GDP is nearly that of the EU with 28 nations, and we have several states that on their own would constitute global economic powers. With a third of the global output, the free trade within the US is massive and effectual. <br><br>The real question is why can’t we produce the same result at the international level? As you alluded to, it is in large part a dissonance between the economic reach of corporations versus the political reach of nations. This dissonance allows international companies to arbitrage such things as labor, workforce regulations, and environmental regulations. The outsourcing of manufacturing jobs had as much to do with regulations as it did with labor costs. In some ways, you can say we exported our pollution to China.<br><br>I disagree that is it simply a race to the bottom for corporate economic inputs. If that were the case, then countries like China would have a stagnant wage level while the developed world sinks down to that level. Instead, average yearly wages in China have increased 100-fold in the last 50 years. Granted, that’s still only about a quarter of US average annual wages, but the point sometime in the future where wage levels equalize will be vastly above where the Chinese were when the US normalized relations in the 1970s. From the wealthy nation’s perspective, it’s a depressing erosion of a standard of living. From the developing nation’s perspective, it’s an overall rise in a standard of living. The continual rise in global product per capita until 2008 reinforces the general improvement in global living conditions.<br><br>Your essay looks at the two top dogs of their eras, both empires, both with the global reserve currencies. In the beginning of both periods, companies in each country aggressively expanded international market share, creating a relatively short period of high growth and profitability, allowing generous wage packages. This period was also marked by increase national trade surpluses. The second half of both were marked by increased competition abroad, declining wage packages and national trade deficits enabled by having the global reserve currency. Could this have been changed by a more nationalistic trade policy? Doubtful. Much of British and US foreign policy has been about expanding the economic reach of domestic companies. Markets that weren’t open peaceably were forcibly opened (e.g. The Opium Wars) since corporations and governments were aligned in their quest for progress and power. And the foreign markets, once opened, allowed corporations to start arbitraging labor, regulations, and resources, thus leading to the hollowing out and decline of the imperial power.<br><br>I seriously doubt that the Trump administration’s trade policy will make much difference in the erosion of US wages. Yes, Ford did decide not to move a major assembly plant to Mexico, a worthy victory in and of itself. However, we will not return to the halcyon days of the 1950s when the US was practically the sole industrial economy in the world, despite any campaign slogans.<br><br>Trade policies can’t fix the systemic problems facing the US. If anything, free trade allowed the illusion of progress to hang around a couple more decades. Now the bills are coming due, and no trade policy will prevent the coming depression (or erosion of our standard of living, if you like). At this point, I think the best trade policies will be ones that reduce the length of supply lines as much as possible, both internationally and domestically. Consider it a variation on your "collapse now" theme put into trade terms.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c8069782575490386966 title="comment permalink">11/23/16, 8:14 PM</a><br><br>

His post at<br><br>http://fofoa.blogspot.com/2014/12/global-stagnation.html?commentPage=1<br> attributes the US’s serial bubbles to a decrepit int’l system, whereby the Dollar’s status as the world’s Reserve Currency HINDERS FOREIGN capital markets’ efforts to raise funds to build their economies! (You might Wiki “exorbitant privilege”, “Triffin’s dilemma”, and “Managed float”, otherwise known as “dirty float”.)<br><br>(Like you, he predicted a Trump victory.) He charges that he US investing public gets Over, since foreigners hoard their extra $$ (coming from the US’ trade deficit) into bubble-ish US Assets (Treasuries, stocks etc.), instead of chasing up prices of real goods/ services here, or being steered into local enterprises better understood by these foreigners. These foreigners are steered into US gov’t and Wall St. etc. instruments which they don’t much understand, thereby encouraging diversion of capital from productive investment into speculation, which leads to bubbles and waste of resources:<br><br> “… investing requires active specialization, and should therefore not be a passive activity. That naturally-passive, risk-averse savers are a large and distinct group, separate from investors, traders and speculators, and that only in the present dollar-based international monetary and financial system… are they forced to swim with the sharks.”<br><br>FOFOA argues that world Central Banks have been propping up US markets when investors (temporarily) fled busted bubbles, but are tiring of this. Will the US Deep State be able to (further) pull strings, to delay the flight of foreign capital (from these instruments) into real goods /services inflation comeuppance here? [Note that US consumers are already mostly tapped out (broken by bursted bubbles?), with Uncle Sam taking up the slack.] <br><br>Warning to gold-bug haters: FOFOA is a vehemently ANTI- Gold Standard “gold bug”, who expects gold to thrive as a store of value, when it’s free from such shackles as its being officially pegged to currencies.

That's a very important point - capitalism is a race to the bottom (for the majority). What it will reliably produce is the lowest possible income and living standards for labor.<br><br>A distinct but important point, though, is that capital is much more mobile than labor - it can move around the world in nanoseconds - and therefore, labor can never compete or reach equilibrium with capital. Essentially, capital can extort labor by threat of its sudden removal, to which labor cannot effectively respond. Even the most "efficient" (lowest paid) labor force is vulnerable.<br><br>Capitalism essentially means: you need money to make money. Which is similar to: the rich get richer. Which necessarily means: the poor get poorer. Rent - e.g. on housing or borrowed money ("interest") - is precisely this mechanism at work.<br><br>When everything is rendered in terms of $$ (human resources, natural resources, financial resources etc), you don't have an ecosystem - you have a monoculture where the few "strongest" entities live by preying on (cannibalizing) those weaker (almost everything else - animate, inanimate, etc).

The labo4r fo4rce also had a habit of becoming uppity and expecting living wages, or sneaking off to the manufacturing centers of the Midwest, especially during the latter years of that time period. Of course, you could terrorize them and hold them on the farm at literal gunpoint, but enough were successful at escaping that it created real shortages. Less draconian attempts at meeting the need were tried, including bringing in Italian, Chinese, and, of course Mexican labor. None of these tended to last more than a generation at best on the farm before discovering that they could do much better by opening restaurants, groceries, speakeasies, or body and fender shops. That's why my region to this day has a national award-winning Chinese restaurant, many fantastic Italian restaurants, and the best hot tamales in the world.<br><br>How was this dilemma finally solved? Why the planters recognized the value of a prosperous working class and started paying them livable wages. HAW, HAW, made you laugh, I'll bet. No, seriously, at about the time demand and prices began to rise as a result of WWII and the post-war boom, along came gas and then diesel tractors, cotton pickers and pesticides.<br><br>Which finally brings me to my point: Yes, I certainly agree that free trade has been disastrous to our manufacturing sector, and there is no doubt that getting back to policies that favor repatriating industry to the US could help to somewhat mitigate some of the effects of the contraction we are going to eventually be going through. If Trump or anyone else can begin that process, they will have served some purpose, anyway. But no one is talking about the effects of automation, which effects I see all around, from obvious places like the factory, to construction, where air compressors, cordless tools, and pre-fabrication have turned crews to handfuls of workers on even fairly large projects. Offices long ago began shedding secretarial and clerical positions fo4r compute4rization, and that p4rocess is well advenced. Self-driving autos are being tested, and GPS-guided automatic tractors are almost ready for adoption.<br><br>I just don't see how that process is reversed, even in an energy decline, and arguably especially in such a situation. We'4re already seeing the self-driving auto being touted as an environmental boon, and from people who ought to know better.

It is incredibly difficult to buy locally-made for most things other than food, so often I have to settle for buying imported goods from independent businesses instead, but I feel like I am heading in the right direction at least, and if we all did this, the demand for local at a fair price would transform our local economies.<br><br>In my mind the golden age of protectionism was the guild of the medieval city which set prices and working hours so that no-one had a business edge on anything other than the quality of their products.

This week it seems as if I have been reading from an Modern Money Theory Blog. Probably the time is ripe for it, as one of its proponents just finished his own 4 part series on free trade "The case against free trade": http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=34677.<br><br>Your analysis also highlights what is going wrong with especially the Eurozone in the EU as having your own currency and exchange rate offers some kind of balancing mechanism, even with free trade. Having abolished that, it is clear to see that the strong industrial power horse (Germany) destroyed the weaker economies, especially since it followed a policy of wage suppression. They don't want to see that their success depends on pushing especially the souther European states into poverty and cannot persist in the long run. Even worse they add insult to injury by blaming the laziness of the Greeks, Spanish and Italians.<br><br>My newspaper just offered the view from the British historian Harold James, who also talks about this first wave of globalization with the abolishment of the Corn Laws in 1846 until the crash in 1929. He admits that prosperity and inequality grow with globalization, both decline with protectionism. However, he laments the fact when nations abandon free trade, open borders and the growing prosperity out of psychological grounds and take the wrongheaded decision to become nationalistic and protectionist in the past and now. He admits the economic crisis but somehow cannot bring himself to question if free trade might be partially to blame.<br><br>On another note. I recently watched an interview with Putin and was surprised how much he talks, at least in translation, about interests in world politics and how little about values.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c7303638842492529323 title="comment permalink">11/24/16, 2:42 AM</a><br><br>

The Scandinavian countries (with pop. of 3-6 million each in the interwar years) did out of it create very successful welfare states. Even when Sweden and Norway was in a union 1814-1905 Norway pursued its own trade policies (the only thing that brought the union together was that both countries shared head of state and foreign policy and there were no border controls for passenger travel. Else they were separate entities, with different parliaments, currencies, military and so on). All Scandinavian countries were heavily indebted (though many of these debts were resolved when Germany went into hyperinflation in the 1920's as much capital had been borrowed from Germany. Alas the UK was a big lender there too), debt which they used to build up their industries, railways and so on. None of them had to declare any state bankruptcy though they at the turn of the last century were some of the most indebted countries in Europe.<br><br><br>If interested I recommend to read Erik Reinert ('How rich countries got rich and why poor countries stay poor' is an excellent introduction to both European and American experiences in how they became wealthy countries. Every method from industrial espionage to trade barriers to governmental policies and investment was used, just as China and India do today). Korean Ha-Joon Chang ('23 Things they don't tell you about capitalism') is another excellent writer on this subject.<br><br><br><br>Another way to look at it is: As long as you only specialize in your "best" industry, you might as well remain in the Stone Age if your "strength" consists of making stone axes (or bananas for that matter). Or to put it in another way, no expert dish washer has ever become a millionare out of it even though he might be one of the best dish washers there is.

I am an avid follower of the Student Loan Justice movement, where the organization receives countless personal testimonies by people whose lives have been utterly destroyed by the student loan scam. For example, there are many letters written by family members of a loved one who committed suicide over unpayable loans plus constant harassment from Sallie Mae bill collectors. There are many more who've attempted or at least contemplated it. Other problem is that all too often a person who thought they only borrowed 30,000 dollars to attend college somehow finds later that they owe over 100,000 due to the outright fraudulent and criminal practices the student loan industry has gotten access to through buying off politicians. This economic burden on especially the millenial generation will take some more years to play out fully (so many of them are still deferring them by going back to get second and third graduate degrees in equally useless areas) but when the bill finally all comes due, the economic burden and the reaction will make the housing bubble's aftermath look like a picnic<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c3140568034770079089 title="comment permalink">11/24/16, 8:03 AM</a><br><br>

This is a question of political power and the people have little organized power serving their interests at the moment. Individual effort at building self-sufficiency is a beginning, but at some point an organized effort must take shape to counterbalance the excesses of the elite. I haven't been exposed to the thoughts of Mao, but I remember hearing his political slogan, "All political power grows out of the barrel of a gun". This maxim seems appropriate, and points to the dilemma of those willing to use force to obtain political ends and those opposed to the use of force and violence as a means to an end. Which worldview is more successful? Which is stronger- which is able to survive over time?<br><br>In one of your previous posts you talked about the importance of interests to determine political affiliation. I am beginning to realize that this is the important foundation on which to build that countervailing force. Clearly defined principles which hold groups of people together in common interest. Truthful, and proven out by physical results- not promises of future benefits.<br>That common interest is based on living together in peace. Why is peace so difficult to achieve when it seems only a small minority of the population revels in violence and strife?<br><br>Globalism and free trade as practiced are just sublimated expressions of the desire for violence against our fellows. All this death and destruction justified by the fact that more people can have toasters and the like. The notion of a global community only makes sense if the quality of life is improved for all. Quantity in and of itself means nothing. Such an complex world.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c3347366289484511057 title="comment permalink">11/24/16, 8:40 AM</a><br><br>

The suggestion that the Trump administration's trade policies will actually test the theory and lead to greater economic equality, however, rather conspicuously elides the other two main components of his economic program: massive tax cuts for the wealthy and wholesale deregulation of the financial industry.

The point I tried to make, and I think most readers missed it, is that trade agreements only benefit the rich in the short run. In the long run, they drive down return on investment and destabilize the economic system that makes money mean anything at all. <br><br>Graeme, I tend to think of it as a matter of simple common sense. Thank you!<br><br>Ien, as I noted in the post, it's a common modern delusion to think that the only possible points on a spectrum are the two ends. I'd also point out that the best size for a nation depends vastly on issues of environment, resources, culture, etc. <br><br>Shane, luxury goods -- and imported booze is a luxury good -- always manage to find their way from place to place, so yes, you're in a good stable industry. <br><br>Drhooves, oh, granted. I'll tolerate Krugman's pretensions to omniscience when he shows that he can make an accurate prediction about future economic trends. Honestly, if he said the sun was going to rise tomorrow, I'd wonder if he was right. <br><br>Inohuri, yep. The Chinese are following historical precedent -- their previous overseas empire, in the 14th and 15th centuries, was in the Indian Ocean and the east coast of Africa. That's one of the reasons I set the key events of my novel <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> there. <br><br>Old Professor, exactly. That's another of the things a sensible tariff would do. <br><br>BobJones, if you've got major cultural and economic differences within a nation, yes, you can get the same effect unless political forces restrain it. <br><br>Grebulocities, much of what drives the push toward automation in the US is the raft of Federal tax policies that reward automation and penalize hiring workers. If you hire somebody, the government requires you to pay a raft of additional costs in addition to salary and benefits; if you automate, you don't have to pay those, and you can write off the cost of the machine as a capital expense. Get rid of the perverse incentives that subsidize automation, and we'd already be well past peak automation in the US. <br><br><br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c2399774128200570374 title="comment permalink">11/24/16, 8:15 PM</a><br><br>

No victory is complete, because the victor always goes to extremes and collapses in turn -- look at the aftermath of US victory in the Cold War as a prime example. In the same way, the temporary ascendancy of capital has created economic imbalances that are crushing return on investment and driving ever more violent turbulence in markets, with a side order of violent popular unrest. This will not end well. <br><br>Berserker, many thanks for this! Okay, that's another very useful parallel. <br><br>Zach, the Treaty of Westphalia was more than a century before the dawn of the industrial revolution, and the particular mode of nation-state more or less established at that time has been replaced twice -- in the nineteenth century, by the ethnic-linguistic nation, and in the twentieth, by the constitutional multiethnic nation. As for multinational corporations, those were a big deal in the Victorian period, too, and then went into eclipse as governments took back the powers that had been briefly lent to the business sphere. Watch what happens when US hegemony goes down; a lot of supposedly "multinational" corporations will go down, too, because they were never more than creatures of US global power. <br><br>Jay, that's also a good point, and relates to my discussion of <a href=../../2015/02/the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html rel=nofollow>the externality trap</a> in a post last year. The mere fact that we've offshored our pollution, of course, doesn't keep it from circling around to bite us in the buttocks anyway.<br><br>Dennis, delighted to hear it. You're in for a treat...<br><br>Gwizard43, that's an interesting point. I wonder if there's something in the rate of change in available net energy that encourages free-trade schemes.<br><br>Melo, you're welcome and thank you. Of course trade restrictions also have their problems -- it's characteristic of every political issue that every possible choice has downsides. <br><br>Canon Fodder, obviously I disagree, and I'd point out that your example actually disproves your claim. Wages in China have risen so fast precisely because China uses massive trade barriers and currency manipulation to protect its industries from foreign competition. Back when it had free trade policies forced on it by Western powers, it hemorrhaged wealth to London and New York, and now that money stays home and boosts the Chinese economy. That's another piece of evidence that free trade is bad policy and should be discarded. <br><br>Ondra, it's been a very long time since I did that reading, and I no longer have the book list. Can anyone else help? <br><br>Bruno, I see Venezuela as an example of what happens when you build a welfare state on the assumption that the price of oil is going to stay above $100/barrel, and it drops to a fifth of that. Good government or bad government, once you make that mistake, you're in for a world of hurt.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c1242935129230385591 title="comment permalink">11/24/16, 8:32 PM</a><br><br>

In the long term it drives down return on investment and destabilizes the entire economic system. I suspect a certain number of rich people have recognized this, which is why opposition to free trade schemes is coming up for public discussion again. <br><br>Mouse, interesting. I'll have to find time to read his site one of these days. <br><br>Talon, I notice that you've done the usual Marxist switcheroo and tried to divert a discussion of the problems with free trade to the subject of the supposed evils of capitalism. Nice try. <br><br>Max, notice that he's proposing public-private partnerships rather than straighforward public works spending for his infrastructure program. That's something a lot of anti-public spending types have historically been willing to get behind. Still, we'll see. <br><br>HalFiore, I think we're actually pretty close to peak automation, precisely because the whole system costs of increasingly baroque technology are becoming so big a burden on the economy as a whole. As I've noted repeatedly, automation makes economic sense in large part because perverse incentives in the tax code subsidize automation and penalize hiring of workers; that's starting to see some discussion -- and I expect it to become a major issue in the politics of the next couple of decades. <br><br>Nancy, I avoid tackling hedgehogs -- they get upset when you do that, and it distracts them from their proper purpose of eating slugs! ;-) That said, we'll see about some of the other economic issues. <br><br>Jose, heh. It's nice to know that the Navy has something just as breathtakingly advanced, and exactly as capable of doing its job, as the Air Force's F-35. <br><br>Lordberia3, of course they want the status quo to continue. That's why nobody protested when Obama broke his 2008 promises, kept fighting wars in the Middle East he'd promised to get us out of, and accelerated the campaign of drone strikes the Bush administration had started. It's also why nobody, but nobody, on the establishment Left got upset when Hillary Clinton demanded that the US try to impose a no-fly zone over Syria when the Russians had already announced that they'd respond with live ammo. The mainstream Left wants to protest the status quo, not to change it. <br><br>Jo, the medieval guild system evolved out of the wreckage of the Roman economy, and embodied a lot of common sense about how to stop people from gaming the system and keep goods and services available at stable prices. In the longer run, we could do worse. <br><br>Neil, again, you're missing the point that trade barriers don't mean a complete halt to trade -- they mean that any good or service that can be produced within a country's borders has preferential access to that country's markets, and each country trades its surplus product to other countries in exchange for things that can't be produced locally. Imagine free trade at one end of a spectrum, and no trade at all on the other end. Sensible trade policy is somewhere in between.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c6767065673745401876 title="comment permalink">11/24/16, 8:52 PM</a><br><br>

It's been a while since I read Ricardo, and I'd forgotten that detail. <br><br>Kristofv, exactly. The EU is a classic example of a badly designed free trade system; the systematic impoverishment of southern Europe for the benefit of Germany and a few other northern European nations will eventually cause enough political turmoil to bring down governments and force the withdrawal of the south from the system. As for Putin, exactly; he's speaking the language of politics, while our politicians are stuck in feel-good abstractions. <br><br>Robert, yes, but the interesting thing is that within a single country a variety of balancing factors come into play. For example, outside the big cities the cost of living tends to be a lot lower -- and yes, there are also various ways of redistributing wealth through the political process. <br><br>Mark, it depends on whether you've got significant cultural and economic differences between the regions. If so, you're going to have some of the same problems -- as indeed the US has had with its southern states, which are very different in cultural and economic terms than the rest of the country. <br><br>Barrabas, exactly.

I'll have to look into Correa's policies; they might well be a useful template for other nations, such as mine. <br><br>Herbert, a very good point.

I'd be delighted to see this piece in Japanese, or in any other language, for that matter. <br><br>Donalfagan, we'll just have to see, now won't we? <br><br>JimBob, another good example. <br><br>NZ, the point I tried to make, which you and almost everyone else seem to have missed, is that free trade only benecits the rich in the short term.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership, comes to mind which is also know is the everyone-but-China treaty. Obama came straight out and said that its purpose was that the US would write the rules of the trade rules in this region. I suspect that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership too is simply a way to destroy any chance of a Vladivostok to Lisbon trade route being formed. That "imagined continent", by the way, sounded like an awful lot like Europe.<br> JMG's suggestion that "that there may be unexpected benefits, even today, to a nation that extracts itself from free trade agreements and puts a well-planned set of trade restrictions in place" is already underway. Ever since the west launched an economic war against Russia two years ago this appears to be happening. Yes, there is a lot of pain but the Russians are substituting local goods and services in lieu of cheap imports fueled by cheap loans. They appear to be investing too in those goods that that they have not manufactured for a very long time as well as an financial infrastructure to back it up. The sanctions will of course continue until Russia hands back Crimea to the Ukraine but as this region has been a part of Russia since 1783 when America become an independent country, America is more likely to hand back Texas to Mexico.<br> Perhaps the worst of it is that those neoliberal economists that push for things such as free trade and the like still command an audience is spite of massive amounts of empirical evidence that their theories do not work in the real world.

Sort of, not on free trade per say but on the export of manufactured goods.<br><br> Prior to the steam engine shipping was expensive and dangerous. Over land was very time consuming and over sea was risky. Trade was primarily in items that could not be obtained locally, ivory, silk, spices, metals, etc. because the shipping costs far exceeded the production costs for most items. It made little sense to buy a piece of furniture or clothing from far away even if the far away place could produce it more cheaply if the freight cost was twice the value of the product.<br><br> Industrialized transport changed that. As shipping costs fell the competitive advantage of a country became more and more important. Just as a thought experiment consider the steal market in the USA. China and the USA compete in the steal industry. US steal is made from US ore and US coal and Chinese steal is made from Brazilian ore and Chinese/Australian coal. In the present shipping environment they are roughly competitive in the American market. Now imagine those commodities, coal and ore, and the finished product, steal where shipped on tiny wooden vessels that took much longer to travel with large crews and small cargo spaces that often got lost at sea.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c7929682407035446060 title="comment permalink">11/24/16, 10:13 PM</a><br><br>

Prices determine what human activities are worth - especially in highly monetized societies such as the West. It is a way of punishing or rewarding individuals into doing what others in the economy would like them to be doing.<br><br>If a nation (or even a tribe) can control its own prices, it can control its own values. If it cannot, its values will be forced upon it from outside. <br><br>And now we understand why they call it "economic warfare". (of course, prices are not the ONLY way to impose values on a country from outside -- when this is not an option, invading armies have done the job) <br><br>With large, multinational free trade deals, a country's control over its values is ceded, partly to the tastes of the citizens of other countries (the values of human activities will become closer to the "average" of the values systems of the different countries), and partly to the multi-national organizations that control and oversee the terms and implementation of the free trade deals.<br><br>Once such deals are implemented, citizens are no longer able to put pressure on their own governments to control the values of daily life, because the people who are in control are unelected and hard to reach. And, perhaps, that is the real reason why these large free trade deals tend to lead to rising income inequality - it is only one of many other values that citizens become no longer able to control.<br><br>It's an idea I had, anyway.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c5034230586004327340 title="comment permalink">11/24/16, 10:26 PM</a><br><br>

It is "cheaper" for me to order toilet paper (an example of a commonly-bought and generic item) from Amazon — where it is delivered to my door at virtually no-charge for shipping/handling — than to drive cross-town to buy the same item at my drugstore, grocery store, or Walmart store. The UPS, FedEx and USPS trucks make regular deliveries every day to several houses on my block — I hear and watch the trucks from my home-office windows. The main difference is that my drugstore, grocery store, and Walmart store do not have couriers that deliver to my door, much less deliver at no-charge. (For argument's sake, I am leaving out Walmart.com.) At Amazon, returns are no-charge to me. I often wonder at what point UPS, FedEx and USPS shipments to/from Amazon will no longer be dirt-cheap. When I had to make a return to JCPenney, it cost me $15 (expensive); because of the relatively high-cost of returning something to JCP, I only buy from them once in awhile — if and when I really need an item that I can't find elsewhere.<br><br>I am located in the San Francisco Bay Area bubble.

The Boomer generation, including myself, made no impact whatsoever. I compare photos of the multitudes at the 1969 Woodstock Music and Art Fair to Boomers' current lack of retirement savings, and really, all I can say is "What goes around, comes around." We expected our parents would take care of us forever, and were foolish not to see that our parents would all be dead by year 2000, and after that, we were on our own. What can we rely on now?

Most of the problems with these machines are the byzantine complexity of them and the sheer overload of tasks they're expected to accomplish. They're chock full of "seeing eye" lasers that track everything. Here are the steps of the palletizer: an arm pushes a pallet out onto a platform (actually, this is a two-step process), boxes enter via conveyor onto a platform where they're oriented in a row based on a pattern to fit on the pallet. An arm shoves the boxes onto another shelf where the layer is arranged for the pallet. Another arm shoves the layer onto the pallet being created. Then, a retractable floor retracts, putting the layer on the pallet. The pallet is on a spinning platform that spins the pallet around shrink wrap as the pallet is being created. Finally, once the requisite layers are put on the pallet and shrink-wrapped, the completed pallet is shoved out for removal by forklift. All of this is accomplished by an army of seeing-eye lasers and Windows-based computing. A frequent problem is boxes going in at odd angles, throwing off the whole pattern. Recently, one of the lasers on the arm that pushes the empty pallet into place got out of joint, so the machine didn't "know" where it was and it broke the chain controlling it.<br>The labeler puts front, back, side, and top labels on bottles, and puts a laser code on the bottle as well. Again, this is accomplished by an army of seeing-eye lasers. The machine is supposed to "know" the orientation of the bottle and flip it if it's not in the right position (this is a frequent source of problems). It frequently breaks bottles.<br>Needless to say, the byzantine complexity of all this computerized, laser guided robotics is it's achilles heel, and I'm just a "little person", so who am I to suggest that this expensive piece of metal is a fracking piece of shale? Meanwhile, the mechanical, non-digital, non laser-guided, 1950s filler is the workhorse, happily squirting whisky into bottles. Everyone talks about how we don't have qualified operators to run the complex machines, and how they would only work well if only we had a dedicated operator, but that just defeats the purpose of having an automated machine, right?<br>The palletizer is made by TopTier of Portland, Ore. and the labeler is made by an Italian firm, Kosme.

Further, the infrastructure that gets destroyed by those munitions also can be rebuilt, generating profit for those who rebuild it.<br><br>In peacetime, you don't have this destruction, and so you don't have the opportunity to funnel money at this scale to munitions makers. <br><br>That said, Frédéric Bastiat used the parable of the broken window (check out the wikipedia page) to argue that destruction is not actually a net benefit societally. In other words, he argued that destruction only redirected profits - one sector benefits, while (often hidden) costs are imposed on other sectors.

An essay by Bunker <i>Natural Values and the Physical Inevitability of Uneven Development under Capitalism</i> sets the scene for much of the current reality of a partially industrialised world, including for example the USA and other ‘advanced’ economies current ability every day to import large resources of necessary raw materials including much from undeveloped extractive economies: Bunker in <i>Rethinking Environmental History</i>, Eds. Alf Hornberg et al, 2007. Bunker makes the obvious point that “… industrial modes of production depend on [this] self-depleting form of extractive activity … [these modes] have evolved the ability to change … [and] find substitutes for essential resources as these are depleted. This process is necessarily finite …” <br><br>Recent substitution has enabled the import by the ‘advanced economies’ of finished goods from industrialising ‘export-led’ economies. These like the extractive economies cannot consume all they produce. Considering the underlying industrial modes of production, and the resources on which these modes depend, globalisation seems to be a self-depleting and necessarily finite process, which brings forward the problems of financing not just expansion, but increasingly maintenance of our modern daily life.<br><br>best <br>Phil H<br><br><br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c7667872543973376083 title="comment permalink">11/25/16, 5:54 AM</a><br><br>

How much of this post came almost verbatim from "The Great Transformation" by Kari Polanyi? It was published in 1944, and suffers from his then-still-plausible conviction that Communism was viable, but is nevertheless a solid examination of market realities versus theories. The reality is that in the short term, everyone participates in the market, exchanging goods and services and prospers, but over time, through bad luck or bad choices, some participants are forced to drop out. <br> <br>I made the obvious (at least to me) conclusion that the fundamental flaw in all these complex trade agreements (any agreement 400+ pages long is NOT free trade!) has been the deliberate exclusion of any consideration of work conditions, human beings (i.e. worker rights), and environmental effects. I believe that were these aspects accounted for, then increased trade does increase wealth, because the only thing that could be traded would be either excellent products or scarce materials. As Buckminster Fuller commented a skilled machinist in Tijuana should be paid the same as an equally skilled machinist in Kamchatka in a truly global economy.

Restraint on individual behaviour is imposed externally in tribal cultures, inculcated internally by highly-complex civilized cultures. <br>So-called Free Trade deals are sold to people by appealing to the purr-word "freedom" that hooks directly into the cravings of the ego with the promise -- demonstrably true in the very short term -- of plentiful, cheap goods.

One of them commented that he was eager for this day so that he and others of his generation could finally get a chance to "truly live." <br><br>So I wondered to him and all the rest, if this is the true life you desire, what is stopping you from living it RIGHT NOW?

Yes, I suppose that I needed to get my pet rant out of my system first.<br><br>Your main point, that in the long term, even the elite suffer under so-called free trade, due to... wait, I just said "long-term." ;)<br><br>Our economic system has become little more than a roving (marauding) band of pirates looking for anything of value to strip off and carry away. The fact that eventually there will be nothing left to pilfer is of little concern to them, since piracy is inherently a short-term proposition; a response to a ready supply of defenseless wealth to plunder. Globalized trade, viewed through this lens, is simply the "cover story" spun for this particular act of piracy. And globalized trade is simply the inter-continental version of the same scam playing out under a variety of names here at home: i.e. securitization, deregulation, privatization...<br><br>In every case, the big money goes to the first guy to have the guts to kick open the doors and "unlock" the wealth built up. Be that the M&amp;A pirates of the 1980's who destroyed countless companies, the S&amp;L buccaneers who turned banking into gambling, the mortgage pirates of the 2000's, the privatization pirates, the offshoring craze, etc. Each of these examples is of relatively stable stores of wealth being raided in various fashion. With privatization, wealth is taken via appropriation of public assets and seizing captive markets at bargain prices. With M&amp;A, by breaking norms and changing laws to pilfer pensions, monetize brand goodwill, and sell off accumulated knowledge and expertise, while sucking off interest and consulting fees. With mortgages, by liquidating equity and converting the act of home investment into leveraged home arbitrage. Globalization, really, is just an extension of the M&amp;A craze (hello Gordon Gecko) played out globally. It is the economic equivalent of strip-mining. Of over-grazing. Indeed. They take too much out of the system without putting anything back in.<br><br>My point here is mainly that the arguments in favor of globalization are really just put there by the elite for convenience. And as evidence mounts that those justifications don't hold water, the elite will glibly change the rationalization, without so much as a backwards glance.<br><br>One argument that I do find interesting to contemplate more, is that nations that trade together tend to fight each other less frequently.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c5875925950356247823 title="comment permalink">11/25/16, 7:51 AM</a><br><br>

Because the euro belongs to all the countries in the eurozone, it also, in a manner of speaking, belongs to none of them. The upshot of this is that all of those governments have to borrow money in what is effectively another country's currency. Normal countries that have their own currencies such as the United States, Switzerland, and Japan can just finance the debts they run up by printing more of their currency. Of course, doing so carries risks of its own if done to great excess (as the United States and Japan will learn to their chagrin once interest rates drift back to something more normal from being almost zero percent), but being completely unable to do this will inevitably hamstring national economies whose governments are so bound.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c3640217719574298483 title="comment permalink">11/25/16, 9:17 AM</a><br><br>

What I said then was how struck I was by the comments about health care in the States and how shocking I found it to read about the cost of insurance as well as trips to the doctor for a basic screening or minor treatment, which for me in the UK is free –though of course I now know to use that word advisedly –in that while I’m not the one directly forking out the cash, of course it is not actually free. But reading those stories it really struck me that these are in fact collapse stories and US decline is actually happening for those able to see it. <br><br>In other news: <br><br>Oswald Spengler has had a mention in the Guardian: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/15/trumpism-solution-crisis-neoliberalism-robert-skidelsky and I am noticing a few commentators to Guardian articles starting to reflect on the cyclical nature of history. <br><br>Also in the Guardian https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/25/13-crises-we-face-trump-soil-loss-global-collapse it looks like George Monbiot has reached despair on the cycle of grief with a doom laden report on his (13) horsemen of the apocalypse –many of which are ascribed to Trump. He does get quite a lot, especially on soil depletion where he quotes a UN report saying we are 60 harvests away from soil collapse, but has yet to join all the dots (I love that thanks to your blog I am now critiquing all these high falutin commentators), especially regarding failing to see any equivalence in the war making propensity of Trump advisers (Michael Flynn) versus Democrat advisors (Victoria Nuland), and most especially his failure to address energy depletion and the steady decline in EROI, certainly for oil. I felt he was having his red pill moment (the Matrix) but he still has some way to go as he top lined the wrong question at the end of his article, going with ‘Can we stop this?’ rather than ‘What do we need to do to get through it’. And one comment signposted to you which is good, –and a noticeably civil signposting it was too, Guardian comments can get polarized and spittle flecked very quickly indeed! <br><br>So thank you for your work, time to put some money in you hat.

That's another way it contributes to economic decline, as the effects of resource peaking come into play.<br><br>I started noticing around 15 years ago how the bars of soap that one receives in hotels began to get smaller and smaller. Useta be you'd get a mini-bar of soap and a couple of shampoo bottles in your bathroom free with any hotel stay, which were substantial enough that the soap would last you another week if you took it home (and you'd often get a second, spare bar). Useta be a little free perq you received as a gift for staying at that hotel. Around that time I noticed the bars of soap were getting smaller and thinner. These days the bar of soap is about the size of a half-dollar, and roughly as thin. There is no possible way to unwrap these tiny slivers of soap from the paper packaging without fracturing the soap. After umpteen times doing this, cracking the soap in half while unwrapping it, I noticed on the label: "Made In China".<br><br>So this fleck of soap has travelled many thousands of miles, at untold cost in petroleum, cushioned carefully so it doesn't break during 30-foot swells on container ships, all so that it can snap in my hands in California at the slightest breath? Are there no soap-makers in California who could be producing this stuff, must even our most basic toilet needs be manufactured in some distant Empire so that the local hotel can shave one-sixteenth of a penny off of its soap costs??<br><br>Political gadfly Ted Rall put it well in a column many years ago: "The purpose of trade remains the same as it was in the days of Marco Polo -- to exchange something you make for something you don't already have. Trade for its own sake is wasteful and inefficient." Sure bring me tea leaves from Zanzibar and beer from Czechoslovakia, but there's no damn reason we can't make soap and tennis shoes here at home.

That's sarcasm mind you. I am probably one of the few who see this as a liberal argument. Of course very few liberals in the public sphere have a single clue about these matters. Then again Liberals in the public sphere were responding to the 'market' to make a buck and since the 'market' demands neoliberalism of various flavors or neo classical economics which has relentlessly been morphing into neoliberalism a sort of vicious circle emerged. Espousing free trade elicited jobs providing readers, listeners and even elections and this 'market' reward encouraged ever stronger support for free trade. Thus with economics taken care of the tattered remains of Liberalism devoted itself to gender issues and that's about it. <br><br>One odd aspect of the marriage of liberalism and neoliberalism is that liberals insist that liberals refuse to believe that there is such a thing as neoliberalism. Go figure.<br><br>Conservatives have their own sins in this regard. Free trade isn't conservative but at least championing it provided a 'conservative' result. That being the wealthy and powerful got more wealth and power and at least conservatives were not shy about getting that, as opposed to liberals who pretended against 30 plus years of evidence that free trade benefited everyone. Then too free trade delivered another conservative result, of the none Burke variety anyway. That being a stagnating lower middle class and an expanding lower class. I know JMG doesn't buy that conservatives want a large lower class.

Not so easy.<br><br>About a year ago, I read a book about this process called "Factory Man: How One Furniture Maker Battled Offshoring, Stayed Local - And Helped Save An American Town." (Beth Macy, 2014). As I remember, this is a book about the Bassett Furniture Company (Virginia.) First you need a certain percentage of companies in your industry to bring a suit, along with you. Not so easy when most of the other American furniture companies were closing factories, laying off workers and importing cheap Chinese furniture. Many lawyers are involved. It's an expensive and protracted process. You're dealing with sluggish and disinterested government agencies. <br><br>Me, if I need a piece of furniture, I head for the local auction house. The bottom has dropped out of the antique furniture market. A run of the mill, circa 1900 oak china cupboard went for $850 to $1,200 ten years ago. In the last couple of years I've seen several go for $200. <br><br>When I was in the old tat biz, I first noticed the impact in the niche market of quilts.

After all, they don't get full-up live testing every day, only during carefully scripted exercises or when there's an actual emergency.<br><br>A main circuit breaker is racked out for maintenance? The computer doesn't know how to re-route power, because nobody told the programmer to consider that possibility, and the generator sits there burning diesel but doing nothing. A ventilation grate is jammed shut? The generator overheats and shuts down. If you're lucky, it didn't catch fire or spray boiling coolant everywhere, and you can re-start it after you clear the jam and wait for it to cool down. <br><br>Heck, some tiny relay in a control panel comes loose, and the system can't automatically open the circuit breaker protecting the generator when the power comes back on. The generator's alternator turns into a great big electric motor trying to spin the diesel engine backwards. Hopefully some other emergency relay cuts in, or you have a big mess. This could have been prevented if the system was wired up fail-safe (the breaker automatically opens if the relay comes loose), but that's harder to set up and debug, you need to run more wires around, and you need to inspect things more often. Too expensive. We didn't budget for that, and it wasn't specified in the contract. Someone else's problem. Take the money and run.<br><br>Those are all examples of messes someone else made and I had to go clean up. Outside of special cases with extremely close oversight, nobody does a whole-system analysis. The programming is just "do A, then do B, then do C". If B fails, the computer throws its hands in the air and walks away. Most of the time, there's no usable manual controls, just a basic system for the monthly "does the engine start" test, an emergency shutdown button, and "call the idiots who installed this thing". That doesn't do much good when the sewage containment system is already full and dumping into the river.<br><br>Oh, and some MBA decided this thing had to be connected to the internet, so the facilities manager could log in from home instead of having a night shift at the plant. An eighth-grader could knock the thing offline with point-and-click tools if he wanted to, but nobody would see how cool he is, so he's hacking his friends' Facebook accounts instead. I sure hope China's cyberwarfare department is busy trying to hack the Pentagon instead of all these little systems....<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c9024460442166475268 title="comment permalink">11/25/16, 11:44 AM</a><br><br>

An introductory economics course usually includes the explanation of the benefits of free trade from comparative advantage which you may want to include in your discussion. But you are right to put this in a broader societal and political framework. An individual country can't only make high-tech products because it will have a low skill part of its population that can't participate in that industry. But I am not sure the trade barriers solve the problem cleanly. In advanced economies, trade barriers will increase prices of many products. That will make incentives to manufacture locally, but those incentives will often be met with solutions that rely on automation, and we still end up without employment for low skills workers. And free trade does have benefits in making countries interdependent decreasing incentives for war and in offering markets that poor nations can tap to raise their economies. So I agree that we really need to evaluate the benefits/drawback of free trade. I am open to being convinced that trade barriers are a good solution. I think I already support them in some cases like restricting rapid capital flows and stabilizing industries so that employment patterns change over human lifetimes and not over a few years. But the broad claim that products should be produced locally to maintain wage/price balance is going to require more empirical evidence rather than rhetorical evidence to convince me.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c4334194708957958284 title="comment permalink">11/25/16, 3:17 PM</a><br><br>

However, It is not the rich who are offering resistance to the trade deals, it is the disenfranchised who have finally reached a breaking point and are making their voices heard, one way or another. This disenfranchisement is beginning to reach into the upper reaches of the professional class and they might have a stronger voice, and more financial resources to make a difference in protecting their interests, but it will mean nothing if vast swaths of the poor are left behind in the process. What I was trying to express was the need to break the cycle of short term thinking and at the same time the need to protect oneself from the predations of the rich. I interpret the break we see in the wealthy as some see the coming class conflict storm and wish to avoid direct conflict by making concessions and those that would relish open conflict. The open conflict side is winning.<br>There is no acknowledgement in the failure of corporatism, just the fantasies that a technological/bureaucratic solution will be found to soften the inherent inhumanity. All the while, slowly, behind the scenes, people struggle to improve their lives with varying degrees of success. The difficulty is that all this effort is still disjointed and still encumbered by a belief in the capitalist system. Profit must be taken out of the social equation.<br><br>A tariff laden, protectionist economic policy only makes sense if it is designed to protect the well being of the citizenry of the nation. But this prescription is not capitalism so will not happen or thwarted by all costs. The golden age of protectionism in America was designed to protect industry, not its people. At that time, it worked because what was good for industry was also good for the citizenry- luddites excepted- in raising the living standards of citizens and had a believable promise of future prosperity. This process has run its course and no longer delivers prosperity broadly. The failure of rhetoric alone to continue convincing people to support the globalist corporate movement seems to be a turning point. If Trump fails to deliver prosperity or some sort of stability to the working class, or only delivers crony capitalism, anything is possible. Now, unless the owners of industry somehow change their view from the purpose of industry is to deliver profits alone into their pockets, to purposeful utility for the community, what we will have is a multitude of exploitive fiefdoms, supported and protected by the government- the rest be damned. That is a recipe for violent overthrow or mass destruction at the very least. It is not a free society or a democracy.<br><br>Economic stability is the foundation on which all is built. Right now, free and open markets are failing the test of stability. My hope is that enough people of means can be convinced of the importance of a broader social vision based on stability broadly interpreted- not just for the few. You have a great mastery of history, while my understanding is very limited, but is seems to me the rich always remain on top one way or another. At the very worst, they will rebrand or rename themselves to begin a new cycle after a fall or crash. This rise is based on aggressiveness and the willingness to use violence in all its forms to achieve goals. These traits do not serve a resource starved world at all. Crony capitalists still feed off the population, whether national or international. It just kicks the can further down the road.<br><br>Jared Diamond spoke to this in his book Collapse. A leadership class that fails to find the proper accommodation with the environment and their neighbors only gains the privilege of dying last. This is the perversion of public/ private partnerships stressed today by those in power. It is the latest form of exploitation designed primarily to maintain the position of the wealthy to the detriment of the majority of the population. Kick the can down the road.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c6674284126597755618 title="comment permalink">11/25/16, 4:13 PM</a><br><br>

Free trade was the banner under which the British Empire extracted wealth from the rest of the planet, and then it became the banner under which the United States did exactly the same thing. I've talked about that at length in previous posts and my book <i>Decline and Fall</i>; this time, I simply wanted to focus on a different dimension -- the fact that even aside from the geopolitical dimension, free trade schemes don't do what they claim to do. As for the proper disposition of neoliberal economists, I'd simply like to require them to abandon their careers of intellectual prostitution and get honest work. There are a lot of highways that need repairing, for a start... ;-)<br><br>Tim, that's more or less my understanding, though there was also some transport of bulk products such as grain -- the last sailing routes that remained profitable for tall ships, for example, brought grain from Australia to Europe. <br><br>Esn, I discussed that point back a while ago on this blog -- the posts in question went into my book <i>The Wealth of Nature</i>.

I really don't know how that's going to fall out.

Not a bad bit of prophecy, all things considered. <br><br>Malcolm, I won't dispute the piratical nature of much of modern economic activity. That's very common in history once limits to growth make it impossible to make a fortune through productive economic activity, and it plays a large role in driving the decline and fall of the civilization that permits it. Under some circumstances, the political sphere can slap restrictions on it -- consider the way that Russia under Putin shut out the multinationals with extreme prejudice -- and at this point, to my mind, that's the one chance we've got of slowing down the decline. <br><br>Varun, you seem to be falling into the trap of believing that the only alternative to free trade is no trade at all.

However, if India and China are any example I wouldn't count on people curbing their appetites. You would be surprised at the amount of misery people will put up with to get at their baubles. <br><br>Regards,<br><br>Varun<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c4400928620695809110 title="comment permalink">11/25/16, 6:23 PM</a><br><br>

For me, traditional social norms approving of beverage alcohol as a "social lubricant", used in moderation, are sufficient justification for the industry. The fact that this practice has ancient roots dating back to antiquity further justifies it, as well as the fact that brewing, winemaking, and distilling are widespread amongst diverse cultures. So there are sociological as well as historical justification for the industry. Secondly, social engineering schemes to eliminate "demon rum", most notably Prohibition, have been disasters.<br>I'm also well aware of alcoholism's role in assisting the Four Horsemen, and am okay with it. People unable to cope with the stark future bearing down on us have a death wish that needs expressing, and if not through alcoholism, then the death wish will find another expression. In the bigger picture, human population is in overshoot, and MUST come down from its 7 billion peak, so I'm ambivalent or philosophical at best about alcohol's role in helping Mam Gaia rid herself of excess humans.

He shows how a higher debt-to-GDP ratio leads to lower wages, higher inequality, slower growth, and a bloated financial sector... using only three macroeconomic definitions and some calculus. <br><br>"Inequality, Debt and Credit Stagnation" is available on YouTube. As is "The Alternative to Neoliberalism."<br><br>Marx and Ricardo both said that in the absence of unions, wages are driven down to subsistence levels. Free trade bypasses unions by subsuming the political sphere to economic imperatives. It forces countries to compete with each other to sacrifice impediments to profit (e.g. people, the environment, etc). Meanwhile, politicians can say, "It's not me. There is no alternative." <br><br>Debt is offered instead of higher wages, which expands debt-to-GDP. But since banks mostly lend for assets, this also creates asset bubbles. People feel wealthier while going ever deeper into debt, until they can't anymore and the music stops. That was 2008.<br><br>The last time the world went through this was the Great Depression. Except this time central banks prevented a deflationary depression by following Japan into stagnation. However, this only protected asset holders at the expense of everyone too young or poor to own anything. <br><br>And then the backlash: first Occupy &amp; Greece, now Brexit &amp; Trump, with more to come, probably in Europe next given that 2017 is a bumper year for elections there. But don't count out China either, as their private debt bubble is currently bursting.<br><br>Your complaints about the salaried class notwithstanding, the real problem is with the 0.1% who own banks and buy lobbyists. And really not even them, but an economic structure that is so unstable that every couple of generations it self-destructs. A little greed is all it takes. That and an unsustainably high private debt-to-GDP ratio. <br><br>I urge you to review Keen and continue educating your readers about the underlying economic contradictions. It's too important for people to remain in ignorance, as Capitalism can break in ways that destroy populations. And an educated citizenry is necessary for democracy to function as it must.<br><br>Sincerely, <br><br>Adrynian<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c899433001071923854 title="comment permalink">11/25/16, 7:10 PM</a><br><br>

Here in Australia the media is still moaning about the loss of the TPP even though they never report on what it was nor any of the provisions such as Investor-state arbitration courts. Our country was once sued by a tobacco mob in one of those courts due to our anti-smoking measures working too well. They lost by the way. Perhaps the Summers memo (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summers_memo) is a good view into the mindset of the people that come up with treaties like this.<br> I just finished cross-checking a list of the history of the leaders of the countries that signed up for the TPP against their simple Wikipedia entries and nearly half state terms like merchant banker and a venture capitalist, Chairman of 1Malaysia Development Berhad, positions at both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Merrill Lynch's global head of foreign exchange and General Manager with Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation.

And of course, there is the dark fact that history has shown what happens when wealth inequality gets out of control. I mean honestly, I ask you this question: how would the average CEO know when wealth inequality has become out of control if their average earnings in the US is apparently the equivalent of 384 average workers incomes? It is just bizarre...<br><br>You know, down here we have another engaging scam whereby franchise operators are simply ignoring the labour laws for minimum wages and just paying people whatever. This is a serious problem for overseas students who can get deported if they complain - and one of those scams is apparently for a brand that is controlled by the second richest guy in the country. I mean, what is with that? Surely they could afford a few more bucks to pay to the workers? Apparently not.<br><br>And then you read that apparently 10% of employees in the country are on working visas and you can smell a rat and it smells of decomposition to me.<br><br>As you quite correctly point out, it is a race to the bottom, and nobody wins out of speculative bubbles because they eat the productive economy. Literally.<br><br>My main hope for the future is that it doesn't take another Great Depression to get the concept that “consumer economies need consumers” into the policy makers thick heads. There, I've said it and I feel much better now. :-)!<br><br>We had the Green Wizards meet up here today and everyone had a great time! Lively conversation and good food – what more can you ask for. Plus most of the daredevils poked their heads into the worm farm sewage system! Top work everyone!<br><br>Speaking of consumers... My computer broke earlier in the week because I was producing my Magnum Opus :-)! video showing 1,100 days growth in the orchard here. The video was just too much for the tired old beast of a machine and it fell over and died - without warning. Even Poopy the Pomeranian vomited up his dinner during the production of the video. It was very strange because everything that could go wrong, went wrong and I was beginning to feel that I should not be putting the video together at all... Anyway, it must be good as I've already been trolled! Well done them too! And too bad so sad for them that I impose strict controls on comments. Do you find that you get trolled more during a particularly choice bit of writing or is it more or less a background noise? Anyway, the video comprises 700 photos over about 11 minutes.

Management argued that Indian workforce costs around 30% of European, and even when factoring in half the efficiency, that still should amount to cost savings of 40%, and that means *gasp* €€€!!!111<br><br>Now what happened was that the whole thing took much longer than expected, and the results were substandard. You won't get cheap first class people in India because the highly qualified will not work in India for Indian income, but instead move out.<br><br>Plus that the low costs of Indian companies are also attained by immediately laying off people once a project is over without a new one starting right afterwards. So you have the steep learning curve in every project.

It simply doesn't work when prices are not transparent, when the consumer of health care has no skin in the price game and pays nothing at the time of service. Once no one knows or cares what the actual charges are, they rise. To be sure, many countries' governments have done a better job of reigning in costs than the US has done, but they are also having difficulties containing the costs and the pharma companies are calling the shots in Europe/Aust/NZ as well as here. Not sure about other countries. There are monopolies of interests that get hold of doctors, academia and medical publishing, who do not disclose their conflicts of interest, who are now pushing "evidence based medicine" which translates largely as big pockets doing studies whose results will benefit them and then forcing all providers to comply. This drives many unnecessary treatments and drugs, which of course increases the price we all pay and is just the same in all first world countries. It's a big club.<br><br>So if you're going to say people do not have a right to free health care you also need to have an actual capitalist system in place, not the corrupt and arguably illegal one in place now. The above accounts for most of the absurd increases in costs.<br><br>I believe that medical things are now so overpriced that if we returned to a system without insurance (or one with true insurance, i.e., against a catastrophic medical event, with no expectation that it pays for the little stuff, any more than you expect your car insurance to pay for a change of oil or tires), that prices would come down so much that a medical event would equal or be less than what your current copay or deductible is.<br><br>And back when it was like that, at least in the 70's, there were quite often free clinics and such for the very poor, anyway.<br><br>Enki mentioned last week that Obama didn't campaign on reducing prices, but that isn't true. He said that if something weren't done to reign in costs, it would bankrupt the nation. I think we need to take that true statement seriously. It may be the biggest financial boondoggle facing us. 20% of the GDP going to medical extortion and still rising. It's time to start enforcing some laws.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c5836727850482631788 title="comment permalink">11/26/16, 12:02 PM</a><br><br>

You can’t except people to just wait that out.<br><br>The current era of globalization and free trade has done a lot of good as well. Most of the world besides the very rich have greatly benefited. I don’t think this is entirely just increased resource consumption. The problem is that it’s been at the expense of the middle and poor of developed nations.

Warren Buffett would be a good example of that. But I'm sceptical that this applies to Trump or his cabinet, and I'll try to articulate why:<br><br>I'll start with Donald Trump. The man is clearly a master salesman, and linguists have made some <a href=http://www.vox.com/2016/8/18/12423688/donald-trump-speech-style-explained-by-linguists rel=nofollow>incisive</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aFo_BV-UzI" rel=nofollow>analyses</a> of how this carries through in his speech (which hearken back to some of your posts on black magic). So, it's possible (even likely) that his concern for the average American was pure sales patter, and his business practices tend to back that up.<br><br>But has he realised that as a billionaire, his long-term prosperity depends on fostering a happy, healthy and equitable society, rather than temporarily profiting from dismantling it? This requires that Trump's competence extends beyond sales and into finance, government and big corporations. Trump has a history of bankruptcies, bullying, refusal to pay contractors and even outright scamming. These suggest competence as a salesman (or conman), but not as a businessman or politician. The fact that he <a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-doesnt-read-much-being-president-probably-wouldnt-change-that/2016/07/17/d2ddf2bc-4932-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html rel=nofollow>doesn't read, and asserts that he makes his decisions based on "very little knowledge other than the knowledge [he already] had"</a> also suggest he does not have this level of awareness. It's possible and even likely that his decisions will be heavily influenced by the people he surrounds himself with, that Donald Trump will be an "empty suit".<br><br>(/continued in next post. Despite my best editing efforts and cutting this well below the 4,096 character limit, the form still won't accept it, so I've regretfully split it across two posts.)<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c4004637008148257258 title="comment permalink">11/26/16, 3:47 PM</a><br><br>

They will be a mix of Republican party insiders on the one hand, and his billionaire "political outsider" buddies on the other. The Republicans have a history of poor-baiting, and are poised to enact policies which will immiserate the poor and benefit the rich, including massive corporate tax cuts and dismantling medicare and medicaid.<br><br>That leaves the ultra-rich "outsiders" who, you've argued, might have come to the realisation that short term profit at the expense of society is a bad idea. Steven Mnuchin will likely be treasury secretary, and apart from being an ex-partner at Goldman Sachs, made <a href=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/steven-mnuchin-foreclosure-machine-treasury rel=nofollow> $200 million through predatory lending before and after the 2008 crash</a>. Betsy DeVos will likely be education secretary, and has a (recent) history of privatising education in Detroit, to the profit of her husband's hedge funds and the <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/us/for-detroits-children-more-school-choice-but-not-better-schools.html rel=nofollow>severe detriment of both K12 students and their teachers</a>. Harold Hamm, the likely energy secretary, made much of his fortune from the Bakken Shale, and advocates drilling in nature reserves. None of these show any sign of ceasing enriching themselves at the expense of those in economic distress.<br><br>It still seems likely that Trump may deliver on his promises to enact protectionism and dismantle international free-trade agreements. But I find it hard to reconcile the idea that this is from any realisation by Trump and his billionaire buddies that free trade, deregulation and general immiseration of the poor doesn't benefit them in the long term. They seem to be full steam ahead on those in nearly every other sector besides international trade. I think it's much more likely that it was political opportunism, playing on jingoistic nationalism.<br><br>As always, I'm happy to agree to disagree, and always welcome your perspectives!<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c169274382530406867 title="comment permalink">11/26/16, 3:48 PM</a><br><br>

Consider that capital investment leads to specialization, so a given worker only produces a tiny fraction of the variety of goods that he/she consumes. If the work of that worker is moved to a new location (e.g., a low-wage country on a different continent), the product of that worker may cost... let's say... half of what it used to. (If the retail price can be cut 25%, that's an extra 25% profit margin for the management.) But that worker's income is not 1/2 or 3/4 of what it was. It's zero. So, it doesn't matter how much cheaper <b>anything</b> is, it's all unaffordable. <br><br>Unaffordable, that is, until that worker finds a new job. But if you now have only N/2 jobs for N workers, half of your labor force can underbid the other half, depressing everyone's wages. Where's the equilibrium? Maybe it's when employers can get by with a part-time work-force, where no one qualifies for "full-time benefits", and the hourly rate is as cheap as the (foreign labor + transportation) costs. If the foreign location has lax environmental controls, wages have to go even lower to break even. On the other hand, a country may have natural advantages (raw materials, energy, financial market transparency, well-established rule of law) which convey to its workers. <i>(Not that I can think of such a country at the moment, but it's perhaps a historical consideration.)</i><br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c5490927691213953445 title="comment permalink">11/26/16, 6:31 PM</a><br><br>

One problem about free trade is that when you let the means of production escape to another country, the research and development, and engineering and tooling functions soon enough go with it for the exact same cost "saving" reasons. Eventually, of course, even the corporate headquarters and financing entities will go to where the factories are, lest they find that they can't compete... or in the case of the financing entities, find nothing to invest in at a rate of decent return and turn aside into speculation instead. That's why we've had so many g.d. boom and bust bubbles since Ole Tremble Chin (Reagan) got elected.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c683976780597035857 title="comment permalink">11/27/16, 2:07 PM</a><br><br>

IMO insurance is the problem, but also the weird notion that your employer is somehow obligated to pay that for you. All that was needed was some high-profile slavemasters at Big Poverty to tell "the community" that employer-paid health insurance was their "right", and here we are. I'd love to go back to the days of catastrophic insurance for big illnesses and paying out of pocket for the routine things. I agree that everything's overpriced and that that's precisely because of insurance. If I'm paying for it, I'm going to refuse a pricy test that may or may not identify problems. But hey, if it's "free...."<br><br>What you need for "free" health care is doctors, truckers, nurses, techs, suppliers, builders, contractors, IT staff, dock loaders, manufacturers, and myriad others to work for no compensation. In turn, the ones who are normally paid by the myriad, like utilities, landlords, mortgage holders, grocers, teachers, and all the staff at all those govt agencies that people throw in my face when I say I haven't been a net taker from "the community" to work for free too. Why should medical professionals be singled out for enslavement - which is defined as forcing one to work for the benefit of another for "free"? No one has the RIGHT to enslave another.<br><br>Those "free" clinics were not free, they were paid for with tax money.

I'll have to talk to Boris Badenov and see if I can get moved higher up the list of sinister subversives! <br><br>Varun, okay, gotcha. Thanks for the clarification. <br><br>Malcolm, thank you. That's a good one. <br><br>Shane, er, I've been saying that over and over again on this blog since the second post, you know!<br><br>LatheChuck, an excellent plan. A helpful addition to that plan might be learning to knit, so that you can amplify the effect of those nice warm slippers with a nice warm vest or what have you! <br><br>Shane, it's rather heartening to hear that you're aware of the effect your personality sometimes has on others. I know this is utterly unfashionable these days, but have you considered changing the way you relate to other people so you're less likely to become a casualty? As for California, though, I won't argue; I've lived in two states that received significant immigration from California, and in both of them, the word "Californian" is used as an obscenity. Apologies to my readers in the Golden State, but there it is; go to a neighboring state, pretend to be from somewhere other than California, and get the locals talking, and you'll hear a lot of really ugly stories about the behavior of your fellow Californians. <br><br>Adrynian, I'll consider it, but your insistence that it's all the fault of the 1% doesn't convince me. The affluent 20% bears a share of the blame, too. <br><br>Wendy, I'd encourage you and other people who got sold predatory loans by the corrupt academic industry to consider organizing and putting pressure on the government. A bill allowing student loan debt to be discharged by bankruptcy is long overdue, but it won't happen until people organize and put effective pressure on the political system to make it happen. <br><br>Kevin, I won't argue about free trade as a wealth pump -- that's how it works. I simply wanted to challenge the official story in a straightforward way. As for the Space Bats challenge, I know -- I'd have been at a loss if I'd tried to come up with something. It was way out there; circumstances permitting, another challenge will choose a less difficult theme. <br><br>Cherokee, delighted to hear that the Green Wizards visit went well! Congrats also on the magnum opus, which is a trip to watch. <br><br>Daelach, that's a classic. As for chess, no, I've never studied chess enough to be able to follow it. <br><br>SMJ, because products seek the highest paying market, just as jobs move to the lowest wage market. That keeps prices high as wages decline; of course that in turn feeds into the inability of businesses to make a profit on consumer sales, since many products are effectively priced out of reach of much of the consuming public, and worsens the flight to speculation.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c1097795880055245529 title="comment permalink">11/27/16, 5:30 PM</a><br><br>

That doesn't always work, but it provides some counterbalance. <br><br>Onething, yep. The difference is that he's not using talk about abstract values as a stalking horse for his interests, the way US politicians constantly do. <br><br>Avery, yes, I saw that, and it's far from the first time. (The distinction I drew, way back in the early days of this blog, between problems and predicaments has been quoted without acknowledgment all over the place.) May I ask a favor of you and other readers? If you see something in the media that's obviously cribbed from a past post of mine, could you consider posting a comment to the story saying something like, "Nice to see that you're reading <i>The Archdruid Report</i>," with a link to my post? That would be very welcome. <br><br>Lordberia3, the Eurozone is a wealth pump on the grand scale, bringing prosperity to Germany and a few other northern European nations at the expense of most of the rest of Europe. I don't know exactly how soon it's going to fall apart, but the writing's on the wall. <br><br>Steve, thanks for this! That'll go into the file next to the US nuclear launch codes for Minuteman missiles, which are on 8 inch floppy disks...<br><br>Kevin, Trump's lead in Wisconsin is larger than the largest lead that has ever been overturned by a recount, and recounts would have to reverse the outcome in several other states as well. Statistically, it's not going to happen. <br><br>Shane, I'm hoping. <br><br>Troy, <i>Merigan Tales</i> is in editing right now; I've seen the cover art, which is really good; I expect it out very early in the new year, and yes, it's got a stellar collection of stories. <br><br>Chris, I see no reason to believe that jobs lost to globalization will ever be replaced, as the same structural imbalances will keep on sending jobs to wherever wages are lowest. If you take the figures on your charts and break them out in more detail by income level within countries, free trade consistently benefits the affluent and hurts the poor -- and that includes the poor in rich countries as well as in poor ones. <br><br>Kieran, well, we'll just have to see, won't we? My take is that in two critical areas -- free trade and neoconservative foreign policy -- Trump and his advisers have grasped that business as usual is leading this country straight to disaster, and they plan on changing the country's course. The first steps toward rapprochement with Russia and the death of the TPP are both promising signs. <br><br>Shane, hadn't you figured that out yet? The left by and large wants to protest things, not to change them. Of course Sanders and Stein are falling in line, the way that Howard Dean did before them.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c6762273126910558077 title="comment permalink">11/27/16, 5:48 PM</a><br><br>

Those are highly useful. <br><br>Zach, I figured as much. I hate to break it to you, but "the species as a whole" isn't listening. It's a common social habit of idealists of certain stripes to convince themselves otherwise, but I'd encourage you to look up the story of the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928 as an antidote to that sort of thinking. As for the prospects of feeding and housing 8 or 9 billion human beings, are you familiar with the concept of carrying capacity? The best estimates I've seen for the carrying capacity of the Earth -- its maximum permanently sustainable population of human beings -- max out around 2 billion. Here's a basic rule of ecology: when a population rises significantly above carrying capacity, the result is overshoot followed by steep population decline. Given the way that rates of population increase have dropped off in recent years in the Third World, we're following the usual curve. (Recommended reading: <i>Overshoot</i> by William R. Catton, the most important book on human ecology I know of.) <br><br>Jeanne, thank you! <br><br>Patricia, understood. <br><br>Shane, it wasn't stolen for Trump at all.

There are many ways to benefit or be held back, often in ways that a person is unaware of. I'd say anyone that is doing well "ought" to be thinking of giving back, simply as a good thing to do. Many people over the years have felt that way, and built public works, churches, hospitals, funded charities and so on. But I object to the current trend of monetizing and privatizing everything.<br><br>If you're not in a position to give back, then don't.<br>I was a single mom once, though, and I even was on welfare for about 6 months. And my kids got some free or reduced summer camp after I went back to work. There were some programs that helped me go to school. I've long since paid back way more than all of that in my higher tax bracket than I would have without that help. <br><br>Of course the free clinics weren't free. But they are the sort of thing I am speaking about. I think the doctors donated their time, an evening a month or something like that. My point about that was that we have generally had ways for the poor to get medical attention.<br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c8897707147003261235 title="comment permalink">11/27/16, 7:43 PM</a><br><br>

I (thankfully) kept one old unit, and exchanged a second one. The first time I used the electronic one, it seemed to work. Then I carefully washed only the part that goes into the mouth in lukewarm water. It never worked again.<br><br>I've also held on to some old-fashioned thermostats with mercury switches, although I mostly use electronic ones as long as they last because their programmability does save some energy.<br><br>I've fixed several old microwave ovens, but my current one is an "inverter" type, which does not have the big heavy transformer, instead it has a transistorized high-frequency circuit with a lightweight transformer.

In those cases, things changed and people adapted to new ways of living after a generation or two was ground (sometimes literally) in poverty. You can argue that the descendants were better or worse off than their ancestors since the ways of life were different, but they were certainly better off than the intermediate generations. We’re seeing one of those intermediate generations now and the resulting misery. <br><br>I don’t know how things will resolve itself with globalization though I can come up with several ways it could. I referenced and discussed Keynes’s quote as a criticism to the common refrain that the jobs will return since it was critical of that pat response. The structural imbalances against jobs you discuss will change, the question is when and how. I’m hopeful it’s merely reform of free trade and a rediscovery of the high productivity of the American worker. I’m worried that things will have to get much worse before it can get better.<br><br>As for the graph, my point is while there are problems with how things are now, it’s also doing a lot of good. Half of the world especially the global poor and lower class has benefited and not just the rich. I don’t see how the 10-70 percentile of the world in income (i.e. those making roughly $2-10 a day) can be just the rich of their respective countries. However, this has caused stagnation in the developed world except among the very rich. As pointed out by others in the comments, China has gained a great deal in the current arrangement within a pro-trade but not free trade framework. This is both a source of ideas for the US and also a source of conflict if China sees its interests challenged.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c9202156269514342281 title="comment permalink">11/27/16, 11:06 PM</a><br><br>

It also looks like between the cracks showing in the EU, Trump's trade policies and China taking the lead on a major free trade agreement without any US involvement, that 2016 is the year that is going to go down in history as the beginning of the end for the American Empire. The future of America's internal politics, and whether the US can survive the next few decades in tact as a nation at all has yet to be written, but would it be safe to say that the chapter of US foreign policy that made up the bulk of "Decline and Fall" has pretty much been written now, much sooner than expected and through ordinary politics and trade agreements, rather than through a Twilight's Last Gleaming style military crisis?<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c1960111816593374520 title="comment permalink">11/28/16, 7:30 AM</a><br><br>

Profits might come first for you, but don't forget that from my point of view as someone spending money in the marketplace, supporting someone's else's profits or employment is no part of my responsibility. While I am more than happy to pay premium prices for premium products, if I don't like the product, I don't buy. Period. No matter whose ox gets gored. Since I have not had any health insurance and scant access to health care for about two decades--not complaining, it is what it is--the cleanliness and quality of the food I buy is a matter of urgent concern. If I prepare my own meals, I control what does, or more importantly does not, go into the meal. Now, I have no idea what your product line is or to whom you sell, but if you are selling to a processing plant, I for one am almost certainly not buying the finished product.<br><br>No, I do not expect anyone else to pay for my health care, but, by the same token, I think I have every right to resent having to help subsidize the immigrant agricultural labor force. Yes, I think I do have to subsidize it, through increased rents and utility costs, drain on social services, schools having to devote extra resources to non-English speaking students, and so on.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c3443242310246929453 title="comment permalink">11/28/16, 7:02 PM</a><br><br>

The fundamental difference, though, is that I think we're further along the curve of decline than you do, so much so that he's better than the alternatives. In a perfect world, the US would have embraced conservation and appropriate technology, reelected Carter in '80 and turned back Reagan, but that never happened, the die was cast, and now, here we are, 30+ neoliberal, neoconservative years later, and this is what we're faced with. I turned five in Oct. 1980, and there's a whole generation or two that wasn't even born in 1980, so we didn't have much choice in the matter. Trump was really the only viable chance we've had since 1980 to turn back the tide of neoliberalism and neoconservatism, and the jury is still out on whether he actually will or not, but I'm willing to at least wait until he takes office to judge.<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c3647940937889485797 title="comment permalink">11/29/16, 2:31 PM</a><br><br>

I've kept quiet, trying to understand the motivations of a Trump voter, but no matter what the voter's motivation, it remains that Trump himself is totally unfit to hold the office of President. This latest tweet was the last straw. He has no concept of the necessity of the Freedom of the Press either, chewing out almost all news organization just because they won't print only favorable things about him. Calling for increased control over what they can print shows he has no clue about the constitution.<br><br>To be very honest, Trump increasingly is sounding like my late father-in-law, who suffered from dementia. We'd hear these screeds from him about "terrorists setting the forest fires in Oregon", communists in the city council, etc. He became increasingly unable to know when it was appropriate to keep his mouth shut and would go off on people in restaurants, in church and other public places. He'd tell complete strangers that this person or that was a crook and threaten them if they didn't believe him.<br><br>Both my wife and I dealt with this for several years and we both say this crap from Trump is all too familiar.

Dunno. It is a complex matter. I realise that you wrote a book about that matter (which I have not read) and so don't really expect a reply from you to the above stream of consciousness comment. I thought that you may be interested? Dunno.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-free-trade-fallacy.html#c8512844929089711265 title="comment permalink">11/29/16, 4:12 PM</a><br><br>

He isn't serious about very much, actually, IMHO; it seems he just enjoys watching and laughing at people spending weeks analyzing and agonizing over something it took him 15 seconds to write.

However, the idea that any of this might go down IS, in my humble opinion (reading the tea leaves so to speak), looking more and more dubious, based on his cabinet picks (cabinet picks, I would argue, ARE policy decisions).
