Just at the moment, many of my readers—and of course a great many others as well—are paying close attention to which of the two most detested people in American public life will put a hand on a Bible in January, and preside thereafter over the next four years of this nation’s accelerating decline and fall. That focus is understandable, and not just because both parties have trotted out the shopworn claim that this election, like every other one in living memory, is the most important in our lifetimes. For a change, there are actual issues involved.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Barring any of the incidents that could throw the election into the House of Representatives, we’ll know by this time next week whether the bipartisan consensus that’s been welded firmly in place in American politics since the election of George W. Bush will stay intact for the next four years. That consensus, for those of my readers who haven’t been paying attention, supports massive giveaways to big corporations and the already affluent, punitive austerity for the poor, malign neglect for the nation’s infrastructure, the destruction of the American working class through federal subsidies for automation and offshoring and tacit acceptance of mass illegal immigration as a means of driving down wages, and a monomaniacally confrontational foreign policy obsessed with the domination of the Middle East by raw military force. Those are the policies that George W. Bush and Barack Obama pursued through four presidential terms, and they’re the policies that Hillary Clinton has supported throughout her political career. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Donald Trump, by contrast, has been arguing against several core elements of that consensus since the beginning of his run for office. Specifically, he’s calling for a reversal of federal policies that support offshoring of jobs, the enforcement of US immigration law, and a less rigidly confrontational stance toward Russia over the war in Syria. It’s been popular all through the current campaign for Clinton’s supporters to insist that nobody actually cares about these issues, and that Trump’s supporters must by definition be motivated by hateful values instead, but that rhetorical gimmick has been a standard thoughstopper on the left for many years now, and it simply won’t wash. The reason why Trump was able to sweep aside the other GOP candidates, and has a shot at winning next week’s election despite the unanimous opposition of this nation’s political class, is that he’s the first presidential candidate in a generation to admit that the issues just mentioned actually matter. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was a ticket to the nomination, in turn, because outside the bicoastal echo chamber of the affluent, the US economy has been in freefall for years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I suspect that a great many financially comfortable people in today’s America have no idea just how bad things have gotten here in the flyover states. The recovery of the last eight years has only benefited the upper 20% or so by income of the population; the rest have been left to get by on declining real wages, while simultaneously having to face skyrocketing rents driven by federal policies that prop up the real estate market, and stunning increases in medical costs driven by Obama’s embarrassingly misnamed “Affordable Care Act.” It’s no accident that death rates from suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol poisoning <a href=http://prospect.org/article/shocking-rise-white-death-rates-midlife-and-what-it-says-about-american-society>are soaring just now among working class white people</a>. These are my neighbors, the people I talk with in laundromats and lodge meetings, and they’re being driven to the wall. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Most of the time, affluent liberals who are quick to emote about the sufferings of poor children in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>conveniently distant corners of the Third World like to brush aside the issues I’ve just raised as irrelevancies. I’ve long since lost track of the number of times I’ve heard people insist that the American working class hasn’t been destroyed, that its destruction doesn’t matter, or that it was the fault of the working classes themselves. (I’ve occasionally heard people attempt to claim all three of these things at once.) On those occasions when the mainstream left deigns to recognize the situation I’ve sketched out, it’s usually in the terms Hillary Clinton used in her infamous “basket of deplorables” speech, in which she admitted that there were people who hadn’t benefited from the recovery and “we need to do something for them.” That the people in question might deserve to have a voice in what’s done for them, or to them, is not part of the vocabulary of the affluent American left. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s why, if you pay a visit to the town where I live, you’ll find Trump signs all over the place—and you’ll find the highest concentration of them in the poor neighborhood just south of my home, a bleak rundown zone where there’s a church every few blocks and an abandoned house every few doors, and where the people tipping back beers on a porch of a summer evening rarely all have the same skin color. They know exactly what they need, and what tens of thousands of other economically devastated American communities need: enough full-time jobs at decent wages to give them the chance to lift their families out of poverty. They understand that need, and discuss it in detail among themselves, with a clarity you’ll rarely find in the media. (It’s a source of wry amusement to me that the best coverage of the situation on the ground here in the flyover states appeared, not in any of America’s newspapers of record, nor in any of its allegedly serious magazines, but in
<a href=http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-reasons-trumps-rise-that-no-one-talks-about/ >a raucous NSFW online humor magazine</a>.)</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s more, the working class people who point to a lack of jobs as the cause of middle America’s economic collapse are dead right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The reason why those tens of thousands of American communities are economically devastated is that too few people have enough income to support the small businesses and local economies that used to thrive there. The money that used to keep main streets bustling across the United States, the wages that used to be handed out on Friday afternoons to millions of Americans who’d spent the previous week putting in an honest day’s work for an honest day’s pay, have been siphoned off to inflate the profits of a handful of huge corporations to absurd levels and cater to the kleptocratic feeding frenzy that’s made multimillion-dollar bonuses a matter of course at the top of the corporate food chain. It really is as simple as that. The Trump voters in the neighborhood south of my home may not have a handle on all the details, but they know that their survival depends on getting some of that money flowing back into paychecks to be spent in their community. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s an open question whether they’re going to get that if Donald Trump wins the election, and a great many of his supporters know this perfectly well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s as certain as anything can be, though, that they’re not going to get it from Hillary Clinton. The economic policy she’s touted in her speeches, to the extent that this isn’t just the sort of campaign rhetoric that will pass its pull date the moment the last vote is counted, focuses on improving opportunities for the middle class—the people, in other words, who have already reaped the lion’s share of those economic benefits that didn’t go straight into the pockets of the rich. To the working classes, she offers nothing but a repetition of the same empty slogans and disposable promises. What’s more, they know this, and another round of empty slogans and disposable promises isn’t going to change that. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nor, it probably needs to be said, is it going to be changed by another round of media handwaving designed to make Donald Trump look bad in the eyes of affluent liberals. I’ve noted with some amusement the various news stories on the highbrow end of the media noting, in tones variously baffled and horrified, that when you show Trump supporters videos designed to make them less enthusiastic about their candidate, they double down. Any number of canned theories have been floated to explain why that happens, but none that I’ve heard have dealt with the obvious explanations. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To begin with, it’s not as though that habit is only found on Trump’s side of the fence. In recent weeks, as one Wikileaks email dump after another has forced an assortment of stories about Clinton’s arrogant and corrupt behavior into the news, her followers have doubled down just as enthusiastically as Trump’s; those of my readers who are familiar with the psychology of previous investment will likely notice that emotional investment is just as subject to this law as the financial kind. For that matter, supporters of both candidates are quite sensibly aware that this election is meant to choose a public official rather than a plaster saint, and recognize that a genuine scoundrel who will take the right stands on the issues that matter to them is a better choice than a squeaky-clean innocent who won’t, even if such an animal could actually be found in the grubby ecosystem of contemporary American politics.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That said, there’s another factor that probably plays an even larger role, which is that when working class Americans get told by slickly groomed talking heads in suits that something they believe is wrong, their default assumption is that the talking heads are lying. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Working class Americans, after all, have very good reason for making this their default assumption. Over and over again, that’s the way things have turned out. The talking heads insisted that handing over tax dollars to various corporate welfare queens would bring jobs back to American communities; the corporations in question pocketed the tax dollars and walked away. The talking heads insisted that if working class people went to college at their own expense and got retrained in new skills, that would bring jobs back to American communities; the academic industry profited mightily but the jobs never showed up, leaving tens of millions of people buried so deeply under student loan debt that most of them will never recover financially. The talking heads insisted that this or that or the other political candidate would bring jobs back to American communities by pursuing exactly the same policies that got rid of the jobs in the first place—essentially the same claim that the Clinton campaign is making now—and we know how that turned out. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, trust in talking heads generally is at an all-time low out here in flyover country. Consider the way that herbal medicine—“God’s medicine” is the usual phrase these days—has become the go-to option for a huge and growing number of devout rural Christians. There are plenty of reasons why that should be happening, but surely one of the most crucial is the cascading loss of faith in the slickly groomed talking heads that sell modern medicine to consumers. Herbs may not be as effective as modern pharmaceuticals in treating major illnesses, to be sure, but they generally don’t have the ghastly side effects that so many pharmaceuticals will give you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Furthermore, and just as crucially, nobody ever bankrupted their family and ended up on the street because of the high price of herbs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It used to be, not all that long ago, that the sort of people we’re discussing trusted implicitly in American society and its institutions. They were just as prone as any urban sophisticate to distrust this or that politician or businessperson or cultural figure, to be sure; back in the days when local caucuses and county conventions of the two main political parties still counted for something, you could be sure of hearing raucous debates about a galaxy of personalities and issues. Next to nobody, though, doubted that the basic structures of American society were not merely sound, but superior to all others. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You won’t find that certainty in flyover country these days. Where you hear such claims made at all, they’re phrased in the kind of angry and defensive terms that lets everyone know that the speaker is trying to convince himself of something he doesn’t entirely believe any more, or in the kind of elegaic tones that hearken back to an earlier time when things still seemed to work—when the phrase “the American Dream” still stood for a reality that many people had experienced and many more could expect to achieve for themselves and their children. Very few people out here think of the federal government as anything more than a vast mechanism operated by rich crooks for their own benefit, at the expense of everyone else. What’s more, the same cynical attitude is spreading to embrace the other institutions of American society, and—lethally—the ideals from which those institutions get whatever legitimacy they still hold in the eyes of the people. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who were around in the late 1980s and early 1990s have seen this movie before, though it came with Cyrillic subtitles that time around. By 1985 or so, it had become painfully obvious to most citizens of the Soviet Union that the grand promises of Marxism would not be kept and the glorious future for which their grandparents and great-grandparents had fought and labored was never going to arrive. Glowing articles in <i>Pravda </i>and <i>Izvestia</i> insisted that everything was just fine in the Worker’s Paradise; annual five-year plans presupposed that economic conditions would get steadily better while, for most people, economic conditions got steadily worse; vast May Day parades showed off the Soviet Union’s military might, Soyuz spacecraft circled the globe to show off its technological prowess, and tame intellectuals comfortably situated in the more affluent districts of Moscow and Leningrad, looking forward to their next vacation at their favorite Black Sea resort, chattered in print about the good life under socialism, while millions of ordinary Soviet citizens trudged through a bleak round of long lines, product shortages, and system-wide dysfunction. Then crisis hit, and the great-great-grandchildren of the people who surged to the barricades during the Russian Revolution shrugged, and let the Soviet Union unravel in a matter of days. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I suspect we’re much closer to a similar cascade of events here in the United States than most people realize. My fellow peak oil blogger Dmitry Orlov pointed out a decade or so back, in a series of much-reprinted blog posts and his book <i>Reinventing Collapse</i>, that the differences between the Soviet Union and the United States were far less important than their similarities, and that a Soviet-style collapse was a real possibility here—a possibility for which most Americans are far less well prepared than their Russian equivalents in the early 1990s. His arguments have become even more compelling as the years have passed, and the United States has become mired ever more deeply in a mire of institutional dysfunction and politico-economic kleptocracy all but indistinguishable from the one that eventually swallowed its erstwhile rival. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Point by point, the parallels stand out. We’ve got the news articles insisting, in tones by turns glowing and shrill, that things have never been better in the United States and anyone who says otherwise is just plain wrong; we’ve got the economic pronouncements predicated on continuing growth at a time when the only things growing in the US economy are its total debt load and the number of people who are permanently unemployed; we’ve got the overblown displays of military might and technological prowess, reminiscent of nothing so much as the macho posturing of balding middle-aged former athletes who are trying to pretend that they haven’t lost it; we’ve got the tame intellectuals comfortably situated in the more affluent suburban districts around Boston, New York, Washington, and San Francisco, looking forward to their next vacation in whatever the currently fashionable spot might happen to be, babbling on the internet about the good life under predatory cybercapitalism. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile millions of Americans trudge through a bleak round of layoffs, wage cuts, part-time jobs at minimal pay, and system-wide dysfunction. The crisis hasn’t hit yet, but those members of the political class who think that the people who used to be rock-solid American patriots will turn out en masse to keep today’s apparatchiks secure in their comfortable lifestyles have, as the saying goes, another think coming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nor is it irrelevant that most of the enlisted personnel in the armed forces, who are the US government’s ultimate bulwark against popular unrest, come from the very classes that have lost faith most drastically in the American system. The one significant difference between the Soviet case and the American one at this stage of the game is that Soviet citizens had no choice but to accept the leaders the Communist Party of the USSR foisted off on them, from Brezhnev to Andropov to Chernenko to Gorbachev, until the system collapsed of its own weight. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
American citizens, on the other hand, do at least potentially have a choice. Elections in the United States have been riddled with fraud for most of two centuries, but since both parties are generally up to their eyeballs in voter fraud to a roughly equal degree, fraud mostly swings close elections.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s still possible for a sufficiently popular candidate to overwhelm the graveyard vote, the crooked voting machines, and the other crass realities of American elections by sheer force of numbers. That way, an outsider unburdened with the echo-chamber thinking of a dysfunctional elite might just be able to elbow his way into the White House. Will that happen this time? No one knows. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If George W. Bush was our Leonid Brezhnev, as I’d suggest, and Barack Obama is our Yuri Andropov, Hillary Clinton is running for the position of Konstantin Chernenko; her running mate Tim Kaine, in turn, is waiting in the wings as a suitably idealistic and clueless Mikhail Gorbachev, under whom the whole shebang can promptly go to bits. While I don’t seriously expect the trajectory of the United States to parallel that of the Soviet Union anything like as precisely as this satiric metaphor would suggest, the basic pattern of cascading dysfunction ending in political collapse is quite a common thing in history, and a galaxy of parallels suggests that the same thing could very easily happen here within the next decade or so. The serene conviction among the political class and their affluent hangers-on that nothing of the sort could possibly take place is just another factor making it more likely. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s by no means certain that a Trump presidency will stop that from happening, and jolt the United States far enough out of its current death spiral to make it possible to salvage something from the American experiment. Even among Trump’s most diehard supporters, it’s common to find people who cheerfully admit that Trump might not change things enough to matter; it’s just that when times are desperate enough—and out here in the flyover states, they are—a leap in the dark is preferable to the guaranteed continuation of the unendurable. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Thus the grassroots movement that propelled Trump to the Republican nomination in the teeth of the GOP establishment, and has brought him to within a couple of aces of the White House in the teeth of the entire US political class, might best be understood as the last gasp of the American dream. Whether he wins or loses next week, this country is moving into the darkness of an uncharted night—and it’s not out of place to wonder, much as Hamlet did, what dreams may come in that darkness. <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

"<br><br>This will most assuredly end badly for us all. It is merely a matter of when. Just as the virus spreads through Westworld, it is spreading slowly and steadily through our country. You can't stay on the wrong path forever, yet we seemed determined to double down and go full speed ahead. <br><br>One important point left out here (or rather, only hinted at indirectly) is the global economic experiment we have embarked on, which is just as much a journey into the wilderness with no end in sight. The global central bank takeover is very much at the heart of the asset inflation that keeps the elite cozy in their positions of power. You only need think back to 2008 to realize how scared, insular and clueless these people are...and ultimately, how vulnerable they are in the future once everything falls apart again. Next time, it won't be so easy to just trot out the duct tape and bailing wire and make it appear unbroken.<br><br><a href=#c4054661996944611603 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 9:47 AM</a><br><br>

But from a practical political standpoint there is no reason to believe that a Trump victory would do anything to weaken elite power in the near term, despite the fact that Trump (and most of his supporters) actively disagree with major elements of elite policy (military spending, immigration, trade, etc). A Trump election means unified control of all three branches by the Republicans, and an end to the stalemates that have kept things from getting worse. Trump has absolutely no ability or interest in coordinating or controlling what the Republican congress does. Congressional Republicans, despite the active hostility of rank-and-file Republican voters are far more dedicated to the programs for unlimited military spending, no infrastructure investment, enhancing corporate and financial power, and upward income redistribution than the elite Democrats. The Democrats will at least look after the interests of the top 20% while the Republicans are totally focused on the 1%. These Republicans are far better at employing the "talking heads" to push their pro-corporate anti-working class agenda than the Democrats. The Republicans and their backers have been salivating at the prospect of unified control of Washington for decades, and once they get it they'll be absolutely ruthless about exploiting that position. Trump understands power; as President he won't have it but Congress and their financial backers will, so he'll play along with 95% of what they want in order to prevent the appearance of impotence. SO, accepting your general predictions of life following a Clinton election, I'd argue everything gets worse with Trump. There will be symbolic sops to hard-core Trump voters while everything else is for the benefits of the plutocrats and rent-seeking big corporations. Just like there were always sops to the religious right on "social" issues that business didn't like but weren't financially important. <br>The comparisons to the late stage USSR are important. Maybe you've done this in the past but I think the key parallel is the use of propaganda techniques--not just Fox News or your "talking heads" but 40 years of corporate/plutocrat investment in "narratives" and the ability to use propaganda techniques to totally hollow out journalism, academia, the judiciary and similar groups in order to totally exclude evidence and arguments that might have challenged the dominance of these elite groups.<br><br><a href=#c527560155248831290 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 9:54 AM</a><br><br>

I might not be a libertarian as such, far from it in fact, but they offered a full slate of candidates on the Federal level for which to vote where I live, and I also respect their consistent stance against hegemonic militarism and the encroaching police-state. The Green Party couldn't be more irrelevant if it tried, and sometimes I wonder if it is indeed trying! The one state-level office up for grabs here, state representative, I left blank because the only choice was a safely-ensconced Scott Walker Republican <i>versus</i> a Democratic old union-boss challenger at whom I'm sure sixty percent of the voters will flip the finger when they vote for the incumbent.<br><br>I find Trump too detestable to cast my vote for him (he's going to be charged with fraud for his Trump University scam and he's an aggressive sexual harasser if not a rapist), but if the Flyover Country laboring classes want to put him in the Oval Office, I won't stand in their way, because I know how fully legitimate their grievances are. The whole shebang is precipitously heading for collapse anyway and the rot of our society and its politics fully reflect this fundamental truth, so "what the hey"?<br><br>I only hope whoever wins doesn't start the ICBMs flying. Last night someone was hot-rodding down my street in their muscle-car, and the sound was a little bit like how the civil-defense sirens sound when they start their nightmarish wailing call.

He is a performer, a "reality" TV actor. He would/will quickly wind up being just be a rough-talking figurehead puppet for pretty much the same neocon/neoliberal consensus of the last several decades. You could say the same was true of Reagan, but by the time he became president he had a substantial history in politics and his principles and policies were well-formed, well-known, and (at least for practical purposes) sincerely held. George W. Bush was more similar, but in reality you can kind of draw a line from Reagan (actor turned politician with real policies) to Bush II (Mindless Prettyboy from a political dynasty figurehead for the Neocon movement who did what he was told) to Trump (Publicity hound who has no actual foundation principles or policies and will just chase the spotlight). <br><br>Clinton's one positive is that she is a known quantity, no mystery about what a Clinton administration will and won't try to do. The devil we know, or the loose canon we don't?<br><br>My own vote has been cast, for neither of them. <br><br>Substantial prospects for significant change in the American trajectory on this presidential cycle evaporated early in the primary season.<br><br><a href=#c3343460575196544127 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 10:14 AM</a><br><br>

One is, both candidates are equally disliked by a big group of electorate. However, there is very little proof (to say the least) that D.T. has any intention or abilities to change anything in DC. He has showed some abilities in staying on top of a wave of discontent (even at that he is far from being brilliant), and an astonishing lack of anything resembling leadership qualities. He got that far only because both the things are quite bad in the "flyover states" and his opponent is, well what she is.<br>I do find your reading of the situation a bit disturbing. 'cause, if you really see DT as somebody "admitting issues" or "takes the stand on them", the country is really primed for a collapse.<br>Then, maybe, it is because I am one of the better-off coastal liberals?<br><br><br><a href=#c3590760944594884650 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 10:16 AM</a><br><br>

I do find it interesting that many seem to think the current narrowing of the polling gap between Clinton and Trump is because of the FBI email stuff. It seems far more likely from the timing of it all that is it because of the huge rate hikes in Obamacare premiums. Of course "85% of enrollees don't have to pay the full rate" so it's not a problem... except for that other 15%, who I guess don't count? I think the average voter has already heard more about Clinton's e-mails than they care to think about and just glossed over the latest crap, but health insurance hits right in the gut and the wallet. But the FBI announcement lets the Dems ignore the problems with the ACA yet again and focus on something meaningless instead.<br><br><a href=#c4888191146709925509 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 10:21 AM</a><br><br>

President Obama, ironically enough, has voiced concern that he's leaving behind a "loaded gun" for the next president to use. You think?<br><br>What's concerning to me (as a self-described republican [little 'r'] constitutionalist who favors decentralized governance) is that we've reached this point. Where healthcare for a nation of 300+ million people is based around a failed program named after a president. Where desperate people look to the president to somehow bestow upon them jobs as though he's Jesus with loaves and fishes. <i>Where</i> in Article II of the Constitution are these powers given to the Chief Magistrate (as Washington called the office)? This is extraordinarily dangerous and, dare I say it, pathetically desperate.<br><br>The fallacy of statism is that economic and political power consolidated in the hands of the "benevolent" and "all-knowing" few is desirable and productive. Instead, it creates corruption, disconnectedness, and ultimately threatens liberty itself. E.g. we defeated the Soviet Union so our economy could be steered by a politburo of econ PhDs at the Fed who debase the fiat currency for the benefit of asset holders.<br><br>Unlike other coasties, though, I am not surprised by Trump's ascent, though I always viewed his candidacy as a rather ham-fisted "F U" to a clearly-broken system. I am saddened that this justifiable anger is not directed at intelligently fixing the underlying issues and has instead been channeled behind an egomaniac blowhard.<br><br><a href=#c289080433755895285 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 11:03 AM</a><br><br>

I consider myself a lefty in many respects, but even I’ve started to talk about liberals with a great deal of contempt. A fair number of my liberal friends are clinging to our current institutions, universities and such, like their lives depend on them. Their lives probably do depend on those institutions, but they refuse to consider a future without those places. They’re also crawling paycheck to paycheck, though not a one will admit it how close they are to disaster. <br><br>Whatever happens we really do need these years of fire. The weakness and arrogance of some of the more educated members of our society needs to be dealt with, and hardship is the only solution. I’ve increasingly started to look upon the affluent, and those people who should know better, with a great deal of contempt. The only thing worse than a know-it-all with power, is a know-it-all without. <br><br>Regards,<br><br>Varun<br><br><a href=#c7414561206670742842 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 11:07 AM</a><br><br>

I must admit that while I cast my ballot for Stein weeks ago, fully cognizant of the fact that she has zero chance of winning, and while I am more than aware of Trump's shortcomings and less-than-pleasant qualities (reasons I did not vote for him despite agreeing with him on a handful of select, key issues), I have been quietly hoping for something that would dislodge our politics from the senile status quo. I have no illusions about the odds as to whether or not such a change would be better, but as you point out, the present course guarantees that it will not be.<br><br>I also realize that I need to get out more. I live in what I'd consider a small-to-mid sized city (~12k), but it is the second largest city in the county (there are three) -- other communities are organized as villages or are unincorporated county (townships).

Arlie Hochschild's recent book "Strangers in Their Own Land" describes the plight and mindset of working class Americans in detail. It is definitely worth reading While the book focuses on people in the South what the author says applies to other parts of the country as well. I live in the rural north country region and in our neck of the woods thirty-one percent of households have a net worth of under $15,000 which means they can not fully participate in the economic and social life of their communities. And it is getting worse. Perhaps there is a set of policies that can help working class Americans, but more likely people will have to figure out how to save themselves.<br><br><a href=#c4798465913088530752 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 11:16 AM</a><br><br>

The irony is that the status quo candidate wants to propel us into a future we do not want and the change candidate seeks to find a "reset" button somewhere in the past where everything could be put back on track. In the middle of the noise of this campaign, most people have not stopped to consider how near to impossible it will be for Trump to halt the inertia of this dying system and salvage anything of value from it. It is only in reading you for last few years that I have allowed myself to admit to the mess that we are truly in. If Trump wins--and I think and hope that he will--it will be then that the "work of democracy" will begin in earnest and the people will have to back him with all their vigilance and might against the forces that will be arrayed against him.<br><br><a href=#c1912403491091855176 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 12:17 PM</a><br><br>

Despite the economic headwinds in Alberta and housing crisis in Vancouver, they've boosted the immigration target for 2016 and 17 to 300,000 per year from 260,000. There's a number of people in important positions who think it should be higher still. Right now doesn't seem like a good time to be raising the target to me.

Cracked in particular has been impressing me with their return to good old-fashioned journalism in the form of actually sending people to the places their articles are about- even to Ukraine and Syria. <br><br>As for the election, I'm not sold on Trump at all. I agree that he'd scrap some elements of the current kleptocracy, but not by a long shot do I believe that he's in it for anything other than himself. Which is to say, I must thank you again- it's reassuring(inasmuch as reassurance can be found these days) to know that many Trump supporters do in fact see what I see, and have simply made different value judgements about the current situation. My fear was that they were operating on blind faith, and would perhaps react violently if their savior turned out to be another traitor. <br><br>That being said, I'll be damned if I vote for Hillary. My current plan is to send some votes toward a third party(haven't decided yet, but probably the Greens), and hope that next election cycle, the Democrats will be overwhelmed by their own outsiders in the same way the Republicans were overwhelmed this time around. <br><br>There is some hope there; I have been telling my friends that 2016's Democratic primary resembled nothing so much as 2012's Republican contest, with Hillary in the role of Mitt Romney(they're certainly both robotic enough!) and Bernie Sanders representing the rage of the dispossessed that finally manifested in Trump. Perhaps, just perhaps, things may hold together long enough for a "Bernie-crat" to run away with the nomination in four to eight years. That's my sliver of hope. But I'm not holding my breath. <br><br>On another note, I finally made it to Ashland, after years of living out here in Eugene, and I can say I totally understand why you left! I don't know if you ever frequented "Oberon's Three-Penny Tavern" when you were there, but the friends of mine who own that bar were the friends I was there to see, and since then they've been driven out by the yuppification of their own hometown. It was sad to see, but it was also some clarity- "Bobo Americanus" is out there in force! I suppose a silver lining of the decline and fall will be to make all of that go away forever. At least, that's another hope. <br><br>Hope your travels went well, <br><br>Matt<br><br><br><br><a href=#c420121094732418408 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 12:36 PM</a><br><br>

He did discount the possibility of a civil war for a variety of reasons, but the fact that he considered it in the first place, and the lack of shock on the part of the NPR interviewer at his doing so was a definitely a sign of the times.

In one town I visited with very traditional values - lots of churches (and church attendance), very family oriented, pride in local history, etc. one of the residents told us that the main source of income for the people in town (population is about 800) is marijuana. I was at first surprised to hear this, since this did not at all seem like a community which would be pot-friendly on the surface, but as the resident explained, that is the only way most folk can make money. Without marijuana, he said, the town would have no economy. For the record, main street in that town seemed to be doing okay, with a number of local business which seemed to be doing okay.<br><br>In a bigger rural town (population 1,400) there are a lot of retirees moving in, mostly from the SF Bay Area, because the cost of living in SF Bay Area is too high. I met some of these retirees from the Bay Area. They are mostly middle class, but I also met two working class retirees who relocated from the Bay Area. That town's main streets has a mix of thriving small businesses (the town is proud of not having any chain stores) and abandoned store fronts. When I talked to the long-term locals, though they are not thrilled about the cost of housing going up, they consider the people moving in from the Bay Area to be a net positive since they help sustain local businesses.<br><br>I do not know how representative the communities I visited are of Northern California as a whole, and I know they are not representative of rural American in general.<br><br>And yes, many affluent people here are clueless about how people in rural areas feel, though some are not clueless (especially those who at one point had lived in flyover country, or had once been blue collar).

Things look an awful lot different when you spend your life in an ivory tower or aboard a private jet and don't have to mix with the masses whose lives are being destroyed by the policies you are defending.<br><br><i>The smartest thing we can do now is to keep our economy as open and flexible as possible — to get the change signals first and be able to quickly adapt; create the opportunity for every American to engage in lifelong learning, because whatever jobs emerge will require more knowledge; make sure that learning stresses as much of the humanities and human interactive skills as hard sciences; make sure we have an immigration policy that continues to attract the world’s most imaginative risk-takers; and strengthen our safety nets, because this era will leave more people behind.<br><br>This is the only true path to American greatness in the 21st century. Trump wants to make America great in ways that are just not available anymore. “What do we have to lose” by trying his way? Trump asks. The answer is: everything that actually makes us great. When the world gets this fast, small errors in navigation have huge consequences.<br><br>While Clinton has failed to inspire, her instincts and ideas will keep us hewing to basically the right course.

Words cannot begin to describe how much I and most of the people I know despise the Friedman's and Clinton's of this world. While I have serious misgivings about Trump, I ended up voting for him because I like and trust Clinton even less and I know that a vote for her is a vote for more of the same ruinous policies that are destroying America from within.

But it would still be a shock, as in Europe the same distrust of the European technocracy is felt as for the USA's folks towards their government.<br><br>Hubert,<br> if you take Trump's stance on energy, it would make things even worse for the USA as he advocates a return to the Reagan era of oil guzzling. It would even be a disaster for the entire world... That's the thing with disruptive candidates : they get votes because people assume that if they got in power, it would completely upheave the status quo and hopefully some good might come out of the upheaval. The "jump into the dark" described by JMG. In this case, Trump's election would not necessarily mean he is approved as President, but that a lot of people want to upheave things. And when it turns out that he doesn't upheave things a lot after all, I guess that the next "new frontier" will be plain violence. Or he might be smart enough to enact a populist agenda... A big risk to take, but at least it beats maintaining the status quo. Violence might come out just as quickly if the status quo were maintained in power by the Democrats.<br><br>In general, we get a bit of the same feelings here in France, with the Presidential function reaching so far unprecedented heights in distrust and impopularity. The differences are too numerous to be listed here, however one of the most significant is that the enemy of the lower classes is twofold this time : both the French elite and the European elite. Therefore a candidate with a strong authoritarian slant and a clear support for economically patriotistic policies might very well get an easy way to the Elysée's Palace, and make for a good President once in office. However the most credible candidates have all been in power previously, all come from the same school (the ENA). And the ENA is slowly becoming the symbol of the formatting of an elite where political orientation matters less than the social separation from the nation's daily life. A lot of them (which includes, erm, a former President) are even mired in corruption/misdeed trials.<br><br> So yes, France is at a similar stage of its History. We have found many of the solutions for a post-industrial future (we still have good rail service, a growing organic agricultural sector...), and yet we need an actual alternative for leadership. The sense that people would do a better job governing themselves than the government has sipped through the Nuit Debout movement which tried to discuss ideas such as randomly chosen elects, universal basic income. But Nuit Debout was too Parisian, too much well-to-do, and the current political offerings on the left have yet to catch up...<br><br>There has yet to come a movement that advocates giving back the work to people, versus rampant automation,offshoring or mass immigration.<br>I fear that if a left-wing political movement does not rise to defend that proposition, which would also help us face the Long Emergency, we will end up stuck on a devil's choice between either the far right, or radical religious ideologies.<br><br><a href=#c356955970418069463 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 4:32 PM</a><br><br>

One thing that should be pointed out, though, is that as this rhetoric intensified into all-out conspiratorial paranoia over the past few months, it also became familiar to a certain group of people: those who personally lived through the Soviet collapse.<br>Those who felt the impact of the collapse in their homes tell me that in the final decade of the Soviet Union, those few voices in the wilderness who claimed that the Union itself would collapse were lambasted as CIA plants or pro-American traitors. Certainly the CIA obviously was operating in the USSR -- and based on that kernel of truth, the establishment was able to conjure up a vast conspiracy by the other Cold War power to subvert people's faith in the motherland. This conspiracy became the go-to response to any sort of concerns about the stability of the Union. Does this sound at all familiar? <br>As you've pointed out on this blog before, the appearance of infuriated defenses of the status quo often tells us more about the people doing the defending than it does about those doing the questioning. A healthy status quo does not need to be defended. And check out the headline of Breanna's link! A full-fledged defense of corruption, as she said, and it's entitled "How American Politics Went Insane"... see any unintended reflexivity there?<br>I feel like this thing must have reached its peak this past Monday, when Hillary Clinton tweeted out a claim that Trump owns a "secret server" that talks to a large Russian bank. I say this must have been a peak because this was too ridiculous even for the New York Times and Washington Post, who both quickly debunked the theory. But on the other hand, I'm just setting myself up to be surprised by what happens next.<br>One thing's for sure, whatever sort of collapse we see will not be the end of the story. Life goes on regardless of politics, and the history of Russia in the 1990s should be a good message to us that political turmoil will not slow down when a new government is installed.<br><br><a href=#c6994042943757885117 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 4:54 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_5ee831" id=c667741996240881048></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/04737693388485635100 rel=nofollow>John Michael Greer</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>A note before I proceed -- as expected, I've received a flurry of fist-pounding, salive-spraying tirades from people who thought that rehashing canned talking points at the top of their lungs counts as polite discourse. With that in mind, I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to read this week's post and respond to it in a thoughtful and courteous manner, whether or not they agree with me.<br><br>That said, on to the comments...<br><br>Gee, since this is a weekly blog post rather than a book, I didn't include every relevant factor. The gyrations of the central banks in recent years are indeed important, though my interpretation of them veers as far from the conventional wisdom as it does from any of the standard theories out here in the doomosphere. I'll be doing a post on that, focusing especially on negative interest rates, as we proceed. <br><br>Hubert, I'm not entirely sure that you're right. The GOP is by no means as unanimous as you make it out to be, and a Trump victory is going to show every ambitious politician in the country which policies will get him or her an instant following among voters. Still, we'll see. <br><br>Mister R., glad to hear it. I'm enough of an old-fashioned small-d democrat that I consider voting an important civic ritual, if nothing else. <br><br>Bill, as I noted in my post, many of the people who are voting for Trump know as well as you do that they can't be sure that electing him will help. What they know for a fact is that voting for Clinton will prolong the unendurable, and voting for Trump will at least annoy the political class. As for substantive change, that's on its way, though not because of the two figures currently whacking each other in our quadrennial Punch and Judy show...<br><br>Vadim, the fact of the matter, as noted in my post, is that Trump has consistently talked about exactly those issues I enumerated. Whether that's pure opportunism or not, it's taken him from the fringe to an election in which he has a serious chance at victory -- and that right there means that the issues in question are not going to go away, because every ambitious politicisn in the country now knows how to win an instant mass following. <br><br>Bill, my guess is that you're quite correct. When I first heard of the scale of the latest round of Obamacare rate hikes, my immediate reaction was that that, all by itself, could put Trump in the White House. But we'll see...<br><br>Robert, no argument there! We're headed for very, very troubled times. <br><br>Matt, thank you. I've noticed that if you just keep spelling things out over and over again, sooner or later people start to get it!<br><br>Rich_P, I'd be perfectly happy seeing the federal government get out of the job creation business, so long as it also gets out of the job destruction business. The federal policies that subsidize automation and offshoring, penalize employers for hiring people, and tacitly allow unlimited illegal immigration have played a huge role in creating the jobless pseudorecovery we're in. More generally, I don't disagree at all that the federal government needs to get back to the purposes established for it by the constitution as amended, and stop trying to do things that were left to the states and the people. More on this as we proceed! <br><br>Varun, thank you! Yes, York Rite Grand Sessions is always a bit of a vacation weekend; it was again at Ocean City, a good time was had, and I came back with a grandiosely titled minor office -- for the next year I'm Grand Principal Sojourner for the Grand Chapter R.A.M. of Maryland. (That and $3.30 will get you a cup of coffee.) As for the more substantive aspects of your comment, I suspect it's not just the working class that's ditching the liberal program. A lot of the lower end of the salary class is turning to something a lot more like social democracy, as exemplified by Bernie Sanders, which is just as much of a challenge to the liberal status quo. One way or another, we're in for a wild ride.<br><br><a href=#c667741996240881048 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 4:58 PM</a><br><br>

One possibility that I can see is that Trump wins the popular vote but Hillary wins the electoral vote because the Democrats have a built-in geographical advantage.

More on this in an upcoming post! <br><br>Rustin, I'm coming to see a universal basic income as a relatively simple fix for one of the industrial economy's most pervasive self-destructive features. I'll be talking about that, too, in an upcoming post. <br><br>Breanna, no, I didn't see that -- thank you!

Either way, what's unsustainable sooner or later will not be sustained...<br><br>Mister R., yep -- that's exactly the sort of thing I had in mind. As for Beale, hmm. Maybe, but I don't think Trump believes that. <br><br>Lordberia3, I'm kind of in the middle here; I'm no admirer of Donald Trump, and I certainly don't expect him to come through on all the promises he made, but yes, I think it's possible he could at least slow down the endless march to war in the Middle East and maybe ditch some of the policies that are getting rid of American jobs. I doubt it will be enough, but it could be something. <br><br>David, exactly. That wider perspective has to be kept in mind even, or especially, while dealing with the crises of the moment. <br><br>Professor, I see the same thing. The one point I'd make about the change of power is that it's not actually the political class that has the weapons and the power. All they do is issue orders -- and we got to see in the late 1980s and early 1990s, in the former Warsaw Pact states, what happens when the people who are supposed to follow orders stop doing so. <br><br>NomadicBeer, so noted! <br><br>Shane, some major elements go back to Ronald Reagan, for that matter, but the neoconservative ascendancy really got bolted into place with George W. Bush. <br><br>John, he doesn't have to care. He simply has to recognize that if he pursues policies that discard business as usual in favor of a rebalancing that benefits the silenced majority, he's going to be reelected in a landslide. I think he's more than enough of an egotist to want that!<br><br>NomadicBeer, notice that they left out everyone in the middle. The rich have enough money to pay for coverage; the poor get subsidies, though the co-pays and deductibles are still ruinously high; it's the people in the middle who don't get the subsidies and don't have the cash to cover medical insurance bills that cost more than a mortgage. <br><br>Dale, Pence is supposed to scare you; he's a well-chosen impeachment insurance policy. Clinton's choice of Kaine was stunningly inept; if you're one of the most detested people in American political life, you don't choose a well-liked moderate with no baggage as your running mate -- not unless you basically want to pin a sign saying IMPEACH ME to your own backside. <br><br>Bill, I'm by no means sure that that's a valid generalization. As I noted in my post, a lot of Trump voters seem to be motivated by specific, concrete issues, not the sort of fantasy images you've evoked. <br><br>Patricia, I'm not saying that Trump's a good choice. As I noted quite some time ago, there are tens of thousands of Americans who would be a better president than he will. It's just that, to my mind, Hillary Clinton is not one of them. <br><br>Tolkienguy, I certainly didn't mean to present Trump as a panacea! Quite the contrary, he's nearly as problematic as his main adversary, and you're quite right that no matter who wins, we're in for a period of bitter polarization and quite probably political violence. Reconciliation, I suspect, is still a long way away -- at least as far as it was in, say, 1860...<br><br><a href=#c4377606905288455799 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 5:51 PM</a><br><br>

These days people confuse money for actual wealth without realising that once the government that issues that money goes into massive debt and begins printing that money - then it is worth less with each passing year. <br><br>Yesterday morning, I passed by a bus stop in the big smoke and there was a guy - who was clearly an addict of some sort in his final days - and he was picking a few of his open sores on his leg. And he asked me if I had a smoke which I could give him. What do you say to that? Sorry mate, I don't smoke is what I said. Homelessness and mental health issues are way, way up and on the rise down here.<br><br>It is interesting, but I had a strange insight this morning that it is only possible to live in the moment if someone else is taking responsibility for your situation. And when they're not doing that, you really are up the creek without a paddle if you attempt that particular trick of outsourcing your responsibilities to someone who is no good or irresponsible. US politics - and down here too - appear to me to be a lot like that. That is why people claim that it all doesn't matter, because for them it probably doesn't. Dunno, but it seems like a confused way to get through life to me.<br><br>Cheers - and nice to have you back too.

As much as I prefer some of Trump's policies (or pretend policies - I half suspect he will do an end-run to maintain the corporate oligarchy of which he is a leading beneficiary if elected), I simply cannot stand his demeanor, his divisiveness, and his willingness to scapegoat and stereotype others.<br><br>I had to respond to this:<br>"The rich have enough money to pay for coverage; the poor get subsidies, though the co-pays and deductibles are still ruinously high; it's the people in the middle who don't get the subsidies and don't have the cash to cover medical insurance bills that cost more than a mortgage."<br><br>I'm a member of the unsubsidized individual market, i.e. Obamacare's big losers. There is much that needs to be done to bring down health care costs - none of which is addressed by the law as it deals only with insurance - but in my opinion the law is a net positive with one major flaw that could be easily fixed. As written, the law allows insurance companies to create risk pools for employer group plans, with a separate risk pool for the individual market. As this group includes many previously-uninsurable people with "preexisting conditions" and high medical bills, the average cost for the individual market risk pool is proving to be untenable. This is essentially imposing a penalty on the self-employed, small local business employees, and part-time workers while privileging full-time employees of large corporations, primarily the salary class.<br><br>A simple fix to the law would require insurance companies to create universal risk pools based on a few permissible factors (age and smoking status, perhaps) and charge the same premiums to everyone in the same risk category, whether on an individual or employer-paid plan.<br><br><a href=#c2554504855468426270 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 7:25 PM</a><br><br>

Yeah, that is definitely NOT happening from just one more Hillary Clinton e-mail story. The steady collapse of Obamacare represents a major failing of the Obama administration on one of its core policies and biggest promises. That is actually something worth voting a party out for, and the small but critical number of voters who remain "on the fence" feel this. More e-mail gossip rumors and leaks? Meh. <br><br>Still, there are a very small number of voters whose minds are not already firmly commited to one, the other, or neither-of-those-crooks.

It's sad that so many Trump supporters latched onto the few moments in the program that Peakfuture referred to, where Mike succinctly explained the very real and valid reasons why the flyover states have every reason to stick it to the man!! Unfortunately, by switching off and not listening to the rest of the story, they may be missing the only chance they have of getting out of the predicament they've been dumped into.<br><br>OK, so maybe Hillary isn't going to do a Pope Francis, who bided his time for years, not rocking the boat until he got into a position where he could make a REAL difference. Hillary has been pilloried mercilessly for decades for daring to suggest that America could do better in the Health sector. In particular, Mike pointed out that while the 3000 victims of 9/11 are rightly remembered, no-one but the victims gives a snot for the 1,000,000 fellow Americans who have died as the result of the crappiest Health Service in the 1st World.

This is the ONLY way significant change will happen and would represent a genuine middle finger to the establishment in D.C. -- Trump is and always will be a phony, and it pains me that the Republic's justifiable anger is being channeled through a conman and not something like a constitutional convention.<br><br><a href=#c5288327637005654589 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 8:27 PM</a><br><br>

Although he suggested that coal would last 1000 years, he did actually say at a rally that other energy sources have a finite life. I mean, holy shale, even though it was an offhand remark by the Orange One, that sounds like progress to me. He also made a direct connection between domestic US energy (which presumably includes Canada and Mexico) and national security, which although obvious, is quite something to see a credible politician talk about in public.<br><br>Although I find a lot of the alt-right to simply be racists for the sake of feeling superior and therefore ignore many of them them, I still kind of like Red Ice Radio &amp; a few other 'alt right' podcasts.

Ryan talked about the petro-dollar and the possibility of the US going to war with a competent opponent as part of a Faustian bargain to maintain the US dollar.

The result has been a disenfranchisement of the ordinary working classes, specially in smaller cities, rural/semi rural areas and on the perypheries of some big cities (and by that I don't mean the geographic suburbs, which could be upper-class, but just working-class neighborhoods). Again, a worldwide phenomenon. What has been happening lately, and with increasing speed, is that this vital electorate has given up on traditional politics and have been giving the middle finger to the political establishment by electing non-traditional right wing candidates, often extremly right-wing populists. <br><br>Brexit had this undertone. Trump. Duterte in the Philipines. Several righ-wing parties gaining rapid ground in Europe. This is happening to some extent here in Brazil, etc. <br><br>These movements are <b>NOT</b> going to make anything better, though. They tend to do unproductive things, like scapegoating minorities of various kinds for economic problems, start nationalistic wars and promote ethnic cleasing, in the extreme. This, couple with formation of warband culture on the outskirts, may be what causes the system to finally enter it's death-kneel. It won't be pretty, though, if it goes like that. Some people seem to forget that, as intolerable as things seem to be near a collapse, the collapse itself is worse. It's faint reasurrance that things will sort themselves up in the long term. The long term can take a loooooong while. <br><br>I'm really sad by the commenter above that illustrated her dreadful economic situation and the impact that healthcare insurance has had on her family, but putting your hopes in Trump is, I'm afraid, very misguided. You're unlikely to experience any improvement if he wins, because I don't think he's sincere in the populist stuff he talks about. Electing him, though, will have a non-trivial chance of hastening the end of whatever is left os american democracy. <br><br>The solution, it seems, would be for some sort of political movement that abandons the current liberal urban upper-class interest and forms some sort of aproach with moderate political/social working and middle class conservatives to try to create some form of political movement against the financial class and corporate hegemony. It seems that Bernie Sanders was trying to create such a movement, but failed to atract enough support and was torpedoed by the Dem establishment. I hope his movement doesn't die in the US and more people like him start to crop up on the left-leaning spectrum of political life in the future, in more places. Could be too late, though.

I feel uncomfortably lucid instead of pleasantly debilitated.<br><br> Second, to JMG and Breanna, I got about halfway through the Atlantic article before I realized two interesting things. One, they also realize that politics is inescapably related to matters of competing interests, as was discussed here recently. And that cooperation, coalition, collusion, corruption, brat in Russian, guānxì in Chinese, graft, or honest graft, whatever you want to call it, is a feature not a bug. As the social mammals that we are this is something that is going to happen and there are ways to utilize it and mitigate the less desirable aspects. Two, they incorrectly, in my opinion, blame our current problems on a break down in the system of graft and political machines. I think the breakdown lies elsewhere in two related areas. The decadent, entrenched, and disconnected elite and a fracturing of the collective consensus. As you know know from Toynbee, Spengler, Gibbons, et al the entrenched elite is perennial problem for civilizations, but the fracturing of collective consensus feels more like a fourth turning, 2.5 crises, revolutionary war, civil war, great depression kinda thing that if handled well might be ok on the other side.<br><br>Normally I conclude with a 'Thanks, Tim' but thanks implies the sort of pleased gratitude one might have for the instructor after an ordinary class in Tai Chi.<br><br>Uncomfortably grateful and appreciative, altered and affected, and unpleasantly aware, almost as if my consciousness had been smacked with a highly caffeinated slice of lemon wrapped around a brick,<br>Tim<br><br><a href=#c799802178436095053 title="comment permalink">11/2/16, 11:35 PM</a><br><br>

Every time I read an essay like this, my lack of understanding history and sociology becomes quite painful.

Half of Americans get some kind of government handout, and when that ends, the misery begins.

One possibility that you have not mentioned is that part of the establishment will make common cause with the working class by playing the identity card, but in order for this to work they will need to pin the blame for the current mess on some other section of the ruling elite. A section of the elite ideally distinguished by ethnicity or religion and with a reputation for aggressively pursuing their own collective interests. If this ethnic/religious group's influence were dis proportionally concentrated in the most despised sectors of the system, the worlds of finance the media and America's disastrous foreign policy, especially Middle Eastern policy, then so much the better.

Yes I would appreciate your thoughts on that matter and I have heard you refer to that particular book in podcasts, but have not read it myself. I may have to correct that lack. Is it a worthy book? The insight came this morning when I was observing the dogs running through the orchard on their important canine business in the warm spring sunshine and they were absolutely 100% in the moment and chasing reptiles, insects and phantoms. As always there was the human contrast to the canine behaviour which drummed home the insight.<br><br>The thing I'm curious to know is whether the "Left" as it is generally understood to be, actually is the "Left" anymore? A very cheeky person may suggest that they have possibly "left" the building? ;-)!<br><br>What an exciting week or two you are all in for!<br><br>Down here, the powers that be announced that the Hazelwood power station will be decommissioned in March with the loss of 900 jobs in what appears to be an already economically depressed area. Sure, the power station burnt the plentiful supplies of brown coal which are readily available in this state and the power station was enormously inefficient, but I just help shake the feeling that somehow this closure was linked to the shutdown of the vehicle manufacturing industries. Maybe it is and maybe it isn't. I heard someone on the radio from a think tank suggesting that electricity security will be fine because we can rely on generation facilities in the state to the north of us (New South Wales) which burns black coal. Now, call me a Cassandra but the links between both here and South Australia (relying on Wind) and also Tasmania (relying on Hydro) both broke within the last year causing all sorts of disasters. What could possibly go wrong with this absurd plan? And I am personally very curious as to why nobody in the media seems to apply this same sort of thinking to industries such as tourism.<br><br>Back in the day those areas used to employ huge number of apprentices, but not so anymore.<br><br>I recall that many years ago the most popular Prime Minister in our recent history, faced a smear campaign in the media during the election about how he had been to a strip club. All that media smear campaign did was reinforce in the minds of the voters – who it should be pointed out are not the people setting the moral tone of the media - that this dude was just like them and his popularity soared. It was a bad thing for us when apparently a cabal of mining magnates pooled together - and this is all speculation - a $22m war fund and took him out of his job. As you quite rightly point out, nobody expects their politicians to be Saints, I certainly don't. I judge them on whether they can get a job done. And on that note, it is worthwhile mentioning that recording one and a half years of metadata at the expense of the average person down here went through parliament like a breeze – despite one notable politician who was responsible for the implementation not even being able to explain what metadata actually was – unlike their strange displays of gridlock on other matters nowadays. Oh, how they must fear your night.

Deporting 11 million illegal aliens doesn´t seem possible either. However, if his administration becomes highly repressive, I suppose he can discourage new immigrants from entering the US. They will go to Canada instead! The Canadian government is set to double its immigration rates, apparently. If Trump can overcome the resistance of the Neo-Cons in his own party (including his own veep, Mike Pence), he might be able to change US foreign policy, from adventurist and clueless to more pragmatic. My fear is that Trump might simply exchange enemies by making a deal with Russia while simultaneously stepping up the confrontationist attitude towards China. As I said two weeks ago, I would prefer a multi-polar world in which the great powers balance each other, and even cooperate on some crucial issues (such as the war against radical "Islamic" terrorism). <br><br>In summary, this means that Trump is at best moderately better than Clinton would have been, but hardly the Savior of Western Civilization. I think you are right when you said that thousands of people are better qualified to be president than Trump - the problem is, Clinton isn´t one of them! In the future, Trump will probably be seen as a transitional figure to whatever comes next. <br><br>Which brings me to your Soviet analogy. Your comparison of Clinton to Chernenko and Kaine to Gorbachev is actually quite funny - yes, Chernenko was the poor old man who died in office after only a year or so, making a mockery of the entire Soviet leadership in the process. I´m old enough to remember him (well, dimly - I´m surprised anyone else does!). Hillary is obviously sick and might very well die in office if elected. Kaine is the young, good but weak guy who will fail to hold the Empire together if he ever becomes POTUS. <br><br>However, I doubt America will ever get its Yeltsin (unless Trump is Yeltsin?).

The American empire, on the other hand, began in 1905, with Theodore Roosevelt, just after the reconstruction era post civil war, and will end roughly by the 2030s, making it just as long as Russia's imperial era.

It's a complex system that relies on financing growth, which requires more people getting treated for more things (some treatments of highly dubious value, some less so)and someone paying the prices necessary for everyone to get paid. The "someone" paying for it includes a mix of taxpayers, employers or individuals. And the "everyone" getting paid includes those numerous insurers, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, clinicians, nurses, administration staff, software companies, shareholders, consultants, government agencies, construction companies, equipment manufacturers, retailers, and on and on, that collectively make up the system. And that system is now around 18% of US GDP. A fifth of our economy is in the business of healthcare! Since none of these players seem remotely interested in not getting paid, the system will continue to try to grow, aided and abetted by policy makers who don't want hurt this great engine of the economy. The only difference between the Trump and Clinton plans comes wrt to the balance of the "someones" who have to try to pay for it all. I'm guessing Clinton will try to taxpayer-subsidize the onboarding of more young and healthy people into the risk pool, while continuing to screw the middle segment of the population that JMG has discussed; and Trump will wave his hands about cross-state competition while figuring out how to withdraw or water down the subsidies and pre-existing condition terms of the ACA, pushing more costs back to lower income individuals. But neither of them will seriously try to cut the expense of the system. Because economic growth and jobs.<br><br>To go forward, we have to go back, retrotopia style. Which means fewer people getting fewer expensive treatments, walking away from the system. Which means taking better care of our health, using alternative treatments, using allopathic medicine more sparingly ("surgically", perhaps), knowing ourselves and our constitutions better, and coming to terms with dying rather more quickly than we might have been planning to. This is where we are heading anyway, since the system as it stands is getting decidedly crumbly. Coming to terms with this is one particularly challenging plank in the "collapse now and avoid the rush" platform. Personally I need to take a monthly shot of a medication without which I will suffer a slow decline and death. So I am reliant on the pharmaceutical system staying intact to some extent; meanwhile there are herbal things that I am trying, and making some progress. But it isn't going to be easy, especially for people who are heavily dependent, or believe themselves to be dependent, on the current system.<br><br><a href=#c7692223331023241810 title="comment permalink">11/3/16, 7:38 AM</a><br><br>

I am, however, troubled by how much psychic space politics takes up in our collective consciousness and even this post, and how it takes away from the energy to create the foundations for local/non governmental relations. I understand that you take on the role of education and tying things together, and you do it quite well. AND at some point, I wonder if the nail has been sufficiently pounded in. I wonder what's next. How do we collaborate and act on this understanding? Personally, I am making local connections to foster resiliency in food systems, energy production, and other resources. For instance, gathering and drying literally tons of acorns (it's been a mast year here in Asheville, NC) for human consumption and livestock feed. Almost nobody knows that this is a high quality food source when properly processed. Could be the new currency when fiat goes bust. I am sure there are plenty of other readers here that have useful information like this to share. At present, I am aware of many bloggers and you tubers who assess the situation well, but I am unaware of any forum that fosters practical organization and trading of information.

Over on this side of the pond the parallels with Brexit are impossible to miss. The wails of the affluent just show to me how clueless they really are - I mean how do they even pretend that Clinton is better? I'm not of the opinion that Trump will do much to improve the fate of the States, but I can see why many will vote for him, and certainly wouldn't be so presumptuous as to castigate them for it - and what do I know about their situation or Trump? He might well do what's needed to ease the collapse for many millions. It's the same here with Brexit. I didn't vote Leave in the end, not because I like the EU, but because I didn't want the Tories to gain even more power (which is how I saw it). But what do I know? I know that my hometown, Swansea, is an economic backwater, that without the life support machine (benefits) will quickly descend into crime. The once thriving city centre is now full of charity shops, and not ones that you feel terribly inclined to buy anything from - they're full of the junk of the last decade. Even the charity shops groan and wheeze. They're punctuated by kebab shops and mobile phone shops that promise to fix tour phone and sell you fancy phone covers. It couldn't be further removed from the affluence of the gentrified parts of London. Quelle surprise, The once labour stronghold of Swansea voted for Brexit and is now a stronghold of UKIP. Abandoned by the Blairites where else do they turn?<br><br>I don't like Trump, I couldn't vote for him (nor could I vote for Clinton) - I'm disappointed that Sanders isn't on the ticket, much like I'm disappointed that over here Corbyn will more than likely not get a shot either. But then I'm another middle class, liberal, affluent citizen so what do I know? But if I was one of the working class struggling for a job I'd have a punt on him - why not? What's there to lose? The fact that people don't grasp that's the motivating mentality of many shows they haven't got a clue what's going on in the world. If you asked me though, I'd rather Trump get in than Clinton. If for no other reason than Trump will help to drag out the shadow of Western society into the light and with that may save us and the 'others' around the world that we perpetrate against, some suffering. Clinton, on the other hand will only continue to suppress our collective shadow by letting us all pretend we're far more decent and civilised than we really are. Now that might be a little unfair on Trump - for he may make some important political interventions, despite his crass character - but at least he doesn't pretend to be what he's not. <br><br>I'm going to largely ignore the histrionics of the media in the next two to four weeks, because it'll just be the wailing of children upset that their toys are being taken away. The changes to Western society that are impending pale compared to the so-called 'crisis' many mainstream papers are discussing Trump and Brexit - I'll save my energy for the crises further down the line - the whole debacle of the two things reminds me of some of your earlier posts on how we must make a spectacle out of something more ordinary. Though I do also realise that Trump and perhaps Brexit is a bit of a rude awakening to many.<br><br>On a final note, I remember a friend of mine about 3 months back saying that it was 'impossible' that Trump will get in. Those were the words. He quoted some study or other - I just smiled and said that it couldn't be further from the truth, and that there's no way they could make such a proclamation. He continued that it was impossible. And 10 years ago he would have been right, but it seems we have now moved into a new territory with new rules.<br><br><a href=#c7268876014598604258 title="comment permalink">11/3/16, 8:40 AM</a><br><br>

Most of the money is flowing to big hospitals, big surgicenters , big pharma and big HMO's, which are mostly located in Urban areas. So if the destruction of working class jobs in the heartland is not enough, the little money that folks in rural and small town america have, is being siphoned off to the big cities for healthcare.

Great post. I really enjoyed the part about doubling down on previous emotional investment. I have friends and family members who are Trump supporters and others who are Hillary supporters. Another interesting thing I have noticed about these Trump and Hillary supporters is that they use the same basic arguments to try and get you to vote for their candidate. And the arguments are all about how bad it will be if the other candidate gets in. A phenomenon you've discussed before. <br><br>Another great observation I've made is when I tell these same people that I am not going to vote for either of the candidates. I tell them that I'm not voting for either because I think they are both liars and will continue the bipartisan consensus regardless of what they say on the campaign trail. After I finish explaining my reason for not voting for either the Trump/Hillary supporter will almost verbatim say: "Well that is just a vote for [the bad candidate]" When I point out that supporters in the other camp say the exact same thing they seem totally surprised by that. A very fascinating thing to observe. <br><br>That brings me to another point specifically about Trump. I don't think it is an open question at all about him actually tackling these real issues if he wins. I think he will go right back to the bipartisan "Loot America" policies that have been in place since Reagan. My reason for thinking that is his economic policy team. It is chock full of some of the biggest billionaire looters on the planet. The same people who have pushed for the bipartisan consensus and profited handsomely from it.<br><br>His economic policy team:<br><br>John Paulson is the founder of investment firm Paulson and Co., and made billions betting against subprime mortgages in 2007 leading up to the financial crisis.<br><br>Roth is the billionaire head of Vornado Realty.<br><br>Hamm is a billionaire oilman and CEO of Continental Resources.<br><br>Lorber is the CEO of tobacco and real estate company Vector Group.<br><br>Mnuchin is Trump's national finance chairman, and the chairman and CEO of hedge fund Dune Capital Management.<br><br>Barrack served in the Reagan administration as deputy undersecretary of interior, and is founder and chairman of Colony Capital.<br> <br>Calk is the chairman and CEO of The Federal Savings Bank.<br> <br>Beal is the billionaire founder and chairman of Beal Bank and Beal Bank USA.<br> <br>Feinberg is the billionaire co-founder and CEO of Cerberus Capital Management.<br> <br>Malpass is a former Bear Stearns chief economist who has had high-ranking roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations.<br> <br>Navarro is an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine.<br> <br>Moore is a former member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board and a founder of the Club for Growth.<br> <br>DiMicco is former CEO of steel company Nucor.<br><br>Source: http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/05/trump-unveils-economic-policy-team-includes-john-paulson.html<br><br>If you want to see Larry Kudlow fawn over these vultures and corporate welfare queens, visit the CNBC link for the video.<br><br>And just a reminder for anyone who doesn't remember John Paulson, he worked with Goldman Sachs to purposely pop the housing bubble to make money on shorting it.

I'm referring here to Trump, Bernie Sanders, and Brexit. And they are the same in a way, I guess, in the same way that Italian food, Mexican food, and Indian Food are all the same by virtue of the fact that they are "not McDonald's." This would seem to be especially true if you had eaten nothing but McDonald's your whole life (which would kill you very quickly, but anyway...). <br><br>The main difference with Brexit is that you have the U.K. *breaking away* from a centralized authority, whereas with Trump you have a political figure who seems to be *craving* the centralized authority. He paints himself as a strong man who is going to solve all our problems, and that he and he alone can accomplish this. He is not a libertarian type who is for states' rights and a non-interventionist foreign policy. Just the opposite, he appears to abhor these ideas. He seems refreshing to some because of his unorthodox style, but his policies appear to be the same old Republicrat trickle down garbage we've been seeing for decades. He makes a lot of noise about immigration but the fact is he has a long track record of hiring immigrants. In short, as you pointed out, there is a very good chance that he cares nothing about the wage class whatsoever. <br><br>Ok, so what? He can't be any worse than the Bush-Obama-Clinton dynasties, right? Well, unfortunately, I think that there is a historical precedent of authoritarian types taking advantage of the populace when they are in the kind of dire straits that you described so eloquently in your post. Is Trump that type of authoritarian? Well, that's debatable, I suppose. I happen to think he is, it seems you do not, however this is not something you have addressed in your analysis that I've seen and I think it's an important point of discussion.<br><br><a href=#c4940496984272401481 title="comment permalink">11/3/16, 9:08 AM</a><br><br>

They have been hammered by nearly 40 years of predatory neoliberal economic policy and insane neoconservative foreign policy. <br><br>One commenter noted that this has been going on since the administration of Bill Clinton. I would offer it extends back to the years of Saint Ronald Reagan, although he at least had sense enough to mix it up militarily with lowly Grenada and not with Russia or China, as the current crop of loonies in the Obama/Clinton orbit seem bent on doing. As an aside, if memory serves, Reagan invaded Grenada to “save” US citizens from Grenada's Marxist government. I think many of the US nationals were in Grenada to attend medical school, no doubt because they could do so without incurring massive student loan debt. Oh, the irony.<br><br>During the Reagan years, the offshoring of American jobs picked up major steam as his administration took the muzzles off of corporations. Here in timber country, for example, the economy of family-owned and private timber companies -- which were managed for generations for sustainable harvests – was laid waste by predatory corporate raiders, who would buy companies with borrowed money, liquidate the private forests, and then completely liquidate what was left of the companies, leaving entire communities devastated. Those companies that remained furthered the pain by turning increasingly to automation. Many shipped raw logs directly to Japan and China because it was cheaper than milling timber in the US. The phrase I heard from people I knew in the industry was “cut and run.” Enter, stage left and on cue, the environmentalists, who argued that this policy should not be allowed on public lands, and we had the perfect scapegoat. It didn't hurt that they could easily be stereotyped as rich, latte-drinking Marin County liberals, and that the guvmint was seen to be implementing their policies.<br><br>Our region has never really recovered. Rural poverty in Oregon is some of the worst in the west, the people caught in it are really pissed, and 2/3 of the state (geographically, but not numerically – The populous I-5 corridor from Portland to Eugene determines Oregon's status as a Blue State) will be voting solidly for Donald Trump.<br><br>I read Orlov regularly, and I think his analysis of the parallels between the collapse of the Soviet Union and the probable collapse of the United States' empire is very powerful. But I wonder if we push the comparison a bit far in trying to figure out if Trump is our Yeltsin and Clinton is our, what? Andropov? I rather think that Trump, if elected, will more likely be our Silvio Berlusconi. Trump has channeled the former middle and working classes' anger effectively because he smells a con, and he is nothing if not an accomplished confidence man. I predict his tenure as President would be characterized by one scandal and outrage after another, by influence-peddling that puts even the Clintons to shame, by self-aggrandizing posturing, by vendettas against enemies both real and perceived, by completely inept administration, and by doing absolutely nothing to alleviate the misery of those who voted for him. Trump wouldn't destroy America, but, like Berlusconi, would advance its status as an economic basket case that threatens to pull a lot of the world down the drain with it.<br><br>Berlusconi had his media empire. There are rumors that Trump is exploring the foundation of a media empire of his own. Berlusconi was also pretty cozy with Putin. There are lots of parallels, but of course Berlusconi did not have a nuclear arsenal at his disposal.<br><br>My wife an I were traveling in Germany this past spring and were constantly asked the German equivalent of “WTF?” when it came to Donald Trump. When I explained my theory of Trump being our version of Berlusconi, they immediately got it.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c3355931219620348243 title="comment permalink">11/3/16, 9:12 AM</a><br><br>

Predation by Big Pharma is largely responsible for those same communities' pharmaceutical and opioid epidemics (and Big Pharma is spending big money to defeat marijuana legalization). California's initiative, which will likely pass, also includes an avenue to review past marijuana convictions. Just as you mentioned rural poor in your region returning to herbal medicine, many people are realizing that marijuana is a much more safe and effective pain medication than, say, Oxycontin.

Racial tensions are high and openly discussed, at least among those of us who reflect lots of light. There are some stores I cannot get waited on.

That includes old women who have no men in their households. Oh, and they'd make sure their kids shoveled my walk for me!

Their reaction to Trump seems to come more from their fear of the unknown he represents. Well that and the ethno-nationalist elements that are supporting him. The lefty circles want a national solution, but not the possibility that the solution may come from someone outside their tribe who doesn’t care to pay lip service to their purity tests. <br><br>I agree with Chris as well, the whole “live in the moment” mantra is really indicative of a bunch of people who don’t want to be responsible for themselves. It’s hyper prevalent on the left-side of the political spectrum. I tried repeatedly to get my newspaper off the ground, and though I got a lot of lip service in support, no one actually bothered to read to paper. Keep in mind I live in a college town that considers itself very politically active. I have a grim feeling that the collapse of the bubble will be far more catastrophic for the left than for the right. <br><br>Regards,<br><br>Varun<br><br><br><br><a href=#c9038549857355884514 title="comment permalink">11/3/16, 11:18 AM</a><br><br>

Do you still live in Western Maryland? I live in Frederick County and I’m not sure I’d refer to Maryland as a flyover state especially east of the Appalachians. Most people in the Frederick area, including myself, moved here for employment opportunities. There are already signs, however, of things starting to slow down. Even with all of the dump trucks, the construction of the new super Walmart and massive road improvements, there is a whiff of desperation in the air.<br><br> I have been traveling through the state with my high schooler visiting various colleges. While we were at the Eastern shore last week, I noticed Trump signs on commercial properties, large agri-business farms and Purdue chicken farm franchises. While coming home from a college visit in Baltimore, there were no Trump signs at an early voting site in Pimlico, an area which comprises mostly black working class residents.<br><br>Back home in Frederick, most Trump signs appear to be in the yards of homes in middle class housing developments. I’ve also seen Trump bumper stickers on vehicles leaving Fort Detrick at the end of the work day. Fort Detrick is the military’s biochemical warfare/research site and is one of the largest employers in Frederick County.<br><br>As for Clinton, I see even less evidence of support for her. I will be surprised if she wins the popular vote. I do find it ironic that she is actually more socially conservative than Trump. She is not divorced. She was raised in the Methodist Church. Her father was a business owner and she was a Republican until 1968. She is about as boring as Bob Dole. Maybe that’s one of the reasons why she is so unpopular, eh?<br><br><a href=#c6217492800137386917 title="comment permalink">11/3/16, 11:28 AM</a><br><br>

I can't help but noticing an add for an investment company that uses the slogan, "In complexity there is opportunity" or something along those lines. This slogan seems like an invitation/admission for/by financial parasites who like to siphon money into their own pockets without actually contributing anything of value. Our health care system is nothing if not complex. Single payer would be far simpler. A part of the Old Testament that gets the least attention these days is the part that one of my literature profs in college called "the social justice thread in the OT." It included the prohibition on usury and the periodic forgiveness of indebtedness. If this Biblical prohibition were taken seriously, I think it would make capitalism impossible.

The Nor Cal of commuting distance to the Bay Area is not typical of rural America. The inland areas are more so. Stockton and Modesto and other Central Valley cities are in desperate straits as are the smaller cities and towns that surround them. Unemployment, drugs, gangs, racial divisions, etc. Large portions of the Central Valley are natural deserts made fertile only by the runoff from mountain snowfall. Since droughts seem to be becoming more severe and frequent the battles over water are heating up. Environmental scientists assert that the rivers must get more water to preserve the ecosystem. But long established patterns of irrigation use have reduced some to less than 40% of normal. One of the local congressional races is focused on this issue, pitting "environmental radicals funded by Nancy Pelosi" i.e. Democrats, against the Republican who promises to restore water to the Valley. In Sacramento itself there has been a huge expenditure on a new arena for the Sacramento Kings basketball team while the mayor and city council continue to ignore the problems of homelessness and lack of wage class jobs. Being a govt. town means that the salary class is pretty well taken care of. <br><br>I am attending local classes for retired people, the Renaissance Society. A speaker for one of the classes pointed out the ways in which government decisions dating back to the New Deal continue to shape the geography of race and poverty in the area. The decision to redline black and Latino neighborhoods from receiving government sponsored mortgages left those areas poor, poorly supplied with amenities such as hospitals and clinics, transit, shopping and so forth. Really amazing to see and think about. Sure it is true in many other areas as well. <br><br>I left my job this past January. The first Medicare insurance plan I enrolled in had $0 premium and reasonable co pays, etc. For 2017 an almost identical plan will be $29 a month. I foresee having to reshop every year.

(Likely neither major candidate will top 50%, but it is possible that his popular vote could top hers.) Two potential results of this: 1) HRC has no mandate and her political capital is weakened considerably, 2) the Republican establishment comes under fire by Trump supporters for its weak backing of Trump (and in some cases disavowal), being seen as having cost him the election.

To think that such a willfully ignorant, self-centered narcissist would actually intend to lead this country in order accomplish anything beneficial other than for himself, and not for the neglected and deserving poor and working classes?

I agree with some of Trump's supposed positions but every time I get a little bit excited about a Trump presidency I remember Trump's last helping hand to desperate Americans. Trump wanted to help folks down on their luck earn a secure future in real estate, so the Trump tells these desperate people that if they rack up their credit cards and borrow from family and friends to pay the $75,000 course fee, those folks would not only learn Trump's secrets, they would be able to invest with the Don Himself, on the ground floor, special access. Of course it was a scam and thousands of Americans had their life savings wiped out. Trump's most trusting fans gave everything they had because they trusted him and the billionaire took it all and left his desperate fans perpetually destitute. <br><br> Hillary is a slimy lawyer/politician but she has never stooped to such depravity as the Trump U scam, nor ever come close. I too find the liberal elite acting too dismissive of the real pain we are feeling, like the biggest problem facing America today is which gender bathroom to use. But, I find the Birther Right to be an existential threat. The Birther Right has no problem telling the biggest and most ridiculous lies to foment hatred and even leaders of Birther Right have threatened "ballot box or bullet box" style threats, church leaders, congressmen and talking heads. They are threatening mass murder not based on some errant policy or actual physical threat,but purely which party gets elected. <br><br>Since Trump hasn't held office, our best guess at what his leadership style might be will come from this world leaders whom Trump admires, Putin, Kim Jung Un and Assad. Trump said Assad is an "A grade" leader, a leader who barrel bombed and gassed hundreds of thousands of his own citizens and caused the worst refugee crisis since the Holocaust. And Trump's pal Putin isn't lifting a finger to help deal with the problem Putin helped create, with Putin actually preferring to destabilize the rest of the West with loads of immigrants from a country rife with Islamic terrorism. Having a president who publicly adores bloody tyrants yet insults leaders like Merkel, leaders who lead over nations with better standards of living, better healthcare, better wages and better worker protections, leaders of relatively free societies compared to Syria and North Korea. <br><br>I get that many people want to at all costs avoid being seen as biased towards liberal and try to be seen as balanced, but the difference between Clinton and Trump is the difference between a cold sore and brain cancer. I think people of conscience owe it to denounce Trump, particularly for the Trump U fraud. I could forgive Trump and maybe vote for him if Trump paid his share of taxes and compensated the victims of the Trump U scam, because then I'd know he was a changed man, unlike the Trump we see today. Who thinks Trump will do the only right thing and compensate his Trump U fraud victims?<br><br><a href=#c2975369862391393323 title="comment permalink">11/3/16, 3:06 PM</a><br><br>

Hopefully the civil comments far outnumber the spittle splattered ones.<br><br>Hopium is a powerful drug, as one commentator quipped. Reagan tapped into it with his Morning in America, Obama did it in spades with his Hope and Change. Trump is now doing it with his Make America Great campaign. Hillary’s response? I’m with Her. Sounds depressing rather than hopeful. You can see the difference in the rally attendance numbers. Trump supporters mob his rallies, Clinton supporters are corralled into hers.<br><br>We voters have been served the hopium line enough times now to see it’s most likely the precursor to a bait and switch routine. Sort of like Charlie Brown and Lucy with the football. Which brings us to flyover country and your comment about the breakdown in our faith in the establishment and the American Dream. We seem to be at the point where “all men are created equal” has passed into the realm of farce, and invisible class structures have metastasized into tools of division and oppression. <br><br>Your parallels to the collapse of the Soviet Union are well taken. I’ve been following the events in Venezuela as closely as possible given the bias of American media, and find many parallels there as well. As you have pointed out in past blogs, many civilizations have gone down this path before, and it’s foolish to think we won’t eventually get there. Trump may forestall that, Clinton surely won’t.<br><br>We Americans do have a choice in our leaders, though I seriously doubt we actually exercise that choice to any extent. Take the US Congress for example. It consistently polls as one of the least liked, least trusted institutions in the country. So what have we done about it? For at least the last 40 years, we’ve reelected over 90% of the incumbent politicians, and much of the 10% turnover is from voluntary retirements, not voter angst. How do you reconcile near total revulsion on one hand, and near total approval on the other? It must belie a sort of cultural schizophrenia. <br><br>At this point in the national embarrassment that is this election, I feel much more kinship to Mercutio than Hamlet, with a rapier in my gut and bile on my tongue.

It is that the USSR could see that the west was doing much better. It was easy to pull support away from the existing institutions in the USSR to a movement that said "We are not winning. We need to make a break with the past because there is a better option out there." The only countries competitive with the US at the moment are Scandinavian bastions of the big government liberal approach that you paint so negatively along with some other British colonies and east Asian countries. (https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction/) There is going to be much less potential for an organized alternative to business as usual when there is no model out there that is demonstratively better. I know you think the system is so shaky that it is almost to collapse, but I think there is enough pragmatism in people that they will not collectively choose a much lower standard of living than is possible by maintaining the existing political structure, even if it has deep problems. So when a Trump like candidate tries to blow up the system, the huge number of educated influencers will make him look foolish enough that they will stabilize business as usual. And don't be fooled. In a collapse, it is the uneducated and rural poor that are going to get hit hardest. (See the 1930s great depression) In short, I think democratic capitalism in its American incarnation is much more resilient than you describe because those on the right wanting to blow it up are suggesting replacements that are incompatible with each other and are almost certain to produce much worse results. And enough people in positions of influence know this so that a soviet style collapse of political legitimacy is unlikely.<br><br><a href=#c7300351811013113328 title="comment permalink">11/3/16, 6:30 PM</a><br><br>

I watched part of one of his rallies the other day on YouTube and one of things he brought up was the obscene rate hikes that so many people are facing. He pointed out that in Arizona, health insurance rates for those covered through Obamacare are rising an average of 117 percent. Think about that. Some of the commenters have pointed out that even with the government subsidies for low-income people, a growing number are reaching the point where they can no longer afford it.<br><br>Clueless Hillary meanwhile continues to defend Obamacare, talks about how wonderful it is and claims everything will be just fine with a few minor adjustments around the margins. That's cold comfort for the millions of people who are losing their healthcare because of skyrocketing insurance rates and all those people who can't use their overpirced health insurance without ending up in bankruptcy court because the co-pays and deductibles are so high.

Sales of Twilight’s Last Gleaming remain steady, and the five part series on which it was originally based is still way up there on the alltime most-read list, so it’s not impossible that a bit of inspiration trickled that way.<br> <br>Guilherme, I see Trump as a transitional figure, a lightning rod of sorts around which the mass movement of the dispossessed is taking shape in this country. If that movement embraces old-fashioned democratic process – which I think is quite possible – then it could accomplish much; if it goes for the easy totalitarian answer, then Weimar America, here we come!

Nobody wanted to hear any of it, and frankly, I learned to just shut up about it because it alienated me quickly. Since the collapse of 08, everything has changed for the rural and wage-earning suburbanites. Truly rural people are well situated for collapse, with extensive food networks that haven't changed much since the invention of the pickup truck and will easily convert back to horses (though they mostly still seem to think the pickup will be around forever). They tend to stockpile guns and ammo, and have been doing that for longer than I've been alive. They have gotten angrier though. The realchange is in the suburbs. You would be SHOCKED if you knew how many families have "collapse plans" and have discussed them with their close confidants. A lot of people in the lower classes feel like they're watching wile e. Coyote hover in midair in that split second before he looks down. But remember this engine can run solely on the fumes of belief in itself for a looong time, I guess it's a type of inertia. If any one of us could correctly pick that "collapse day" and write it on the calendar, none of us would be reading these blogs anymore, we would all be reading "diy backyard chickens" and "how to can cattail root".<br><br>It's possible when trump was "admitting issues" you didn't catch it because they aren't issues to the affluent.

By all means enjoy the creatures of the night, while we’re waiting for ours to slither off to the saurian ooze from whence they sprung...<br><br>Donalfagan, it’s essential to current mainstream political rhetoric that everything has to be flattened out into the categories of race and gender, so that the impact of class and the rural-urban divide can be erased from public discussion. I see those stories as just par for the course, disinformatsia of the classic American Pravda type. <br><br>Dan, well, we’ll see, won’t we? <br><br>Brian, I just hope we haven’t been awful enough to deserve Clinton! <br><br>Tidlösa, Ivan Grozny is always a possibility. With regard to Trump and the American economy, a lot depends on what you mean by that slippery term. If you average out the kleptocratic frenzies of the very rich and the destitution of the majority, you get a “recovery;” in the same way, if the very rich take it in the shorts and the majority stabilizes and gains a bit, you could well have a “recession.” <br><br>Bruno, hmm! Fascinating. You’re quite right, of course. I may have to put some time down the road into figuring out how many other empires lasted either 140 years or some multiple thereof, perhaps with down time in between. <br><br>Rita, granted. It’ll be interesting to see what happens when nobody can afford the airdrops any more. <br><br>Tidlösa, nah, he could have picked dozens of other people if that was the deal. Pence was chosen because he gives Democrats violent nausea, and so Trump would have to go way overboard before a Democratic-controlled Congress (if that happens) would grit their collective teeth and impeach him.

Fair enough; the question is whether anybody on either side has figured out that one too many looting operations like that could destabilize the entire system and leave bankers dangling from lampposts...<br><br>Blackwyn, I haven't addressed it because I haven't seen any reason to think that either one of the candidates is any more or less authoritarian than the other. As I've pointed out in previous posts, the left likes to fling around the word "fascist" -- it's one of their favorite bits of hate speech -- though the frankly ignorant way they use it reminds me of Tom Lehrer's injunction not to write naughty words on walls if you can't spell.

It'll be fascinating to see how all this plays out. <br><br>Mister R., almost anything would have been better than the mess we ended up with -- and yes, if Obamacare puts the final nail in Clinton's coffin, nobody in the privileged classes will mention that for a lifetime and more. <br><br>Fred, thank you. <br><br>Varun, the American left alternates between actually trying to change things, on the one hand, and concentrating on preening itself on its moral superiority to everyone else on the planet, on the other. The purity tests come in during the latter phase. Give it time, and it'll implode. <br><br>Whereami, next time you go for a drive, head west on 70, then turn onto 68 and keep going until you get to Cumberland. We're almost twice as far west of you than you are from Baltimore, and we're well into flyover territory out here. A lot of people in your end of Maryland -- from here, everything from Hagerstown east is "downstate" -- forget about us up here!<br><br>Steve, I'm hoping for stalemate. It'll keep most of the worst case scenarios at bay. <br><br>Pantagruel7, I ain't arguing. <br><br>David, that specific possibility is one that I've considered. It's also quite possible that Trump will squeak in with a very narrow win and thus no mandate either, while the Democratic party is abandoned by its voters who, quite rightly, blame it for sidelining Sanders (who could have trounced Trump) for Clinton (who failed). <br><br>Mister R., all of the saliva-spraying, fist-pounding rants I fielded and deleted were Clintonistas screaming about how Trump eats small children for breakfast, etc. The Trump supporters who post here have been uniformly polite, even when they disagree with me. <br><br>Clay, one more irony in the fire! <br><br>Gabriela, but that's how democracy actually works! Show me a democratic society that doesn't routinely attract scoundrels and fools to high office; to my knowledge, there's never been one. <br><br>RAnderson, as I noted in the post, not everyone thinks that the election ought to be decided on the basis of the moral virtue of the candidates, you know. <br><br>Marc, as I noted in the post, working class people (notice the way you slipped in the usual insistence that they're all of one skin color; they aren't) have a choice between one candidate whom they know beyond a shadow of a doubt will pursue the policies that have destroyed their communities and plunged them into poverty and misery, and another candidate who might do something else. Their logic in voting for the latter, it seems to me, is impeccable.<br><br><a href=#c1931392166766769809 title="comment permalink">11/3/16, 9:09 PM</a><br><br>

The max you could be charged for an ER visit was 100 dollars. Co pays of 25 or 30. It was 300 per month, then 350 and then 400, which was a lot of increases I thought. Lack of transparency was already a big problem.<br><br>My daughter's family has a good middle class income and insurance with a pretty nice employer. White collar. Yet they pay, even with the employer paying whatever they pay, about 1200 per month for their insurance, and it covers very little. Due to some bad luck they have had to go to the ER a couple of times and they come out of it owing hundreds and even a couple of thousand dollars. Not a big trauma case, just a few tests or some IV fluid, that kind of thing. So even though they are not poor, they do have student loan debt and a mortgage and car payment - it really is a bit tough to get sick or even just to be afraid that something is very wrong (all three cases turned out okay) and then be socked with bills like 1700 dollars when you already pay out 1200 a month. <br><br>A lady on medicare at the hospital where I work showed me her bill for the helicopter ride, 30 thousand and some change. Medicare is an 80/20 plan, which means she owes 6000 dollars for that trip and of course probably thousands more for the rest of her stay. <br><br>So I called a helicopter service in a nearby city and asked them if they gave tours to the public. They sure did and I could hardly get the salesguy off the phone. He said we could take 4 people for 2200 dollars for a one hour flight, but if we didn't do it at the last minute and reserved it ahead of time, the price would be 1,499.<br><br>I get that Lifeflight has 2 trained personnel and some equipment and might even be a little bit bigger helicopter, but how do you square that?<br><br><a href=#c1403976696453188627 title="comment permalink">11/3/16, 9:35 PM</a><br><br>

Lots of my friends are there, I even consider going, but I don't think that long distance travel is the way to support it. You observed that the protesters cannot win unless they go on the offensive, well to do that they would have to effect change where the protest exactly isn't. <br><br>An oil worker I know posted to his facebook, sarcastically, a great idea. Ribbing the protesters, he suggested that if they don't want the pipe line they should start by turning of the natural gas line into their homes. My friend certainly has little love lost over the Standing Rock protesters, but I think he has a good idea.<br><br>The only way to resist pipelines is to block demand, and the way to do that is to decrease our personal use of fuels and then to inspire others to do the same. A boycott is what I am suggesting. A retro technique. Even a small number of protesters actively working in communities around the country to decrease their areas demand for fuel, using appropriate tech, could have a disproportionate benefit.<br><br>I am trying to decrease my house holds fuel needs, but I have a long way to go. The skills to do these things is something that I am having to develop from scratch, my gardening skills have moved up a bit, but manufacture is another story still.

So Sara and I were able to dine pleasantly at a nearly empty steak house, with no screens and decent beer, and walk a nearly empty boardwalk that's wall-to-wall human flesh during the season. It was pleasant. <br><br>Bill, not at all. I'm taking Clinton at her word when she says her economic plan will focus on handing out benefits to the middle class, and when she talks about picking a fight with Russia. As for Trump University, er, you really need to check out the sleazefest that is the Clinton Foundation; selling preferential treatment at the State Department to foreign nationals for plump under-the-table donations is pretty well up there on the scale of graft, you must admit. <br><br>Helix, I know. No matter what happens, it's going to get ugly. <br><br>Ethan, thank you. Nice metaphor, by the way! <br><br>Patricia, hmm! That's a historical comparison I hadn't considered, but of course you're quite correct. Hmm and hmm again. I may need to do a post on that. <br><br>Glenn, fair enough. I simply noted that you were only talking about the people on the two ends, and that's common enough these days that I overreacted. <br><br>Sub, you're welcome and thank you. I wish I knew some way to get it through the heads of the privileged and clueless that they're cutting their own throats by supporting screw-the-majority policies with a big side dish of sneering contempt for the victims of those policies, but so far I haven't found a way. <br><br>Fodder, fortunately, yes -- I got maybe twenty saliva-flecked rants, and close to 170 comments that, even when they disagreed with me strenuously, had the grace and common sense to do so in a civil and reasoned fashion. I think that speaks very well of the readership of this blog. <br><br>Ganv, I wonder if we live in the same country. The collapse of legitimacy, as I noted in my post, is already well under way among the increasingly impoverished and silenced majority in America; the people in power are doing nothing to forestall it -- and they, not Trump, are the ones most likely to bring the system crashing down, by pursuing a set of hopelessly unsustainable economic and foreign policies in the teeth of all the evidence that those policies have already failed. What's more, people do have an example of something better to look toward; the past. Most people in middle America were a lot better off a few decades back, and they know it. That's why retrovation is already becoming a massive social force in America, and will in due time turn into a massive political force as well. <br><br>LatheChuck, it's way too early to identify our Putin, if we get one. We might get a Napoleon Buonaparte instead, you know! As for your revelation about trade, thank you. If that kind of common sense was more widespread, fewer stupid policies would be in force today. <br><br>Justin, fascinating. The sooner all the libertarian anarchocapitalists turn into something less crazy, such as flat Earthers and believers in the Great Pumpkin, the better off we'll all be. <br><br>Armata, yep.

In some ways we're better prepared than the Russians for collapse, though; we have a cadre of capable people who know how to make things, maintain things, and take a part in creating economic activity (many of them the suspect recent immigrants); but we also have a very large group of people lacking the character or skills, or health even to adjust to severe changes. JMG, as you say, the flyover people (by the way, we have flyover counties here in California also; the places the affluent rarely go to). <br>Partly because of miseducation on many levels, partly because of the rotten elites we've come to accept somehow, the country continues to flounder. We know that the ones left behind don't lack potential intelligence or energy, but their initiative and drive gets taken away. I can see it generationally here in the SF Bay area; the working class tends as a group to become less capable. Is it nutrition? Bad schools? Bad peers? All of the above? But quite a few of the workers here (I know whereof I speak as I am in the building trades) do quite well as there are many opportunities, though many of these pay poorly unless you start your own gig.<br>I guess I'm getting around to saying that this presidential election really doesn't matter; neither party's choice will substantially improve things. Grassroots action, State and local, have a chance to help.

When Rome disintegrated too far to enforce the law, the farmers just walked away. My point is even though things got worse for Rome, they got better for the farmers very quickly. We may have a rough patch ahead, but we may also have a golden opportunity to rebuild our way of life so that we can take our time back and choose to work together with friends and family rather than slaving away for corporate overlords to pay ridiculously high taxes.

Hooooooo boy. That's seriously inaccurate. The Crimean War was when Russia was attacked on its own territory by an alliance of Britain, France and Turkey. I was taught about it when I was still in primary school, back in the 70s - Florence Nightingale, the Charge of the Light Brigade, the Thin Red Line, the Siege of Sevastopol, Balaclava &amp; Inkerman, etc. Not one of the combatant nations in the Crimean War - not the UK, not France, not Turkey - considered the Crimea to be anything but a part of Russia. Russia had many imperial adventures going on at that time, and I've read many entertaining books about them, but they were further east, in the Caucasus and Central Asia, and the first of them was a couple of centuries before the Crimean War! That means that your timing is badly out in your calculations....<br><br>@Alex Blaidd I worked in Swansea up until about 3 years ago. I used to enjoy the laverbread from the market (and there's a great cheese stall there as well!). Even then, the deprivation was obvious, and it could be pretty scary at times. You're right about the town centre: charity shops, pawnbrokers, slot machine arcades, and not a great deal more. I'm not sure that I agree with you about the charity shops - I got some good furniture from the Heart Foundation shop, and the Oxfam on Wind St is a good source of old books! All that tells us, of course, is that the last generation with the taste and money for good furnishing, and the education for reading, is dying off. What was obvious was that many of the remaining thriving shops are ethnic supermarkets - I recall Chinese, Indian, Turkish/Kurdish, and Polish. Great for me as a lover of spicy foods etc, but it says a great deal about demographic change in what was until very recently a traditional white working class stronghold. IIRC, the local council declared Swansea a 'sanctuary city', and has a policy of inviting refugees I wonder what connection that might have to the UKIP vote you mentioned? I think we agree overall that both the current circus in the US and Brexit are symptoms of an ongoing, underlying, collapse.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c5760474373113936630 title="comment permalink">11/4/16, 3:44 AM</a><br><br>

I chose that date because it was that election that made it clear to me that the working class low-key hated the healthcare law in a pretty big way. But now that it's late 2016, Obamacare has since used its chance to demonstrate that it is rather more awful than I imagined it would be in early 2010!<br><br>I also performed an interesting mental exercise yesterday. If I were legally compelled to vote, could choose between only Clinton and Trump, and my vote would not be a matter of public record, I would very reluctantly vote for Trump only because he advocates a minimal level of reconciliation with Russia. If Clinton were, instead of being the uber-hawk she is, a perfect midpoint between a hawk and a dove but absolutely everything else about her were the same, I would very reluctantly vote for Clinton. That is because I find myself just a little bit more aghast every time I learn something about the personality The Donald reliably and consistently displays, and I wouldn't want to give such a person the nuclear codes under normal circumstances.

It's almost the exact same story, a populist candidate with a whole lotta ugly wrapped up in his language, but ideas boiling and ready to be tossed from the fringe and the mainstream. With Goldwater, we had his ideas refined and honed and channeled through the New Right, which lobbied to bring an end to the New Deal and turn it into a neutered compromise in the form of LBJ's New Society program, and eventually found a voice fully in the mainstream with Ronald Reagan, who brought out the unspoken shadows of American thought, took up the same populist approach but with less of the rhetoric that empowered his opponents, and (for all his long term problems which we've often discussed), wound up being popular enough that his policies became the consensus that still has a hold on both parties today. The road from Trump's Goldwater to a future Fred Halliot's (or the more democratic alternative's) Reagan will probably be a much shorter road, but if Trump loses this election, I expect his place in history to be much the same.<br><br><a href=#c14184985769173324 title="comment permalink">11/4/16, 8:11 AM</a><br><br>

Any great-great grandchildren of "the people who surged to the barricades during the Russian Revolution" would have been very young indeed in the late 1980s. <br><br>A 35-year-old at the revolutionary barricades in 1917 (and many on the front lines were of course younger than 35) would have been born in 1882. His children were born circa 1905; his grandchildren circa 1931; his great-grandchildren circa 1956; and thus any great-great grandchildren were born circa 1981, and were little kids during the last years of the USSR. (Of course I'll grant that these years very much deserve their <i>circa</i>s.)<br><br>Again, my only point in mentioning this is because an institutional and familial memory of revolution -- what it really is, how it works, what its many downsides look like -- was very much more present in the USSR than it is in today's America. That revolutionary man born in 1882 spent the rest of his life telling family and friends about his firsthand experience at the barricades. Younger 1917 revolutionaries (those born circa 1897) might have lived until the late 1970s or early 1980s. <br><br>Various parties in today's United States like to talk about <i>revolution</i> as if they know what it actually is. However, unless they are the children of certain diasporas, they are incredibly far removed from firsthand stories of any relatively recent example of a national revolution. That's a difference between the USSR of the late 1980s and us, and it's a difference that is not to our advantage.<br><br><br><a href=#c8417662481745829831 title="comment permalink">11/4/16, 9:59 AM</a><br><br>

On the other hand, you're absolutely right that any real change has to start from the ground up, beginning with the choices that each of us makes every single day of our lives. <br><br>Jessi, that's a valid point. Did you know that the average medieval peasant worked fewer hours, had more days off, and kept a larger portion of the value of his labors than most full time employees in America do today? <br><br>Bogatyr, so noted. If the beginning of Russian empire is counted as the start of its eastward expansion into Siberia, though, the beginning of US empire would have to be the beginning of westward expansion here, which puts it before the American Revolution. <br><br>Sven, I'm flattered! <br><br>Fred, well, we'll see. <br><br>Mister R., I get that.

I'm still working on the Bill of Redress, but it ought to have something to offend everyone. <br><br>Eric, and that's also a workable parallel -- though as I recall, Goldwater was stomped, and of course it took four more elections before his ideas hit the big time with Reagan; I doubt the same sort of lag time will occur here. <br><br>Bill Ding, you know, if I'd set out to parody the arrogance of the privileged toward the working classes, I don't think I could have done a better job than you've just done here.

The working classes, faced by one party (the Dems) that was actively hostile to their interests and full of sneering contempt for their values, and another (the GOP) that at least paid lip service to the latter, did exactly what most Clinton voters are doing now, and voted for what they thought was the lesser of two evils. <br><br>Owen, once I can find something coherent that explains exactly what everyone is yelling about, sure. <br><br>Phil, if that's true, it's all over for Clinton. <br><br>Matt, yes, I read that one also, and it was well worth the time spent.<br><br><a href=#c6992054881267508685 title="comment permalink">11/4/16, 1:56 PM</a><br><br>

Aside from Trump's nasty racist, sexist persona, I worry about his climate change denial, support of increased coal mining and lack of any environmental concern.

Having said that, the sense I get from her, specially from reading people whom I quite trust, is that she's just a very standard politician, with extra-gravy on being legally bought-for by big corporate interests. She's a sleazy, slick politician, from a very conventional background for that kind of people: ambitious, hard-working, willing to cut unsavory deals to advance, etc. The people who tend to think she's a sociopathic war monger, that enjoys the suffering of others and will plunge the world in WW-III are usually alt-right or close to it, and I don't tend to trust their judgment. <br><br>I concede it that she has an excellent chance of getting the US involved in a even more confrontational foreign policy vis-a-vis Russia. It might end going full-blown proxy war in Syria or the Ukraine. But that has happened before (Korea, Vietnam, Soviet Afghanistan, etc) and the world has not blown up yet. Putin is too shrewd of an operator to be baited into launching nuclear weapons unless actual russian soil is invaded, and I sincerely don't think HRC would do that, and if she did, I'm quite sure a gaggle of Pentagon generals would have something to say about that. So, yes, she might invade some countries in the Middle East. She might drag the world back towards full-blown Cold War again. While bad, none of these things represent WW-III. <br><br>Were I american, I would vote for her, no questions asked. Trump is not exactly fascist (which is a word that I agree with JMG is used far too loosely), but he's a vain, narcissist strongman. The comparisson to Berlusconi or, even better, to someone like Qadafi, is valid. Just the fact that he has refused to say he's going to accept an electoral defeat and his comments about "Second Ammedment people maybe doing something about Hillary" means he's a threat to whatever's left of american democracy, I don't think his populist policies are sincerely held or that he would act upon them, he stands excellent chance of doing some terrible damage to the country and/or world either by design or incompetence and despite agreeing that a majority of his support can be explained by the economic situation of working-class americans (primarily the white ones), there <b>IS</b> a good number of downright racists, conspiracy-theory nutcases, neo-confederate and neo-nazi types on the wings of his movement and electing him, specially if he's stymied by Congress and the career bureucrats, might kick-start the formation of some "Brownshirt Activism" a la what happened to the Weimar Republic which ended up getting our good old friend Adolf elected. <br><br>So, yeah, I would vote for Hillary and risk what I consider to be a truly insignificant risk of global armageddon, and then try my best to do whatever I could to reform the Democratic Party so they pick someone like Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary the next time. It's probably a loosing proposition, but as JMG likes to point out, the time for good outcomes has long passed us. We are stuck trying to minimize the damage. If I was living there, I would prefer any future offspring of mine to live in a graciously crumbling has-been empire, perhaps fractured into somewhat more manageable countries, kinda like the UK is these days, now that I think about it, then in some truly detestable homegrown american version of the Third Reich. With nuclear weapons. Again, not saying Trump = Hitler, not by a long shot.

If we do, every single country in the world would have, at some point at least, to have been through an Imperial phase, and that's absurd. Thus, I think we should consider as the beginning of any country's Imperial phase the first time it tries to impose its will, preferably by force, upon an unprovoked neighbor in a permanent fashion, but without the purpose of incorporating said country in its borders and making its people citizens. For Russia, that would be the Crimean War: Russia intended to project power on the area and bring it to its sphere of influence permanently to exploit it. For the USA, on the other hand, it would be the Spanish-American War, in which the US sought to expand its influence overseas with the very clearly stated purpose of exploiting foreign lands for the profit of the mainland.<br><br><a href=#c8971581013263304865 title="comment permalink">11/4/16, 4:57 PM</a><br><br>

But, specifically: I don't think a country has entered its Imperial phase until it hasn't finished by large its national expansion phase. By "national expansion phase" I mean the phase in which it does not only expand its borders, but also its nationals, people that have a stake on the country's future and may participate in the political life of said country. It's only when a country actively seeks foreign lands and peoples not to integrate within itself, but to exploit, that it has entered its Imperial phase. Again, lets consider the Russians: when they invaded Siberia in the seventeenth century, although even their stated purpose was to exploit it, what ultimately happened was the integration of Siberia within the Russian state, whereas when they took half of Eastern Europe within their borders as one single super state after WWII (the USSR), although their state purpose was to integrate said countries within the soviet political life, what ended up happening was their savage exploitation for the benefit of Moscow.<br><br><a href=#c848292353318702828 title="comment permalink">11/4/16, 5:09 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, all of that is true, mainly because agriculture in the Middle Age was so unproductive that you had to leave a lot of land "fallow" to recuperate and, thus, the acreage worked by each peasant was quite small and farm work tends to be very seasonal. Also, as a percentage, yes, they were less taxed then some modern-day people. But all of that does not represent quality of life.<br><br>Swedes are more taxed then americans, and I don't think they are worse off! Also, while a good GINI coefficient usually means the country in question is a great place to live, some countries with nominally good GINI coefficients, like Ethiopia and Pakistan, are not the sort of places that most people would gladly emigrate to. It doesn't matter if the pie is better divided if the pie is very small. That certainly applied to the Middle Ages! While your church tithe and your feudal obligations could, perhaps, account for only 35-40% or so of your total labour (though it could be much higher, too), which is, indeed, lower then many people pay today as a percentage, there wasn't much left! <br><br>Peasant life in the Middle Age was, as a rule, short, scant in intelectual pursuits, filled with back-breaking labour, insecure in terms of both the ability to feed yourself as well as personal safety, and not very nice, all things being told. Peasants revolts happened for good reason. While these people did the best they could under the circumstances and it's true that they had community life, folk art, etc, I'm particularly sensitive to people who try to paint too-rose-a-picture of life in medieval times, or the glory of living care-free as a hunter-gatherer (until you die from a tooth infection, gets killed in a night-time raid by the neighbouring clan looking to capture women or cattle, or simply starve to death in a bad hunting season, that is). <br><br>Not accusing you personally, mind you, it's just that I've read stuff like that far too many times, and it irks me :)<br><br><a href=#c2402228272483128419 title="comment permalink">11/4/16, 5:13 PM</a><br><br>

From that, he's worked scams in investment, schooling and other things, using his name to squeeze money from others for stuff of less-than-no value. One can say the same for Mrs. Clinton, but at least she puts herself up as a politician (truth in advertising); Trump is a fraud in that area by comparison.<br><br><b>Hillary Clinton:</b> She has a record of betrayal clear as day to this working-class stiff. GATT, NAFTA, Giving China "Most Favored Nation" status, Three Strikes, Ending Welfare As We Know It – All during her Husband's presidency, and everyone knew that she was VERY MUCH INVOLVED with his decisions. This is why West Virginia, once a blue island of resistance against the 1988 landslide, became the red spear aimed at Pennsylvania and New England. Not only that, but her running smells too much like the great southern tradition of wives running for Governor when their husbands run into term limits (Apologies to all Southerners for that, but I remember this VERY CLEARLY from my youth. Even if it's Northern Mythologizing, I still remember it clearly.).<br><br><b>Johnson:</b> The Libertarian Party is nothing but the clear exponent of where things will be in the future if things continue as they have without any crisis to throw things off. Something, in short, that I cannot abide with.<br><br><b>Jill Stein:</b> The Green Party is the party for groups that think they can take over a party and gain national exposure. It rarely works, and said groups get pushed out by someone new every so often and slink into obscurity. I expect that in a few years they'll be taken over by the worst of the Alt-Right types who'll slink away a few years afterwards, hopefully leaving behind a better, smarter alt-right to continue the fight.<br><br><b>The Communist Party:</b> Became the "independent" radical wing of the Democratic Party. 'Nuff said.<br><br>Thankfully the Socialist Party still exists, and has a candidate I could write in in Indiana.

Anybody care to guess what the American 2020 elections will be like? The campaign for it starts next week! I was going to say that the biggest loser of this election is modern journalism, which has been so biased, so contemptuous of people's views, so censuring of inconvenient facts, they they will be in serious danger of commercial flame-out as people walk away from them. I have had to revise this opinion.<br> What is being lost is something far more important and that is trust which is a far more deadly symptom for a society. People have lost trust in their government, in the media, in their political parties, in their fellow Americans, in being able to get ahead at all which is at the heart of the American Dream. Trust is the glue that really holds a society together and even commercial transactions need a patina of trust to work. To paraphrase Obi-Wan, "Trust is created by all living things.

One would think that people who identify themselves as citizens of the world would be promoting a world class education for all, emphasizing the study of world history, geography, foreign languages, and world literature along with mathematics, science and civics."<br><br>There are two kinds of education in the US - one for the common people and one for the elite. I don't know if you are from the US or have children, but it is easy enough to get a flavor of the education of common people through the media. What is hidden from sight is what is happening for the elite. You can't simply go to their school websites and you can't read about it in their yearbooks, or press releases. They appear to have the same sort of school subject, clubs and sports as public schools. But this is like saying people have two legs, two arms, two eyes, etc so they must all be the same.<br><br>The common people graduated to know enough to read to the news and understand the basics of how to get through life. They are trained to be passive, to compete with each other through the ugly sports programs in schools, and to work alone and against each other through classroom instruction. (Every salary employer needs people who can work in teams, but in school is you raising you hand to answer questions trying to answer first before other people. Why? The "real world" doesn't need this skill, but notice how it shows up everywhere in how we deal with each other). <br><br>Also notice how much people most people don't understand classical music, ballet and opera - that leaves these halls protected from commoners. In public school you get high school dances with a DJ playing the most popular music (which will change in a few weeks and you'll have to go out an buy that - public school students are taught to be consumers after all) and students dancing wildly and sexually assaulting each other while adults watch from the sidelines. (Or maybe that was just my school.)<br><br><br><br><a href=#c2008299210954598007 title="comment permalink">11/5/16, 4:47 AM</a><br><br>

Well there you go - the elite and the commoners. I'll share what I know because I do have friends who sent children to those school and here is what you get when you attend those schools - access to adults who are doing big work and strict reinforcement in manners and courtesies.<br><br>What do I mean by "adults who do big work"? I mean most kids only have access to their parents (if they have both) and teachers in high school (who are some of the more boring and dull people on the planet). Elite kids have access to the top performers in industry who bring their children's class to Martha's Vineyard to teach them to sail, take them for golfing, skiing, and out to performances of ballet, opera and music. These interactions and trips are all build into the school year and summer so all year long kids are groomed by real adults, not some state certified college flunky. <br><br>Students get together in socials and dances that are formal so they are used to dressing up and behaving appropriately. Sports are truly team sports and it is the team that wins, not star players featured in local players. Class work is project work and speaking presentations, so one is used to the work at the highest corporate levels.<br><br>Students in elite school shake hands with adults, greet them, are skilled in making respectable small talk, know which fork to use when there are several displayed at a meal, and eat from a wide variety of foods on actual plates with linens at lunch time. There are no chicken nuggets and brown canned green beans served on plastic trays with little partitions so the food doesn't touch each other. <br><br>So the global elitists do want a great education for kids - theirs, not yours. If anyone wants to groom their children into being an adult and can't afford the $50,000 a year for boarding school, then homeschool them and spend your days out in the community. Any adult working a job is a better teacher than any school teacher reading from a curriculum put together by a book publisher and written by eight "experts" and approved by a state board of another eight "experts". And you'll avoid that animal nature encouraged in high schools - a nature that we are all told is a normal part of being a teenager. Why are we told that? They take children and lock them up for 12 years and claim all that behavior is normal. Its like taking an animal in a zoo cage and claiming its behavior is normal. <br><br>It takes a lot of observation and avoiding of all media discussion on education to see what is actually going on in the US.<br><br><a href=#c6406976317419922235 title="comment permalink">11/5/16, 4:49 AM</a><br><br>

According to MIT: http://www.globalresearch.ca/mit-study-of-ghouta-chemical-attack-challenges-us-intelligence/5365110<br>The rebels have also used chemical weapons against Assad's side and the Kurds numerous times since then, including in Aleppo (the most recent was last week):<br>http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/russian-experts-come-aleppo-collect-evidence-chemical-weapons-use/<br>http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/rebels-strike-kurdish-neighborhood-aleppo-chemical-gas/<br>http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/video-us-backed-rebels-use-chemical-weapons-aleppo-civilians/<br><br>As for the refugee crisis, saying that Assad is the main cause of that is as daft as saying that Stalin was the main reason that 20-30 mil. Soviet citizens died in WW2. It's blaming the victim. The whole war got started after Assad rejected a natural gas pipeline from the Gulf States to Turkey in favor of one from Iran. Right after that, the Gulf States, Turkey, EU and US began organizing and funding Sunni jihadists to carve out some real estate in Syria to get that pipeline built. Each had some other reasons, too - the US and EU wanted to block Iranian and Russian influence, Turkey's Erdogan wanted to annex some former Ottoman lands (a task he's managing quite well at the moment, it seems), the Saudis and Qataris wanted to spread their fanatical version of Islam to multi-confessional Syria.<br><br>It's a bit of poetic justice that the EU is now getting swamped by all the refugees from Syria and Libya, because the EU was very much responsible for helping cause the problems in these countries in the first place. The US, of course, is smugly safe behind the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but for the EU this was very much an "own-goal" (the EU seems to be doing a lot of those lately).<br><br>(continued...)<br><br><a href=#c2833522491075959025 title="comment permalink">11/5/16, 8:29 AM</a><br><br>

I don't get it. Putin's position has been that Syrians should make a peace agreement (perhaps in a new federal system) and choose their leaders in democratic elections in which any citizen can participate. The Gulf States', Turkey's, EU's and USA's position has been that Assad cannot be a candidate in any election (this is the reason why every single attempt at peace talks ends at an impasse). Using logical reasoning, we come to the conclusion that BOTH sides believe that Assad has a majority of Syrians supporting him, and would win if any vote were held. What other explanation is there? That his opponents believe that Assad would rig an election in which he was included? Just make it UN-organized and heavily-monitored. No, it seems that both Assad and his opponents know what the outcome of such an election would be, which is why Assad (and Putin) keep offering Syrian elections and their opponents keep rejecting them.<br><br>Also, Putin is the only one abiding by international law in Syria, while the US, Turkey, and EU are all making war illegally without a UN mandate. If the "West" wants to solve the refugee problem, the solution is simple: stop spending money on supporting an anti-Assad jihadist war, and use that money to rebuild Syria instead, so that Syrians will want to move back. Putin's been pretty good for Russia, but he can't be expected, nor has he been elected to, solve all the world's problems.

A couple of weeks ago I lunched at a new restaurant in the Sacramento suburbs. It was laid out with a four sided bar in the center, booths around the outside walls and tables in the area between. Each booth had a TV screen on the wall at about eye level. Another row of larger screens was on the wall above the booths, which could be viewed by the people sitting at the tables facing the wall. The bar likewise had two rows of TV screens: one row slightly above eye level for people sitting at the bar and another row of larger screens for the people sitting at the tables facing the bar. I didn't count the total number of screens, but it must have been at least 40. All were tuned to sports channels. Ironically the decorative scheme was outdoorsy, like some place you might stop at on the way to bag a moose in the north woods. Weird. <br><br>I have recently read _Deer Hunting With Jesus_ and reread _The Redneck Manifesto_ as well as the more recent _Listen Liberals_. I am saddened and maddened by the complete scorn for Trump supporters shown by so many liberals. Dehumanizing opponents by labeling them as dumb, not just in a metaphoric sense but literally of low IQ is no way to win an election. I pointed out on my Facebook to one poster that no one ever changed their vote in response to "Hey dumba**, how can you vote that way?"<br><br>Friday I recommended _Twilight's Last Gleaming_ to the leader of my Renaissance Society seminar on America's Top Ten Issues. We had just watched a documentary about the power of the military industrial complex, so it seemed appropriate.<br><br><a href=#c4359380202314114718 title="comment permalink">11/5/16, 12:40 PM</a><br><br>

The subreddit /r/collapse does quite a decent job of covering the ground; Naked Capitalism is another good aggregator site; Rice Farmer has quite a bit of good material; for analysis, though they don't get the resource and pollution issues, the National Interest is first-rate. I add and subtract other sites on a regular basis depending on moment-by-moment interests, but those are the current core, along with a couple of non-US general news sites. (US news media is a pointless embarrassment to the electrons that are forced to carry it.) <br><br>Bruno, hmm. That'll need some consideration. <br><br>Guilherme, it's an interesting detail of modern life that people either idealize the Middle Ages or they demonize them. My take tends to be more nuanced. It's worth keeping in mind, though, that in the US and many other countries as well, the lot of the people on the bottom of the heap has been getting steadily worse for many years; at a certain point -- which we haven't reached yet, but it's not completely out of sight -- a medieval existence starts looking pretty good to people who are dealing with the cascading dysfunctions of a failed civilization like ours; it may be rough but at least you aren't at the mercy of the random decisions of bureaucrats in the imperial capital a thousand miles away. <br><br>Justin, thanks for the info. Hmm. <br><br>Jeff, you're being very selective about your memories, I see. After the 2000 and 2004 elections, Democrats were loudly accusing the GOP of election fraud, and the GOP was insisting on its innocence. In 2008 and 2012, the shoe was on the other foot. As a rule, the losing party talks about election fraud -- and this basically amounts to the pot calling the kettle black. Have you read, by the way, Seymour Hersh's very thoughtful <i>The Dark Side of Camelot</i>, which talks at some length about how JFK's daddy bought him the 1960 election? If not, it's well worth a glance. <br><br>Steve, nah, if you'd been uncivil, I wouldn't have put your comment through! <br><br>David, I know a fair number who are already very quietly talking about that. In a few days, we'll see. <br><br>Bob, thanks for the link. I didn't see the movie, though, so it may not mean much to me. <br><br>Onething, I don't know about a landslide, but to my mind a Trump victory at this point is about as likely as a Clinton victory. It might be better to say that both candidates have a roughly equal chance of losing. <br><br>Sandy, can you give me a source on the claim that EROEI on petroleum is now below 10? That differs from what I've seen. <br><br>Donald, interesting that you said why you're going to vote against this and that and the other candidate, and never mentioned why Mr. Soltysik deserves your vote. That's very common these days, of course!<br><br><a href=#c5309518045975247983 title="comment permalink">11/5/16, 5:22 PM</a><br><br>

Clinton's character. Similar observations have been made by many highly placed persons who know her personally. For example:<br><br>http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=767&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=16919<br><br>I admit to having an agenda in this election. I want to see the American Empire peacefully dismantled before it is forcibly dismantled by a world which no longer chooses to tolerate outrages like the attack on Libya and the coup in Ukraine. Yes, that does imply certain consequences vis a vis foreign nations and their citizens. Tariffs. Restrictions on foreign ownership of American real property. No more easy immigration with a look the other way approach to charming eccentricities like using stolen ID. If you want to call that "alt right", go ahead. I am not sure I know what the phrase 'alt right' means, but I do know I am fed up with being threatened with rampaging "brown-shirts" if I don't fall in line behind Mme. C. Turns out that the "violence" at Trump rallies was instigated by provocateurs who had been recruited and paid by the Clinton campaign. My personal situation is that I have far more to fear from Clinton's salarycrat apparatchiks than I do from gun-toting Trumpists, however rude and crude they might be.<br><br>In any case, I doubt that Mme. C,'s dream of open borders will happen. If she thinks she can force that on us after stealing an election...if an impeachment bill can get out of the House, she is toast. Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative Catholic ideologue, loathes her and everything he thinks she stands for; he may not be much of a legal scholar, but he knows how to get the verdict he wants out of a jury. <br><br>My guess is that the days of easy immigration, diversity and multiculturalism are over with, with the unaccompanied minors being the last straw for many Americans. If any of us tried a stunt like that, sending kids hundreds of miles across an international border, we would be up in front of Family Court, being declared unfit parents and having our kids sent to foster care.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c6364676933214079297 title="comment permalink">11/5/16, 5:34 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, it's a huge shift, and it's going to lead to further (and potentially very troubling) shifts in the years ahead -- but this election is the hinge point in a process that's been gathering momentum for a very long time. <br><br>David, yep. While the US flounders and bellows, our replacements are very calmly getting the institutions of the next global hegemony in place. <br><br>N=ro, yes, I saw that! As I've noted before, Musk is a very smart man; he knows that it's not really possible to make a profit these days producing an honest good or service, and so he's gone into business to cash in on government largesse and the cravings of the American people for a future they aren't going to get. As for Resilience, as I noted to Armata earlier, yep -- I asked their parent organization to stop sending me emails begging for money, and their response was a bit petulant. No loss; they cater to the <i>Yes! Magazine</i> crowd these days, and I've noted before that if I ran a magazine about the future, it would probably be called <i>Probably Not!</i><br><br>Mister R., among others. Some surprising places may be in play, in either direction. <br><br>Pygmycory, thanks for the data point! <br><br>Rita, that's just stunning.

Good sources (as he's listed) are necessary but not sufficient. A regular practice of what he labels as "meditation", but then defines as "focused, purposeful thinking". How many of us have a regular schedule which includes daily, dedicated time for undistracted <b>thinking</b>? <br><br>From time to time, quite by accident, I have found myself turning away from the stew of stimulation here on the web, and simply sat down to think about upcoming activities. "What actions are expected of me in the next week?" is a good topic to start with. In only a few minutes (5-10), I realize ways to be more efficient and effective.<br><br>Another useful question "why is it so, and not otherwise?", for some "it" condition of my environment. This has led to a hypothesis that the local decline of bees may be a consequence of high populations of white-tail deer eating everything that blooms, not just in our home gardens, but throughout the land. (Of course, there are other well-known factors: habitat, pesticides, mites, and disease.)<br><br>When all else fails, try THINKING!

(How does that old quip go "If God had wanted us to vote, he would have given us candidates"). And as much as some people have a real grievance with the status quo (as JMG has pointed out and the rise of Trump and Saunders has confirmed) it is important to keep in mind that neither of these candidates are really talking about the things which will matter. If by voting you mean only to give the finger to the establishment, go for it. But if you thought you were going to get someone in charge that can see the real issues and will work on them, well no such luck.<br><br>You remember those real issues, energy depletion, climate disruption, the disintegration of empire, unsustainable systems creaking to a halt, and all the things we used to speak about here before the elections took center stage. They still are at the root of our problems, and neither of the major candidates will do anything to make them better, at least based upon their past history, who they owe allegiance to, and their campaign talk. <br><br>No matter who gets elected, all this election will do is allow for a period of venting. And to a greater extent increase the divisions in our society. You might argue these are good things, but when no substantial changes are delivered, it could easily bring us closer to the boiling over point.<br><br>Actually the FBI's latest move is probably the scariest thing to come out of this whole show IMO. Not because the FBI took sides for one candidate or the other, that really doesn't matter (even if it was pro your candidate or against). What does matter is they broke the illusion of neutrality that these institutions are supposed to have. That means that the rules that these institutions play by are being torn up before our eyes. To me it signals we are much closer to a breaking point than I had ever believed.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c8865168693424894241 title="comment permalink">11/5/16, 7:46 PM</a><br><br>

This is almost disqualifying, IMO, and I'm surprised you didn't write about this issue at all in this week's post.<br><br>However, I noticed something interesting - in his rallies (like the Warren, Mich. one recently), he boasts that he'll cut billions from UN climate change programs, then in the next breath says that he'll instead use that money to get clean water and air locally in the US.

Not the insurance, the treatments. Insurance works by spreading "risk" (extremely high costs for a few people) over a lot of people afraid they MIGHT incur extremely high costs. So it only works when the average of all the costs is cheap enough for everyone to pay it. Now the treatments (doctor bills, hospital bills) cost so much that the insurance companies have to raise rates to be able to break even, but they raise rates so high that they lose customers. There is a magic number somewhere beyond which a group of people are "uninsurable" which means they just can't charge enough to cover the costs. Remember when Obama passed ACA by making insurance mandatory but without bringing down the cost of treatments? This is the logical conclusion of that. My grandma's cancer treatment cost a million dollars. If 40% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetimes, it doesn't take a calculator to see this isn't going to work.<br><br><a href=#c2962001859404036847 title="comment permalink">11/6/16, 12:47 AM</a><br><br>

So it props up the system by simply making the middle class pay hugely for everyone's care.<br> The problem was not insurance, but costs increasing much faster than cost of living."<br><br>You hit the nail on the head. Here in Canada, we have the same problem with out-of-control healthcare costs (though not as bad as in the US). For that matter, the same problem exists in many spheres of modern life - perhaps because we measure wealth by GDP per capita. If I get paid more but have to buy things that I used to get for free, the GDP per capita rises, but I'm no better off than I was before. There's just more inefficiency.<br><br>In the Greater Toronto Area, there is in effect a government subsidy for suburban sprawl. Developers are allowed build sprawling suburbs, and then everybody else's taxes rise to pay for the new roads and transit that now have to be built and maintained. Also, the traffic congestion gets worse and worse every year. The developers get massive profits, while all the costs are passed on to society.<br><br>If developers were forced to pay for that, maybe they would plan more efficient cities and the problem would take care of itself. <br><br>This is actually one of the things that Dmitry Orlov mentions - collapse, if it happens, will hit American/Canadian suburban neighbourhoods especially hard. When I visited Russia last year, the thing that pleasantly surprised me the most is how compact communities are and that there are good grocery stores everywhere within easy walking distance (under 5 minutes). Russia's GDP per capita is much lower than Canada's - but the expenses that people have are also much lower, with the result that from my perspective, quality of life for average folk in both places is pretty similar right now (which certainly wasn't the case when I visited 10 years ago).<br><br><a href=#c1427110618993894710 title="comment permalink">11/6/16, 1:22 AM</a><br><br>

The Ant men of the future, who believe in force, consider that you can determine whether twice two is four by knocking people down who disagree with you. The democrats,who are to believe in argument, consider all men are entitled to an opinion, because all are born equal-"I am as good a man as you are,' the first instinctive ejaculation of the man who is not."<br>"If neither force nor argument can be relied on," said the King," I do not see what can be done."<br>"neither force, nor argument, nor opinion," said Merlin with the deepest sincerity," are thinking. Argument is only a display of mental force, a sort of fencing with points in order to gain a victory, not for truth. Opinions are the blind alleys of lazy or stupid men, who are unable to think. if ever a true politician really thinks out a subject dispassionately, even Homo Stultus will be compelled to accept his findings in the end. Opinion can never stand beside truth. At present, however, Homo Impoliticus is content either to argue with opinions or to fight with his fists, instead of waiting for the truth in his head.

That is, by an optimistic observer. The nine knaves assemble themselves under the banner of the most knavish among them and become 'politicians': the wise man stands out, because he know himself to be hopelessly outnumbered and devotes himself to poetry, mathematics or philosophy; while the ninety fools plod off behind the banners of the nine villains, according to fancy, into the labyrinths of chicanery, malice and warfare. It is pleasant to have command, observes Sancho Panza, even over a flock of sheep, and that is why politicians raise their banners. it is moreover the same thing for the sheep whatever the banner. If it is democracy, then the nine knaves will become members of parliament; if fascism, they will become party leaders; if communism, commissars. Nothing will be different except the names. The fools will still be fools, the knaves still leaders, the results still exploitation. As for the wise man, his lot will be the same under any ideology. Under democracy he will be encouraged to starve to death in a garret, under fascism he will be put in a concentration camp, under communism he will be liquidated.

As I've already noted, there've been issued of sign theft in my area, so yard signs may not be a good indicator of support here, but amongst my wage class coworkers, you've got the thumb on their pulse. They freely admit Trump's flaws and shortcomings, and are not at all certain that he will follow through, but he does give them a bit of hope, as opposed to the certain jump off the cliff they see w/Hillary. And there is way more enthusiasm about voting this year among the rural wage class. The stereotype of red America's rabid talk radio listening, right-wing partisan only captures a small fraction of the actual rural wage class. Like most Americans, the rural wage class has been overwhelmingly politically apathetic and far and away, non-voters. This year, I've seen way more interest in voting (registering, etc) among the wage class than in years past.<br>I'm curious to note on here the nihilism or cynicism, if you will, amongst certain salary class individuals who have been deeply involved in various left-wing/liberal causes over the past 30-40 years. I'm thinking that it's all very much an inability to accept the implosion of progressive values-based politics in favor of interests. I'm interested in your take, JMG, on the loud proclamations of nihilism or cynicism regarding a potential Trump presidency on here. What do you make of it? As you've already mentioned, most of his supporters already grant that he may not follow through on his promises, but the movement has become bigger than the man himself. The wage class can always fall back on insurgency and civil war if this Trump thing doesn't work out.<br>I'm thinking back to your comment, JMG, that certain people have simply stopped talking to you when you express that you don't support Hillary. For me, this past year has been the year of "losing" people, as a former "progressive" who has totally given up on any kind of "progressive" politics. It's a strange feeling of "losing" people, of realizing that these people inhabit totally different worlds and see things totally differently, and being unable to communicate with them at all. Very surreal. Here I'm thinking of a recent exchange I had with someone spouting the "Trump's supporters are motivated by bigotry" meme. This person was projecting the shadow onto the white wage class, and was totally unaware of the hatred oozing out of them, and the fact that she totally embodies what she is projecting onto the white wage class. To me, it's so strange to see people go batshale crazy over Trump. Third world countries like the US routinely elect people like Trump (Chavez, Morales, Duterte, etc.), but most times I've brought this up to provide perspective to people, it's usually provoked an "American exceptionalism"/nuclear arms spiel (Pakistan is a nuclear armed country less stable than a Trump America). What's so odd is to see people who have focused all the preparatory efforts on the practical/Green Wizard stuff while totally neglecting the non-rational, esoteric, spiritual, magical aspects then totally lose it over something as minor as Trump.<br><br><a href=#c6439125400778462599 title="comment permalink">11/6/16, 6:06 AM</a><br><br>

He DID get support from the rural wage class. Here in KY, his largest margins of victory in the primary were in Eastern, Appalachian counties. WV, which is like Eastern KY, was the same. Not sure about the Appalachian counties of other states (VA, MD, NC, TN). Clinton carried Jefferson (Louisville) and Fayette (Lexington) counties by comfortable margins, which mystified the "progressive" Sanders supporters on the salary class organic farm I was on at the time.<br>I wanted to let you all in on a little local aspect of the class divide that you might not be aware of. I live in the wealthiest county in KY, which simply means that the class divide is that much starker than in a more "universally" poor county. I can assure you my hometown is a much poorer place than when i was growing up, and has not been spared the heroin epidemic. We're electing our local city council this election, and economic growth and development. A perennial issue here is land use and "preservation". Yes, we're talking about the world-famous thoroughbred horse farms and the wealthy elite that own and run them. American Pharoah is at stud in my home county. "Preservation" is elite code for "horse farm interests" which do not benefit the local wage class at all. Now, like most of the Eastern US, our natural ecosystem is "mixed hardwood forests", which horse farms decidedly are not. They're a bluegrass monoculture that requires tons of fossil fuels (mowing and trimming) and pesticides (including lots of Roundup) to maintain. They produce a luxury good (thoroughbred horses) which have no practical benefit. At least our other traditional products, Bourbon and tobacco, have tangible uses and benefits. The presence of so much wealthy land in the hands of a small elite runs up real estate prices, which makes our county one of the least affordable to buy land/real estate. The horse farms are notorious for paying the lowest wages in the area, and are one of the largest employers of undocumented workers. Indeed, my dad said that the horse farms were unified in their opposition to our first factory, Texas Instruments, because of the upward pressure factories would create on wages. So, needless to say, the wage class here is decidedly anti-preservation and pro-development because their interests are not at all represented by the "preservationists". If you see in the next 5-10 years horse farm elite dangling from lampposts or meeting the business end of a pitchfork, and some populist KY politician calling for land reform/redistribution for more practical purposes than thoroughbred horse farms, you'll have heard it here first.<br><br><a href=#c7499757575300192649 title="comment permalink">11/6/16, 6:52 AM</a><br><br>

Increased tensions, a reversion to some of the worst years of the Cold War. I do think this is not going to result in global thermonuclear war, though, or even a serious conventional shooting war between Russia and the US/NATO. It's my opininon and you're entitled to a different one, of course, but I find the assertion that electing HC carries a major risk of serious war with Russia a partisan position against her, by people who dislike her either on a non-thinking emotional way or have another agenda in place. <br><br>As for easily considering another war, let me remind you I barely qualify as "westerner" in the sense you're using the word (Brazil being a largely neutral contry, not a member of NATO, etc), I'm also NOT saying that more war in the Middle East won't be a tragedy. Or course it will, mainly for the people living there. These stupid interventions there are creating failed states that will be prime breeding ground for the formation of warband culture and bite all of our asses (pardon my french) in the end! Vladimir Putin seems to be the only rational world leader at this point, with the position that maintaining state institutions in the region is in the best interests of everyone, while the "West" and some of their allies (Saudi Arabia, in particular) has been cluelessly trying to play a game of real-politik against Iran/Russia and risking the complete collapse of public order across vast swathes of the region. <br><br>I find THAT a credible mark against HC.

I've read some actual academic work on the period, too, including some of the most respected historians on the issue (Braudel, Duby, etc). So, yes, I agree with you that the Middle Ages tends to be seen in a very black and white manner. Which was the point of my comment. I have no doubt that you are cognisant of the facts of life in the period, as far as we can know them, since you're one of the most well-read people I know of. What I was nitpicking is that your comment could be interpreted as paiting "too-rose-a-picture" of the period, like I said in my original comment. We also didn't discuss the fac that the quality of life in the Middle Age varied wildly between time periods and regions. I don't doubt that a prosperous small farmer in north-central Italy in the XIV century lived a pretty good life, all things considered. Or a swiss free peasant. But a serf in the bad parts of Xth century France? I would prefer to live as almost anyone else in any period of history then that, the only few exception being a chattel slave or perhaps a really poor person in the early Industrial Revolution in Britain. <br><br>Also, I live in a typical large third world city, one with a pretty bad wealth inequality index to boot. While my family is in the bottom rung of the salaried class (with some relatives being better off), I live pretty close to honest-to-god "favelas" and the social situation here is such that I do have contact with people who live pretty marginal lives in such places. I think I can safely say that counts as being as bad as, or even worse, then whatever you can find in the US in terms of desperate poverty. Moreover, a mere two or three generations ago, these people's grandparents and great-grandparents were largely living as rural sharecroppers, which is pretty close to being serfs. Despite the miseries and the often crushing poverty if everyday life, I don't see them wanting to go back there, to be frank. Your experience may be different up there in rural america, but I would be curious to see if the majority of urban black people have any desire to move back South and become sharecroppers for a largely racist white landowner class again....<br><br>If you're talking about returning to the land, that's completly different. I'm 100% behind you that I think some decentralization, a more vibrant rural and small-town economy is much preferable then what we have now. But we have to also recognize that there was a LOT of bad when it comes to traditional rural societies. Specially for the people who were at the bottom of it. The ideal, in my mind, would be to move towards something that's not the past, but it's not the disfunctional system we have now. I think you tried to do that with the Retrotopia series, and I really like that, despite having a few reservations about something s that you implied there and that I thought were unrealistic, but then again, you said it yourself that it was written in the utopian tradition, and I can respect that.<br><br><a href=#c5541262190141639391 title="comment permalink">11/6/16, 11:52 AM</a><br><br>

I get the sense that we come from fundamentally different positions. I'm socially very liberal in outlook, even though I'm extremely irritated with the hijack of the left, worldwide, by "identity politics" spoused by rich urban liberals worldwide. I share some traditional burkean conversative positions with JMG in a few issues, and being here in this blog obviously means that I'm more worried about environmental causes then most people. But I'm a leftist/progressive at heart, I think. I think you're far more socially conservative then I am and even if we could probably agree in a range of other issues over a beer, I think in this point we probably can't. <br><br>I agree that's whe more hakwish in foreign policy, and you're totally entitled to hold the position that this issue is of fundamental importance for you. I can respect that.<br><br>But I'm far less sympathetic to the illegal immigration issue. I agree with JMG that tacit illegal immigration has, indeed, be used by the american upper class to drive wages down, but it's also true that americans consume a quarter of the world's resources while having approximately 5% of the world population. Given the fact that you're neighbours with vastly less wealthy countries (and ones that the US had a hand, historically, in exploiting or outright stealing land in case of Mexico), it strikes me a bit as defense of privilege when wage earners in the US make these comments. <br>You seem to be willing to roll back the institutions of the american empire that created this imperial wealth pump, to which I applaud you. But looking from the outside, a lot of the Trump supporters want to go back to a time when american factory workers and wage-earners in general could afford a lifestyle propped by the fact that the US represented 40-50% of the world economy. This is simply not possible anymore and I'm afraid that a good proportion of them are going to dump their anger on the illegal immigrant themselves, not the upper-class which mainly beneffited from it. <br><br>Even you were more pissed off, it seems, at people sending their kids to cross the border, then at the people who hire illegal immigrants in the first place, for exemple. To some extent, this is a supply and demand issue. As long as there are people in the US hiring illegal immigrants, they will come, walls or no walls. It seems that the first step in adressing this issue would be to penalize people that hire the illegals, like the commenter before that suggested that people who are angry with that gas pipeline should perhaps start by shutting down their own spigots at the end. But the rethoric falls disproportionatelly upon the immigrants themselves, it seems.<br><br><a href=#c460177092852563682 title="comment permalink">11/6/16, 12:27 PM</a><br><br>

They believe the free market will reward ethical business and punish those that lie or produce dangerous goods. In contrast, the left believes that corporations will do anything to destroy us all and the only thing we have to protect us is government regulation. Who's right? It's simple. There is no free market, it's all government regulated to support the rich. The government and the corporations are all run by the exact same people and we are all fracked.

There's just too few people left in the narrowing circle of the elite in this country, and too many people of different races, genders, and sexual orientations left out of the "system/establishment" for race, gender, or sexual orientation to matter. Those categories are simply how the establishment keeps the underclass divided, and people are wizening up to that. Even if we will have insurgency groups that are divided based on race or language, they're going to coordinate with each other to bring down the system. The old Arab saying, "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" is apropos here. The insurgency/civil war is going to unify people in ways no civil rights movement ever could. I simply must agree with JMG about racial trends in this country--children trick-or-treating this year in my neighborhood were the most diverse and the most mixed I can ever recall.<br>Regarding the Article V convention, I am on the list for the Con Con movement for a Balanced Budget, not so much because I support a Balanced Budget Amendment, but because it is the most successful vehicle for calling an Article V Con Con. My interest in an Article V Con Con is not so much in proposing actual amendments to the Constitution, because I think the country is way too divided politically and regionally to ever reach the 2/3, 3/4 requirements required to ever propose or pass amendments, but a bogged down Con Con that goes on for months on end w/out ever accomplishing anything a la Twilight's Last Gleaming is the only way to put in stark relief to most Americans that we are no longer a United States, a unified country, and brings us that much closer to Twilight's dissolution amendment (USexit) being proposed and passed.<br>Regarding dissolution, I'm noticing amongst the wage class that their faith in Americanism (i.e. a representative Constitutional democratically elected Republic on the American model) has not wavered in the least, but that their belief that the government in DC actually embodies those ideals has collapsed. This is a very good sign as the insurgency goes forward, because it demonstrates that this revolution has the potential to be as small-c, Burkean conservative as the initial American revolution and the Confederacy in the last Civil War. People still very much believe in the American democratic Republic, they just don't have any faith that DC embodies those ideals. This bodes very well going forward.<br><br><a href=#c2614625477593079417 title="comment permalink">11/6/16, 1:58 PM</a><br><br>

If petroleum as a whole has dropped below 10:1, we're neck deep in kim chee and sinking fast. <br><br>Justin, I don't read the comments on /r/collapse, just the news stories. Generally speaking, I don't bother with comments on sites that don't have a courtesy code in place and enforced by moderators -- the signal-to-noise ratio is just too low, and I get plenty of trolling right here. <br><br>LatheChuck, exactly. I've noticed that with 24/7 media saturation and the rest of it, most people these days don't seem to have any kind of inner life that's separate from the yelling of the collective consciousness. Making a space for one's own thoughts, one's own reflections, one's own inner life -- that's utterly essential these days, though it's also very, very strongly discouraged by popular culture and peer pressure. One of these weeks, when I want to field even more saliva-spattered diatribes than I get when I mention that humanity isn't going to the stars, I'll probably do a post on that. <br><br>Steve, I ain't arguing. As I hope to show in upcoming posts, the descent of politics into its current incoherence is one of the main factors that's keeping the US from addressing any of its deeper problems; it's also the case, I'd argue, that some of the other issues I've raised recently, such as the impact of the bipartisan consensus of the last few decades on working Americans, are worth some attention in their own right. That said, as I've noted before, there is no bright future ahead; if we're smart, lucky, and get a move on, we may be able to get through the next round of crises in less than totally devastated condition, and make the most of the period of stabilization and partial recovery that will follow -- but industrial civilization is going down, and nothing you or I, or Trump or Clinton, or anyone else can do will change that. <br><br>Bruce, notice the way you're trying to drag the conversation back to the racial and sexual stereotypes that dominate the officially approved discourse on politics. It's not about "white males." It's about class issues -- but those are taboo now, and so it's not surprising you and so many others refuse to talk about them. <br><br>Cherokee, glad to hear that spring has arrived! Here we're in the middle of a crisp and gorgeous autumn, with the first frost on its way. <br><br>Unknown Aussie, that's a very pungent metaphor! I'm not a great fan of Strauss and Howe, but that's mostly because their system seems rather too rigid to me, and has to be defended with a certain amount of cherrypicking. The broad cycle they trace isn't unique to them, and it does seem to be there in the data. <br><br>Esn, Blogger apparently ate it -- I saw it and approved it, but I don't see it in the comments field now. That's a fascinating point about Trump's rhetoric, and it feeds into something I'll be discussing in an upcoming post. <br><br>Hubertus, "Lügenpresse" is my new word for the day -- typical Deutsche precision. Thank you. <br><br>Chevalier, excellent. You and LatheChuck are both onto one of the keys to America's terminal political dysfunction: the replacement of thought with argument. More on this in that troll-attractant post I mentioned above. <br><br>Shane, this happens whenever I talk about the election!

I'll have some comments shortly on one element of the pervasive paralogic that fills the void where functioning politics used to be. If people in the wage class still have faith in the basic presuppositions of democracy, it may just be possible to salvage the core institutions of our system of government.<br><br>Nastarana, I'm by no means sure it's fair to credit that one to Clinton's side of the line alone. Punitive austerity for the poor has bipartisan support these days. <br><br>Pygmycory, I got a lot of readers by way of Energy Bulletin, and a fair number back before Resilience really started pandering to the privileged. Since then its share of my trackbacks declined steadily -- so I think you're quite correct. <br><br>Bruno, thank you! I think it's time we start considering Cracked.com a news medium and the New York Times a really campy humor magazine...<br><br>Glenn, excellent! The more often that gets said, the harder it'll be for the defenders of privilege to insist that all those who disagree with them are just nasty people, blah blah blah. <br><br>.Mallow, changes in the laws to shield the media from harassment lawsuits would be a good start. It would be tolerably easy to lobby for those, and a lot of wealthy and influential interests could get behind that. <br><br>Guilherme, oh, I get that. I simply like using the statistic about work hours and days off to rattle true believers in progress who like to think that every single statistic must have gotten better since the Middle Ages. As for our current situation here in the US, did you know that a significant number of African-Americans are in fact leaving northern cities and moving back to the rural South? They may not be taking on jobs as sharecroppers, but conditions in the big cities are ghastly by US standards -- not yet to favela conditions, but headed that way pretty obviously -- and as the US unravels further, I expect conditions here to get rather worse than they are in your country. <br><br>Lordberia3, if there turns out to be serious evidence of massive vote fraud, I could see that. The logical fig leaf would be to have the election thrown into the House, as happened in 1876, and then have the House elect Trump. That way a facade of constitutional government would be maintained -- and I suspect that maintaining that facade will be on a lot of minds, if things go pear-shaped. <br><br>Shane, I hope to the gods we can avoid another civil war. Dissolution via constitutional convention would be far less traumatic, and there's also the possibility of returning the US to what it was originally -- a federal republic in which social issues in particular are decided by each state individually. That's the possibility I'll be exploring in upcoming posts, via the Bill of Redress. <br><br>David, given some serious statesmanship on both sides, it might work. <br><br>Shane, oh, they know that if Trump gets in a lot of the deals that keep the puppet governments of our near abroad propped up are going to come unraveled in a hurry.

A classic publicity hound, sheister businessman, whose life is an ongoing assault on at least 4 of the 7 deadly sins. Neoliberal or neoconservative central casting could not possibly have come up with a better candidate to oppose them. <br><br>Of course in a way the neo central castings did come up with Trump because any and every 'reasonable' opponent of the status quo is by definition a nobody with zero chance of nomination for president much less town counsel person in Peoria. One is either a linkedin member of the institutional world be it corporate, government, or NGO or your an outsider. <br><br>It would be all well and good if Trumps ill defined and unexamined opposition to the status quo came to power if just to blow things up except that he is deeply authoritarian as are a large portion of the insiders coalescing around him. When the devolution of the financial economy takes place with the real people economy to soon follow authoritarians will certainly come to the fore but to invite them in now is a mistake. So say I.<br><br>Besides if you think a Trump administration would not be all in for QE infinity the next time stocks correct 20% your wrong. Or think he won't bomb somebody soon after election like all presidents do just to show they are 'tough' your wrong too. Any hint that America is weak or being make a fool of by anyone is going to see the wrath of Trump as his entire life revolves around domination and humiliation. The slightest slight aimed at him is answered by nuclear grade payback. <br><br>Many W voters thought W a fool but figured he had "good advisers". Trump has a few not total wack job advisers but the majority are just that.<br><br>It disturbs me that most alt economic thinkers have entered this game in favor of Trump. JMG knows and most others do as well as anyone that the system is not going to reform and make things happily ever after. Trump isn't about reform. Among other things he is about bringing new levels of authoritarian police power to new heights in America. That may[ likely come in many places but to invite that in is madness.<br><br><br><a href=#c7297009034597867225 title="comment permalink">11/6/16, 4:49 PM</a><br><br>

What I was saying is that being an empire does not contradicts my definition of imperial phase, or make it absurd. I asserted that the Roman state first expanded its polity, and only later switched to expand its borders and become an empire. Thus, when the Romans were marching on Italy, integrating sabines and latins into its polity, they weren't yet an empire, but an expanding polity, just like the US marching West and occupying largely unpopulated territory with citizens. During the Imperial phase, however, Romans began to subject whole peoples to its will, without ever granting them the right to have a say in the political decisions of the empire. Thus, most people living as subjects of the Roman Empire until Caracalla made his famous edict weren't citizens. Most territories subjected to Roman power weren't fully integrated into its political life, ever.

Nice to read of someone else on here that has lived in Swansea! Are you still in Wales? Yes you may be right actually re. charity shops - I was a bit unduly harsh on them. We actually got our sofa from the BHF shop and there was lots of excellent furniture in there, as too the YMCA shop. The city centre really has become dire though hasn't it. All of my family members a bit older than me (I'm in late 20s) tell me of how vibrant it was. Yes how the market is surviving I don't know, but it's great still - Tesco's and the lack of car parking must've taken a toll on it, but it's still going well. And the cost of buses in Swansea... £4 plus now for a day return! Yes St.Helen's road is actually very vibrant, and I love the diversity of food around there, but yes very telling of the shift. I was confused that we were named a city of sanctuary - has it really led to anything though? Seems a bit bogus to me, but the I don't know much about it. But I don't foresee a great future for Swansea - classic post-industrial wasteland I'd imagine. It's amazing to read how it used be a real place of money during the early 1900s when industry was booming. But it's had several decades of neglect.

In fact, until the Italian War in the closing years of the Roman republic, not even Italians outside Latium were Roman citizens. Which is to say, the Romans did act like a true Imperial expansionist power, controlling far-off countries without incorporating (most of) their inhabitants into the Roman civitas (citizenry). I therefore tend to think American imperialism should be dated from 1898. There might be counter-examples from other empires, though, e.g. China under Qing, Han and Tang.<br><br><a href=#c5841450569331882875 title="comment permalink">11/7/16, 7:22 AM</a><br><br>

I will concur that there are differing kinds of imperialism (e.g. recent US methods versus historical British methods) and that the same polity might go through a number of phases of imperial expansion with differing characteristics. I'd agree that such is the case of the US. But at the end of the day, we took lands from native peoples at the point of a gun; we took lands from Mexico in a similar manner. We pursued policies which encouraged migration and encroachment onto those lands by settlers so that these could be "saved" later. The US had no claim to its current borders other than the one in our minds. We ourselves were a fragment broken off from British imperialism that decided to become an empire itself. <br><br>Perhaps we are splitting hairs. The point, which I think we all agree on, is that we've been an empire for a long time, much longer than people realize.<br><br><a href=#c7621133628873073192 title="comment permalink">11/7/16, 10:34 AM</a><br><br>

First off, the continent was not empty when the USA was expanding at the expense of various first nations. When their territory was stolen/conquored, the first nations peoples were not integrated with the rest of the US citizenry. They got pushed onto reservations, and still aren't treated equally today. The US has been an imperial power all along. <br><br>Interestingly, by that argument, so was Canada.<br><br>As for the Roman Empire, significant numbers of people were becoming roman citizens well before Caracalla's edict, which in any case occurs well before the fall of the roman empire. For examples of earlier roman citizens who weren't from near Rome, take St. Paul's conversation with the roman centurion, where Paul tells him he's a roman citizan, and the centurion says he (the centurion) became one by paying a large sum of money. Paul is one by birth, and he was born in Tarsus in Cilicia to a jewish family somewhere in the vicinity of 10BC-10AD. Cilicia was conquored by Pompey in the 60s BC, and is in Asia minor. Paul's conversation with the centurion was in the middle(ish) the first century AD.<br><br><a href=#c6902656696525462137 title="comment permalink">11/7/16, 10:50 AM</a><br><br>

The earlier layers are almost so far back that they are not seen as imperial expansion at all (kind of how the Italian peninsula is seen as "naturally" Roman, even though the city-state of Rome had to conquer and absorb those peoples and lands in the early phases). The reason I think that this is important to recognize is that I am inclined to believe that our current structure in not tenable in the absence of our empire and that we will, quite naturally, break into the 7 or so cultural entities which comprise the present-day US. <br><br>In other words, it is the present order, and not the future fragmentation, which is the artificial construct.

It's pretty huge. English media has not reported about it as much as event of this magnitude deserves. In the nutshell: there was fake phone call to emergency center from one of Mohammedan ghettos surrounding Paris like ring of rot. When two police cars came to site of emergency, "local youths" prevented police officers coming out from their cars, then burning trapped officers with gasoline bombs. If I recall it right (my French language skill is pretty limited), one officer died and three others sustained severe injuries.<br><br>After the incident officers of law held huge, unauthorized protests at least five night in the row at the center of Paris, using police cars with flashing lights in their demonstration. Top brass police chief denounced demonstrating officers, to no avail. Officers in the field didn't care about orders of top brass to disband protests. They say that situation in immigrant ghettos has spiraled totally out of control, and that they cannot maintain order with weaponry and manpower they have now. They are demanding heavier weapons and much, much more manpower, and larger policing rights. There is also some amount of "Ferguson effect" going on, as officers are apparently very reluctant to respond for calls from Moslem ghettos, or to patrol there. Police strikes and menonstrations have also spread to other big cities from Paris. Feudal fiefdoms of Mohammedan crime warlords are being carved out from the flesh of French republic right now. Native French seems to be, in growing numbers, quite tired of being "openminded" towards "vibrant diversity".<br><br>War is coming.<br><br><br><a href=#c3301879949141240248 title="comment permalink">11/7/16, 12:34 PM</a><br><br>

I don't think that size is the problem, though: Brazil has been just as big as the US for a longer time, and that was before railroads even existed and news from the Crown would take six months to arrive in some places. Being big is not an issue, not even taking into account the end of the industrial era. The problem I see with the US is the fact that you won't have an universally recognized source of authority for long: in Brazil, that is the still lingering sentiment of obedience to the former Crown, now converted into worshipping of the Presidency and Federal government, and that's going to stay as it is for the foreseeable future at least. In the US, however, what holds the country together is the faith or trust in its institutions, the first of which is the Constitution, and that faith is draining fast, and will be gone rather sooner than later. Without anything holding it together, the US will fragment.<br><br><a href=#c3694784248411974829 title="comment permalink">11/8/16, 1:03 AM</a><br><br>

Many of the Native cuktures and civilizations on the East Coast were indeed severely impacted by old-world diseases, as you state, but far from all of them. But in the Midwest and on the West Coast your claim is definitely false, and nowhere is it more dramatically false than in the arid Southwest and in the wet Pacific Northwest. Here you have had strong populous and stable cultures that were deliberately repressed and robbed by advancing waves of Anglophone settlers, with the support of the US Army and the malevolent policies of the Federal Government. The remnants of those Native civilizations, even today, endure, and may even recover some of their former political independence and power down the road. Go there and meet the people of those cultures. Read the collections of texts made by anthropologists in the 20th century. Study the history of officially supported exploitation and aggression in the documents left by the Anglophone settlers of the 19th and 20th centuries, And so forth. It was deliberate, culturally and legally sanctioned genocide on a continental scale, pure and simple. Like all other empires, the United States has had its hands and feet reddened and dripping with human blood.

(LDS is not evangelical and vice versa. When my evangelical friends held their nose and voted for Romney I was shocked. You see the LDS assertion that Joseph Smith was a prophet and his teaching must be taught, runs counter to the evangelical stand that Jesus is the Way. Evangelicals see Mormons, Seventh Day Adventists, and Jehovah's Witnesses all as fringe cults to be destroyed.)<br><br>So an LDS family raises their children that they are "saved" and others not in LDS are condemned as must be converted to LDS. (Substitute any of the above faiths in this argument.) But the elite of this country are not like that. They are not looking to make more people elite. They see there is a distinct difference in what I call their "breeding stock" between them and us. The elite rely heavily on family lines and family relationships and intermarry with each other like royalty does in England. The elite does not mix with the commoners. The LDS church adopts children of all races and does missionary work all over the world and looks to recruit from all nations. <br><br>I totally agree with you the LDS church owns a lot of businesses - Marriott Hotels is the most public that comes to mind - and their church is growing and spreading. I wonder if Romney running was more to accomplish the spread of that church more than anything else. There is a new Temple in Center City Philadelphia, built on some of the most expensive real estate in the city. Shiny and white like a beacon of hope. There is also a huge temple that rises high above the tree lines of the 495 beltway near DC. Here's a quick youtube video of it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgMUJZRhCc LDS church members believe that the more money they make, the better for the kingdom, the more people they can save, and the more prepared they are for what's next. The have preparedness trainings and canneries where people can can their own food in the large #10 cans. Each LDS family is expected to have a one year's supply of food stored in their home.<br><br>Mormons aren't THE elite, but given conditions coming they likely will be. Our elite will move out of the country to save their own skins, but Mormons aren't going anywhere. After all, they think the 13th tribe of Israel is the Native Americans.<br><br><a href=#c7743271984173131118 title="comment permalink">11/8/16, 4:37 AM</a><br><br>

I assume they do rank among your more popular ones, but I am not surprised the level of discourse suffers to a degree. Here is an extreme example of a similar dynamic: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/facebook-clickbait-political-news-sites-us-election-trump - "The town of Veles, Macedonia (population 44,000), is the unlikely home for dozens of avowedly pro-Trump political news sites, featuring headlines like Hillary’s Illegal Email Just Killed Its First American Spy and This is How Liberals Destroyed America, This Is Why We Need Trump in the White House. [...] All of them exist primarily for one reason – to cash in on the seemingly endless appetite for news about Donald Trump. And they’re getting a big boost from Facebook."<br><br>@Juahna: I think you refer to this incident: http://www.france24.com/en/20161026-france-police-protests-unions-terrorism-work / http://www.france24.com/en/20161009-french-police-injured-molotov-cocktail-attack-paris-suburb <br>No deaths I know of. <br>But I agree the situation is bad. I know people who have recently signed up for police in Marseille, and I've had some opportunity to observe their conduct down here. Generally speaking I would say it is abysmal on several fronts (not exclusively their fault! Funding, training, citizens relationships play a role, and I can't look much behind the scenes).<br><br>Have you heard of the right wing "equivalent" incident happening in Germany? http://www.dw.com/en/german-police-find-weapons-cache-linked-to-right-wing-reichsb%C3%BCrger-group/a-36189098 Of course it is not really equivalent, but there are some parallels like "turf", etc. I think the French case is probably a more "casual" use of violence, which I think is more unsettling. Also the "Reichsbürger" (and similar) are probably significantly less numerous than the nastier end of the "vibrant diversity" (which is to a large degree French born, and looked down upon from NA).<br><br>Regarding call for heavier weapons it is a little complicated. I see lots of FAMAS assault rifles, and grenade throwers in very inopportune places down here. Sometimes I half wonder if the squads (military) get sent out as bait. <br>The "regular" police usually carries semi-auto pistols only. After the Nice attack they broke out some ancient looking MPs in public which I can't believe they've trained on very much. <br>Provided they get adequate training and discipline I'd imagine an MP5 in the squad car would not hurt on some tours. But it wouldn't have saved the day in this instance either.<br><br><a href=#c4539991842410343008 title="comment permalink">11/8/16, 5:12 AM</a><br><br>

Just this morning NPR did a story on child care and how it is family's greatest expense and at the same time child care workers are the lowest paid workers, often receiving food stamps and Medicare. But NPR does not do the math and call out the corporate shills running this child care centers. A college degree worker is paid $11/hour to be in a toddler child care classroom taking care of 8 children (what's allowed as max number varies by state). The worker makes $440 per week gross, so more like $300 after taxes, SSI. The parents pay $250 a week for child care so those 8 children bring $2,000 into the center in tuition. Where does the other $1,560 go??? Sure there is overhead, materials and food costs, but not to that extent. But the journalist don't dig deep and we allow these corporate child care centers to profit and thrive while its workers live in poverty. <br><br>Well lets see if the votes defy the polling data and we have a Dewey moment.<br><br><a href=#c7450079673047147100 title="comment permalink">11/8/16, 6:11 AM</a><br><br>

I believe the vote last night was an antiwar vote. The American public is done, finished, over with the pretension that we can police the globe. <br><br>2. The winner's initial, and for a long time, only, issue was hostility to continuing immigration. I think it is fair to say that the public wants a moratorium on further mass immigration. The losing party met this sentiment with accusations of "racism", "bias", "basket of deplorables" and so on. <br><br>3. The losing party, in their invincible arrogance and hubris, chose a nominee who was revealed as both corrupt to an unbelievable degree, and terminally incompetent. Remember that most of us are practical people who have a fairly high tolerance for corruption and chicanery. But, here, the more one learned, the worse she appeared. To add insult to injury, we were being accused of racism and worse for declining to support an aging white female from a comfortable background, serial enabler of her husband's infidelities, no small number of which were honored with the title of assault, merely because some members of some minority groups had chosen to support her in hopes of largess and patronage.<br><br>Then came the wikileaks releases. Drip. Drip. Drip. Drip, like the celebrated water torture--one wondered when would this end and what was coming next. Next turned out to be that HER HOUSEKEEPER was trusted with sensitive documents. I don't know if you understand how parents over the last generation have sweated blood and tears to get promising children through college and started in the world, knowing that those children, no matter how clean their record nor how brilliant their academic careers are never going to be offered lucrative positions in the higher echelons of government or business. <br><br>In addition, there are various causes which are supported passionately by small but significant numbers of citizens who vote, such as stopping the Keystone pipeline, anti GMO, anti fracking, and banning the ivory trade. The democratic nominee was on the wrong side of just about every issue which folks care about this year, this decade.

JMG is to be congratulated on having accurately predicted the election outcome.<br><br>Last night was a replay of Brexit: the mild apprehension beforehand, as one entertains the possibility that the voters will take the less prudent of the two possible decisions; the brief groping around the Internet, with the resolve to do the rather safe, if unimaginative, thing and stick to the BBC; the repeated refreshing of the BBC "Live" page, with its incoming tweet-style bulletins; the realization (as BBC bulletin follows BBC bulletin, over the course of an hour or so) that the bad scenario is indeed at hand; and then the final resolve to do the one sane thing possible, namely to crawl into bed. 2016 has so far been been a worrying year. <br><br>If (<i>if</i>) I understand this TADR blog correctly, JMG still believes Mr Trump an acceptable ballot choice, given the undeniable problems with Mrs Clinton. I for my part still think (as I remarked this week at <a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com/ rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com/</a>) the following: (1) USA Presidents normally wield little power, with the actual decisions taken by a tight unseen group of people who grasp the (enormously complex) facts, and who manipulate the President-of-the-day by writing up "Policy Options" for her or him; (2) this normalcy is set aside only rarely, when some unusually gifted leader such as FDR occupies the Oval Office; (3) in the USA, as in all other national, regional, or municipal governments, a conspicuously eccentric figurehead, while lacking the power to do good, retains the power to do harm. <br><br>As evidence for proposition (1), I would cite Mr Obama's failure to achieve much, despite his being in office for two terms. <br><br>My evidence for proposition (3) comprises the points I bring up in my <a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com/ rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com/</a> essay. There I list, without aiming for completeness, several kinds of damage inflicted by Mr Trump on the American community or on the world community in the course of his odd campaign. <br><br><br>In grief and worry,<br><br><br>Tom (Estonian diaspora, near Toronto)<br><br>PS: LatheChuck: Thanks for your kind words over timestamp "11/8/16, 3:34 PM".<br><br><br><a href=#c6309509618195609587 title="comment permalink">11/9/16, 6:52 AM</a><br><br>

Aggressive chemo for his lymphoma, which is not being treated successfully by other means, trashed his kidneys. <br><br>He is - was - a well liked and respected high school chemistry teacher in a high desert blue-collar town of 17,000 people, active in the Jaycees for a long time, and in the local Republican Party. She is an Air Force veteran, a bookkeeper for the town's one big industry, and active in the local Democratic Party. They are both from blue collar roots. The very people who have narrowly escaped being pushed to the wall by the presence of that industry, by Oregon's laws, and by her veteran status.

If you click on that, all the actual comments disappear and you are left with just the list of the names of the commentators in the order of their comments from oldest to newest. Clicking on “said” just after the name (not the name itself), will reveal that person’s comments. If you do this, its easy to find particular comments from particular people names without having to scroll though all the comments. This is also a good tactic if you want to see comments that JMG is replying to since they are usually NOT just immediately above his comment. Collapse all the comments, expand just his comment and then look above for the names of the people he’s replying to.<br>As suggested by others, it helps us all if you at least mention the name of the person you’re replying to. It also helps if you summarize what person said that you are commenting on.

How will losing ACA coverage actually lead to your friend's husband's death? Will they be unable to afford coverage, or unable to get insurance because of a pre-existing condition? I assumed that in a case like that, people might receive the treatment and then end up bankrupt because of lack of insurance, or end up relying on some sort of Medicaid or similar, but I did not really think they would just be flatly denied lifesaving treatment if unable to pay. I know people who cannot pay can get life-saving treatment in an ER for an acute problem, but I do not have a good grasp of what happens to someone with a chronic condition like the one you describe.<br><br><a href=#c7202845291548788427 title="comment permalink">11/9/16, 4:16 PM</a><br><br>

Anyway, like I said, kinda excited to see what will come out of it, though definetly aprehensive. <br><br>One thing that I read in a local blog here in Brazil caught my attention and I decided to share: Both the UK and the USA, the two contries that spearheaded the push for "globalization" in the early 80's and put the alternative/sustainable economic experimentation of the 70's to death have now explicitly cast votes for a non-globalist agenda. With the revitalization of alternative centers of power to western neo-liberal orthodoxy in Russia/China, this may represent the beginning of the end of this tragedy of an economic policy that has plagued the world for the last 35 years. I'm afraid this might be a repetition of the last time the world revolted against laissez-faire capitalism, which ended up with two World Wars, large swathes of the world falling into pretty bad communist dictatorships and a few genocides to boot, but there's always hope that we can be more construtive this time around.<br><br>Here's to hope!<br><br><a href=#c8861931993789747205 title="comment permalink">11/9/16, 4:49 PM</a><br><br>

That it's unlikely that he will take control (covertly, of course) of the media, or make sure that the armed forces and police do exactly his bidding, or start by straightening out the Republican party and make sure that they all toe the new party line, which is going to be that they all must agree with him, immediately, on everything he says, even if he changes his mind on it the next week.
