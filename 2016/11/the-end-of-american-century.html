I have a bone to pick with the <i>Washington Post</i>. A few days back, as some of my readers may be aware, it published a list of some two hundred blogs that it claimed were circulating Russian propaganda, and I was disappointed to find that <i>The Archdruid Report </i>didn’t make the cut. </div>
<br>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/boris-9f04ff-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=200 src=../../img/boris-421598-192x200-g95.jpg width=192></a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Oh, granted, I don’t wait each week for secret orders from Boris Badenov, the mock-iconic Russian spy from the <i>Rocky and Bullwinkle Show</i> of my youth, but that shouldn’t disqualify me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve seen no evidence that any of the blogs on the list take orders from Moscow, either; certainly the <i>Post </i>offered none worth mentioning. Rather, what seems to have brought down the wrath of “Pravda on the Potomac,” as the <i>Post</i> is unfondly called by many DC locals, is that none of these blogs have been willing to buy into the failed neoconservative consensus that’s guided American foreign policy for the last sixteen years. Of that latter offense, in turn, <i>The Archdruid Report</i> is certainly guilty. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are at least two significant factors behind the <i>Post</i>’s adoption of the tactics of the late Senator Joe McCarthy, dubious lists and all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first is that the failure of Hillary Clinton’s presidential ambitions has thrown into stark relief an existential crisis that has the American news media by the throat. The media sell their services to their sponsors on the assumption that they can then sell products and ideas manufactured by those sponsors to the American people. The Clinton campaign accordingly outspent Trump’s people by a factor of two to one, sinking impressive amounts of the cash she raised from millionaire donors into television advertising and other media buys. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Clinton got the coverage she paid for, too. Nearly every newspaper in the United States endorsed her; pundits from one end of the media to the other solemnly insisted that everyone ought to vote for her; equivocal polls were systematically spun in her favor by a galaxy of talking heads. Pretty much everyone who thought they mattered was on board the bandwagon. The only difficulty, really was that the people who actually mattered—in particular, voters in half a dozen crucial swing states—responded to all this by telling their soi-disant betters, “Thanks, but one turkey this November is enough.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It turned out that Clinton was playing by a rulebook that was long past its sell-by date, while Trump had gauged the shift in popular opinion and directed his resources accordingly. While she sank her money into television ads on prime time, he concentrated on social media and barnstorming speaking tours through regions that rarely see a presidential candidate. He also figured out early on that the mainstream media was a limitless source of free publicity, and the best way to make use of it was to outrage the tender sensibilities of the media itself and get denounced by media talking heads. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That worked because a very large number of people here in the United States no longer trust the news media to tell them anything remotely resembling the truth. That’s why so many of them have turned to blogs for the services that newspapers and broadcast media used to provide: accurate reporting and thoughtful analysis of the events that affect their lives. Nor is this an unresasonable choice. The issue’s not just that the mainstream news media is biased; it’s not just that it never gets around to mentioning many issues that affect people’s lives in today’s America; it’s not even that it only airs a suffocatingly narrow range of viewpoints, running the gamut of opinion from A to A minus—though of course all these are true.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s also that so much of it is so smug, so shallow, and so dull. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The predicament the mainstream media now face is as simple as it is inescapable. After taking billions of dollars from their sponsors, they’ve failed to deliver the goods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Every source of advertising revenue in the United States has got to be looking at the outcome of the election, thinking, “Fat lot of good all those TV buys did her,” and then pondering their own advertising budgets and wondering how much of that money might as well be poured down a rathole. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Presumably the mainstream news media could earn the trust of the public again by breaking out of the echo chamber that defines the narrow range of acceptable opinions about the equally narrow range of issues open to discussion, but this would offend their sponsors. Worse, it would offend the social strata that play so large a role in defining and enforcing that echo chamber; most mainstream news media employees who have a role in deciding what does and does not appear in print or on the air belong to these same social strata, and are thus powerfully influenced by peer pressure. Talking about supposed Russian plots to try to convince people not to get their news from blogs, though it’s unlikely to work, doesn’t risk trouble from either of those sources. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Why, though, blame it on the Russians? That’s where we move from the first to the second of the factors I want to discuss this week. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A bit of history may be useful here. During the 1990s, the attitude of the American political class toward the rest of the world rarely strayed far from the notions expressed by Francis Fukuyama in his famous and fatuous essay proclaiming the end of history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The fall of the Soviet Union, according to this line of thought, proved that democracy and capitalism were the best political and economic systems humanity would ever come up with, and the rest of the world would therefore inevitably embrace them in due time. All that was left for the United States and its allies to do was to enforce certain standards of global order on the not-yet-democratic and not-yet-capitalist nations of the world, until they grew up and got with the program. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That same decade, though, saw the emergence of the neoconservative movement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The neoconservaties were as convinced of the impending triumph of capitalism and democracy as their rivals, but they opposed the serene absurdities of Fukuyama’s thesis with a set of more muscular absurdities of their own. Intoxicated with the collapse of the Soviet Union and its allies, they convinced themselves that identical scenes could be enacted in Baghdad, Tehran, Beijing, and the rest of the world, if only the United States would seize the moment and exploit its global dominance.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
During Clinton’s presidency, the neoconservatives formed a pressure group on the fringes of official Washington, setting up lobbying groups such as the Project for a New American Century and bombarding the media with position papers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The presidency of George W. Bush gave them their chance, and they ran with it. Where the first Iraq war ended with Saddam Hussein beaten but still in power—the appropriate reponse according to the older ideology—the second ended with the US occupying Iraq and a manufactured “democratic” regime installed under its aegis. In the afterglow of victory, neoconservatives talked eagerly about the conquest of Iran and the remaking of the Middle East along the same lines as post-Soviet eastern Europe. Unfortunately for these fond daydreams, what happened instead was a vortex of sectarian warfare and anti-American insurgency. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You might think, dear reader, that the cascading failures of US policy in Iraq might have caused second thoughts in the US political and military elites whose uncritical embrace of neoconservative rhetoric let that happen. You might be forgiven, for that matter, for thinking that the results of US intervention in Afghanistan, where the same assumptions had met with the same disappointment, might have given those second thoughts even more urgency. If so, you’d be quite mistaken. According to the conventional wisdom in today’s America, the only conceivable response to failure is doubling down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“If at first you don’t succeed, fail, fail again” thus seems to be the motto of the US political class these days, and rarely has that been so evident as in the conduct of US foreign policy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Obama administration embraced the same policies as its feckless predecessor, and the State Department, the CIA, and the Pentagon went their merry way, overthrowing governments right and left, and tossing gasoline onto the flames of ethnic and sectarian strife in various corners of the world, under the serene conviction that the blowback from these actions could never inconvenience the United States. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That would be bad enough. Far worse was the effect of neoconservative policies on certain other nations: Russia, China, and Iran. In the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse, Russia was a basket case, Iran was a pariah nation isolated from the rest of the world, and China had apparently made its peace with an era of American global dominance, and was concentrating on building up its economy instead of its military. It would have been child’s play for the United States to maintain that state of affairs indefinitely. Russia could have been helped to recover and then integrated economically into Europe; China could have been allowed the same sort of regional primacy the US allows as a matter of course to its former enemies Germany and Japan; and without US intervention in the Middle East to hand it a bumper crop of opening wedges, Iran could have been left to stew in its own juices until it imploded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s not what happened, though. Instead, two US adminstrations went out of their way to convince Russia and China they had nothing to gain and everything to lose by accepting their assigned places in a US-centric international order. Russia and China have few interests in common and many reasons for conflict; they’ve spent much of their modern history glaring at each other across a long and contentious mutual border; they had no reason to ally with each other, until the United States gave them one. Nor did either nation have any reason to reach out to the Muslim theocracy in Iran—quite the contrary—until they began looking for additional allies to strengthen their hand against the United States. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the basic goals of effective foreign policy is to divide your potential enemies against each other, so that they’re so busy worrying about one another that they don’t have the time or resources to bother you. It’s one thing, though, to violate that rule when the enemies you’re driving together lack the power to threaten your interests, and quite another when the resource base, population, and industrial capacity of the nations you’re driving together exceeds your own. The US government’s harebrained pursuit of neoconservative policies has succeeded, against the odds, in creating a sprawling Eurasian alliance with an economic and military potential significantly greater than that of the US.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>There have probably been worse foreign policy blunders in the history of the world, but I can’t think of one off hand. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You won’t read about that in the mainstream news media in the United States. At most, you’ll get canned tirades about how Russian president Vladimir Putin is a “brutal tyrant” who is blowing up children in Aleppo or what have you. “Brutal tyrant,” by the way, is a code phrase of the sort you normally get in managed media.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In the US news, it simply means “a head of state who’s insufficiently submissive to the United States.” Putin certainly qualifies as the latter; first in the Caucasus, then in the Ukraine, and now in Syria, he’s deployed military force to advance his country’s interests against those of the United States and its allies. I quite understand that the US political class isn’t pleased by this, but it might be helpful for them to reflect on their own role in making it happen.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Russian initiative isn’t limited to Syria, though. Those of my readers who only pay attention to US news media probably don’t know yet that Egypt has now joined Russia’s side. Egyptian and Russian troops are carrying out <a href=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2016/10/12/Russian-Egyptian-troops-to-hold-exercises-at-El-Alamein.html>joint military drills</a>, and reports <a href=http://www.dailysabah.com/mideast/2016/11/04/egypt-sends-forces-to-help-assad-report-claims>in Middle Eastern news media</a> have it that <a href=http://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2016/11/27/syria-egypt-joins-fray-support-russia-backed-coalition.html>Egyptian troops will soon join the war in Syria</a> on the side of the Syrian government. If so, that’s a game-changing move, and probably means game over for the murky dealings the United States and its allies have been pursuing in that end of the Middle East. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
China and Russia have very different cultural styles when it comes to exerting power. Russian culture celebrates the bold stroke; Chinese culture finds subtle pressure more admirable. Thus the Chinese have been advancing their country’s interests against those of the United States and its allies in a less dramatic but equally effective way. While distracting Washington’s attention with a precisely measured game of “chicken” in the South China Sea, the Chinese have established a line of naval bases along the northern shores of the Indian Ocean from Myanmar to Djibouti, and contracted alliances in East Africa and South Asia. Those of my readers who’ve read Alfred Thayer Mahan and thus know their way around classic maritime strategy will recognize exactly what’s going on here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Most recently, China has scored two dramatic shifts in the balance of power in the western Pacific. My American readers may have heard of President Rodrigo Duterte of the Phillippines; he’s the one who<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>got his fifteen minutes of fame in the mainstream media here when he called Barack Obama a son of a whore. The broader context, of course, got left out. Duterte, like the heads of state of many nominal US allies, resents US<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>interference in his country’s affairs, and at this point he has other options. His outburst was followed in short order by a trip to Beijing, where he and China’s President Xi signed multibillion-dollar aid agreements and talked openly about the end of a US-dominated world order. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A great many Americans seem to think of the Phillippines as a forgettable little country off somewhere unimportant in the Third World. That’s a massive if typical misjudgment. It’s a nation of 100 million people on a sprawling archipelago of more than 7,000 islands, commanding the entire southern end of the South China Sea and a vast swath of the western Pacific, including crucial maritime trade routes. As a US ally, it was a core component of the ring of encirclement holding Chinese maritime forces inside the island ring that walls China’s coastal waters from rest of the Pacific basin. As a Chinese ally, it holds open that southern gate to China’s rapidly expanding navy and air force. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Duterte wasn’t the only Asian head of state to head for Beijing in recent months. Malaysia’s prime minister was there a few weeks later, to sign up for another multibillion-dollar aid package, buy Chinese vessels for the Malaysian navy, and make acid comments about the way that, ahem, former colonial powers keep trying to interfere in Malaysian affairs. Malaysia’s a smaller nation than the Phillippines, but even more strategically placed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its territory runs alongside the northern shore of the Malacca Strait:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>the most important sea lane in the world, the gateway connecting the Indian Ocean with the Pacific, through which much of the world’s seaborne crude oil transport passes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All these are opening moves. Those who are familiar with the rise and fall of global powers know what the next moves are; those who don’t might want to consider reading my book <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/D/Decline-and-Fall target=_blank>Declineand Fall</a>, or my novel <a href=http://us.karnacbooks.com/product/twilights-last-gleaming/34386/ >Twilight’s Last Gleaming</a>, which makes the same points in narrative form. Had Hillary Clinton won this month’s election, we might have moved into the endgame much sooner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Her enthusiasm for overthrowing governments during her stint as Secretary of State, and her insistence that the US should impose a no-fly zone over Syria in the teeth of Russian fighters and state-of-the-art antiaircraft defenses, suggests that she could have filled the role of my fictional president Jameson Weed, and sent US military forces into a shooting war they were not realistically prepared to win. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We seem to have dodged that bullet. Even so, the United States remains drastically overextended, with military bases in more than a hundred countries around the world and a military budget nearly equal to all other countries’ put together. Meanwhile, back here at home, our country is falling apart. Leave the bicoastal bubble where the political class and their hangers-on spend their time, and the United States resembles nothing so much as the Soviet Union in its last days: a bleak and dilapidated landscape of economic and social dysfunction, where the enforced cheerfulness of the mainstream media contrasts intolerably with the accelerating disintegration visible all around. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That could have been prevented. If the United States had responded to the end of the Cold War by redirecting the so-called “peace dividend” toward the rebuilding of our national infrastructure and our domestic economy, we wouldn’t be facing the hard choices before us right now—and in all probability, by the way, Donald Trump wouldn’t just have been elected president. Instead, the US political class let itself be caught up in neoconservative fantasies of global dominion, and threw away that opportunity. The one bright spot in that dismal picture is that we have another chance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
History shows that there are two ways that empires end. Their most common fate involves clinging like grim death to their imperial status until it drags them down. Spain’s great age of overseas empire ended that way, with Spain plunging into a long era of economic disarray and civil war. At least it maintained its national unity; the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires both finished their imperial trajectories by being partitioned, as of course did the Soviet Union. There are worse examples; I’m thinking here of the Assyrian Empire of the ancient Middle East, which ceased to exist completely—its nationhood, ethnicity, and language dissolving into those of its neighbors—once it fell. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then there’s the other option, the one chosen by the Chinese in the fifteenth century and Great Britain in the twentieth. Both nations had extensive overseas empires, and both walked away from them, carrying out a staged withdrawal from imperial overreach. Both nations not only survived the process but came through with their political and cultural institutions remarkably intact. This latter option, with all its benefits, is still available to the United States. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A staged withdrawal of the sort just described would of course be done step by step, giving our allies ample time to step up to the plate and carry the costs of their own defense. Those regions that have little relevance to US national interests, such as the Indian Ocean basin, would see the first round of withdrawals, while more important regions such as Europe and the northwest Pacific would be later on the list. The withdrawal wouldn’t go all the way back to our borders by any means; a strong presence in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins and a pivot to our own “near abroad” would be needed, but those would also be more than adequate to maintain our national security. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, the billions upon billions of dollars a year that would be saved could be put to work rebuilding our national infrastructure and economy, with enough left over for a Marshall Plan for Mexico—the most effective way to reduce illegal immigration to the United States, after all, is to help make sure that citizens of the countries near us have plenty of jobs at good wages where they already live. Finally, since the only glue holding the Russo-Chinese alliance together is their mutual opposition to US hegemony, winding up our term as global policeman will let Russia, China and Iran get back to contending with each other rather than with us. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Such projects, on the rare occasions they’re made, get shouted down by today’s US political class as “isolationism.” There’s a huge middle ground between isolationism and empire, though, and that middle ground is where most of the world’s nations stand as they face their neighbors. One way or another, the so-called “American century” is ending; it can end the hard way, the way so many other eras of global hegemony have ended—or it can end with the United States recognizing that it’s a nation among nations, not an overlord among vassals, and acting accordingly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
The mainstream news media here in the United States, if they actually provided the public service they claim, might reasonably be expected to discuss the pros and cons of such a proposal, and of the many other options that face this nation at the end of its era of global hegemony. I can’t say I expect that to happen, though. It’s got to be far more comfortable for them to blame the consequences of their own failure on the supposed Boris Badenovs of the blogosphere, and cling to the rags of their fading role as purveyors of a failed conventional wisdom, until the last of their audience wanders away for good.</div>

I think I noticed about 18 months ago that most stories had degenerated into "Person X said [something offensive Y] causing Person Z to be outraged." It didn't matter what the subject was - it could be politics, sport, arts, or anything else—everything everywhere was suddenly outrageous.<br><br>I suppose, on reflection, that maybe this is just a side effect of the legacy media losing its power to the alternative narratives that have stepped into the void. It certainly seems that they are doubling down on this theme of outrage, raving about "fake news" and "Russian hackers" and all the rest of it. I wonder if they realise how utterly silly they are looking.<br><br>In other news, I'm happy to announce that my first fiction novel has just been published by Club Orlov Press. "Seat of Mars" is a racy story about a bunch of diverse characters as they deal with a sudden end of the age of abundance. Many of the themes contained within will be familiar to readers of the Archdruid Report, and you'll be relieved to hear that the narrative occupies the broad but sparsely populated area between an ascent to the stars and all-out apocalypse. The book is available <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seat-Mars-Jason-Heppenstall/dp/1540631176/ref=pd_ybh_a_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=H6ZZ9XE95R86EENPFVZW" rel=nofollow>here.</a><br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c5892897934863179564 title="comment permalink">11/30/16, 11:48 AM</a><br><br>

Very much appreciated, as are all the people who visited, subscribed, ordered copies of the issue, and so on. The response to the project has been really gratifying! And as always, let me urge everyone reading to consider a letter to the editor once you've had time to absorb the material--especially all the fine commenters here! I really loved the letters section in this most recent issue and want to keep that momentum going (I'll probably put a prompt of some kind up on the journal's blog sometime soon, since it worked so well last time).<br><br>As for the subject at hand, I have admittedly been somewhat clueless about geopolitics and military affairs for much of my life. Your occasional writings here on the subjects have helped me to broaden my view and have a bit more of a basic grasp. This post is particularly illuminating, clear and concise; I really appreciate it.<br><br>I certainly have my concerns about Trump's presidency, but one of the possible silver linings from his election is this exact possibility of the beginnings of an ordered retreat from empire. I'm not super optimistic, to be honest, but it at least feels possible now, whereas before I thought our death grip to the end was largely inevitable. So here's my question to you: do you see any particularly ideal openings at the moment for activism or voter input around this idea? Are there particular pressure points you think are more clearly available with Trump that we might best focus on pushing?<br><br>I've been thinking for the last few weeks about political strategy around a Trump presidency. One of my concerns with people on the left and Democrats--of which I'm still more aligned than conservatives and Republicans--is that so many seem to have not even listened to, paid attention, or actually in any way studied or examined Trump and his campaign. I've seen a lot of talking points and expressed concerns about things that many Congressional Republicans stand for or advocate but that Trump himself has aligned in the opposite direction. Any attempts to make the best of a Trump presidency that aren't based in at least some understanding of the man's actual positions and stances (which are in many instances quite different from establishment Republicans) strike me as doomed to failure due to poor strategy. If you don't pay attention to what the man says, how are you going to effectively exploit pressure points between him and Congressional Republicans?<br><br>(I should take a moment to note that, yes, Trump has contradicted himself regularly and we simply don't yet know what his administration is going to look like, but I see far too many complete and utter misunderstandings of him from people who freely admit they've never listened to one of his speeches and have barely exposed themselves to him outside of the mainstream media's presentation, as well as liberal media.)<br><br>So I'll loop back around. Obviously, part of the strategy is attempting to get the idea of an orderly retreat from empire out into the national conversation, even if that means an end run around the establishment media. But do you think there are other forms of activism or advocacy that might be particularly effective just now? Is the potential for normalization of our relationship with Russia a good place to apply pressure?<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c3970924047694195951 title="comment permalink">11/30/16, 12:20 PM</a><br><br>

It's also a very good wedge issue for people on your end of the political spectrum to apply; as I noted here two weeks ago, that's a huge issue out here in flyover country, and could be an issue on which the left could reach out to the people who voted for Obama in 2008 and Trump in 2016. The difficulty, of course, is that the left will have to learn from its failures, and as you've noted, an astonishing number of people on your end of things seem unwilling to even attempt that. <br><br>Lisa, no, that's not what I'm saying. This notion you have that policy "isn't a thing" makes me scratch my head and wonder what you think politics is about. Let me be even more precise: <i><b>politics is about policy</b></i>. It's about what kind of decisions the government is going to make about issues that matter. Should the US confront the Russians in Syria, or negotiate? That's a question of policy. Should the US have a national health care plan, or not? That's a question of policy. Should the US maintain its current trade treaties, or cancel them? That's a question of policy -- <i><b>and those questions matter</b></i>. They shape the lives of all three hundred million of us in this country. <br><br>I should probably clarify something else, too. I don't feel strongly against Hillary Clinton. I couldn't care less what kind of person she is. I feel very strongly against the <i><b>policies</b></i> that she pursued as a senator and secretary of state and advocated for as a presidential candidate. If policy isn't a "thing" for you, may I encourage you to wake up, rub the sleep out of your eyes, and look around? <br><br>Crowandsheep, you definitely get a prize -- tonight's gold star, in fact. ;-)<br><br>Kari, thank you!<br><br>David, every commonsense idea begins as a blasphemous heresy mouthed by some madman on the fringes of society.

Certainly the Russians seem to be making the most of the discomfiture of the US political class; if the new administration has the common sense to back away from unnecessary confrontation and draw lines in the sand only where they have to be drawn in the interests of actual national security, there's still plenty of room for a positive outcome. <br><br>LatheChuck, duly noted. I'll have to check into that. <br><br>Lucullus, we'll see. As I noted in response to Brother Guthlac, remembering how people in this country responded to a call to shared sacrifice in the Second World War, I really do think it's possible that a president who leveled with the people and stuck by his guns might win reelection in a landslide. <br><br>Ad Attacker, you're welcome, thank you, and please do shout it from the rooftops!<br><br>Phil, highly pertinent. A Chinese naval and air base in the Azores would be a logical next acquisition for them -- I'd also look for a treaty or two with a nation or two in West Africa, and perhaps one of the smaller South American countries with an Atlantic coast. <br><br>Archimedes, we won't know for sure unless remedial treatment is attempted, will we? <br><br>Nuku, I see things a little differently here. The US is treating New Zealand as a fallback for naval basing, as it loses control of the South China Sea and has to look at the possibility of new shipping routes running south of Australia instead of through the Malacca Straits. So the move to get US naval vessels docking rights in your country is part of the retreat. <br><br>Ghung, I didn't mention it because it wasn't relevant to the subject of this week's post. Sure, we have a byzantine system of electing a president here in the US; successful candidates grasp that and work with it, failed candidates buy into their own groupthink. That would be just as true if we didn't have the electoral college and the coastal population centers could steamroller the less populous regions. <br><br>Bruno, exactly. It seems to me that getting rid of our empire is the first step toward getting back some of our democracy. <br><br>Wolfbay, you're welcome. There really is another choice, and the more people talk about that, the more likely it becomes that we'll take it. <br><br>Armata, yes, I noted that. My working guess, unless the Democrats can get past wallowing in their hurt feelings and learn from their mistakes, is that the GOP will add to its Congressional majority in 2018 and, if Trump can deliver on at least some of his promises, he'll win in a 1936-style landslide in 2020.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c3571915147857829848 title="comment permalink">11/30/16, 4:57 PM</a><br><br>

And this may only be the tip of the iceberg with both political parties playing the same game! What the hell?

When a maybe-Russian airstrike destroys a hospital in Aleppo with the "White helmets" pulling an uncrushed child from the rubble, that is called a story (of sorts). When the same damn thing happens literally day after day, week after week, then one is forced to conclude that the entire city of Aleppo is made up of hospitals and it population made up of children and "White Helmet" rescuers.

In other words, everything will continue on until it cannot anymore. When those Americans that live in the coastal enclaves feel the same amount of pain that is felt in the rest of the country, perhaps then the country will decide to change course but by then it will be far too late.

These are issues where the entire establishment, GOP &amp; Dem, is against Trump, and he needs all the support he can get. If someone is amongst the Bernie Bros (and gals), and can somehow plant a bug in their ear that these issues are far too important not to reach across the aisle and work to effect positive change, it could go a long way.

Today, Russia and its proxies are clinging to scraps of Eastern Ukraine, Russia is engaging in expensive military adventurism to try to salvage Syria, and rapidly draining its national financial reserves.

I hope you never tire of leadership, and I hope your lack of prominence on blacklists saves you the trouble of fighting off clueless hackers (much worse than trolls, unfortunately, but luckily also less numerous). <br><br>I stopped watching the mainstream media years ago, after tolerating the usual 5 minutes of news followed by sports (which I hate) and weather (here, usually wrong) and traffic (I'm directionally challenged, anyway haha) and then 5 minutes of celebrity gossip, all interspersed with commercials. I finally stopped watching it completely when I learned a lot of the actual news stories are really just more paid advertisements in disguise. I'm sure you've seen the typical segment touting the major medical breakthrough: XYZ Pharmaceuticals has discovered some new medication/technology to treat cancer/heart disease/depression.... guess what? XYZ Pharmaceuticals paid to have that "medical breakthrough" covered on the news. Any time any branded corporation is listed on the news in a positive light, there's a really good chance they paid for the publicity. After I learned that, I stopped watching completely (except when the weather comes on the TV at work, I occasionally stop to watch that... still wrong lol). I eventually switched to noncorporate media like Democracy Now and international news like BBC, RT, and Al Jazeera, but then I realized that life is better without TV, now I get all my news from the most paranoid corners of the internet ;) and of course here, too. I'll occasionally use a mainstream site's online page to fact-check a claim off a fringe site, but that's about it. I did tune in to some mainstream media during the election, and maybe it's because my blinders were off, but I couldn't deal with how partisan the channels were. There was a point in the election when it was clear Hilary was losing badly, and one particular channel kept showing vignettes of the sad Clinton supporters all night, without a single report from the Trump side. Not one. Even when it was obvious she lost. I can't handle that kind of tunnel vision. I had to switch back and forth between channels to create the illusion of total coverage. That was my last night listening to a pundit for what will be a very long time. <br><br>Your report of the alliance between China, Russia, and Iran is ominous. We can only hope that Trump drops the neocon agenda and finds other things to do besides wage war. I have hope but only a small hope. While it's so easy to see that the US has been very aggressive in the past, it's very easy to paint the picture of Russia as a victim, an innocent bystander caught in the middle of a terrible mess. I find myself thinking it a lot. We all need to remember that the real reason for the neocon agenda is of course limits, and the US has been using military force to control access to the best remaining reserves of dwindling resources (oil, for example) and therefore influence supply and demand and prices (mainly to drive corporate profits). However, Russia and China are probably even more aware of the position we are all in, as outsiders they have less access to resources than we do and are probably acutely aware of the trajectory of civilization. I don't see many reasons to believe that we have peace in our future. Even if we walk away from the Middle East and leave it to our rivals, get out of the empire business, and start paying full price for resources, we will still be on a planet where a bunch of nuclear powers are fighting over the Middle East's oil or Africa's rare earths or the Arctic's decaying bones. Nuclear fallout doesn't recognize international borders.

The critical issues that threaten us are not explored in the shrunken media and objection to the vaulted common wisdom is termed anti-American.<br> For the military and its readiness to fight impossible wars, the critical issue is getting nothing for all the money spent on weapons systems. As a country and as a culture we can no longer create and manufacture ships, planes or anything military without huge cost overruns and disastrous results. The F-35 Lardbucket program is an insult to our past achievements. The Bradley fighting vehicle was a twenty-year boondoggle. The current crop of Navy ships, including the new Zumwalt class destroyer is a complete failure. From that pit of corruption to the painful reality of how the military is created and used is a national tragedy.<br> Other departments and other disasters are very apparent. The war of drugs is a failure. The loans to students are mounting to a new height of insanity. Health care is a swindle and a scam. Infrastructure is not getting repaired or replaced. In short, we are a national failure.<br> The incoming administration will continue the process, begun years ago, that the party coming into the White House scams the nation, installs their own criminals, never goes to prison, and steals everything is can get, through new laws and new programs in its allies favor.<br> Can we expect anyone or any organization surviving the trial of a presidential campaign to be anything but totally corrupt? The winner will get their chance to pick over the carcass for the next cycle. Some toes will get stepped on and many losers will protest their causes and their point of view to no avail.<br> In the long run, the United States is spent. Our economic system is bankrupt. The appetite for oil, for gas, for petroleum products is too high to operate in any other way but “happy motoring.” We cannot exist without a gigantic stream of imported oil feeding our cars, our bellies, our houses and our generators. We are addicted to petroleum for vehicle fuel, for home heating, for plastics, for fertilizers and for generating electricity. We cannot convert to any other life style or economic pattern without many changes and a complete national shakeup. America could not declare victory with a few garden plots. Most institutions will not survive the ordeal that is coming.<br> Russia is currently billed by the media as America's arch-enemy. But Russia has many inborn advantages. Its appetite for oil is much lower. It is a northern country that is not directly in the path of climate change like our seaboard. It can feed itself with food and with its oil. It has an underlying peasant culture that is hardy and strong. Militarily, it is designing and building practical weapons for a fraction of what the US does. Some of its systems are old and less vulnerable to EMP. As a continental power, it is not vulnerable to invasion from outside. A big army tried invasion a few years back and failed. In the past, Russians have been wise.<br> The US is over taxed militarily with too many far flung commitments and too much spent on graft, corruption and useless weapons. The all-volunteer army is scratching the bottom of the barrel for bodies and would not be able to fall back on conscription. The current American culture will not support a draft. A draft would take years to work out and in the meantime protests would fill the streets. The Navy is building poorly designed, too teched-out ships to fight the next war, at an exorbitant cost per ship.<br> In short, the US is perched on the brink of cultural collapse, monetary collapse, military defeat and can only rely on increased scams to keep its trajectory. Everything in American life comes down to a scam, a swindle, a steal of resources from the innocent to the more corrupt. The poor are penalized and the rich pretend they are invulnerable to the coming downturn. Buckle up, it's going to be a stormy ride.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c4101493262633314204 title="comment permalink">11/30/16, 7:07 PM</a><br><br>

That means preserving Russian allies like Bashar al-Assad in Syria, breaking up the "globalist" EU, NATO, and US-aligned trade and defense organizations, and getting countries to join "Eurasianist" Russian equivalents instead... Or else.”<br><br>In a lot of ways, this sounds exactly like the geostrategic analysis you give in this post, as Russian and China struggle to find a way to counter American hegemony. Funny that the US acting “to stabilize [its own] structurally-unstable regime” is perfectly acceptable, but for anyone else, it’s propaganda.<br><br>Further digging may have revealed why The Archdruid Report didn’t make the list (other than it takes more than an honest 5th grade education to read it). It seems many of the sites listed were ones that were linked to, referenced by, or repeat posted by a site called Zero Hedge, and you haven’t been linked by them yet. This site, according to propornot, is ground zero for the Russian information insurgency, and cause for many of the ills in America today. Zero Hedge itself was probably targeted since its listed as one of the ten most popular financial blogs by Time Magazine (I know, sterling endorsement but these people read Time, not Zero Hedge) with page views north of 18m per month, and actually questioned American policy. <br><br>Part of what may be happening to the media is a reflection of the bifurcation of culture in America. We are increasingly divided along rural/urban lines and media markets are defined by urban areas. In my little chunk of fly-over America, the media moguls have lumped three cities (towns?) into a single media market, and even that doesn’t crack the top 100 media markets in America. Given that a majority of Americans live in urban areas, and urban areas are left/liberal leaning, it’s no surprise that the media caters to that audience and that advertising market.<br><br>As for the media effort put forth by Clinton vs that of Trump. What I don’t see widely published (though it may actually be considered behind the scenes) is that Clinton was a lousy product. I don’t care how much money you pour into advertising, it just won’t sell. Just ask the Coca-Cola Co about their New Coke advertising blitz.<br><br>Love the blog, keep up the good work.<br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c378177446268449007 title="comment permalink">11/30/16, 7:13 PM</a><br><br>

For another entertaining example of clueless affluent liberals bowing down before the Church of Hillary, check out this celebrity Hillary supporter who <a href=https://twitter.com/JillFilipovic/status/796396691113017344 rel=nofollow>tweeted</a><br><br><i>Sorry America, you didn't deserve her</i>.<br><br>Or how about this shining example of <a href=http://www.lennyletter.com/politics/a613/hillary-clinton-is-more-than-a-president/ rel=nofollow>Bobo idiocy</a><br><br><i>When people told me they hated Hillary Clinton or (far worse) that they were "not fans," I wish I had said in no uncertain terms: "I love Hillary Clinton. I am in awe of her. I am set free by her. She will be the finest world leader our galaxy has ever seen."<br><br>I want to reverse the usual schedule of things, then. We don't have to wait until she dies to act. Hillary Clinton's name belongs on ships, and airports, and tattoos. She deserves straight-up hagiographies and a sold-out Broadway show called RODHAM. Yes, this cultural canonization is going to come after the chronic, constant, nonstop "On the other hand" sexist hedging around her legacy. But such is the courage of Hillary Clinton and her supporters; we reverse patriarchal orders. Maybe she is more than a president. Maybe she is an idea, a world-historical heroine, light itself. The presidency is too small for her. She belongs to a much more elite class of Americans, the more-than-presidents. Neil Armstrong, Martin Luther King Jr., Alexander F*****g Hamilton.<br><br>Hillary Clinton did everything right in this campaign, and she won more votes than her opponent did. She won. She cannot be faulted, criticized, or analyzed for even one more second. Instead, she will be decorated as an epochal heroine far too extraordinary to be contained by the mere White House. Let that revolting president-elect be Millard Fillmore or Herbert Hoover or whatever. Hillary is Athena.</i><br><br>The comedy of it all is almost too much to bear without dying of laughter. I think its hilarious in the extreme watching all these affluent liberal yuppies lose it because Hillary Clinton lost the election.

The American media has made it its business to be the arbiter of information exchange in the world, and now that substantial cracks are showing in that façade they appear to have a choice, to rediscover the core of their readership/viewership, or to continue to die the messy death they've been struggling towards. A media that would actually adopt and advance the viewpoint of the American people - wow, what a concept. I am amazed and frankly appalled that the American media throws around words like "Populist" and "Nationalist" as if they carried the same negative connotations as the numerous other words they use for evilly evil evilness (Nazi, Racist, and so forth ad nauseum.) BTW, your analysis is spot-on as usual. Not many in the USA know (as you alluded to) of the Chinese treasure fleets, the voyages of Admiral Zheng He, and how the Chinese turned aside from becoming (for a while) a global empire as did Spain and later England. I've long been fascinated why the Chinese looked down that road but decided: nah.

Forster, in "The Machine Stops," also had a future Chinese conquest of Australia? <br><br>Barry, I don't think you've seen US media. Our news media is considerably worse than the average news-and-views blog. <br><br>Professor, the current US navy is very poorly provided with the smaller classes of ships -- so much money has been sucked down the black hole of the Gerald Ford-class carriers and a handful of other high-tech boondoggles -- and one of the consequences of the strategy I'm proposing is that frigates and the like would be far more useful than, say, carriers or littoral combat ships. Thus the naval buildup and a staged withdrawal from global hegemony are entirely compatible. <br><br>Donalfagan, thanks for the link. <br><br>Varun, the fact that there's so much empty space in the political sphere is a risk, but it's also a profound opportunity. Why do you think I've been hammering on political themes so heavily this year? My political posts get anything up to four times normal traffic, because people are desperate for some alternative to a failed business-as-usual model, and they're certainly not going to get it from either of the mainstream parties. The ideas that seize the public imagination now may be public policy twenty years from now. <br><br>Rapier, where on earth did you get the idea that I expect a steady march in any direction at all? <br><br>Patricia, I'm delighted to say that Naked Capitalism, one of my favorite Badenov sites, <a href=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2016/11/links-112916.html rel=nofollow>has already featured a Natasha Fatale pinup</a>.

Deserved, mind you, but harsh. Do you think they're mad because they didn't make the list either? <br><br>Pygmycory, I remember hearing some remarkable squeals of rapture from my more liberal Canadian friends when Justin Trudeau took office. Like Obama, of course, he talked a great line and then pursued business as usual for the benefit of his rich friends. <br><br>Jeff, I'm familiar with that argument, and to my mind it doesn't hold water. If you compare the Russian military response in the Georgian, Ukraine, and Syrian campaigns, what's immediately visible is a steady increase in effectiveness and in the scale and coordination of the units in action. The Georgian action, though successful, was pretty klutzy; Syria has been the opposite. US military observers insisted that there was no way the Russian air units in Syria would be able to maintain an adequate OPTEMP (operational tempo -- basically, rate of missions flown per unit), and then were dumbfounded as the Russian units kept up, for months, an OPTEMP that the US air force can't maintain for more than a short time. That's the mark of an expanding power, not a contracting one. <br><br>As for MANPADS, there's another reason the US doesn't provide them to the mercenaries and jihadi militants we're funding in Syria; if they did, Russia could turn around and supply equivalent weapons to armed groups in areas where the US air force is active, and their planes are a lot less expensive to replace than ours! <br><br>Warren, it's a weird mix of the two. A lot of Americans still embrace the last scraps of the old messianic fantasy about the US as the world's savior; many can't imagine a world in which the US isn't the most powerful nation on Earth; and yes, the "world citizen" business comes up now and again. Overt glorying in America's imperial conquests is rare in public. <br><br>Twilight, that strikes me as a very plausible analysis. <br><br>Gordon, no doubt that was it! <br><br>Repent, in 2009 McPherson insisted that there would be no cars on the roads by 2012. In 2010, if I remember correctly, he insisted that we'd all be dead by 2015. He's not even right as often as a broken clock -- so, yes, I assume that we'll still be around over a period of centuries. I also don't believe in the Great Pumpkin, by the way. <br><br>Patricia, I'm still astonished that they left out Dmitry. He's got to talk to Boris and Natasha, and get himself better publicity from Fearless Leader. <br><br>Jessi, I know it's going to be a rough ride whatever we do. I'm hoping that enough people will take constructive steps to keep us away from a worst case scenario. That's a gamble -- but why not take it? <br><br>Nathan, funny. As opposed to using a smokescreen of identity politics to prevent anyone from discussing policy, like certain news media I can think of! <br><br>Doom, so? Of course we're up against long odds. It seems more useful to me to try to influence the situation in a constructive direction than to sit there coming up with long lists of reasons why there's no hope left in elves or dying Numenor... <br><br>Canon Fodder, yeah, I've been linked regularly in Zero Hedge comment threads but not yet in their articles.

So there goes health care, public education, any attempt to deal with climate change, safety and finance regulations, and our national parks.

Somehow the rest of the world doesn't agree with this, and sees these wonderful moral values as window dressing for the systematic looting of their countries. If you can do so without losing your last meal, you might read Rudyard Kipling's poem "The White Man's Burden," and compare it with the rhetoric currently spraying out of the orifices of the Times; the words are different but it's the same old song. <br><br>Edward, I'm glad to hear you and your son have such conversations.

I'm still not sure if the author has a panting schoolgirl crush on Hillary Clinton, or if she's projecting her own floridly delusional ego fantasies and overinflated sense of cosmic importance onto the blank screen of a presidential candidate. <br><br>Bryan, thank you! I try to include the rest of the planet in my historical analysis, and China's a very rich source of historical lessons, as Spengler and Toynbee both realized. <br><br>Rakesprogress, I know. Russia and China both have got to be looking at the chaos into which exploitive trade agreements are driving Mexico, and rubbing their hands together. That's one of the reasons why I want to get the idea of a Marshall Plan for Mexico into circulation, to suggest another way to deal with the disparities along that border. I think it was Mexico's president Porfirio Diaz who said, "Poor Mexico -- so far from God, so close to the United States." Changing the dynamic of the relationship that inspired those words might help ward off some very ugly futures. <br><br>SJ, you're welcome and thank you! <br><br>Keith, glad to hear it. I'm aware that we may not have that much time, but it makes sense to sketch out options in case we do. Things are moving very quickly now -- I'll be posting something sometime soon about climate change, which is spinning out of control very rapidly at this point -- and so all our choices from here on out are gambles.<br><br>Elros, oh, I don't expect quarrels to arise immediately. It may wait, in fact, until both Putin and Xi have stepped down and someone else takes the helm in both countries. That said, remember how fast Russia and the United States went from allies to enemies after the Second World War! <br><br>Cat, that is to say, you've picked up all the usual talking points from the media and are chirping them back at me. Trump has already saved more working class jobs in the days since the election than Obama has done in eight years in office, you know.

I hate the feeling that, after I read this post, that I became for a second suspicious of it because it appeared that you did an effective rhetorical trick; first mocking the idea that The Archdruid Report and other similar blogs could be Russian sponsored, and then afterwards proposing the policy that the US should start a 'staged withdrawal of imperial overreach' which would directly benefit Russia (if only in the short term). Of course I realize that this suspicion is precisely the point of releasing the Washington Post list, but once the idea has been planted, you can't remove it from your mind. I'm sure you are expecting comments which accuse you of this. <br><br>I've anyway become suspicious over the years of the media because of how it often acts as a form of advertising (all the Best Of 2016 lists are out for films, books and music - go and buy them for Christmas!

The two suppositions in no way contradict each other.<br><br>The problem I see occurring here, and frankly why I have stopped reading most blogs, and am slowly losing faith in this one, is that there develops a tendency for substituting normal sources of information for what looks to me like uncritical acceptance of "alternative" sources strictly for their, well, alternativeness. I know it's a fine distinction to maintain, but the combination of credulity of pretty dubious sources with an unfortunate tendency to become rigidly attached to an internal narrative of one's own creation leads to a syndrome I've come to internally refer to, borrowing from our esteemed host, as "senility of the blogosphere." It's a echo-chamber path I've seen too many blogs go down. It's downright tragic to see in one I've come to value as highly as this one.<br><br>The "free press" guaranteed by the Bill of Rights is an institution which has always had it's flaws, and has hit some pretty deep lows during it's history. As I said, it often does a pretty bad job, but has generally served, to a discriminating reader, and in the long run, to give as fair and accurate a picture of reality as any institution ever devised for the purpose. Yes, there has always been a bias toward those with the resources to "buy ink by the barrel," but it has, over time, developed methods for sourcing information and ensuring some modicum of accuracy that is being lost in the "new" media.<br><br>Dare I say it's one of those human institutions that Burke would have defended?<br><br>One would be a fool to accept the narrative presented by any segment, or to make judgements on anything read or viewed in the media without ample time to digest and allow other evidence to be brought forth. But my experience is that some amount of thought and a wide enough availability of sources generally provides as accurate a picture as one could expect.

I would like to read your ideas of how they will come into play in the context of the impending collapse of US global hegemony.<br><br>Nukes:<br>I suspect that nuclear weapons make a total empire collapse (i.e. defeat on US soil) unlikely. The US may engage in some brinkmanship but will not actually fire any ICBMs in support of any proxy war. However, in the event of a Pearl Harbor-style invasion, all bets are off, and I'm sure Putin and Xi know this very well.<br><br>Corporations:<br>The effect is more difficult to predict, but I suspect that global corporate structure may allow the US to be economically subjugated while maintaining a political ruse of sovereignty. There is surprisingly little outrage (both in the status quo left and right, and among Trump supporters) against the ongoing cozy relationship between big business and government. With his appointment of Goldman Sachs' Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary, Trump is following directly in the footsteps of Clinton, Bush, and Obama with nary a finger pointed. When you couple this with the exponential trend of Chinese buyouts of US corporations, it is not difficult to foresee a future where Chinese-Russian interests guide Washington decisionmaking, with no military defeat or direct government meddling. I also see it as likely that any prolonged economic depression in the US will be ended not by a make-work program from the bankrupt US government, but rather by the employment of underutilized, cheap US labor by foreign-based multinational corporations with more or less the same effect.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c128425620026745374 title="comment permalink">11/30/16, 10:38 PM</a><br><br>

As often stated on this blog, you don't need a conspiracy as an explanation when incompetence suffices. The EU has done a remarkable job of destabilizing itself through their handling of the Euro-crises.

Sometimes many of them in one song! So "Bill Monroe for Breakfast", which describes a happy rural family listening to the radio, is in this category. This allows the 'higbrow' listener to show off his/her knowlege of the traditions.<br><br>B) 'Lowbrow trash' describes depression era rural life (trains, moonshine, fiddle music, Mom's cooking, willing country lasses) as completely positive. The 'lowbrow' listener enjoys happy distraction from the reality of current rural living.<br><br>C) 'Middlebrow' describes the same as above, but with a mix of tragedy, or going home to find the old home empty. The 'Middlebrow' listener gets the full nostalgia package, and a distraction from the reality of current city living.<br><br>D) Murder fantasy, fictional descriptions of killing a spouse/lover and burrying him/her somewhere.

I was a fairly early member of Jackpine Radicals (JPR), a site that made the WaPo list. JPR was formed by a small group of "BernieBros" who were being slowly evicted from the Clinton-sponsored Democratic Underground (DU). JPR was dedicated to getting Bernie nominated and, failing that, pushing his policies. Shortly after the election, in the wake of the DU hack, JPR was overrun by suddenly homeless Hillary-voters and supporters in what appears to have been a coordinated coup involving "sleepers" and the owners. The "BernieBros" who had dared to strategically vote Trump in order to keep Clinton's warmongering out of the WH are now only welcome there by censorship. The most rational and well-reasoned of the moderators was removed from his duties and replaced by 2 newcomer Hillary-supporters. And so a core group of Berniebros -- the very ones who want to work with Trump where we can -- have been effectively silenced at JPR.<br><br>Iow, the 2000 or so Bernie supporters I personally know of are in disarray and there appears to only be a small core (~50 that I know of so far, although I suspect more within the overall group) who have re-grouped elsewhere to push working with Trump and staying focused on issues rather than personalities.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c7905127389950099643 title="comment permalink">12/1/16, 4:44 AM</a><br><br>

While reading I sparked back to a presentation given by an English historian who was speaking on the Gulf War at our local college. He predicted the neo-cons had over-reached, and would usher in the end of the American Empire. He talked about what that same experience meant to England post WW11, and his final comment was, "Relax, you'll get over it. Life goes on and can be lived well.".<br><br>I wanted to reply to two posters, Pygmycory and Ghung. Cory....I live on the BC Coast (Sayward). I have made two predictions over the years...one, that Northern Gateway would not be approved, mostly because of the Haida and their resolve. Two, that Trudeau would do as he was told and squeeze in the Kindedr Morgan twinning to Burnaby. I now will risk another prediction. I believe that the only pipelines that will be built will be the enlarged/revamped to Wisconsin, and a new version of Keystone XL. Trump/Pence will push the Keystone through. I believe that Vancouver area protestors and local Natives will stop the Kinder Morgan push west. Oh, it might be started in Alberta, but it will never be finished. It will make the Clayquot logging shutdown of the '90s look like childs play. When Burnaby's mayor talks of laying down in front of dozers.... And don't forget the Ernie Creys of the world. First Nations (Coast Bands) will go nuts about this. Plus, there are so many folks these days not working, manning the blockades 24/7 is not an issue.

I won't deny his regime did some pretty horrible things, but many people in and out of the media have talked about his actions as the height of atrocities while ignoring the fact that US imperialism easily caused more death and suffering in latin america alone. You can see that many in that region agree by the way they responded to his death. Noam Chomsky recently argued that the reason the US had moved to normalize relations was because it had become so ostracized from the rest of the Americas and was in danger of being shut out of regional conferences etc. I'm curious how well you think Cuba is set up to deal with peak oil and the other crises we face.

It seems like there’s a distinct possibility we may have avoided a Twilight’s Last Gleaming style crisis in exchange for something else. But what does that say for the stack of dominoes that is connected to American power in the rest of the world? One of the major arms of the US Military Industrial Complex has been NATO, and the Western Empire has been not just US led but has been led by a dominant alliance of North America and Western Europe (which is of course experiencing its own internal strain re: Brexit). Would a shift of US policy toward more domestic concerns and towards a deepened diplomatic relationship with Russia strain the US relationship with the other NATO member nations?<br><br>The other thing that’ll be curious is the role that an ascendant Russia and a declining US would have in shaping the future of the United Nations. I recall during the election campaign, leaders in the UN being concerned about the possibility of a Trump presidency bringing the US closer to Russia and thereby deflating the major backing to a lot of their posturing towards Russia in recent years. I know they’ve been a big supporter of some of America’s more aggressive policies towards Russia, such as the no fly zone over Syria, sanctions regarding Russian control of Crimea, etcetera and has been a vocal critic of Russian foreign policy, while being fairly supportive of whatever the US does, so which is the more likely outcome there? Will it push Russia to the center of UN international policy, or will the balance of power remain more or less the same with the US pushed to the same fringe Russia currently occupies in the UN, being subject to international sanctions and having peacekeeping forces sent to settle internal disputes (I’ve already heard talk about the possibility of UN peacekeeping forces being sent to Standing Rock if that situation isn’t resolved peacefully).<br><br>And then, of course, there’s the fate of the United States’ own internal empire: both the economic power exerted by the coasts on the south and Midwest, and the overt colonization that continues to be exerted on the First Nations peoples. How long can that continue? There are definitely some precariously stacked cards ready to fall in the Post-American Century.<br><br>Re: The Washington Post article: One of the things I found most interesting about that was the way it targeted not only right wing news sites, and crazy conspiracy theory sites, but also websites devoted to various new-age and earth-centered alternative spiritualities.<br><br>Re: News: Which international news sites would you say are the most reliable? (Russian propaganda or not, I wouldn’t exactly consider anything from that list a reliable news source… at best they’re useful for tasting the winds of popular opinion.) But a lot of international news sites I’ve looked at just copy and paste from CNN and translate it, are so focused on local news that I can’t glean much that’s directly useful to me all the way over here, or is every bit as or even more hot-headed opinion laden than what I find over here. I’ve found an Egyptian news site that has lengthy, thorough stories with lots of background that I glean for a lot of my international news, but that’s not much diversity.

Also, I recall you saying that US national debt should be regarded as tribute as well, as its repayment is only lip service.

The danger is that most people just look for a leader, or savior to relieve them of their suffering. In a sense, take the easy way out and don't undertake the hard work of educating themselves to the things that really matter. I see the Trump presidency as a long needed opening, however small or fragile, to begin to broaden the meaningful discourse so badly needed in American society. This dialog of ideas and understanding is the only force that can begin to reduce the neocon influence that is destroying the country. In the meantime, find truth and carry on.<br><br>I think you are correct that the MSM will not be the place where that dialog takes place. The first step in educating oneself is to unplug form the corporate propaganda machine, and many are discovering that pathway. The internet is currently providing an alternative outlet for information, but how long will that last? Seems like the combination of relentless neocons and the shortsightedness of multinational corporations are bent on locking down the flow of information or at the bare minimum, have the ability to shut it down at will. However disastrous and counterproductive this lockdown would be, I take some satisfaction in the though that public meetings to discuss and become more informed will return to prominence.<br><br>What will be interesting to watch is how Trump handles the public meetings he has scheduled and how those public appearances will change over time. Will they be chances to rally the strength of the population to achieve positive national goals for all, or will they be another form of social control, used by special interests to control the population and divert dissent. Corporations are not bad in themselves, it is what they are used for that is dangerous and destructive.<br><br>On a side note, I watched the explosion of Elon Musk's Space X rocket with Facebook's Satellite aboard as payload.

With an estimated now 1.8 million of us (which is about as dubious a counting as you'd expect of a group whose density among the population varies pretty widely according to state laws and doesn't much trust the government), we're pretty good at getting legislation passed and rejected by hassling, er, lobbying our state and federal legislators. We have group legal representation for many of us through HSLDA (which is unabashedly Christian of a particular stripe, and doesn't get anything like universal membership of home schoolers) which is important for folks going up on a shoestring against the government and big entrenched and well-funded interests (Teachers' Union). HSLDA used to be single-issue and it's been very disappointing to see them change. One key to their previous successes is that HSLDA uses many tiny subscription payments from individuals who want representation if they get taken to court over home schooling to provide representation for the few who do, not donations from other parties which is the current popular model.<br><br>Note that it's taken us since the seventies to get to where we are today. If there are shortcuts, I don't know what they are. But as an effective grassroots movement, it's a pretty well-recorded one, and I think could be copied by any one-issue group. (The idiots who want us to lobby about marriage, abortion, or whatever are trying to sow the seeds of destruction of the movement, and I don't think they even realize it.)

George Bush was the "guy you'd like to have a beer with", in contrast to Al Gore's wonky, unsmiling persona. Bush of course turned out to be a dim-witted substance abuser with little interest in the job he had for 8 years, just interrupting his many vacations to sign off on the PNAC agenda. In 2008 the president was marketed as a young, progressive outsider whose election would by itself signal that the nation had cleared a major hurdle. He's turned out to be just another Bush family adoptee, giving the treasury to the MIC and saddling us, probably permanently, with the worst healthcare system in history. But he has a photogenic family and soothing baritone, so shut up about the torture and drones! I hope that at some point real news sources overtake TV and print propaganda with respect to influence on actual issues, but it's a long way off IMO.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c4032828146355392470 title="comment permalink">12/1/16, 10:42 AM</a><br><br>

From the Assyrian empire to the classic hyperinflation of Zimbabwe: it is all a swirling, kaleidoscopic show that is both viewed as entertainment and feared as calamity by the audience, most of whom are completely unaware that they themselves are the playwright, actors, set designers and director of this bizarre reality show. But just who are the producers of this clever sparkle and flash that so engrosses and enthralls the wide eyed and utterly susceptible audience? Ahh, now THAT is a subject ripe for playwright's quill! If our hero is to drain the swamp, must he not first discover the identity of thr swamp's creator? It's financiers? After all, swords cannot put paid to shadows, nor can arrows pierce the black heart of smoke. The villain of the piece must whip aside his cloak and be revealed for catharsis to reign victorious; for the curtain to fall to tumultuous applause. If the actors are but paid marionettes, the script but false and hollow chatter then the work will have been in vain, the reviews merciless, the investors ruined, the theater darkened. The answer, of course, is as old as the history in which we are enmeshed. He who pays the piper calls the tune, as it were. In our present, but fleeting, moment in the arc of history, look to that merry band of ancient money lenders and war mongers currently known as "neocons" to raise the curtain, light the stage and pen the vain but innocuous line that our actors will mouthe. Oh, the swords and arrows, the screams and the spurting blood are real enough, the hapless victims quite dead indeed, the cacophonous cries of mourning true in timbre. The audience, however, sees only a play; a momentary diversion from their soft and silky lives of warm hearth and fortress keep. They cannot hear the distant approach of their own brief strutting turn churning the dust, coming down the darkened road.

I followed the US elections closely and was appalled by the coverage of the mainstream media which systemically failed to report key issues which should have been discussed and was totally hostile to the Trump campaign. It was embarrassing.<br><br>Personally, i follow a broad spectrum of media sources, including foreign media like the Guardian, Spiegel, Telegraph, Spectator, New Statesman, Breibart and Politico as well as "alternative" sources like the World Socialist Web Site, zero hedge and financial sense. Interestingly, I have found the business online sources (Reuters, Bloomberg and FT) as a more reliable source of coverage of politics than the traditional legacy media like the New York Times etc.<br><br>I suspect that the slightly more balanced coverage of the business geared media is because their clients require accurate reporting of politics as it plays a key role in investment and financial decision making! For those, on this blog, who have criticized John's critical comments on legacy media, I suggest you have misunderstand his point. <br><br>The point is to take a critical but open minded viewpoint on all news media used, whether it is legacy or alternative. Blindly following a particular strand of "alternative" news reporting is just as unhealthy as religiously believing whatever corporate spin the NYT or Washington Post publishes on a daily basis.<br><br>Regarding your interesting geopolitical analysis on the state of the American empire, i fully agree. President elect Trump has a great opportunity to reshape foreign policy and make a start on a partial withdrawal of American global commitments, something I have predicted on my forecasting blog, here;<br><br>https://forecastingintelligence.org/2016/09/24/the-global-implications-of-a-trump-presidency/<br><br>Contrary to some on this forum, I am cautiously optimistic about Trump. Clearly he needs to keep his cards to his chest as he hasn't been formally inaugurated yet and he is aware that the Deep State's tentacles roam deep. However, the early signs are positive, with the scrapping of the trans-pacific trade deal a strong sign that Trump means what he says and is prepared to take on the vested Washington interests.<br><br>I also see that Trump is starting to deliver on his commitment to help the Rust Belt. Those who sneer at his attempts to save jobs should re reminded that President Obama during 8 years in office made little to no attempt to protect jobs for American workers. It looks like Trump will try and help the Rust Belt communities who got him elected.<br><br>So, its early days but so far it appears promising. <br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c8421603984546079848 title="comment permalink">12/1/16, 12:59 PM</a><br><br>

As it happens, though, I haven't yet been accused of being a Putinist fellow traveler, or what have you. <br><br>HalFiore, if you read my post as an attack on the existence of a free press, you misread it. My point is precisely that the US mainstream media has fallen down on the job and is no longer fulfilling its traditional role; that's why people are paying less and less attention to it. I'd honestly prefer to see the media doing its job -- that is to say, reporting and analysis, rather than cheerleading for whoever pays the most. <br><br>Clay, Krugman is amazing, and I don't mean that in a good way. I read him when I'm not sure how far elite cluelessness can go. <br><br>Vedant, true enough.<br><br>HalFiore, I agree -- some standards must be maintained. It's because the mainstream US media has failed to maintain even the most basic standards that people are turning to other sources to get the information and analysis they need. That's all I'm saying. <br><br>Warren, exactly. It's precisely because Americans have convinced themselves that they don't have an empire that they manage their empire so badly. <br><br>HalFiore, if the AP has been saying that, it's news to me -- I don't read US media unless I can help it. I simply added together the death of the TPP and the two big corporations that have cancelled their offshoring projects, compared it to the big fat nothing the working class has gotten from Obama, and drew the logical conclusion. If that offends you, sorry, but there it is. <br><br>Look sie, oh, granted, there's a lot to worry about in the bizarreries Armata quoted.

Could our empire devolve productively?<br><br>Still, I'm waiting for (perhaps I missed it) one of your cogent analyses about how Trump, Putin, Xi and all their pals are part of a trans-national global elite. I believe that a different wealth-pump will occur in which the basically stateless global elites maintain their cushy lifestyles against all others, similar to what the elite Mayans did in a time of great drought. <br><br>The web of billionaire funding --including the astroturf tea party supported by the Kochs, and media outlets such as Breitbart funded in large part by the Mercer family,among other things--that got Trump elected, and the fact that now they and other fossil fuel/wall street interests have got people being assigned to significant government positions is telling. <br><br>The idea seems to be that they can "adapt" to and possibly "exploit" climate change, and thus can continue enriching themselves by working really hard to exacerbate it--and who cares about all the regular folks deeply affected by it.

The devolution of the US empire, if it happens by force, will be a matter of proxy wars and regime change operations, along the lines I sketched out in <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i>. As for multinational corporations, I disagree with the standard analysis that sees them as major players in their own right. Look back at the way that Russia poleaxed foreign multinationals, and you see the wave of the future. <br><br>Kristofv, agreed -- it's a tossup between them, and I don't imagine the rude awakening is going to be welcome in either case. <br><br>Chevalier, heh indeed. <br><br>Ramaraj, why, I couldn't possibly recommend that any of my readers do that, could I? ;-)<br><br>Grisom, thank you -- I'll give it a look as time permits. <br><br>Phil, also a possibility! <br><br>David, understood. Please note that I didn't say that all blogs, or even most of them, offer accurate reporting and thoughtful analysis. I said that people were turning to blogs to get those things, because increasingly they can't be found in the mainstream US media. Of course it's buyer beware in the blogosphere, with inaccurate stories all over the place -- but the same thing's true on the mainstream news media here. <br><br>Fred, that sounds like a very good project for the new year! <br><br>Jerry, it's not a matter of withdrawing from empire or not doing so -- at this point, it's a matter of doing so voluntarily in a controlled fashion, or doing it involuntarily as a consequence of sudden crisis, very possibly with next to no warning at all. Given the choice, the controlled withdrawal is much less disruptive. One way or another, it's going to be a rough road -- the question is purely how to make it a little less rough than it will otherwise be. <br><br>Kevin, I'll consider that. <br><br>Paulo, exactly. It's a normal historical process, and can be made easier or harder, but one way or another most of us will live through it. <br><br>Christopher, that's a good point. Of course the difference between recycling surpluses in a Marshall Plan and recycling them via Wall Street is that in the former case, you actually produce something other than profits, and the result is increased economic stability; in the latter, you feed speculative bubbles and that's it, resulting in instability. I hope the Chinese are paying attention to the distinction.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c8625640942698834161 title="comment permalink">12/1/16, 1:38 PM</a><br><br>

I recall someone saying something about a mote in your brother's eye and a beam in your own...<br><br>Sleisz Ádám, oh, granted. Again, though, it's not a matter of whether we retreat from empire, it's a matter of whether we do it via deliberate withdrawal or sudden collapse. <br><br>Averagejoe, I'm aware of that. We had a choice earlier this month between one candidate who offered lip service to climate change and another who was open about ignoring it. Since nobody in American public life is willing to talk about what's going to have to happen to stop dumping CO2 into the atmosphere, we're going to face the kind of mess I've discussed repeatedly in this blog -- and neither party's candidate in the election would have done a thing about it. <br><br>SCA Heretic, I spend time with a lot of working class guys these days, and all of them are Trump supporters; I've also met a lot of Clinton supporters who not only have never had a conversation with someone in the working class, but talk about the American working class in terms I can only describe as hate speech. Your mileage may vary, but that's been my experience, and that's what was behind my comment. <br><br>Elros, they don't need to fight.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c135458928123240290></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/05603392775011807948 rel=nofollow>tolkienguy</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Nice essay, JMG!<br><br>I still think you are being a little too sanguine about Trump though. Overturning the entrenched status quo in favor of some other ideal requires one to have, well, ideals in the first place, and Trump has shown no sign of that. Furthermore, if you look at his prior business career, he actually doesn't show many signs of being a good businessman-he started off with a fair bit of property from his Dad and managed to go bankrupt three times. Indeed, the only thing he's shown above average-and indeed, I would say genius-level-skills at is generating good publicity for himself. This article actually gives a pretty good look into his personality:<br>http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all<br><br>Quite frankly, the man shows no sign of being committed to any ideals, much less the decidedly counter-mainstream ones presented here (not using this term as an insult-I consider myself very counter-mainstream). On the other hand, he shows a great ability to figure out what people want to hear, say it, and thus get them to go along with him. Even on foreign policy he's been rather inconsistent-he's espoused isolationism at times, but at other times talks about "bombing ISIS into the stone age". Quite frankly, I don't think he has any real idea of what he's going to do after he takes the oath, and (much like Bush), is going run a rather confused, directionless foreign policy until some clique of advisors gains his confidence, and thus control over his actions. With Bush, it happened due to 9/11. Don't know when it will happen with Trump, but I'm sure it will happen, and I think there's a better than even chance the winning clique will be very neoconservative in flavor. As to why I think this, here's another good article, this one from the (Hehe) Badenovsphere.<br>http://www.unz.com/pgiraldi/iranophobes-on-parade/<br><br>Basically, that article is about how a lot of Trump's "Pro-Russian" advisors are also really, really anti-Iranian-and thing is, Iran has become about as important to Russia over the last few years as Saudi Arabia is to the US. Cutting Iran loose would cost Russia a lot of influence in the Middle East, without any immediate way to gain it back. What happens when Trump gets into office, cancels the Iran nuclear deal, and draws us into an escalating game of brinkmanship with Iran, with Russia siding with the Ayatollahs? To refer to Twilight's Last Gleaming, Trump looks like a very good candidate for Jamison Weed.<br><br>And also, his treasury secretary is a Goldman Sachs alum. Do you really think a Goldman Sachs alum is going to reinstate Glass-Steagal? This is starting to look like a re-run of a story we've seen very recently, which started when a legion of puppy-eyed young idealists, including myself, marched into voting booths across the country to propel Mr. Hopenchange to the Oval Office. I think its going to end the same way too.<br><br>One last thing-please do that climate change blog post. Surely you've heard what almost happened to Gatlinburg a couple days ago? Having been there, I wouldn't have mourned its destruction too much-it's a tourist trap of the worst kind-but it was still quite shocking, and the drought the South has been having contributed to it. Not to mention the "thousand year flood" that befell my birth city of Columbia last year-all of these things may have a natural cause, but we're seeing way to many of them for my taste.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c135458928123240290 title="comment permalink">12/1/16, 4:08 PM</a><br><br>

One way or another, Europe is going to have to cover the cost of its own defense, and so it's no wonder they're upset -- the relatively lavish welfare states of northern and central European nations are only affordable because the US pays for their defense. The UN -- well, we'll see what happens to it. As for news sources, I use a very broad range of non-US websites, depending on the subject. I like to balance competing biases against each other -- for example, in international events, compare what BBC and RT have to say, then bring in a couple of news sites from the countries actually affected, and draw your own conclusions; the results seem to reflect what's actually happening tolerably well. <br><br>Karim, his chief of staff apparently already holds that opinion, so a telegraph may not be necessary. <br><br>Jay Dee, the tribute economy is going away one way or another. It can be closed off in a deliberate fashion, giving the US economy some time to adjust, or it can be cut off by sudden crisis, but one way or another it's ending -- the abandonment of the dollar as the medium for international exchange, and its replacement by bilateral currency deals, has been signalling that one for years now. Thus you're quite correct; the tribute economy is ending, and the coastal cities of the US that have thrived on it are going to be in a world of hurt in the decades ahead. <br><br>Dammerung, maybe the frog god did it. Have you considered the possibility that the deity in question might actually be the Great Old One Tsathoggua? ;-)<br><br>DaShui, fascinating. If they go ahead with that, it might actually help, too! <br><br>Mark, the reason Les Deplorables get it is simply that the contrast between what the media says and what they see around themselves in flyover country is too vast to be ignored. In the bicoastal bubble, it's still possible to mistake the media's story for a vague reflection of fact. <br><br>NZ, exactly. It really is anyone's guess how this is going to play out, but at least the bipartisan neoconservative consensus seems to be cracking at last. <br><br>Christopher, square on target. Yes, exactly. <br><br>BoysMom, that's an excellent point, and thank you for bringing it up. Anyone else interested in learning how to organize to make change happen, instead of simply waving signs and being ignored? Here's your example.<br><br>Jason, well, we'll see, won't we? <br><br>N=ro, no doubt! <br><br>DE Prof, oh, granted. Listening to people rabbit on about this or that candidate's personality makes me roll my eyes. As I noted earlier, I couldn't care less about what kind of person a candidate is; I want to know how he or she will vote on the issues that matter to me.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c8110549872778438680 title="comment permalink">12/1/16, 4:10 PM</a><br><br>

You mentioned offlist that your earlier attempt to post this didn't go through; oddly enough, when I scroll up between Cat and Neil above, there it is. Is it still not there when you check? <br><br>Onething, of course it is. That's why satire is an appropriate first counterstrike -- the one thing I can do at this stage of the game is to assist Pravda on the Potomac to make a fool of itself publicly. (Not that this is hard, mind you.) If it accelerates, I (along with other bloggers who are or might be targeted) can move to other tactics. <br><br>Karl, a nice colorful bit of rhetoric. Thank you. <br><br>William, thanks for this! Glad to see the magazines starting to return fire. <br><br>Bill, and if Sanders and other Democrats who are opposed to militarism, destructive trade agreements, and some of the other issues involved work with the incoming administration, they may well be able to get some quid pro quo on other issues important to them. That's how politics used to be done, before it froze up into gridlock. <br><br>Pygmycory, well, there you are. <br><br>RAnderson, er, you forgot to mention the death of TPP, which would have accelerated offshoring, and Ford's decision not to offshore one of its production lines to Mexico. <br><br>Lordberia, I'm neither optimistic nor pessimistic about Trump. I think it's reasonable to wait and see what he actually does in office before passing judgment. Some of the actions he's already taken seem very promising to me, others are disappointing -- but that's par for the course. As quite a number of others have commented, at least we seem to have dodged a shooting war in Syria...<br><br>Ursachi, that's a very good point. Western Europe may suffer as a result of a US pullout, but eastern Europe might benefit quite a bit. <br><br>RAnderson, I never said he was a friend of unions. I said that he was going to benefit the working class. Cynical or not, he's not stupid; if he wants to be reelected in 2010, and all the evidence suggests he does, benefiting the working class is his ticket to a landslide. <br><br>Adrian, I'm far from sure I agree with that analysis. While there's a class of rich people who think of themselves as a transnational global elite, I've come to think that they have much less power than you or they believe, and they -- like pampered aristocracies more than once in the past -- may find that a new and more muscular ruling class has shouldered them aside.

We'll see how that plays out. <br><br>Raymond, and now a second magazine returning fire! Interesting. <br><br>Inohuri, yes, but the geopolitics works either way. <br><br>Clay, oh bright gods. So the Democrats, who just lost one election by spending all year screaming insults at people who voted for their guy in 2008, are now going to double down by screaming insults at a generational demographic they've got to win over to their side if they're ever going to win again? I'm beginning to wonder if the Democratic Party has a death wish...<br><br>Gwizard43, in Britain's case they were pressured into it by the US. China's another matter -- I don't know the literature well enough to be able to say what drove it. Hmm -- I foresee a lot of reading ahead.<br><br>David, exactly! Congratulations; you win tonight's gold star for getting it. Good luck with the upcoming campaign. <br><br>Tolkienguy, as I noted in response to an earlier comment on this post, I'm neither optimistic nor pessimistic about Trump; I'm willing to see what he does once he actually gets into the White House. Given the ratio of heat to light in the media about him right now, I know that's rare. As for climate change, it's in process; the short version is that we were locked into drastic climate change by the time Obama finished his first term, and it's already happening.

"Malaise" went down as a precedent never to be repeated! Have things really changed that much, JMG, since "malaise" that we're willing to take another look at calls to shared sacrifice? BTW, are Trump's videos a modern-day form of FDR's "fireside chats"?<br>Regarding Mexico, is it really that bad? I thought they were doing better than us, economically.

I think it was fair to point out that, actually I can now say all of the news items you cited have been reported extensively and not particularly critically by rock solid mainstays of the "MSM." If you did not know that because you make it a practice not to expose yourself to the media that, after all, still bring most people their news, well, all I can say is that it's hardly an excuse. Especially when you are lambasting them for the quality of the news they report, apparently sight unseen.<br><br>Here's the site I usually start with, mainly because my internet connection is data-limited and it's easy on that resource: http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/fronts/HOME?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME<br><br>Nothing sexy, edgy, alterntivy, or groovy in any way. Just the boring old AP feed that supplies front pages in communities all over the country.

Latching onto news and commentary from sources which have few verifiable credentials other than the ability to open a blogspot account, while willfully ignoring more traditional sources seems to me to be a recipe for a narrow type of groupthink to emerge. Add to that being cheered by near-sycophantic followers every week, and it's not hard to see how a lot of dubious answers could begin to make sense.<br><br>I did not think for a minute that your criticism was of a "free press." It's a lack of discrimination and critical questioning I'm concerned about.<br><br>I'm just reporting what I have seen in various online "communities," becoming ingrown to the point of the hall of mirrors I think I might have alluded to.

I wouldn't mind, were the possibility not so unlikely, getting a position at a think tank or developing strategy and legislative proposals for somebody who might actually do something with it, but electoral politics? That's way outside my skill set. I'd be miserably bad at it, not to mention miserable. <br><br>Mario, I know there's going to be a lot of resistance. Still, the common sense of today's politics was once the ravings of some eccentric out on the fringe.<br><br>Shane, you don't present it as malaise. You present it, as FDR and Churchill did, as everyone standing up and doing their part in the face of an imminent threat, and you frame it as heroism, not as cardigan-wearing dorkhood. (Not that I have anything against cardigans, mind you.) As for Mexico, well, the regular readership of this blog has fair number of citizens of Mexico, so I'll toss the question their way: are there ample jobs at decent pay available for the Mexican working class now? <br><br>Dammerung, I've been there rather more than once; I lurk on a lot of unlikely forums, all across the political, cultural, and social spectrum of the net. It's a useful way of gauging the state of collective consciousness, which is a lot of what I use for my predictions. As for an OP, hmm. No time soon -- I'm up to my eyeballs as usual, this time finishing another Latin translation -- but I may consider it at some point. <br><br>David, yep -- nailed it. <br><br>LatheChuck, good. A historical parallel is always welcome here. Now we'll see whether it continues to follow that curve. <br><br>Armata, no argument there.

The ecstatic identification of followers with a leader they think can do no wrong, to the extent that their identities merge into that of the leader....where have we heard of that before? <br><br>HalFiore, so noted, but you've missed the point of my response. I don't get my news from blogs. I sometimes use aggregator blogs on specific themes to direct me to news stories -- the latest climate change news, for example, shows up much more regularly on certain blogs than in the mainstream media -- but most of my news comes from overseas news media that still maintain some degree of integrity. I do visit US news media from time to time, as I've pointed out here, so my criticism isn't "sight unseen," as you claim; I do it when I want to find out what the party line is this week, and then go elsewhere to find out what actually happened. <br><br>Thus I didn't happen to catch the story you mentioned; I was probably too busy watching Trump play the media like a fiddle -- this latest business about flag-burning, for example, was great political theater, not least because Clinton cosponsored a bill in the Senate calling for exactly the same thing, and Trump has therefore set his critics up for another round of charges of hypocrisy.

I hope he manages to pull the Dems' collective head out of an anatomically unlikely orifice. <br><br>Zach, of course I realize that. That wasn't my point. A thousand people who were going to lose their jobs still have them; the community in which most of them live will now be able to keep its stores and bars and public schools open -- and to most of the people that are affected by that, <i><b>that's all that matters</b></i>. If you want to get them to care about regressive tax systems, you have to meet the needs of their day to day survival first. It astonishes me that so many people on the left seem to have lost track of that.

You've actually clarified something for me; I've been watching the histrionics, the narcissistic insistence that every vote against Clinton was a vote personally and deliberately directed against each individual who supported her, and the rest of it, and wondering about the sources of it. Of course you're right; the culture of egolatry, the overt worship of the individual's ego as God (or Goddess) that's become pervasive in quite a few corners of US pop culture, has got to play a significant role there. <br><br>Arnold, I'll consider that. <br><br>Kfish, good heavens.

It came to me to imagine the reaction of a professional class black man with the same amount of mileage on him as our poster above in 2008, if Obama had lost. <br><br>He would not, of course, have used the hyper-emotional girly-girl language seen in that link, nor the Feeling Type identification of "I am him and he is me." But if the same sort of parade of, in this case, race-based insults, missed opportunities, and being in physical danger just going about his business hadn't flooded his mind, I'd be greatly surprised. IF it hadn't his his gut as hard, I'd have been surprised. <br><br>Of course, he'd have expressed it in more properly masculine language, and probably a lot more profanely, than our blogger above, but the reaction would have been similar. Perhaps somewhat more cynical. <br><br>And the intense ethnically based identification with public figures isn't all that off track. Remember when minority kids were kept in line by "Anything one of ours does wrong reflects on all of us? And will bring negative consequences down upon us?" I certainly remember Jewish kids being kept in line that way, back in the day! So that one flamboyant fraudster going to jail would have a whole bunch of people feeling the stigma. <br><br>Finally, let me note that feeling type females do often tend to exactly that sort of extravagance of speech and feeling of emotional identification - you see it most clearly in the area of love and romance, to the bafflement and dismay of their practical or rational type partners, but it is a recognized expressive style of my own sex. And, let me add, a lot more socially acceptable than the flood of profanity a man might express parallel feelings with. <br><br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c1776660053311160696 title="comment permalink">12/2/16, 10:08 AM</a><br><br>

I was disappointed to see Pelosi reelected House leader, though not surprised, and we'll see how the Senate shakes out. Of course, it's hard to tell which direction all this will take until Trump actually takes office and begins work with Republican majority. There's still SO MUCH that's unknown right now, it's almost impossible to see the course of all this. On top of that, I wouldn't be surprised to see a major crisis--most likely economic, but there are plenty of sketchy variables lurking out there right now--throwing a wrench in everything at some point over the next four years. It sure will be interesting!<br><br>Regardless, I plan to apply my small bit of pressure here from the left and keep a sharp eye out for whatever openings there are. If they pop up at other points of the political spectrum in which I'm comfortable entering, I'm not afraid to shift around a bit. But my affinity still lies more on the leftward end of things, so I'll work on making my mark over here for the time being. In the meantime, I'm keeping my eye on some of the more interesting upcoming members of the party. I have more to say in my comment to Shane below, but I'm more intrigued by Tulsi Gabbard all the time; my best way-out-on-a-limb guess at this point is that she runs in 2024, most likely after a second Trump term.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c504354729235425593 title="comment permalink">12/2/16, 10:58 AM</a><br><br>

Sending that on to Sanders with a not that I supported his campaign and am open to supporting him again in 2020 if I feel it's worth it, and should he run (probably a long shot) would be a good idea, so thanks for that.<br><br>I've been watching Sanders' moves with interest. He seems to be bouncing around a bit and I'm curious to see where he settles. I don't know if he has any thoughts of running in 2020--I kind of wonder if even he knows right now--but if he does, that certainly complicates his path a bit. And even if he doesn't, I imagine he wants to see someone new in office come January 2021, so he's likely trying to figure out how best to move with Trump on issues he can get behind and how best to oppose him at the same time. That's a tricky balancing act.<br><br>On a somewhat related note, I continue to watch Tulsi Gabbard with a <i>lot</i> of interest. Her recent unapologetic meeting with Trump and her involvement in the Standing Rock showdown is intriguing. She's clearly aiming to go national and I'll be shocked if she's not running for President at some point in the next several cycles. I'm just curious how quickly she'll throw her hat in the ring and what path she settled on to get there; the usual ascension up the ranks, in which case she would need to angle for a Senate position, Governorship, or some kind of national appointment, or just a jump straight from the House now that Trump has blown the lid off the idea that you have to first hold one of those higher positions before you can run? I wouldn't be at all surprised to see her running in 2024. Heck, I'd be impressed with the chutzpah but wouldn't rule out 2020 if Trump implodes, though I somewhat doubt he will.<br><br>As for your concern on his cabinet, I don't disagree. On the other hand, I want to see what they all do. The thing is, Trump essentially is an Independent, even if he ran as a Republican. He has to build his cabinet out of something, and the likelihood that it isn't going to involve a fair number of people already in positions of power is unlikely. The question really becomes whether or not they go in and exert power reflective of their own stances and ideology, or if they follow instructions from on high.<br><br>I still think Trump is a very smart politician with a solid grasp of the views of much of this country and a desire to remain popular for various reasons: reelection, legacy, pure ego. He's working with a Republican party establishment that overtly supports a number of policies that, if enacted, would likely reign fire on them from a lot of voters. So what's he going to do?<br><br>It's going to be a <i>very</i> interesting four years. I hope in more good ways than bad, but we'll see.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c9058765837132852065 title="comment permalink">12/2/16, 10:58 AM</a><br><br>

They still haven't established anything resembling a united vision. The main opposition ideology is entrenched in the ideology of western liberalism, and is dying a slow painful death. The ideology in power is entrenched in a desire to industrialize along Japanese or Chinese lines. Until there's a rise of a different economic ideology, and a focus on integrating local government with the national, I wouldn't expect India to be a major international player. India is also entering it's first 80 year crisis, so whatever comes out the other end is going to determine the role they play. <br><br>Regards,<br><br>Varun<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c6427994951239112602 title="comment permalink">12/2/16, 10:58 AM</a><br><br>

There's a problem of statistics spinning, where Government claims to have created record number of jobs in some period of time, but reality has more to do with companies poaching skilled workers from each other, or other cases where there are layoffs and most affected workers do actually find jobs elsewhere (usually at lower pay). The point being that the government counts how many new jobs are created, but not how many where lost. Still better than the most economically depressed areas in the USA, but not a panacea.<br><br>What there is, is a huge informal economy; old data claimed it was about 1/3 the size of the formal economy, so I'd not surprised if it was about 1/2 by now. People coming back from the US do have at least some savings, that can be stretched to live for several months here (in my town, USD$1,000 per month is a profesional or low-level manager's salary), they usually have better skills and attitude than the locals (having added to the baseline Mexicat traits everything they learned while working abroad), there's also their network of friends and relatives that pass word around and allow them to establish themselves as freelance workers. <br><br>There's also the issue of cost of living. If you are already unemployed or struggling to bring in enough business to stay afloat, it makes no sense to remain in the high cost town and see your hard earned dollars evaporate. You go back to your parent's town and wait for the storm to pass (or so would think anyone who thinks the US downturn is a temporary thing).<br><br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c3742427853684358732 title="comment permalink">12/2/16, 11:01 AM</a><br><br>

With the Cold War over and Europe sliding rapidly downhill, there is nothing *really* important at stake for the United States in Europe, so a deal with Russia makes sense there. Besides, the U.S. can still maintain a foothold by making a deal with a post-Brexit Britain. Even in the Middle East it makes a certain sense to deal with Ivan, since most "U.S. allies" are conspiring against both America and Russia (Saudi, Qatar, Turkey). More genuine U.S. allies such as Israel and Egypt already have good relations with Russia, so Trump can simply jump onto the bandwagon! <br><br>I suspect the real challenge will come in East Asia. For a protectionist America, confrontation with China makes sense - but the Chinese already call most of the shots, don´t they? Just now, Trump called the president of Taiwan to express his support, but I suspect most Taiwanese would be perfectly happy with Taiwan gaining "special status" á la Hong Kong within a state capitalist/dirigiste China. South Korea is also developing strong economic ties with China, despite their conflict with pro-Chinese North Korea. Within a decade or so, the U.S. might loose both Taiwan, South Korea and the Philippines, making those shipping lines impossible to defend. (This will also affect Japan, of course.) Another U.S. ally that might go all-Chinese would be Thailand, due to their conflicts with anti-Chinese Vietnam. <br><br>Thus, it seems as if Trump´s protectionism (not bad in itself) might lead to world war with China (which would be bad)! Hopefully, some ingenious solution to this can be found, benefitting both the budding Celestial Empire and the jaded American one. Otherwise, we´re headed for interesting times... <br><br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c2050021508782545951 title="comment permalink">12/2/16, 6:48 PM</a><br><br>

Then there´s the environmental destruction in China, which may make them dependent on food imports through those shipping lanes. India and Japan are obvious enemies of China, with Russia as a potential enemy, especially since the Chinese are colonizing their Far East!

I have travelled around a lot of Asia and twenty years ago I would not have written that about Melbourne. Sorry mate. And I believe that the Chinese have purchased the Port of Darwin which is next to that of a US base which is manned I believe about six months of every year, as I understand things. And the Chinese own a whole lot of other crucial infrastructure down here too. The ground has shifted. We have always had overlords down here dictating policy since the Europeans first landed. There was recently a Federal politician down here who was busted publicly for being on the take from the Chinese, and I was personally surprised by how cheap he came and he was quite well spoken too which surprised me. Apparently the give away was that he was spruiking the South China Sea business, but my take on that was that he was thrown to the wolves as a diversion tactic. That is what it looks like to me anyway. My perspective on the matter was that he was an idiot, because I'd heard him speak and he didn't sound stupid.<br><br>In another truly astounding failure of the infrastructure down here: <a href=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-02/alcoa-curtails-production-at-portland-smelter/8085840 rel=nofollow>Alcoa curtails Aluminium production at Portland smelter after power failure</a>. Call me suspicious, but I also read an article spruiking the benefits of closing down that smelter due to the benefits of reduced of carbon dioxide emissions, and it is worthwhile mentioning that the town of Portland is located on a deep water harbour, but mate, it is in the middle of nowhere on a lonely stretch of coast. We appear to be being gutted at every opportunity and it sucks. Our leaders have no vision.<br><br>You don't have to go back too far to see that the state government was whingeing about the cost of subsidising the aluminium smelter either: <a href=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/massive-portland-smelter-risks-closure-as-losses-and-costs-surge-20160217-gmw82h.html rel=nofollow>Massive Portland smelter risks closure as losses and costs surge</a>.<br><br>The last Prime Minister down here who said: "I don't want to be the Prime Minister of a country that has no manufacturing" was removed from office despite being the most popular Prime Minister in recent times. The interesting thing was that years later I heard an interview with Peter Garrett (of Midnight Oil fame) who was a minister of his government at that time describe him as a national security risk. I have often wondered since then whether that was a gift of a foreign power? It sure smells like it.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c9198605661645937943 title="comment permalink">12/3/16, 2:53 AM</a><br><br>

I think it was Bill Gates that said a long while back that offshoring would have national security implications. Duh. Well, it surely did. Most astounding was the seemingly iron-clad consensus among American elites that this new "globalized" world was an unalloyed good. <br><br>Did you hear any dissenting voices from powerful Americans? Aside from the murmur of protest from Gates, I didn't. Maybe I missed it all. <br><br>In any case, the process continued apace for decades under the gaze of multiple presidential administrations and a multitude of elected representatives in Congress. As for China, it was raining money there - American money and especially know-how - and Chinese leaders were probably rubbing their eyes in disbelief. <br><br>The domestic consequences for Americans are right under everyone's nose so there's no need to belabour it, a disintegrating country as you said. And so forget about running and policing the world because the economic and financial means to do so were sent overseas, to a rival, no less.<br><br>None of this can be un-done. IMO the new globalized world is not only unworkable, it's unfixable. Too bad, so sad. Not to be insulting, but man oh man, if there's a prize for history's biggest laughingstock, the United States surely has to be a contender. <br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c2069337089728086246 title="comment permalink">12/3/16, 8:22 AM</a><br><br>

The model that best predicts Trump behavior backwards and forwards time is that he will say whatever he thinks crowd X wants to hear him say, layered on a petty, insecure and vindictive core. Will he take the safeties off our nuclear arsenal or somehow cart off Iraq's oil? Even though he has said those things, somehow I doubt it. <br><br>More than any other President Trump's behavior will be determined by whatever advisor has his ear at any given moment. I am fairly confident that he does not consciously want to torpedo our diplomatic relations with China. More likely he just wanted to promote his kid Eric's investments there. Perhaps an aide who _does_ want to screw with the admittedly silly but not nuclear war-provoking one China policy set up the call and Trump lacked the sense to say no. There are plenty of aides like that - Bolton, Heritage fellows working with the transition, etc. Who knows. Something stupid happened and the team is clearly confused about how to deal with it. <br><br>I would suggest while discussing Trump as a normal leader who will execute this specific geopolitical strategy, perhaps temper that with the distant possibility that maybe we hired Homer Simpson to oversee safety at the nuclear plant.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c4493607877705924425 title="comment permalink">12/3/16, 1:52 PM</a><br><br>

Either or both sides could blunder into one, but I'm guessing that the more likely outcome is a trade war between China and the US in which a lot of jobs come back here, a lot of Treasury bills get dumped, and a lot of paper wealth gets erased. That might be intentional -- the US has more debt than it will ever be able to pay off, and once interest rates rise, that debt's going to become impossible even to maintain. A default is the only option, and if China starts dumping T-bills, that might be a decent excuse for same. Just a speculation...<br><br>LatheChuck, that's one reason I find overseas news sources refreshing. Some of them, at least, still remember how to report news. <br><br>Larry, my working guess is that's a parting shot from the neocons. Still, we'll see. <br><br>Tidlösa, the Harry Potter books and films were so popular precisely because they mirrored the affluent liberal worldview so precisely. Harry's evil stepparents are caricatures of the way that affluent liberal Brits think of their own working class, and Harry gets liberated from them to go to an upper-crust boarding school because he's just so <i>special</i>. The racism of the Malfoys et al. is stressed so heavily because it covers over the class bigotry of the "good" characters -- and when Hermione whatsername gets concerned about the treatment of the house elves, that's something to make fun of, because of course the underlings who keep the lives of the affluent running smoothly all love their jobs! Gah. (No, I'm not a fan. How did you guess?)<br><br>Candace, yep. <br><br>Unknown Joel, it's very easy to confuse the runaway entitlement fantasies of the affluent women who seized control of Second Wave feminism and are running it into the ground with the broader issues that confront women who don't happen to be white, middle-aged, affluent, and privileged. That's all the easier because the women in question have gone out of their way to foster that confusion. One of the reasons that so many women voted for Trump was precisely that they've watched the Hillary Clintons of the world throw their poorer "sisters" under the bus in order to buy their way through an assortment of glass ceilings. <br><br>Are there still issues where women receive unfair treatment on account of their sex? You bet, but those principally burden women who are poor or working class -- and you know, and I know, and they know that putting Hillary Clinton in the White House would have done absolutely nothing about those issues. One of the massive wedge issues a populist movement could take up right now would involve simply listening to poor and working class women, finding out what they actually want, and giving them some reason to believe they would get it. The Left used to do that, and still could, but unless they get a move on, they're going to be preempted...<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c7099012514463962608 title="comment permalink">12/3/16, 10:59 PM</a><br><br>

I've had a lot of experience with democratic process in fraternal lodges, using a simplified version of Roberts' Rules, and when it's handled competently, everyone gets their say. Then the group makes its decisions, actions are taken, and everyone gets home at a reasonable hour.

My wife and I had a little bet going as to whether pro-Israel or anti-Israel readers would jump on that first, and as a result, she owes me a backrub.

First, that "the United States resembles **nothing so much** as the Soviet Union in its last days." Many Poles have experience of both the USA and Russia, both then and now, and none that I know of would say this. In fact, Poles would be more likely to say that it is contemporary Russia, not the USA, that is "a bleak and dilapidated landscape of economic and social dysfunction, where the enforced cheerfulness of the mainstream media contrasts...with the...disintegration visible all around." Thus, despite the current military resurgence of Russia, and the difficult situation in the States, I don't know a single Pole who would prefer to live or to have lived in Russia rather than in the States, either then or now, unless a romantic relationship or a specific job offer was involved. I could be wrong, but doesn't Russia still have the most quickly declining population in the world? Here's a detail I can attest to: I live within a 100km of the Russian oblast of Kalinigrad, and most people here go there only to buy vodka and cigarettes at lower prices—other things are cheaper and better here. So perhaps you might say that the USA resembles the last days of the Russian's Soviet Imperium **in some ways**. In any case, it is the citizens' perceptions that are more important than absolute comparisons. So, you could say that many of your neighbors in "fly-over country" think that the United States resembles the Soviet Union in its last days, if they were to say such a thing.<br><br>Second, you wrote that "the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires both finished their imperial trajectories by being partitioned, as of course did the Soviet Union." From a local perspective, the Soviet Union was just another manifestation of the Russian Empire, which Moscow is extending once again. This is nothing new: the fortunes of the Russians have waxed and waned ever since the 1300s, when the Muscovites began to regard themselves as the sole legitimate heirs to the Kievan succession (something which other east Slavs will dispute, look at the references for the article on Kievan Rus' on Wikipedia), and began to use the Greek name for Rus' (Rossiya). Also it seems to me that, when it fell apart, the Soviet Union was not "being partitioned", but "partitioning" itself—this would reflect the view of the Eastern European countries that declared their independence at the end of WWI, lost it before or during WWII, and then regained it at the end of the Cold War. So it might be more accurate to say that that the Russian Imperium lost territories when the Soviet Union dissolved. <br><br>With regard to Mr. Orlov's comment: Although some of our leaders seem to be emulating Putin in terms of certain political tactics, it seems that West Slavs and Balts mostly do not admire and wish to emulate Russia. And this is despite centuries of intimate relationships with their neighbor to the east! I myself might be more convinced that we should emulate Russia in other ways if Mr. Orlov were to set up one of his proposed anarchist, utopian communities there, and then live there on a full-time basis for a decade or two. <br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c6357767718512795182 title="comment permalink">12/4/16, 5:41 AM</a><br><br>

Due to its history and population, Israel must accept outside support, usually from the West, while the Arab states and Iran are more unreliable. This is what makes Israel important.<br><br>Still, it´s interesting to note that American Jews and Israel seem to have a serious disagreement, for the first time since the Suez Crisis or so. American Jews largely opposed Trump, while Israel´s right-wing government favored him. Also, Israel has good relations with Russia, while the various American Jewish lobby groups are still stuck in the old paradigm (Neo-Con or liberal imperialist and hence anti-Russian). <br><br>It will be interesting to see how this works itself out. In contrast to anti-Semites, I never believed American Jews have their primary loyalty to Israel. I think their primary loyalty has been to America - or, today, to the transnational global elite largely based in America. Israel, by contrast, is nationalist and threatened by the bizarre globalist-Islamist alliance. I wouldn´t be surprised if the ADL or AIPAC soon starts to tell everyone that they are the best possible liberal Americans (with two capital A´s) and of course have nothing to do with that insignificant Jewish state in the Middle East...<br><br>As for Israel itself, they have just been given a new lease of life by the election of Trump since they can now enjoy support from both the US and Russia! <br><br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c7082416950731531935 title="comment permalink">12/4/16, 5:44 AM</a><br><br>

It's a very common fallacy that people easily fall into.<br><br>Sure, it's desirable for any empire to fall gracefully. But that isn't an option open to every empire. The British Empire had that option because it effectively delegated it to a daughter nation that shared the same language and a similar outlook: the United States. China has had that option, almost every time it has fallen (which has been a few times in its millennial history), because it remained without question the strongest country in their region, even if they were debilitated compared with the past.<br><br>I understand that any American would rather see the American empire falling gracefully, if it needs to fall at all. Unfortunately, there are a number of reasons I see it far more difficult than it was for the Spanish empire to fall gracefully. First, it would be ceding position to a country with an entirely different culture and attitudes, not to mention dominant racial group, that is, China. It's very difficult for any country to accept that. Secondly, the States still happens to have the strongest military in the world. The temptation to die fighting would be hard to resist, and there is nothing in American culture that would encourage people to resist it. Third, the reason empires normally try to hang to their power like dear life isn't narrow-mindedness, but grim realism. Hegemonic status has real perks, and it translates into very real prosperity for the country that has it. Think of the Roman Empire. The Italian peninsula was never the same after the fall of the Roman empire, simply because there aren't the resources there for the sort of prosperity it enjoyed during Roman times. It truly depended on the favorable trade terms Rome could get on everything, because of its dominance. The same applies to the States. The American economy will go down the drain once many people start feeling like they have the option to pick other economic partners. It's true that many Americans aren't aware of this, but that doesn't make it any less true.<br><br>I'm fairly sure that the likelihood of America falling gracefully is less under Trump than it would have been with Clinton, in spite of the propaganda saying otherwise. Clinton looked like somebody who would have hung on to the foreign policy status quo, which admittedly, is less than ideal. But Trump, instead, looks like somebody who will flip-flop for a while until it dawns on him that the only way of "making America great again" is to keep dominance, and the only way of keeping dominance is by starting WWIII. He certainly doesn't look like a shrewd statesman that could do a careful diplomatic strategic retreat. His claims of retreating aren't made in the sort of terms that would give anyone any confidence that he has a plan to do it in such a way that wouldn't be immediately disastrous for American interests.<br><br>Clinton might have got America into WWIII, but she always looked to me like somebody who's rational enough to know to stop before the losses become disastrous, if it looked like things were going wrong. Trump, on the other hand, looks to me like somebody almost doomed to blunder into WWIII, and once he does, like somebody who will insist on fighting it to the bitterest end.<br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c5628284165946232499 title="comment permalink">12/4/16, 9:42 AM</a><br><br>

I really enjoy reading your well thought out essays and the articulate comments here, even when I disagree with them. (Oh, but you're still 'wrong' about abstract expressionism, BTW. Ha!) But on this political discussion, it is sounding like an echo chamber. <br><br> I do understand that this election was a big event, so a lot of folks, even here, are still rehashing and re-rehashing it all, but it is over. Hillary Clinton lost. Can we let it go? Are we going to spend the next 4 to 8 years responding to every criticism of Trump with "But Hillary would've done......"? In the same way we heard, "But George W Bush did ......" for the past 8 years? Hillary was never even President. If some female bloggers are upset about that, so what? Is it any different than the angry gun-toters at those early Obama - Town Halls? (Or is it the very feminine/emotional presentation of their gripes that is so unbearable? As opposed to the very masculine way Obama's detractors at those town halls expressed their gripes. I don't get why that would be.) <br><br>On the wishful thinking and "cautious optimism" / the speculations of some hidden brilliance of President-Elect Trump and his decisions thus far: It's reminding me of the early months before and during President Obama's first term. "Obama is playing chess while we are playing checkers" was an oft heard phrase from his supporters to explain why what we were seeing of his decisions did not match what he had said. IOW: "Don't question, he's way smarter than we are, and way smarter than we think he is!" But honestly - we just didn't want to wake from our dream of Hope and Change.<br><br>Sometimes when it walks like a duck and talks like a duck - it's not a hidden genius, &amp; it's not playing chess. It's just a duck. <br><br>Additionally: Of course, I see this weird deification of Hillary from her supporters, even now after her loss - Equally, I see this unreasonable granting of far more benefit of the doubt to President-Elect Trump, than ( from what I've seen) he truly merits. That's why I see it as self-delusional wishful thinking.<br><br>I dunno - maybe we are all susceptible to day-dreaming that this bread and circus is what would or will make a difference for our lives in the dark dark days ahead.<br><br>Respectfully, Can we get back to discussing the coming collapse?<br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c9126179375181969870 title="comment permalink">12/4/16, 10:27 AM</a><br><br>

I have encountered this personally. I belong to a group that reads and discussed the New Yorker magazine weekly. The last few weeks we have tended to spend more time venting about the election than discussing the articles. One of the members persists in referring to Trump voters as "those people." I confronted her on it, saying that it was an extremely offensive term. She sort of snarled that she intended to be offensive. I then asked rhetorically how her attitude differed from referring to "for example, those people who control international banking". Now answer. I deliberately chose that example because a number of the members of the group are Jewish (we actually meet in a Jewish library). One of the questions raised earlier was whether the fact that Trump's son-in-law is Jewish would be good or bad for Jews in general.<br><br>A friend of mine announced on Facebook that she is putting her money where her mount is in terms of trying to reform the Democratic Party by running for Assembly District representative for her district (in California), so I decided to do the same. Fortunately we are in different districts. Will be interesting. Apparently each state assembly district chooses 6 women and 6 men for some kind of governing or advisory board. I don't know whether the process is the same in every state, but it might be something for readers to look into if they haven't given up on electoral politics completely. <br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c8445448405679802041 title="comment permalink">12/4/16, 5:03 PM</a><br><br>

The way I read them (and I thought about these issues even as a member of the Harry Potter generation) was that being a wizard was nearly 100% genetically transmissible but a minority were born to non-wizards (because the wizard world was so small, and because most wizards were born to wizards, that means that a vanishingly small proportion of Muggles give birth to wizards). So the Malfoys were bad for wanting to preserve their culture which inherently depends on magical ability even though it seems to me like if wizards wanted to preserve themselves they would have a taboo against procreation with muggles. It's very strange. Within the framework of the Harry Potter universe I would say that the wizards opposed to mixing with muggles are in the right - if I had special powers which made me categorically different than most people as a result of my ethnicity I would certainly only consider having children with a person of the same ethnicity!<br><br>Personally I will just regard this as bad science fiction - Clarke or Asimov wouldn't make a mistake like that.<br><br>I think JMG is right, wizards are those with the right ideology who of course fight the evils of pure evildoers who are evil because they are evil. The Lord of the Rings is sometimes rightly criticized for being too black and white, but at least it painted an epic picture in the progress.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c3225569320718074181 title="comment permalink">12/4/16, 7:32 PM</a><br><br>

It is an impressive book and makes a solid argument with little wiggle room. Out of curiosity, I wonder if that book was vilified to the same extent that say, Limits to Growth was subjected to? Dunno. Overshoot would be a very difficult book to argue with in any meaningful sense.<br><br>If you can indulge me for a brief moment I'll share a paragraph which I read this morning. The following paragraph is more or less relevant to the current discussions here:<br><br><i>"When human history did not work out according to the high hopes engendered by the Age of Exuberance (note: the book explored the ecological and sociological meaning of that phrase), we began in the post-exuberant world to suffer from the illusion that we could retrieve the good old days by hating someone for stealing them from us. Examples abound."</i><br><br>I'll bet you've deleted some rather tiresome comments given that you mentioned Israel! Hehe! Oh no... From my perspective that country really needs to come to grips with their neighbours and their massively long supply lines and also given the fragile environment that is that part of the world. Fresh water is a very serious problem there.

That's the victory of the Sioux at Standing Rock, where the pipeline construction has officially been halted. After a long and increasingly bitter and violent confrontation (on one side, that is) I can't help wondering whether this decision comes in response to the news last week that veterans had started joining the protestors in numbers, and using organised methods.

I thought you might have known, 'people like me'. I was drawn initially to these sites as my own family had already 'collapsed'. These sites have helped immensely in making sense of our experience and forge a positive new way ahead. <br>One of the things that made the most sense and echoed my own experience was that it is a fractal collapse, not a smooth avalanche where we all tumble down together. Different people and institutions will fall or slide down, while others will stay intact for awhile longer, some will crash, some will break off, like a chunk from an iceberg and fall to a lower shelf, (that's where my family are now), some will hollow out inside and seem perfectly intact until very late in the process and then crash spectacularly into the sea.<br><br>And sadly, respectfully to you as well, Although, I agree it's here, I doubt we are anything near the MIDDLE of it all. The middle would indicate the very worst of it. I think we have a long way to go yet to be there. <br><br>I do wish I had your faith in our President-Elect, but I don't think he or any of our Leaders will be able to do much to alleviate the pains most of us are in for in the coming years. We are on our own in too many ways. That's why Green Wizardry is so helpful and important. And that's why I get a bit restless in discussing what we expect him to do; even more restless in imagining what Hillary Clinton would have done, which I see as pointless now that she is out of the picture.<br><br>While we still have the internet to exchange ideas with each other from so far away, I'm still here and still gleaning as much as I can and enjoying the company. <br>All the best to you and yours.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c7210628456113320048 title="comment permalink">12/5/16, 7:02 AM</a><br><br>

The easiest one is personal profit. His business empire has and probably will continue to focus his attention at least as much as any concern us petty folk might have. There are other elements of course. He really likes the trappings of an authoritarian police state. He has advocated for NATO allies to pay more for a long time. That is not even a bad idea! Whether someone with his skill set can accomplish that without tying his shoes together and setting them on fire will be a fascinating to watch. <br><br>I think it is vital to tease apart his actual feelings from the obvious dreck. Trump declared he will protect Medicare. He has clearly forgotten that promise. His idea to take all of Iraq's oil is physically impossible, but aside from that it entirely belies this commitment of his to step lightly in the mideast. It is literally the ne plus ultra neoconservative dream. All those policies Trump claims to hate were directed towards that goal - invading Iraq, stabilizing Syria through force and installing a friendly leadership, etc. Neoconservatives obviously cared about Israel, but oil was the carrot that drove the cart*. Someone who seriously believes the statements you find encouraging would simply never say that about oil. Further, you have to admit that his reckless statements about nuclear weapons are either Homer Simpson-level dreck or else wildly troubling for someone who cares about keeping this world in something like the shape we found it. While I have heard the arguments from John Robb et al. about the very long term (as in, ultimate survival as a species) advantages of fast collapse versus slow collapse, I have to think that nuclear war is a counterproductive way to accomplish the former. <br><br>(*) Hell, I care about Israel, and I agree that it is tangential to the current debate and best left for a separate conversation.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c5193160591496001001 title="comment permalink">12/5/16, 7:09 AM</a><br><br>

Making a premature assessment that Trump will turn out like your standard Republican president is totally premature.<br><br>Europe is getting exciting again with the Italian referendums.

Vernon makes business deals on the golf course and plans to buy a holiday house in Spain. In a “normal owl-free morning” he “yelled at five different people … made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more”. Step-mother and housewife Petunia has “nearly twice the usual amount of neck” &amp; spends her days “craning over garden fences” and worrying about what Other People Think. This family is in the affluent middle classes, they just don’t happen to be liberal in any sense, nor bother to pretend to be. Rowling treats them satirically, just as she dishes out on upper class twits (Justin Finch-Fletchley, Cornelius Fudge) and a wide assortment of other characters from the rather complex class structure that all British authors have to address. The satire comes with varying degrees of affection; the warmest is perhaps reserved for Hagrid, a manifestly working class character complete with heavy regional accent &amp; vocabulary and distinct fondness for drinking vast amounts of alcohol. He was based on a real-life bikie that Rowling met and the portrayal is unambiguously affectionate, without shrinking from Hagrid’s obvious flaws. <br><br>There’s only one Hermione, so no need for “whatsername” but in any case I’m *sure* you know the surname is Granger, a very solid name from middle-England. Her parents are both dentists, named their child after a Shakespearean character and have regular skiing holidays in France. They are upper-middle class and so Hermione initially talks and behaves with the assurance of someone expecting authority figures to be on her side, because (a) she goes to fanatical lengths to do the right thing and (b) the authority figures she knew (parents, teachers etc) played it straight. Meeting Professor Snape is then a cruel lesson; she learns to expect opposition and her fanaticism for doing the right thing becomes increasingly fierce.<br><br>When she discovers the house-elves, the wizards she confronts about it all refuse to join her crusade on their behalf, many telling her flatly she is wrong. Disappointed but undeterred, she ignores lecturing and ridicule. Stubbornly convinced she is right, she persists, not realising that even Dobby, the only free house elf, is silently undoing her efforts to free other elves because those elves were offended. Her efforts fail and she is physically ejected from the kitchens by the offended house-elves. Still undeterred, she becomes ever more shrill and continues to spar with adult wizards on the issue. <br><br>(continued....)<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c2777650427245836093 title="comment permalink">12/5/16, 1:08 PM</a><br><br>

But that’s not the case: misdirection is the rule in Potter &amp; this is a good example. Two characters are used for exposition and truth telling in the books: Hermione and Dumbledore. They are rarely wrong about anything important, so the crucial clue is that despite the range of adult wizards telling Hermy she is wrong, we don’t hear from the only one that matters. When Dumbledore finally weighs in at the end of Book 5, not only is he firmly on Hermione’s side but the mistreatment of elves has led to the death of Sirius Black, a devastating event in the books. Subsequently, Voldemort takes elf-mistreatment further (naturally) than anyone else and this plays a major role in his demise. <br><br>When Rowling was fresh out of University studying languages and Classics, she went to work for Amnesty in London, where she encountered people having emotional breakdowns while telling extremely grim tales of their families being murdered and tortured by assorted 3rd world regimes. Hermione is a semi-autobiographical character: her travails with elves reflect Rowling’s own journey in response to these horrors, where she had to learn over time that there is a difference between desperately trying to help people and actually helping them.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c2384016594198157118 title="comment permalink">12/5/16, 1:12 PM</a><br><br>

That way the Russians could show the Turks they meant business and warn them to back off in Syria while keeping their own hands clean and avoiding a direct confrontation.<br><br>Russia is the new kingmaker in that part of the world and it's been very interesting to see how the American government is increasingly being frozen out of the deals in that part of the world that really matter, like the Syrian peace talks and plans by the Russians, Israelis and Turks to turn Turkey into a major gas export hub for Europe and beyond by building major pipelines from both Russia and Israel to a new terminal in northwestern Turkey.<br><br>It's also quite fascinating to see how long-standing American client states, such as Israel, Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, are rapidly moving to improve relations with Russia. One of the things that has really impressed me about Russian diplomacy and foreign policy in the Middle East has been Russia's ability to stay on good terms with a wide range of opposing powers in the Middle East, such as maintaining an alliance with Iran and at the same time having strong, cordial ties with Iran's archenemy Israel. The contrast with America's ham-handed, binary, moralizing "your with us or against us" approach in recent decades could not be greater. <br><br>One can see the political equivalent of a major tectonic shift occurring in the Middle East. I for one am convinced we are seeing the return of Russia to superpower status and further confirmation that Oswald Spengler's prophecies concerning Russia were largely correct.<br><br>Speaking of Erdogan, did you see his proposal to Russia, China and Iran to replace trading in dollars with direct deals in national currencies? There have been moves afoot by both Russia and China to dethrone the dollar as the global reserve currency and replace it with a basket of major Eurasian currencies as the new global standard, so this appears to me to be one more sign the American Empire is waning.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c8852101759273820693 title="comment permalink">12/5/16, 2:03 PM</a><br><br>

I was referring specifically to the idea that politics is not part and parcel of the effects of peak oil, limits to growth, and collapse. Our collective response since 1980 would predict a Trump in our future. It did seem in your post that you indicated you did not consider it to be part of it, and I feel that it is. Regarding collapse, you probably are further along than me :) As for a depression, I do think we are in for the next fractal collapse stage, one we haven't seen since the 70s and of a severity not seen since the 30s.

She has nothing but disdain for science.

She insulted everyone enamored with this character, saying, "Some girls like bad boys." (Sound familiar?) She couldn't understand why anyone would like him.

The folks that came out and filmed the fourth meeting of the Kanto Green Wizards/monthly Kompira picnic were very interested in what motivated me the others to be priests and what our lively community found so attractive about this endeavor. We had about 30 people, and probably not anyone following your site, but I had no time to find out or even eat. They were filming us for five hours. I'd prepared a mini-sermon again, translating it into Japanese for their benefit, which unsurprisingly I didn't get to give, but they wanted a copy of it, and also a copy of my sketchy translation of your "Green Wizards" essay. <br>I took the idea of "religions as keepers of history" that you wrote about in the Ecotechnic Future, with a couple of examples from Shinto and a question to everyone about what parts of modern culture they would like to see preserved. <br>I also mentioned a recent news story about "illegal farming," which is happening on otherwise disused land along river floodplains, which obviously flood regularly. It seems to be mostly resourceful Chinese and a few older Japanese doing this. It is an example of resilience in a country with less than 40% food self-sufficiency and lots of farmland simply going to waste as the children of aging farmers eschew that life. I proposed seeking a legal framework to allow use of the land by anyone willing to do it.<br>I also mentioned your concept of "Collapse Before the Rush," translating "collapse" carefully as "tettai," which is closer to "retreat," and asking people to consider what things in their lives were unsustainable over the long term, choose one and give it up early.<br><br>I doubt very much that this will be mentioned in the five minutes or so that make it all the way to broadcasting. We went into this expecting a fluff piece again, and satisfied at that. People will get curious and then we can talk to them.<br><br>They did film me explaining to our community's Harley dealer (who really looks the part) and our German Catholic guy with local TV acting experience how to perform one of the genteel parts of the ceremony. I truly hope that makes the cut.<br><br>To anyone in the Kanto area, watch TV Tokyo this Friday night at 9:00 p.m. "Tokoro-san no Gakko de Oshiete Kurenai Sokonno Tokoro".

I'd point out, though, that you suggest that China's retreat from empire was made easier by the fact that it had the strongest military around, and then turn around and insist that the US won't retreat from empire because it's got the strongest military around! It's precisely because we have a very large military (thougn an increasingly brittle and underperforming one) that standing down from global empire is a viable option, and since that empire now costs us more than it's worth -- a normal result of what I've called the "imperial wealth pump" -- walking away from it is also an economically beneficial step as well. But we'll see, of course. <br><br>Caryn, er, I've written about the decline and fall of industrial civilization from every angle I can think of. I've explored it from an energetic standpoint, a historical standpoint, an economic standpoint, a military standpoint, a religious standpoint, a magical standpoint, and even brought in Conan the Barbarian and Hermann Hesse. (Now <i>there's</i> a conversation I would love to host...) I can't think of much else to say on the subject that isn't a rehash of what I've already said, and that option doesn't interest me. Trump's election, like the Brexit vote and the Italian referendum, are part of a massive political shift in the industrial world, and that <i>does</i> interest me -- and ultimately, I write about the subjects I want to write about, for those who want to read about them. <br><br>James, good! The Canadians have been far too reticent about their rightful status as Evil Country Manipulating Everyone, though. We clearly need to see books that add up the words of "O Canada" to get 666, or what have you. ;-)<br><br>Bob, I'm glad to hear that. A lot of the people I used to see at peak oil events repeating McPherson's talking points, and going through elaborate grieving rituals for all life on earth, used to climb, alone, into SUVs afterwards to drive home to their well-paid corporate jobs. <br><br>Phil, interesting. I'll check it out. <br><br>Livingstone, if you go back in this blog's archives to 2008, you'll find that when Obama was elected I expressed cautious optimism that he might turn out to be a good president, and gave the guy the benefit of the doubt until he'd demonstrated what kind of head of state he was. I intend to do the same thing in this case. That certainly seems more useful to me than joining in the chorus of denunciation that's the mainstream's latest mandatory round of virtue signalling. <br><br>Herbert, true enough. <br><br>Justin, duly noted. 8chan is where I've done most of my occasional lurking, anyway. <br><br>Jt, I see a lot of my readers also follow the Keiser Report!<br><br>Rita, excellent! I wish you success in your run for election and the political career that I hope will follow.

I thought her novel about politics in an English village was rather good, and her detective fiction, by "Robert Galbraith" is pleasant enough, not comparable to Chandler or Simenon, but readable. For me, Rowling's cultural importance is that she is a highly visible part of a long overdue, IMHO, revival of storytelling in popular fiction. The children's series, you either hate them or love them, or your kids do. My kid read them; she also obsessively read Nancy Drew, and then outgrew both.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c286337610390021384 title="comment permalink">12/5/16, 7:50 PM</a><br><br>

I've been told, by a friend there, that in the town where he lives, many more people are registering to vote than usual. That's just one report from one town, of course, but if the polls are even close come election day, France, Europe, and the world may be in for a shock.<br><br>1ab, duly noted. I'm entirely willing to be corrected, as it's been a long time since I looked at Rowling's books. I read the first three when they first came out, found the first one a mildly enjoyable mashup of fantasy cliches and the generic English public school novel, was mildly bored by the second and third, and got about two chapters into the fourth before I looked over the vast mass of unturned pages still to go, decided the story wasn't interesting enough to justify the slog, and taking it back to the library. (That's a matter of personal taste rather than a substantive criticism, btw; I'm sure there are plenty of people who find my fiction uninteresting, too.) Thus I was going on the basis of what I recall of a not very interesting read, rather some years ago. As for Hermione whatsername, I used that phrase because I honestly couldn't recall the character's name -- if a book or a series doesn't hold my interest, the details don't always stick.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c4099528075981628631 title="comment permalink">12/5/16, 9:53 PM</a><br><br>

Several people who work for the city of Sweet Home have gotten or are getting their Ham Radio licenses. We have Ham Radios installed at the Fire Station and Police Station. We have a whole group that are from all political persuasions, from quite left to quite far on the right, all working together. I'm helping those who want to learn about the more technical side of the radio stuff. This is a real community building going on. This is with the County ARES (Amateur Radio Emergency Services) groups. The City, Police and Fire Department are wonderfully supportive of what we're doing.<br><br>I keep putting out ideas about resilience and so on in the way we do things, without trying to push a so-called "Green" agenda.

It'll have full solar backup in the near future.

The american media positioned the battle for mosul vs the battle for aleppo as some kind of good vs evil narrative. The good and humanitarian Iraqi army backed by U.S. advisors and airpower would kindly liberate Mosul from ISS without civilian casualties and be greeted with flowers and parades. But the Evi Syrian Army, reinforced with Iranian and Hesbollah troops and backed by Russian Airpower and advisors would clumisly barrell bomb Aleppo while mostly killing civilians and blowing up hospitals and of course fail. It has turned out differently , with the Syrian Army having rolled up ISS throughout most of Alleppo and forcing John Kerry back to the negotiating table to save the last remenants of the "moderate rebels". While in Mosul the U.S. Proxies have failed to dislodge ISS and today the U.S. announced that it would require american boots on the ground to do so. Same size cities, same enemy, couldn't have set up a better labaratory test for imperial power and capabilities.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c4675352803913028407 title="comment permalink">12/6/16, 10:09 AM</a><br><br>

I don't think you Americans will back down from empire. What makes the wealth pump become a liability is not that it fades, but that there are increasingly more enemies and parties interested in putting their hand on it. That makes the cost of keeping the wealth pump increase over time. Now, from what I know about Americans, backing down from something because it will cost a lot to keep others from taking or stealing it, perhaps more than what that something is actually worth, is not something the American psyche permits. It is akin to losing a fight, and as you once argued, America has never lost a fight.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c8306276707480182981 title="comment permalink">12/6/16, 10:26 AM</a><br><br>

Throw in a potentially significant left-wing "shy FN" vote (assuming that Le Pen campaigns on a traditionally socialist economic platform and downgrades the "security" and "identity" issues usually associated with the far right) and it could be a very close race!<br><br>The lessons of the Italian referendum was that pollsters significantly underestimated the turnout of the youth, unemployed and the lower classes and didn't factor in a "shy no vote" from the electorate. This is why the polls seriously under-estimated the size of the no victory. I suspect that something similar will happen in France and your anecdote fits in with that.<br><br>The German elections are interesting as well.

He openly accused the US, Britain and France of hiring and supporting terrorist groups in Syria and said that we have blood on our hands as a result, saying<br><br><i>The blood of our soldiers is on the hands of the hirer of the murder. These people who hired, supported and armed these beasts in human form, called them opposition to justify themselves towards their own consciences and voters. <br><br>Yes, the blood of our soldiers is on your hands, ladies and gentlemen, the patrons of terrorists, from the United States, Britain, France and other countries.</i><br><br>All I can say is wow, just wow! <br><br>This is really strong stuff and shows just how fed up the Russians are with the US government playing footsie with Islamic extremists in the Middle East. It's well worth taking the time to watch. It's been a long time since I have seen a senior Russian official so visibly angry during a media briefing.<br><br>This of course follows the "accidental" American airstrikes on Deir Ezzor that killed as many as 83 Syrian soldiers and are also reported to have killed several Russian servicemen who were acting as forward air controllers. As we discussed in an earlier post, there were reports of a retaliatory Russian cruise missile strike against a hippogriff base near Aleppo in which several American military advisors were rumored to have been killed. I wonder if we will see some sort of retribution for this particular attack as well, either by the Russians or their local allies.<br><br>At some point, these regime change games the US government has been playing are going to come back and bite us hard in the bum. We've got a truck-load of bad karma headed our way thanks to all the nasty things our government has been doing in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Latin America and elsewhere in the name of "freedom", "democracy", "free trade" and all the rest.<br><br>The Clintdubyobama administration has been a disaster for America both at home and abroad and now the Russians believe, with quite a lot of justification, that we are responsible for yet another terrorist atrocity in which Russian citizens were murdered. Like many Trump voters, I voted for Barack Obama both times he ran for president. And like so many Americans, I have been profoundly disappointed with the way he talked a good game but promptly sold out to the establishment. I can't wait to see him and the neocon blood-drinkers in his administration like Victoria Nuland and Samantha Power out of office. I sincerely hope Trump follows through on his campaign promise to normalize relations with Russia and get us the hell out of the Middle East. <br><br>Enough is enough!<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c496193258105169129 title="comment permalink">12/6/16, 2:27 PM</a><br><br>

JMG had mentioned, "what you contemplate, you imitate" in reference to the right and Communism, and how Ayn Rand and her minions became the Communist caricature of an evil capitalist. I think that may be what is at work here. It seems like they're just accepting the SJW's presuppositions and inverting the values. It would be so much better if they focused on the elite rather than minorities. I can assure you, the average, wage class LGBT person and person of color is suffering as much as the white wage class, and I know plenty of immigrants who are disillusioned with the whole American dream, and feel exploited by the whole system. Unassimilated immigrants are one of the few representatives of traditional culture in this country, and the white wage class would do well to emulate them. A good strategy is always to make common cause with people in the same boat as you.<br>@Mark and others,<br>Yes, the Western world has a standard of living that is/has been the gold standard, but THAT IS PART OF THE PROBLEM. As JMG has stated on this blog since its inception, that is not a sustainable way of life, and the resources to maintain it are not there anymore. Right now, it is being propped up by unplayable debt. Therefore, the ideal should be to find some less extravagant lifestyle to emulate. Faulting the Russians, Brazilians, and others for not having as extravagant a lifestyle as the US &amp; the West misses the point. Their lifestyle is not as unsustainable as ours, and does not use as much resources. That is why it is an advantage in this age of scarcity industrialism. Whoever gets by on less is ahead.<br>I must agree with JMG, I'm not pro-Trump, but I am willing to give him a chance to change things, and, unlike Obama's supporters, I am sure that Trump's supporters will loose patience with him in short order if he sells them out and make their voices heard by other, more muscular, means. These are well armed people well versed in the use of violence, folks.<br>I must say, the insanity seems to continue on the leftward end of things. I met with an older (40-something--"40 is the new 60") salary class lesbian couple Hillary supporters last night for the first time since the election. They work for the state, so I was interested in their take on the whole election, as our state became the last Southern state House to flip to GOP this past election. They seemed to be in acceptance about the whole thing, but it was denial all the way, "evil 'ists'", "victory for bigotry", "Pence will be calling the shots", "It was Comey's fault", "people won't elect a woman", etc. Total denial. Then tonight, I go to the local Fairness group, and the local GSA came, and it was pure hysteria about bigotry. The adults were not the adults in the room, and they were not setting a good example for the teens.<br>I'm really hopeful for the post-millennial, 25 and under generation coming of age. I'm hopeful that they'll be the most "small-c" conservative generation to come down the pike in a while, and that the coming depression will have the same effect on them that it had on their great-grandparents, and that they're Boomer grandparents will be turning in their graves seeing how much they resemble their parents.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c7228660891011859121 title="comment permalink">12/6/16, 5:42 PM</a><br><br>

I like life in less affluent countries. That's why, even though I'm a US citizen, I've lived and continue to live in them. <br><br>I had two points: First, that although the situation in the USA certainly resembles that in the USSR during its final days in some important ways, to say that it resembles "nothing so much as" that period of the USSR seems to be going too far. In fact, having also been in Venezuela during the early Chavez years, I see just as many, if not more, similarities between the USA today and that era in Venezuela. For example, the distrust, disgust and desperation caused by traditional party leaders failing to address economic problems; the expectation that a leader rather than grassroots organization and individual action will solve these problems (or at least a more balanced combination of national leadership and local action); the election of a charismatic, mercurial and bombastic outsider to be that leader; and the contrast between the horror of one part of the population at the election of that leader, and the hope of another part that this one man will be strong enough to do something—anything—to smash the status quo. Caudillo and caudillismo are Spanish words that are rich in overlapping meanings (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudillo); some of them may apply to the current situation in the USA.<br><br>Second, JMG replied that he thought Poles wouldn't want to emigrate to Detroit. I thought that, although Poles mostly emigrate to other countries in the EU nowadays, Detroit wouldn't look too bad to people who come from more desperate environments, of which there are plenty.<br><br>You make a good point about how everyone needs to get by on less. And that leads me to ask how many people in the USA actually want to do that. Trump promised to make America great again, which many interpret as being more materially prosperous. But Americans need to get by on less, and in fact they will have to do so at some point. You also mentioned some impatient, well-armed Trump supporters. So what do you think will happen if these impulsive, take-charge warrior types end up feeling deceived, as it seems they may? A second constitutional convention, a caudillo in the original sense of the word, a police-state, or just an ever deepening morass, like Venezuela in recent years? Do you think it will turn out well if, "unlike Obama's supporters, [Trump's supporters lose] patience with him in short order if he sells them out and make their voices heard by other, more muscular, means"?<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c2313832252094179789 title="comment permalink">12/7/16, 11:00 AM</a><br><br>

The view of human nature in the books is closer to those of CS Lewis and Dorothy Sayers than the PC world. But we are learning along with Harry and no faster. This is the first real bad thing we learn about the hero Dumbledor and the lovable Weasleys. The following books continue on revealing more and more flaws and evils. If anything the cited book should be taken as a savage putdown of PC attitudes.Hermione accomplishes nothing in PC mode and is only tolerated for friendship sake. Hermione does succeed in making changes in later books but only to the attitudes of Ron and Harry and in each case the negative effects of her PC period are the first barrier to getting them to listen to her.<br><br>Magic in the books is more like intelligence in that it appears in unexpectedfamilies as well as in the expected. Harry's mother was born to muggle parents. Hermione is also muggle born. The name created by those who want it to be genes and genes only is mudblood. Obviously mudblood existence undermines the ideology. Also undermining it are the ongoing effects of inbreeding.<br><br>One last point: Harry's step father is a business exec not working class.

I do hope that society can reach a healthy attitude towards homosexuality. For instance, I think that homosexual men and women should do what heterosexual men and women do as a matter of course, and not work in professions where they're around children of their preferred gender in certain environments. I'm sure many homosexuals already do this, but if, for example I were to say this in 'polite society' I would be called a vile homophobe or something. And yet, before 'SJW' was a perjorative, it was a widely held belief that the female gym teacher we had in middle school (grades 7-9 here), who 'supervised' the girls changing room was a lesbian. Considering that there was no actual requirement (we had a male gym teacher who felt no need to enter the boy's room except when there was some kind of pubescent-moron related problem) that these rooms were supervised, this was kind of strange.<br><br>Now, this could very well be a schoolyard rumor and a witch hunt, but that gym teacher also had a very butchy hairstyle and manner of dressing and was unmarried. But the fact remains if a male gym teacher (one of the rules was that gym class always involved a male and female teacher present, in case a locker room issue required adult intervention without the risk of lawsuits). If I had my way, homosexuals could be open about who they are and they would face the same sort of restrictions in the world that are entirely normal for heterosexual people. And of course, I know many LGBT etc would likely agree with me but there are plenty who would call me a some kind of -phobe or -ist.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c1022324746717098670 title="comment permalink">12/7/16, 3:42 PM</a><br><br>

I know that what people really want is not a 'white ethnostate' but rather a community and group identity that is (a) theirs, and (b) positive. And also meaningful challenges. I agree that it would be excellent for them to go bag a deer (or on the lower cost and easier-to-get-into side go fishing).<br><br>Regarding the tight male companionship, I think the point is that the young men the article is talking about it don't understand what is causing their anomie or our society is structured in such a way that there are few opportunities. For example, you mention joining the military, but that's a huge quantum leap (nonetheless, many young men do join the military for reasons which are not entirely economic) - there's no incremental way to do it. I think one problem with modernity is that there are no major aspects of life that are single-gendered. Nearly every culture except the modern decadent West has had single-gender parts of society and I think that would go a long way to reducing anomie in these young men that find themselves drawn to anime-Nazism.<br><br>Regarding anti-consumerism, the problem with being anti-anything without being also pro-replacement-for-that thing is that it doesn't work. The alt right is selling their intoxicating, but ridiculous vision of a revival of the authoritarian ethnostates of the past.<br><br>And yeah, I doubt the guy's ever held a shovel, but it's entirely possible he lives in one of many regions of the United States where teenagers and young adults can't find that sort of work. Again, one of the things I would do if I were in charge, is make it completely mandatory for every young adult, around age 16, to go spend 6 months or so doing some sort of dirty, unpleasant, boring, strenuous job for little pay, while living in austere conditions (that way if their parents are wealthy, they don't come home to luxury every day) - tree planting is a perfect example. And anyone who goes to university has to spend another 6 months working as an apprentice in some sort of skilled manual labor job like welding or cabinet making.<br><br>And yeah, the use of ancient military traditions as usernames is funny, it always reminds me of a macbook-equipped latte-sipping dweeb with a Che Guevara shirt on. On the other hand, it seems like most cultures always have a pantheon of deceased warrior-philosophers, enough to say that such behavior is a common feature of all cultures, especially agricultural ones where organized warfare is more important.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-american-century.html#c132391829133261458 title="comment permalink">12/7/16, 3:42 PM</a><br><br>
