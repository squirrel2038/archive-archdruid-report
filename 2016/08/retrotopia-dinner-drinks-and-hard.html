<div dir=ltr style="text-align: left">
This is the twenty-second installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator has dinner with Melanie Berger, tells her about his change of mind, and has to confront the hard choices ahead of him. <br>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We’d settled on a Greek restaurant close by, a place I’d been for lunch already.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I passed that onto the driver as soon as we got into the cab, and slumped back against the leather seat as the driver climbed up onto the seat up front, snapped the reins, and got the horses moving. Neither Melanie nor I said anything. The lights of Toledo rolled by, and I wondered how many people behind the windows we passed were worrying about the war down south, the way I was. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was maybe five minutes, if that, when the cab rolled to a stop, and the cabby swung down from his seat and popped open the door. I climbed down, paid him, reached out a hand for Melanie; she took it gratefully, got down onto the sidewalk. “Thank you,” she said, when the cabbie was driving off. “For a few minutes of silence, especially.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We don’t have to talk over dinner,” I said as we headed toward the door. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Don’t worry about it. You won’t be screaming at me in a Texas accent for an hour straight.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave her a questioning look, but by then we were inside and the greeter was headed our way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once we were comfortably settled in a booth over to one side, and the waitress had handed us menus and taken our drinks order to the bar, I said, “Seriously?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Seriously. The Texan ambassador wanted to see President Meeker right now, and no, she didn’t care that he was in a cabinet meeting and that she was going to be the first to see him afterwards. It’s one of the few times I’ve ever wished that diplomatic courtesies included the right to slap someone hard enough to send teeth flying.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I choked, then pasted on a respectable expression while the waitress came back with our martinis and took our order. “I take it Texas doesn’t put professionals in its embassies.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Only the important ones, and we’re not one of those. Velma Streiber’s a Houston society matron who has good friends in the Bulford administration and wanted a fancy title.” She shook her head.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I hope you didn’t have to deal with the Confederate ambassador too,” I said.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I did, but that was easy. John Bayard MacElroy is your basic Confederate gentleman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He might shoot you dead in cold blood and feed your corpse to his hound dogs, but he’ll be the very soul of politeness while he does it.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I choked again. Then, still laughing, I shook my head and picked up my martini. She gave me a startled look. “That doesn’t look much like what you were drinking Friday night.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“It isn’t,” I admitted. “I decided to try a Lakeland style martini Saturday, and liked it.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That got me a long, considering look, and then a nod. “But that was my day—that and dealing with just about every other embassy in Toledo by phone or in person, scheduling meetings with Meeker, setting up briefings like the one you went to, attending a couple of briefings myself. Oh, and helping out two delegations—I won’t say which ones—that lost their satellite links with home and have no idea how to get by without hardware in orbit.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That interested me. “How do your embassies phone home?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Shortwave radio, of course—the way everybody did before satellites took over. I had to explain that to both delegations.” With a sly smile: “When the Atlantic Embassy loses its satellite links, have them give me a call; I can recommend a good radio firm that won’t even put bugs in the hardware.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave her a dubious look, and she laughed. “I hope the briefing you got was worthwhile, by the way.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Even more so than I’d expected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Turns out you’re not the only people interested in freight transit through the Erie Canal.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Now surprise me.” She sipped her drink. “Missouri, East Canada, and who?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Chicago.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Oh, of course. That’s good to know; I’ll talk to Hank Barker with the Missouri delegation and see if we can coordinate shipping with them. We do a lot of trade with Missouri these days; the wool your suit is made of almost certainly came from their flocks, and possibly from their fabric mills.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Barker mentioned that,” I said. “Wool and leather.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Two bowls of avgolemono soup came, and neither of us said anything until the waitress was gone. “I’m going to risk mentioning a potentially uncomfortable subject,” Melanie said. “The Missouri Republic is the one neighbor we’ve got that’s shown any interest in in learning from our experience. They haven’t gone nearly as far as we have—you still see bioplastic clothing there, and they’ve still got a metanet, though it’s pretty ramshackle these days—but the World Bank doesn’t like them much any more.” She shook her head, laughed. “I’ve been told that people from the World Bank threatened them with trade sanctions two years ago, after they refused a loan, and President Applegate told them, ‘Didn’t hurt Lakeland much, did it?’ That shut them up.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I laughed, because I’d met Hannah Applegate at a reception in Philadelphia, and it took no effort at all to imagine her saying those words in her lazy Western drawl. Then the implications sank in. “They turned down a World Bank loan?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Of course. You know as well as I do that the only reason the World Bank makes those is to force countries to stay plugged into the global economy, so they can get the hard currency they need to make<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>payments on the loan. The Missouri government knows that, too, and they’re sick of it. Since we’re Missouri’s number one trading partner these days, we’ve both got the necessary arrangements to handle trade and investment in each other’s currencies, and a fair amount of private investment from our side heads over there these days, they decided it was time to take the risk.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Good timing on their part,” I said, thinking of the war. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And on ours.” In response to my questioning look: “They produce things we need and buy things we produce. The last thing we want is to see them bled dry.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The way my country will be,” I said. She glanced at me, said nothing, and concentrated for a while on her bowl of soup. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The waitress showed up conveniently a moment later, served us our entrees, made a little friendly conversation—Melanie was a regular, I gathered—and then headed off to another table. “As I said,” Melanie said then, “it’s a potentially uncomfortable subject.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The fact that your country is set up to weather this latest mess in fairly good shape, and mine might just end up as a failed state.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Her face tensed, and after a moment she nodded. “If that happens, and you can make it to our border, have the border guards contact Meeker’s office. Shouldn’t be too hard to expedite your entry. I hope it doesn’t come to that, but...” She let the sentence trickle off. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Thank you. I hope it doesn’t either.” Then: “To the extent that you can tell me, how bad do your analysts expect it to get?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She considered that. “I can tell you a few things. It’s nothing you won’t hear from your own intelligence people once you get back home—the NIS, isn’t it?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded. “What do you call your spook shop here in Lakeland?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We’ve got three of them: the Office of Political Intelligence in the State Department, the Office of Economic Intelligence in Trade, and the Office of Military Intelligence in Defense. Keeping it broken up like that helps prevent groupthink.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I motioned with my fork, granting the point, and she went on. “What OPI says is that Texas and the Confederacy were both in deep trouble even before this whole thing blew up in their faces. They both depend heavily on oil revenue to balance their budgets, they’ve both had declining production for years now, and you know as well as I do how badly they’ve been clobbered by volatility in the oil markets. That’s ultimately what’s behind this war—neither of them can afford to compromise because they both need every drop of oil they can possibly get—but this is going to take a lot of wells out of production until the fighting’s over.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Or permanently,” I said. In response to her questioning look: “I was told off the record that so much of both sides’ offshore fields are stripper wells that a lot of the destroyed platforms won’t produce enough oil in the future to be worth the cost of rebuilding.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She nodded. “That’s OEI’s bailiwick and I haven’t talked to them yet, so thanks for the heads up.Even without that, though, both countries are going to be hit hard even if the war ends in a few days—and it doesn’t look like it’s going to end in a few days.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded. “Military intelligence?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Got it.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I didn’t ask for details; she’d told me as much as she was cleared to pass on, and there are lines you don’t cross in our business. Pretty clearly she’d attended a classified military briefing and gotten the latest information about the war, and I could think of at least a dozen signs that would warn the Lakeland government that neither Texas nor the Confederacy was going to back down any time soon. In a couple of days I’d be back in Philadelphia, and I could ask people I knew in Ellen Montrose’s transition team for a summary. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And if it drags on?” I asked.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She gave me an unhappy look. “Best case scenario is both countries end up economic basket cases, with per capita GDPs lower than the midrange for sub-Saharan Africa, but they both manage to hold together and begin to recover in about a decade. Worst case scenario is that one or both go failed-state on us. Either way we’re looking at a big refugee problem, and a long-term economic headache if the Mississippi stays closed. We can deal with it, no question—it’s just going to take some work. It’s the people down south, in both countries, I feel sorry for”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We both concentrated on our meals for a minute or two. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And the thing is,” she burst out then, “this whole business is so unnecessary. If both countries weren’t stuck on a treadmill trying to—” She stopped cold, catching herself. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Trying to progress,” I finished the sentence. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Another unhappy look. “I really don’t think we should go there,” she said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I think we should,” I replied “I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the things you said Friday evening, and you were right.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She was so surprised she dropped her fork. After a moment: “I’m sorry. I’m not sure I believe I just heard you say that.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You were right,” I repeated. “I spent all Saturday trying to find holes in your logic, and I couldn’t find any.” I shrugged. “I have no idea where to go with that yet, but there it is.” Which was not quite true, but there were things I wasn’t going to say in a restaurant that close to Embassy Row. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She considered me for a long moment, pretty obviously shaken good and hard, and I said, “Come on, I can’t be the only person from outside who’s told you that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“It happens,” she said then. “Once in a blue moon, maybe. No, that’s not fair—working class people get it in a heartbeat, more often than not. They look at the way factory workers and store clerks live here, compared to how they live outside, they ask a few questions about why we do what we do, and they have no trouble at all figuring out the rest for themselves.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I thought about the family of immigrants I’d seen on the train from Pittsburgh, and the conversation I’d had with the father of the family. “But people who are well off, well educated, part of the system.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The minority that still gets some benefit out of progress,” she said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That stung, but I knew she was right. “Yes.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Once in a blue moon.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Neither of us said anything for a while. Our plates got empty and our drinks got refilled; a couple of dishes of baklava came out for dessert, and when we started talking again it was about uncontroversial things, the Toledo Opera’s future plans, funny stories about trade negotiations, that sort of thing. I guessed that she was still trying to process what I’d said, which was reasonable; so was I. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finally the meal ended. She was looking really tired by that point—no surprises there—so we settled pretty much right away that nobody was going to end up in anybody else’s bed that night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I gave her a kiss, helped her into her coat, and got her onto a taxi headed for her place. My hotel wasn’t too many blocks away, so I waited until the taxi had turned the corner and set off on foot. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The sky was still clear and a rising wind swept down the streets, hissing in the bare branches of streetside trees. Overhead the stars glittered, and now and then something bright shot across some portion of the sky and burnt out, one more fragment of business as usual falling out of the place we’d stuck it and thought it would stay forever. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In less than forty-eight hours I’d be back in the Atlantic Republic:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>on my way home to Philadelphia, where three decades of effective one-party rule by the Dem-Reps had just gone out the window in a landslide and taken the status quo with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The new administration would have to scramble to find its feet in a world gone topsy-turvy, where there were too many hard questions and nothing like enough straightforward answers. For that matter. I was going to be facing some hard questions of my own, and I was far from sure I had any straightforward answers, either. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Another chunk of dead satellite traced a streak of light across the sky, dissolved in a flurry of sparks. I kept on walking. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***************</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In other fiction-related news, two magazines with links to this blog have something to report. <i>Into the Ruins</i>, the recently started deindustrial SF quarterly edited by Joel Caris, has just released <a href=https://intotheruins.com/issues/issue-2-summer-2016/ >its second issue</a>. I’m delighted to say that it’s a worthy successor to the first issue, with a lively mix of short stories and a letters to the editor column that’s really starting to pick up. Fans may also want to know that this issue includes the first installment of a regular column by yours truly, "Deindustrial Futures Past," reviewing older works of science fiction set in the aftermath of industrial civilization. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<i>Mythic</i>, the new science fiction and fantasy quarterly by the publisher of the <i>After Oil</i> anthologies, is also moving toward its first issue. I’m eager to see this take off, and am contributing a short story, “The Phantom of the Dust,” set in the same fictive world as my novel <i>The Weird of Hali: Innsmouth</i>. I’ve been told by publisher Shaun Kilgore that he’s gotten a good initial response to his call for fiction submissions but would like to see more, and he’s also very much interested in book reviews, essays, and other nonfiction pieces related to science fiction and fantasy. More details? You’ll find ‘em <a href=http://www.mythicmag.com/p/submissions.html>here</a>. This is a paying gig, folks; let your writer friends know. </div>

I wonder what is going to happen when the conspiracy theory, alt-right and limits to growth crowds, who are of course united in their dislike of the IMF/World Bank come together. I listen to a few 'alt-right' podcasts - no, none of the really vile ones, and so far the limits to growth reality is on the edges of that world. I expect those forces to eventually merge, and probably form the Inner Party of that political party you described in the Strange Bright Banners series of posts. Something interesting about the deep alt-right is the conflict between people (especially in Europe) who identify with their Pagan past, and fundamentalist Christians - I think something interesting will come out of the syncretism between Pagan ancestor worship and the notion of immortality through your ancestors with some of the better ideas in Christianity. Of course, these ideas lead towards very racialist thinking, but well, I think that cat is out of the bag, even if our lead suit dummies insist it isn't. What do you think, JMG?<br><br><a href=#c3092212719447081165 title="comment permalink">8/17/16, 5:26 PM</a><br><br>

No mention of the three greatest inventions of western civilisation. All three are available to most people. One has rid us of the scourge of fleas and all three have freed us from drudgery. The vacuum cleaner, the washing machine and the refrigerator. You can have all three in a low energy economy.<br>There are two other things not usually touched on nowadays. Perhaps they are no more obvious to folks living in your country than water is to a fish. The awful and appalling nature of your food, and looking at people anywhere in public: the deep sadness of your population. I guess your protagonist visiting the Atlantic republic would be struck by the absence of both.<br>Though not by the smell and noise. The sound of hundreds of steel shod horses and iron rimmed wheels on stone is deafening. And if Toledo were a city of about 300,000 and using mainly horses for transport, it would be dealing with about 100 tons of manure and 2,000 odd gallons of urine a day. Quite enough to power the electricity department's turbines. Quite enough to pong the place out.<br><br><a href=#c1710976466996474603 title="comment permalink">8/17/16, 5:44 PM</a><br><br>

I wonder if you have encountered the work of former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. He tried to get his party to rejects loans and has talked and written a lot about his experiences. It is very interesting to hear his perspective, because people with his views seldom get as good a glimpse of power as he did. His anecdotes about meetings with the euro group are priceless. A fair number of members admitted to him that that they knew the austerity and additional loans they proposed would make it impossible to pay back the money they owed. But they wanted to make an example of Greece. Upon completing a rather diplomatic speech to the group I believe it was the German finance minister who responded, "we can't allow the outcomes of elections to change economic policy." Varoufakis pointed out that the Chinese had a similar view. I wonder if the Greek restaurant was a coincidence or intentional. I have not had much time to read his books, but I catch talks he has given while cooking.<br><br><a href=#c3971677023814122175 title="comment permalink">8/17/16, 5:45 PM</a><br><br>

I can get bogged down in the negativity of our predicament at times, so it's nice to dive into something more positive and remember those aspects, as well.

However, I can't help feel a deep-seated sense of tribalism and anger when I hear about what is happening in Europe, which is at face level silly considering I'm a second generation Canadian. I don't consider myself to be a white identitarian or anything, but the notion of the white population of Europe being replaced by Islamic Arabs and Africans bothers me on a deep level. Rationally, this shouldn't matter to me, and yet I get seriously butthurt when I hear more about the Islamisazation of Europe. On the other hand, I don't particularly care that Brampton, Ontario is predominately Indian and that nobody who isn't Indian has any chance whatsoever of being elected.

Speaking of progress, I picked up from the library a copy of "A Short History of Progress" (Wright, 2005). I sat down to give it a read the other night and noticed a blurb on the front cover. "If you read one book about impending doom this year, make it this one." (Ottawa Citizen. Newspaper?). I generally don't laugh out loud when I read, but in this case, I did.<br><br>Speaking of newspapers, I don't know how many of the commentariate (love the term) caught you wishful speculation that if a lot of us landed in one place, it would be ... interesting. I've been kicking around the idea of Cumberland, Maryland for a couple of weeks. Especially after I took a look at your real estate prices. But I agree with you, that to stay on the right side of the locals, you'd better have your own income that won't take away from the local economy. I have a small retirement income that would travel, with me. And, having been a member of a twelve step program for a number of years, I would be pre-plugged in to at least one support system. It's a possibility, but I'm a little long in tooth for one last great adventure. I think. <br><br>But, what I would like to suggest to anyone looking to relocate (to either Cumberland, or, anywhere else for that matter) is ... take the local newspaper for at least three months. Not the online version, which usually lacks .. nuance. Most newspapers will mail you a subscription. In the case of Cumberland, it is the Cumberland Times-News. Per month is probably somewhere north of $20. You have to call to get an exact price. <br><br>I subscribed to the newspaper, here, for three months before I moved.

Personally, I have rather...conflicted views on the alt-right. I admire their effort to rescue Conservatism from the Milton-Friedman types who have dominated it since WWII, but at the same time I find the racialist ideas in alt-right circles repulsive. I don't say this out of typical Leftist sentimentalism-I was born and grew up in central South Carolina, a place that has black and white communities interlaced with no real regional separation. Though I'm white, I've worked, gone to school with, and been taught by black people enough to know that they are as much a part of the South as the white population. At one point I frequented alt-right websites a great deal (and found this blog through a link on one of them), but over the past year or so, I've noticed the movement's racialist aspects taking it over like some giant tumor, with alt-right websites calling for the sort of ethnic Balkanization that would tear my birth state's society to shreds if it were ever implemented. I still hope that somebody, somewhere, can build an identitarian, communal Conservatism that tries to unite black and white Americans (or black and white Southerners), but the alt-right that I've seen doesn't seem to have any interest in that. I wonder if you or anyone else here have found somewhere that does.<br><br><a href=#c541126788301102941 title="comment permalink">8/17/16, 10:17 PM</a><br><br>

Of course he doesn't notice washing machines et al. I've put in enough hints that anyone who's paying attention will know that they're there. With regard to food, if you live where I suspect you do, trust me, the opinion is mutual; and as for the rest, first of all, where did you get the idea that Toledo's streets are paved in stone or that its taxis have iron tires, and second, did you somehow not notice the electric streetcars that are carrying a very large fraction of the traffic? <br><br>Greg, I haven't gotten to more than a couple of Varoufakis' essays yet, but I gather that he'd get along very well with the Lakeland Republic government. <br><br>John (if I may), radio may be obvious to your generation; I've long since lost track of the number of tech geeks I've encountered who literally don't know that there was any way to communicate to people on other continents before the Internet went in. It's really quite embarrassing. As for Enigma machines, no, those are breakable, as the Wehrmacht found out to its cost. Single-use pads and the like tend to be rather more secure. <br><br>Joel, no, I didn't have Toomas in mind when I wrote that scene; I simply remembered that Melanie had been up since about 3:30 in the morning, having not had a lot of sleep before then, and she's pushing middle age, so normal human limits apply. I'm delighted to hear you've picked up a copy of <i>Davy</i> -- to my mind, as you know, that's one of the classic works of deindustrial SF. <br><br>Steve, yep. Maybe four, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be three. Carr catches the train back to Pittsburgh Wednesday afternoon, and it's Monday night as this episode ends. <br><br>Pinku-Sensei, exactly. As I noted in my ten year retrospective post, this entire blog is the working out of a single idea with all its connections and implications. Your fellow director is quite correct, and we're moving in that direction fairly rapidly; as wage class white people increasingly find themselves being treated more like wage class people of color than like salary class white people, unexpected solidarities are beginning to form. <br><br>Eric, best wishes for the meeting! I'm glad to see these moving ahead. <br><br>James, that's really quite good. A deindustrial story set in the nearer reaches of the solar system might do very well indeed, since the ending of the Space Age is an important theme of the future immediately ahead of us. <br><br>Ozark, I don't think we'll get much on that, since there's not a lot of time left for Carr to hear about it. Still, I may drop some hints. <br><br>Jon, in the future history I've mapped out here, there hasn't been a lot of mass migration; there were a lot of refugees in various places during the Second Civil War, but most of them returned home when the fighting was over, and of course Lakeland was basically behind closed borders for thirty years, so there weren't any significant population movements to or from their territory in that time. <br><br>Justin, I'd encourage you to explore why you feel that way about Denmark and not about Canada! For my part, I've studied way too much history to think of ethnic, cultural, and national identities as anything but temporary and rather arbitrary constructs in the bubbling cauldron of human history.<br><br><a href=#c7616409662743805958 title="comment permalink">8/17/16, 10:39 PM</a><br><br>

I suppose other serializations will folllow to illustrate arguments that come up. I could imagine similar on your other blog. Perhaps reality will catch up with us rather quickly anyway. Lakeland is a sort of ecovillage/commune/middle ages monastic system writ large. One can just imagine hitech civilized people disappearing back into the jungle to live with primitives but lakeland would be a more comfortable and likely alternative. Soviet collapse saw dachas, gardening come to the fore. Now they are in a conservative 1950s style phase, Putin is Eisenhower in this scenario. The 90s collapse was real however and it could have got worse. The whole Western system is brittle. 2008 banking crisis was a warning. Fracking and QE were stopgap measures but seat of the pants measures to keep system going. Both ideas are scrapping bottom of barrel to maintain growth with debt and energy growth. Conscious deindustrialization, degrowth measures have nowhere been attempted. Alt energy is not that really. Tech reduces need for workers, increases production to increase sales. Debt supports sales and energy supports mass production without humans. Put manual production of very long lasting goods with repairs a prerequisite and debt and energy are reduced, people have a future. 100 million without a job. Next leg down comes soon enough when Deutsche Bank or Italy or China or Japanese debt hits limit. Perhaps a new leader somewhere blows afuse, EU breaks apart with Marine Le Pen winning or something somewhere breaks. We are riding an old jalopy sputtering along from one traffic light to next wondering if we can get home. Putin, china, etc. seem to be creatively replacing western system for eurasia, inviting more countries to join, as they get gisgusted with US imperial arrogance. Pakistan and now Turkey getting abused. Israel flirting with Russia. Saudis getting involved with china just in case. This looks like lakeland as core of new conservative civilization but taking up all of Old World, piece by piece as West falls apart.<br><br><a href=#c7702886783089921043 title="comment permalink">8/18/16, 12:12 AM</a><br><br>

Several years ago, I was having students research and write biographical essays of favorite writers. A problem we encountered was the lack of scholarly material about writers of genre fiction (e.g., sci-fi and fantasy, mystery and detective fiction, romances, westerns, etc.) The literature intelligentsia, of course, don't consider those writers' output important or valuable enough to be worth engaging in literary criticism. The rap on genre fiction is that it's "written to a formula." Well, yes. The typical murder mystery, for example, is very formulaic. But that, of course, doesn't necessarily mean that the writer of such fiction is not a good writer. Many are. Furthermore, a significant amount of literature that's considered "classic" is written to a formula: Shakespeare's sonnets, for example. The problem isn't the formula; the talent is revealed in how the writer works the formula. Sigh.<br><br>My category for the homework assignment is sacred music.

You explain that the Lakeland foreign secret service is organized into three branches. Does Lakeland have a need for a dedicated service assessing domestic, as opposed to foreign, threats? <br><br>Canada was able to get by for decades without such a thing, assigning to the RCMP what little domestic assessment may from time to time have been necessary. In 1984 (oh heck, what terrible cosmetics, in choice of year), Ottawa created CSIS to counter subversion. Under this change, the RCMP's remit got reduced, being from 1984 onward confined to the countering of conventional, essentially nonpolitical, crime. <br><br>The UK, by contrast, has long felt threatened internally, and has since the World War I era accordingly felt constrained to run "MI5". The UK thinking is that MI5 is to be kept administratively separate from the more celebrated MI6: MI5's remit is domestic, and MI6's foreign. Many, I included, will applaud the separation. <br><br>What, then, is the situation with Lakeland? My speculative guess is that internal threats are sufficiently mild for Lakeland to be able to apply the pre-1984 Canadian model, using its conventional national police for handling whatever mild threats to its Constitution may from time to time emerge, as pre-1984 Canada used the RCMP. But perhaps I am wrong? <br><br><br><br>Tom (living in Canada) <br><br><br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a><br><br><br>PS: I may as well add a remark on spookery more generally. This branch of government is to be, in general, deprecated. What is fundamentally needed (though I do not know if any government anywhere has this) is a visible, prestigious, "Department of Appraisals" under the Foreign Ministry, operating with open-source materials, and publishing almost all of its work. The "DofA" would concentrate on reading the foreign press, monitoring foreign broadcasts, and sending analysts abroad in a transparent manner - for instance, as explicit "DofA" attachés, by way of juniors in selected embassies. A minuscule foreign-intelligence spookshop, also under the Foreign Ministry, would be needed to do the occasional bit of unpleasant work, as when Outer Slobovia (Singapore and the USSR actually did this) criminalizes the mailing of its newspapers to recipients beyond its frontiers. The DofA will have to keep an eye on Outer Slobovia, as on everything else. If all else fails, the DofA will have to ring up the spookshop and arrange for an asset to be deployed - the asset being now charged with, for instance, smuggling out copies of the Slobovskaya Gazyeta day by day, for that curious DofA readership. <br><br><br><a href=#c5560450352712132910 title="comment permalink">8/18/16, 7:13 AM</a><br><br>

In both roles, he said, he had been the advocate for “sound science.”<br><br>“This is what a ‘dark age’ looks like,” [Edwards wrote]. “When science is no longer a source of enlightenment, people still need to believe in something.” The people of Flint had been betrayed, and the betrayal had pushed some of them “into the anti-­science camp.” He continued: “We lost our authority and the public trust with good reason. After Flint kids were protected, I took off my activist suit and put on my lab coat. Some people assumed my motives could be changed just as easily. Not so, but arguing about it is not productive.

It is a wonderful way to explore future possibilities. <br><br>A few thoughts about the entire series. Sorry it got long, and I didn't intended to nitpick. I love the unity of the story and the way the same point about effective solutions from earlier eras is made in different contexts and builds a full argument. <br><br>--About internet technology. The satellite Kessler syndrome makes a great fiction device since it is a real threat to satellite use. But it isn't a primary threat to internet communication. Most of that is fiber optic. And as the telegraph networks of the mid 19th century show, that isn't particularly high tech. Fiber optic takes knowledge of glass chemistry and optical amplifiers, but it is less resource intensive than copper telegraph and isn't that complicated. A primitive digital computer with a fiber optic connection is so much superior to a telegraph operator or a short wave radio operator, that that is one piece of a retrotopia that will not be restored to 19th century. (Just like medical knowledge will not be replaced with 19th century approaches to anesthesia or sterile operation conditions. Note that the story included a 24 hour flu but not a complicated birth requiring a C-section) In short, progress does happen. But in our age of the irrational cult of progress, your story is a refreshing move back toward the truth. As we discover a fairly complete story of the basic mechanisms by which our universe works, there becomes fewer technological advances that improve our lives compared with the number that only improve some corporation's earnings. <br><br>--The military aspect is fascinating. I totally agree with your assessment that the military implications of our resource and environmental predicament are some of the most important and hard to predict. I personally suspect that in a resource constrained era, the most successful militaries will be a pyramid with a small amount of very high tech units coordinated with a larger amount of mechanized units, coordinated with an even larger amount of low tech highly adaptable units. But war will be totally different than any earlier war because communication and imaging technologies will make a very different combination of knowledge/ignorance and capability. Note, this is not faith in progress. It is an observation that we won't forget things that are highly useful for achieving victory. (One side note: guerrilla warfare can be very effective against an economically superior power trying to control a less economically productive country. But it doesn't stop a militarily superior but economically inferior power from rolling in, plundering what they want, and returning home. An economically successful country has to have a military capable of repelling possible invaders or diplomatic ways of avoiding being invaded. There isn't much other option. Indeed, you only need to make it economically disadvantageous for an invader, but the more needy the invader, the more it takes to deter them with this method.)<br><br>--I particularly like the way you leave the questions of "efficiency measured by what output compared with what input" unanswered. Because answers about human and ecosystem well being compared with time and material resources are hard for people to hear unless they discover them for themselves. And the ludicrousness of optimizing corporate earnings with respect to only time is so obvious that only the most dogmatic and mindless civic religions could possibly believe it.<br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c332365428504394305 title="comment permalink">8/18/16, 6:55 PM</a><br><br>

I'm reading the _Folly of Fools_ by Robert Trivers. The general subject is self-deception, its benefits and costs. He assumes it must have some benefits in order to have evolved. In one chapter he discusses the metaphors used to describe the behavior of the stock market in news<br>. He divides these into 'agent' metaphors such as 'the Dow climbed higher' vs. object metaphors such as 'General Mills dropped to 100 per share.' He claims that agent metaphors influence us to think that the trend will continue, while object metaphors do not. Further, he notices that agent metaphors are more commonly used to describe up trends. He leaves open the question of whether this is deliberate manipulation. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c1537165657042675567 title="comment permalink">8/18/16, 7:42 PM</a><br><br>

Williamson, in which a planetary government on Earth attempts to undermine and overthrow an otherwise peaceful, prosperous and, most importantly, independent (politically and economically) world - Freehold - that has rescources the Earth government wants. <br><br>The tactic the Earth government uses, is to destabilise Freehold by engineering a mass movement of people liberally seeded with criminals and 'undesirables'. Think; round up all the homeless, the troublemakers, clean out the prisons, put them all on ships and send them to Freehold as 'refugees'. Then, when things are good and chaotic, send in "peacekeepers" to "restore order". The Freeholders win eventually, but only after a long, bitter struggle reminiscent of the defensive strategy Colonel Pappas outlined several chapters ago, and their once prosperous society is left in ruins from which they have to rebuild.<br><br>I couldn't help noticing the similarities between Freehold and the Lakeland Republic, and the relationship each has with the Earth government and the I.M.F., respectively. I can see the I.M.F. using the war between the Confederacy and Texas as an opportunity to undermine Lakeland in the manner described above, as Lakeland represents a viable alternative to their economic hegemony - one that the other republics are beginning to take notice of - and is therefore a threat that needs to be dealt with before it spreads. <br><br>How Lakeland copes with a massive influx of people who don't share their culture (new as it is) and may not want to settle permanently, just shelter until the shooting stops, will be interesting both in the context of the story but also in the real world as such mass-refugee movements are likely to become quite common over the next couple of decades.<br><br>Cheers!

You might be pleased to know that I'm discussing a nonfiction title on the same subject right now with New Society Publishers. <br><br>Patricia, why not post an invitation now, and get the planning done early? With regard to Africa, given the way that Western nations and now China have stripped the continent of everything that isn't nailed down, I don't expect to see many African nations leave the basket case category for most of a century yet. Thanks for the update on fracking; yes, and it's just going to get worse...<br><br>Mustard, I've long had the suspicion that if Putin were to visit Alabama, he would make a lot of friends very quickly. <br><br>Gregg, agreed -- it's a town and a region that's gotten the short end of the stick for a very, very long time, and that has consequences. I had no expectations of becoming 'from here', which probably helped. <br><br>Peter, well, then I'd say you might consider advocating for it! The story should be out in book form for the Christmas trade, if you think that might help. <br><br>Bruno, good. That sense of dizziness is actually one of the things I've been trying to achieve -- it's crucial, it seems to me, to break out of the common delusion that everything's going to stay as it is today for the imaginable future!<br><br>Don, excellent. When the consumers of highbrow trash insist that science fiction, say, is "written to a formula," they're demonstrating that they don't know enough to have an informed opinion. A lot of science fiction is; so is a lot of other fiction, including a lot of highbrow trash. The best SF, like the best of all other modes of fiction, transcends formula. <i>Dune</i> isn't a formulaic novel, for example; neither is <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i>, or dozens of other major SF novels I can name. The same can be said for every other genre, including mystery, romance, and so on. <br><br>Toomas, you're most welcome; you raised a valid question and I saw a convenient way to insert the answer. As for Mr. MacElroy, yep -- he can tell you exactly which Confederate regiments each of his ancestors fought in, which battles, etc. I know people here in Cumberland who can do that right now. <br><br>Gwizard43, the World Bank still exists in 2065 because it was taken out of the cold stiffening hands of the US and put to work in the interests of Chinese global hegemony, of course. In this future history Brazil is the new upstart power; Russia has quietly pursued its own interests, spending the last fifty years building a network of alliances and client states in the Middle East, and financing its own projects without World Bank interference. <br><br>David, excellent! As a lifelong pedestrian and bus rider, I've felt that gap in time consciousness myself from the other side -- all these people rushing by in a frantic hurry, while I stroll along, knowing that each of us is going to get to our own funeral just as quickly as the other. <br><br>Toomas, the Lakeland Republic assigns domestic counterintelligence to the national police, as Canada did, and for much the same reason. Since the level of discontent with Lakeland government policies is fairly low -- this is a common consequence of having a lively democratic society where most points of view have a voice in the legislature, few people are very poor, and jobs at decent wages are easy to come by -- they simply don't have to worry that much about subversion. BTW, thank you for the Slobovskaya Gazyeta -- it's been many years since my high school Russian classes, but that still got a laugh.<br><br><a href=#c2208533168424976621 title="comment permalink">8/18/16, 8:17 PM</a><br><br>

Here in Germany for instance the AfD, only a few years old, is in the throes of a power struggle at the top that may see it split; given that even in its present shape it is scraping the 5% threshold needed to get into parliament that's not encouraging for its future. Paleocons in the Buchanan mold strike me as a surer bet.<br><br>OTOH those who think Europe is a spent force about to go gently into that good night have a thing coming for them. Americans in particular cannot quite wrap their head around the fact that Europe is and always has been a charnel house. In the mid-20th century 40 million died here in about as many years; more people died in some WWI battles than in your entire military history, something I don't believe you can really process but which for us is a natural fact. After such a gorging, epic even by european standards, the beast needed a longer than usual rest but it is neither dead nor dying, merely sleeping, like a continent-sized R'lyeh, and right now it is awakening. It is also armed to the teeth, esp. if you count Russia as part of Europe, and still the world's weapon factory.

By the way, there is no such thing as "the white race." That's an arbitrary label for a heterogeneous assortment of ethnic groups that have nothing in common except light-colored skins and the absence of an epicanthic fold over the eye -- and it's high time that the label got retired. <br><br>Synthase, I'm delighted to hear it!

By my calculation there will still be plenty of industrial capacity available to build petroleum infrastructure, though not enough to do that and maintain current consumer-based production -- so many of the consumer goods have gone away, while oil pipelines are still available. Give it another fifty to seventy-five years and that may no longer be the case, but that's outside the ambit of this story. <br><br>Josh, thanks for the link.

I don't make many predictions, because history shows that most predictions fail; sheer random chance gets in the way far too often.

The Trump phenomenon, like the Sanders revolt (turned back by the Dems only by way of serious vote fraud), are symptoms of that awareness, but the political themes of the next thirty to forty years are only just beginning to take shape; I want to toss some ideas into the inevitable debate.<br><br><a href=#c3464869154307902185 title="comment permalink">8/18/16, 9:51 PM</a><br><br>

If you mean by that, though, that everything newer is better, or that we can expect and endless series of such improvements -- which are common meanings of that phrase -- then there's a bridge in New York I'd like to sell you. <br><br>I don't recall mentioning anywhere that the Kessler syndrome was going to take out the metanet, though it'll certainly mess up quite a range of other things! As for military technology, though, keep in mind that new technologies always mean new vulnerabilities, and one of the core theses of this story -- and of the case I'm making here more generally -- is that very often, at this point in the filling up of notional space, the vulnerabilities outweigh the advantages. That's why, in the discussion of military affairs, it's mentioned that the Lakeland Republic army has made a specialty out of monkeywrenching high-tech military gimmickry using low-cost methods, to worsen the economic impact. Of course there's also the far from minor point that the Lakeland Republic in 2065 has very little that an invader would want -- no oil, next to no coal left, no significant mineral deposits, etc. So its strategy is well designed for its needs. <br><br>Rita, fascinating. I may need to get that book. <br><br>Bootstrapper, I'm not sure whether it'll come into the story, but the obvious strategy for the Lakeland government is, first, to maintain its current immigration policy -- you can get in only if there are citizens willing to sponsor you and guarantee that you won't become a public burden -- and maintain the integrity of its borders, using armed force if necessary. If Lakeland feels that humanitarian assistance is appropriate, as I'm sure it will, it can be provided on the Confederate side of the border, and attempts by the Confederate government to get noncombatants to flee to Lakeland to reduce the economic burden on the Confederate economy can be treated as the violation of Lakeland's neutrality that it is. Refugees from the war zone would be best accommodated in the Confederate states along the Atlantic coast, where they'll be out of harm's way, and international aid can reach them just as efficiently there as elsewhere. Texan refugees, by the same measure, have plenty of territory to the west in which to evacuate. <br><br>That is to say, the notion that refugees have some kind of inherent right to go wherever they wish, irrespective of laws or the concerns of the people who already live there, is one I reject completely. Do refugees deserve compassion? Yes, if they're fleeing a war zone or the like -- but compassion, like charity, begins at home. <br><br>Olivier, the alt-right is very new, and going through the same growing pains as other new movements. Socialism was highly fissiparous in the 19th century, too. As for Europe, though, I couldn't agree more; a couple of thousand years from now, when people can finally sit back and write a tolerably objective history of European civilization, it'll rank with the Mongols and the Huns. Europe will be remembered as a subcontinent packed with savage, bloodthirsty tribal nations that invaded and conquered most of the planet when they could spare the time from murdering one another en masse.<br><br><a href=#c7765289379953514188 title="comment permalink">8/18/16, 10:18 PM</a><br><br>

And people who consider themselves non-white have no trouble identifying “whites.”<br><br>The Alt Right rises for several reasons. But the biggest reason is that sufficient numbers of people who self-identify as non-whites are present in societies that once consisted of “white” supermajorities. And again, to be sensitive to Scotlyn’s good point, these supermajorities were racially impure but racially similar enough to largely ignore race a source of nationwide political conflict.<br><br>If, for example, rioters with African characteristics are looking to “beat white people,” the racially impure but white looking target cannot avail himself of Scotlyn’s logic by saying, “Whoa, guys, I’m not all white and you’re not all black.” Such good sense is irrelevant in the dynamic of open conflict.<br><br>Similarly, if a political organization that consists of people who identify as Hispanic sights “white culture,” as a dominant and oppressive force, and that organization seeks to bring about social change by making people or institutions it identifies as “white” pay tithes or accept handicaps to facilitate the advancement of Hispanics, it does the targets little good to explain that whites are not white and Hispanics are not a race.<br><br>Inaccurate labels like the “White Race,” will not be going away because their retirement would be disadvantageous to people and politicos who self-identify as non-white. And as more deracinated people are forced to endure disadvantage because they are labeled “white,” self-identifying as “white” will become the norm for a great many people who otherwise couldn’t have cared less.<br><br><a href=#c6094948230903097752 title="comment permalink">8/19/16, 9:37 AM</a><br><br>

One of the key lessons the Russians have learned in the last few years is the dangers of globalization and being overly dependent on foreign trade. You also mentioned that you believe that Europe's most likely future is to end up under Russian hegemony.<br><br>One the most amazing trends in recent years is Russia's comeback as a great power. Only a few years ago, Western analysts like David Goldman ("Spengler") were writing Russia off as a dying nation with no hope of long term survival. And yet not too long ago, Goldman admitted that he and other Western analysts were wrong about that. In fact, he had pointed out that Russian birth rates have actually been going back up and are now close to the replacement rate. The current crisis doesn't seem to be having a negative effect on the willingness of Russians to have children. He noted that the birth rates among ethnic Russians, most of whom are Christian or atheist, now exceed those of the Muslim peoples in the Russian Federation.<br><br>I am also thinking of Spengler, who believed that the next great civilization would emerge out of Russia and the next great religious tradition would come out of Russian Christianity. He argued that Russia is in its late Pre-Cultural stage of development, so we can expect Russia's Springtime to begin within the next few centuries if Spengler is correct. <br><br>Spengler pointed out that Russians have always looked to the South for religious and cultural reasons, in large part due to a reverence for the holy cities of Constantinople and Jerusalem and the formative influence the Byzantines had on Russia in its early stages, so a deepening Russian involvement in the Middle East makes sense for both geostrategic and spiritual reasons. In addition, if Siberia is eventually absorbed into a Greater Chinese Empire, as many expect will happen sooner or later, then the logical course of action would be for the nascent Russian civilization to expand to the south and the west instead.<br><br><a href=#c3079259603532707152 title="comment permalink">8/19/16, 2:14 PM</a><br><br>

I think technically, though, the second from the first would be the antepenneproximate. ;-)<br><br>FiftyNiner, the US squandered any moral authority it had when the Cold War ended and we just shrugged and kept on squeezing. At this point the US maintains its standing in the world purely at gunpoint -- a situation that, historically speaking, always ends badly for the empire that falls into it. As for Russian and/or Mandarin, it's never too late, you know. <br><br>Jim R., thank you! <br><br>JebB, funny -- and quite tolerably accurate, too. <br><br>HalFiore, hmm! That's about what we paid for a 4 bedroom 1925 Craftsman bungalow in Cumberland -- a very reasonable price, in other words. <br><br>Jon, okay, let's analyze what you've just said. Our culture has these arbitrary categories that lump people of many different ethnicities into simplistic groups labeled "black," "white," and so on. A fair number of people in our culture end up identifying with those labels, and now and then people who identify with one such label beat up people who identify with a different label. (If you want to claim that people who identify as "white" never engage in such activities, btw, I trust you won't mind if I laugh long and hard.) Given that situation, you're saying that the only option is to buy into the labels and double down on them, so we can get even more of the same problematic consequences. Riiiiiight...<br><br>In point of fact, those categories shift and merge like drops of water on a hot griddle. Not that long ago, as Shane pointed out, people in the South considered Hispanics to be white and Jews to be non-white. Similar transitions happen all the time, all over the place -- and the categories themselves are purely a product of the cultural politics of our society; they emerged in the early 18th century, as a way to drive a wedge between African slaves and European indentured servants, and keep them from making common cause against their masters. The divisions can be scrapped, and one of the ways to scrap them is to stop using the old dishonest labels. Another is to identify with your own ethnic and regional heritage, not as some subset of "whiteness" or what have you, but on their own terms. <br><br>Thus, for example, I'm not "white." Ethnically I'm almost entirely Highland Scots on my dad's side and a typical melange of Welsh, English, and Lakota on my mom's side; culturally I'm American, specifically the distinctive subset of American culture you find in the coastal Northwest, where I was raised. Those labels mean something, and teach me quite a bit about who I am and how I differ from people with different backgrounds; "white" does not. <br><br>Stacey, read my response to Jon above. The groups you mention, by the way, only get the publicity and the media attention they do because this is to the advantage of certain power centers in the political establishment. It's been one of the core strategies of the affluent in North America for three centuries now to keep ordinary working people of different skin colors at each other's throats, so they don't recognize their common interests and unite to advance those interests in the political arena. By using labels such as "the white race," you're putting yourself exactly where the rich folks want you. <br><br>Cathy, whoosh! I hope we don't get any of that up here; 90 degrees F. and too humid is bad enough. Many thanks for the link; that's very promising.

Chesterton wrote on the subject:<br><br>http://www.solemncharge.com/Library/chapter.aspx?key=GK-Chesterton-Heretics-Celts-and-Celtophiles<br><br><i>When a wealthy nation like the English discovers the perfectly patent fact that it is making a ludicrous mess of the government of a poorer nation like the Irish, it pauses for a moment in consternation, and then begins to talk about Celts and Teutons. As far as I can understand the theory, the Irish are Celts and the English are Teutons. Of course, the Irish are not Celts any more than the English are Teutons...</i><br><br><i>How much of the blood of the Angles and Saxons (whoever they were) there remains in our mixed British, Roman, German, Dane, Norman, and Picard stock is a matter only interesting to wild antiquaries. And how much of that diluted blood can possibly remain in that roaring whirlpool of America into which a cataract of Swedes, Jews, Germans, Irishmen, and Italians is perpetually pouring, is a matter only interesting to lunatics....</i><br><br><i>The truth of the whole matter is very simple. Nationality exists, and has nothing in the world to do with race. Nationality is a thing like a church or a secret society; it is a product of the human soul and will; it is a spiritual product.</i><br><br>The piece also includes one of his most quotable lines:<br><br><i>Who were the Celts? I defy anybody to say. Who are the Irish? I defy any one to be indifferent, or to pretend not to know.</i><br><br>This meshes quite well with what our host has said.<br><br>To my knowledge, anthropologists recognize three races: caucasian, negroid, and mongoloid. These are recognized because it is possible to identify the race in those cases by things other than skin color, such as skeletal structure. Now, because there are only three races, they cover a wide variety of actual ethnicities and skin colors. Many if not most caucasians have brown skin!<br><br>Also, while we're sharing ethnicities, mine is Scandinavian and German on my father's side, Norman and Scots Irish on my mother's.

You might be amused to know that the Theosophists argued that a major new culture would emerge in Russia some centuries from now, and that another, later on, would emerge here in North America. I suspect they were quite right. <br><br>Nachtgurke, no question, the US is very much part of the European diaspora, and culturally an offshoot of Europe -- though it's also absorbed significant cultural elements from West Africa, from the First Nations who were here all along, and more recently from Asia. In a very real sense, an American civilization doesn't exist yet, nor will exist for a good many centuries. If Europe had stumbled, no, I don't think that China would have colonized North America; I think, rather, as oceanic trade routes picked up, the First Nations here would have picked up more complex technologies, gotten hit by Old World diseases one at a time instead of all at once, and today North America would be divided into maybe two to three dozen nations of mostly Native American ethnicity, functioning on roughly the same technological level as the rest of the world, and competing economically, politically, and militarily with the Old World nations on a more or less equal playing field. It would frankly have been a much more interesting world! <br><br>Ozark, my guess is that instead Lakeland, at least, would try to broker a truce among the contending fragments, bring in US peacekeepers, and get the Confederacy back on its feet. Any nation that has control of the entire Great Lakes-to-Mississippi route has effective domination of North America, and the other republics would be crazy to concede that to Lakeland; it's much less problematic to have the Mississippi valley shared out among three different nations. Mind you, it's entirely possible that the Missouri Republic might expand south at Texas' expense, but that's a less geopolitically explosive matter. <br><br>With regard to mass migrations, the ones you've noted aren't big enough to overturn public order and swamp nations, which is more or less my touchstone for a mass migration worth the name. In my future history, southern Florida had to be abandoned bit by bit starting in 2020 or so, and the gradual abandonment of Arizona and Nevada began a little after that; it wasn't an all-at-once thing in either case. <br><br>Bill, exactly -- and I apologize for crediting Shane for something you said! <br><br>Sgage, there have been plenty of eras in human history in which people of different skin colors got along with no difficulty at all, and without everyone turning coffee colored. I'm thinking here especially of the Roman Empire, in which the color of your skin and hair meant diddly squat to anyone. Since the entire color thing became a big deal in Europe and the European diaspora for purely political reasons, relating first to the massive expansion of chattel slavery in the diaspora and thereafter to the European conquest of the planet, I'd like to hope that as the last scraps of the political issues that gave it power fade out, the color thing will dissolve as well, leaving us with a world that still has plenty of other things to divide people and set them at each other's throats!<br><br><a href=#c4926850161422732431 title="comment permalink">8/19/16, 6:51 PM</a><br><br>

We can look at hurricane Katrina to imagine how even larger disasters might play out. <br><br>Katrina gained a huge amount of energy from the hot gulf water, which is why it grew so rapidly and why its storm track moved in a different way than predicted. (I'm not a meteorologist, but I have evacuated for 5 different hurricanes in my life, and 1 destroyed my house, and those numbers become 6 and 2 if you count the hurricane that my parents evacuated when I was still in my mamas belly).<br><br>The government response the entire time was too little, too late. New Orleans mayor ray nagin gave an excellent speech about how it all went wrong explaining that every aid effort should have added another zero. "They sent a hundred busses, we needed a THOUSAND busses.". It was a failure to grasp the scale of the disaster on multiple levels. <br><br>I could go on and on, but if anyone is interested, you really would benefit from doing your own research on what happened to the refugees from start to finish. <br><br>I think though the topic of climate refugees is far beyond the scope of the story.

As regions to its south, like India, China, eastern Middle East, etc. suffer increasingly from the effects of climate change and overpopulation, people from those countries might want to emigrate north. <br><br>Northern Asia and Canada will soon become more wet and temperate, instead of being cold and frozen.

No cotton farming at low wages in uncomfortable conditions is required. Some polyester fabrics are also made from recycled plastic, and polyester clothing can itself be recycled.

Human genetics and skeletal structures are a multivariate continuum with no neat or natural dividing lines. As I mentioned before there is more genetic (and morphological) diversity within Africa than among all the rest of the world combined. Which of course makes sense, because that is where humanity first evolved and is the source of the other populations that radiated out into the other continents. And Africa is an enormously diverse place environmentally as well. <br><br>Studies looking at genetic diversity among modern humans do identify "populations" of individuals that are more similar to each other than to those outside the group. These drop out of multivariate statistical math, and are also subject to a LOT of interpretation. They bear little resemblance to traditional ideas of "races."<br><br><a href=#c2697013915337017210 title="comment permalink">8/19/16, 8:35 PM</a><br><br>

One is that pointing out one's own privilege in liberal circles is akin to christians saying they are sinners in front of the group. It gets you brownie points from others and a cleaner conscience, while you haven't done anything and don't really plan on doing anything to promote more justice. <br><br>The other is that what often seem like acts of injustice, aren't. For example the wage gap between men and women is mostly due to men being willing to endure more hardship and sell their souls for higher pay, as Warren Farrell documents in The Myth of Male Power. And using such specious examples to claim that males have privilege allows injustices against them (such as them being crucified in family court if they ever get divorced and have children, or being disposable in dangerous work situations, or the military, or prisons) to continue with no abatement in sight, in an irony that parallels Jesus being forced to carry his own cross (and maybe build too), while being called King of the Jews.<br><br><a href=#c3818284080762560403 title="comment permalink">8/20/16, 6:14 AM</a><br><br>

In doing this, I would like to broaden the perspective a little. There was a moral failure after the Cold War which was not uniquely American, but involved the West as a whole, admittedly under its American leadership.<br><br>With the Red Bedsheet lowered for the last time in 1991 December, it was time for the West to reach out to Russia, in two ways: (1) Basic humanitarian help was needed, in a situation that was seeing a decline in male life expectancy almost unthinkable under peacetime conditions. (2) Help was needed in rebuilding institutions, along the lines of the help correctly given to both Japan and Germany by the USA and the UK immediately after 1945. Above all, it was necessary to help in rebuilding the legal system (with due exploration of the possibility of admitting Russia to the EU and NATO, either as a full member or as some kind of close associate). <br><br>What actually happened? The requisite outreach was accorded to the Eastern European satellite states, plus the Baltics. Russia itself, however, was left to fend for itself, with little assistance from the West beyond some American support in technicalities of decommissioning nuclear warheads. The help that was so badly needed - to take just two small examples, a scheme of academic exchanges and scholarships, bringing Russian students of law into the Ivy League; and again a scheme for the training of judges, such as the British had in post-1945 Germany - never eventuated. <br><br>Russia may succeed in the long term. <br><br>I would myself respectfully discount Mr V.I.Putin, who seems to me a second L.I.Brezhnev, now proceeding into his old age as the administrator of a "Stagnation" period paralleling the 1960s-through-1980s Brezhnevian "Stagnation". <br><br>Military and diplomatic adventures, such as are now unfolding in Syria, are compatible with "Stagnation", as we see from L.I.Brezhnev's record.

I think it would be a mistake to think that this is an attitude limited to "hill country, USA". I recall the story of infectious disease investigators in Africa who find themselves mistrusted, feared, and (in some cases) fatally attacked simply for showing up to fight an epidemic, when and where they were not invited. Why would this be? Well, how often have strangers shown up in the village with the sole intention of trying to find the best place to insert the suction nozzle of the wealth pump? <br><br>From the perspective of the locals, these outsiders have invested considerable effort to get themselves here. And are we to believe that their purpose was to HELP us? Did we ASK for their help? No, the more they insist that they have invested their own energy simply to make our lives somehow better, the more we must speculate on their true motives. They want to give us medicine, when we are not even sick? More likely, they want to give us medicine to MAKE us sick, so they can rob us more easily than the last gang of outsiders did.<br><br>I imagine that one path to escape this predicament is to appeal to religion: "My God told me to come here and learn from you." Having identified yourself as irrational as well as humble, you might be tolerated to go about your irrational business without interference. If you're surprised at local people's hesitation, just think of the <b>frackers</b> that came before you and poisoned the well (perhaps literally).<br><br><br><a href=#c1051564500327983335 title="comment permalink">8/20/16, 12:08 PM</a><br><br>

The part of the program that resonated with me was not the music (a debate for another day), but the description that the coal miner's wives took great care and pride in cultivating flower gardens. I think this is worth paying attention to. We're all going to be "poorer" in the energy-scarce future, so we might as well learn to find our <b>joy</b> in low-energy pastimes. Growing flowers seems like a good one. There is much to know about their selection and care, and their place in a healthy ecosystem. There is room for social competition and differentiation: "He specializes in scented roses, while She selectively cross-breeds marigolds for new colors, shapes, and sizes, and over there, Their sunflowers have the biggest seeds we've ever seen".

I've been a long time, part-time bus rider, both in the city (Portland, Oregon) and on the rural, north Oregon coast. It's fascinating how different it is in the two different places. The city buses are often crowded and a combination of interesting and entertaining, but the mix of people is fairly diverse and it's not that uncommon to see people who appear well off riding them. The rural bus route was pretty different, with a higher ratio of the disabled and poor--most people simply wouldn't ride the bus out there unless they had no other choice. Mostly cultural, I'm sure, but the bus also was admittedly not the most frequent or convenient in its run times (though not all THAT much slower.)<br><br>There was definitely a strong community on the bus out on the coast. I never really became a part of it, just because I tended to see the bus rides as a nice chance to space out (especially the ones at 6:50 am, which is a time of day I'm generally completely unable to carry on any kind of coherent conversation) or sometimes to even catch a nap. Still, I've generally found the bus a wonderful way to commute and to meet or observe people you otherwise wouldn't.<br><br>Now that I've recently returned to Portand, I find myself almost never riding the bus. I simply walk instead. It's very nice having so much within walking distance. It's far and away my preferred mode of transit.<br><br><a href=#c8269484608128065894 title="comment permalink">8/20/16, 6:49 PM</a><br><br>

On the one hand, local identities are far more powerful -- you'll find far more people identifying themselves, say, as Southerners irrespective of skin color, than as whites irrespective of region; on the other hand, as Spengler pointed out in <i>The Decline of the West</i>, charismatic individuals who can draw together a following from as wide a range of backgrounds as possible become dominant political factors in an era of decline, and can easily sweep aside those who only attract members of a single ethnic category, however broad. Loyalty to a region, to a political movement, to a leader -- those are the nuclei around which social order reconfigures in times like the ones we're facing. <br><br>Hammer, that is to say, synthetic fabrics employ fewer people? ;-)<br><br>Jim, and many thanks for the ornament! <br><br>Shane, heck if I know why it happens. It might actually be helpful, in the broader picture, if more gingers celebrated their really pale skin -- not as something better than other skin colors, but as something unique, distinctive, interesting -- and so got people like me whose skin is light brown to notice that human skin isn't "white" or "black," but a lavish diversity of skin colors, each one interesting and attractive in its own right. <br><br>Starhammer, I may just put in something as I revise. You're right that they don't use private prisons -- and the thing that separates their legal system most strikingly from ours is that they have a lot fewer laws and a lot more opportunities to make a decent living legally, and so they have many, many fewer people behind bars...<br><br>Scotlyn, well, given that I piled into it myself, I'm hardly in a position to criticize you!

As for the rest, though, I won't argue; as I noted in <a href=../../2015/06/an-affirming-flame.html rel=nofollow>an earlier post</a>, it would have been the simplest thing in the world to turn post-Soviet Russia into a staunch ally of the US-centric order of things, and it took decades of stunning stupidity on the part of the US government to drive Russia, China, and Iran -- three nations with very little basis for mutual alignment -- into a firm military alliance against us. <br><br>LatheChuck, and of course that's a core issue. One of the reasons I moved to Cumberland is that there was an organized program on the part of the city government to attract writers and artists here, and I think that the fact that this program existed and was well publicized was one reason we got the really quite friendly welcome we did. If all of us did up and move somewhere, we'd want to be sure first of all that the people who lived there wanted newcomers -- and some towns do, especially if they think that'll help them keep the local economy going. As for flowers, that's a good point -- it's something Carr might very readily note in Hicksville, for example. <br><br>Pygmycory, and "English" means a total hodgepodge of Celtic plus Saxon plus Norman plus refugees from all over Europe -- the days when England had relative freedom of religion and nobody else did brought as wild an assortment to England's shores as to ours.

Fantastic ideas and insights on a subject close to my heart. Thank You, Thank You, Thank You.<br><br>Yes, we may be in for a good essay next week on the 'white' or 'racial' construct topic which seems to have hi-jacked this week. My 2-cents worth is that when I think of any kind of 'racial purity' I always think, (segueing from last weeks discussion on Art!) of Francisco Goya's paintings of the in-bred Spanish royal family, all pudgy, pudding-faced imbeciles, staring blankly out of the canvas. <br><br>https://letsexploreart.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/goya_familycharlesiv_sized.jpg<br><br> It's never seemed like a good idea to me. BTW: The human genome will never let us 'evolve' to one common coffee colored sameness. It likes variation and experimentation too much. It also likes nostalgia from time to time; my husband looks nothing like his immediate family or the previous 2-3 generations that we have photos of, but is the spitting image of Dutch ancestors 10 generations back. He's lucky that they were wealthy enough to have portraits painted of themselves which are now hanging in the City Museum of New York, ("Hey, that's D. in a pilgrim hat!!"). I've, (haven't we all) seen and known many other 'throw-backs' among friends and acquaintances. IMHO: mixing it up and having many ancestral 'bloodlines' to call upon is a great thing. <br><br>I have no idea what (in that sense) I am, as my family were among those who came to America to re-invent themselves and this did not stop at the door of ethnic heritage. My cousin has always loved Native American cultures and due to a gap of ancestral knowledge on her mother's side, she figures she might be, (OK - IS) part Cherokee. Due to another gap on my Great Grandfather's side and his love of Russian culture and history, my son has declared himself of Russian extraction. That same gap rendered my uncle solid German, (unlike the rest of us.) Having lived in and loved Hong Kong - I'm declaring honorary Chinese. My sister is Irish and Swedish. Going through one of those DNA tests would ruin it for all of us. No, we'll never do that.<br><br><a href=#c4471172262141023559 title="comment permalink">8/21/16, 9:29 AM</a><br><br>

It would be wonderfully romantic for Carr to stay with Melanie and enjoy a new life in LLR, but in the broader scheme of things, I do hope (and now expect) he returns to AR to help his new president, Montrose, with the knowledge he's gleaned. <br><br>Soooo many thanks, JMG for sharing this story with us in these installments. It has been enlightening and a real treat.<br><br>Additionally:<br><br>Glenn: The best cold-weather and rainproof coat I have is my old Barbour oil jacket. Cotton canvas treated / coated in oil. Totally waterproof, lightweight and yet keeps me warm in the snow all day. It works much better than any of the synthetics I've tried. As I work now frying chicken in a deli 2 days a week, (10% cooking, 90% cleaning oil off of every surface), I can attest that 'treating' any cloth or fabric in oil that will never come out is dead-easy!<br><br>As for American food being the worst: As a recent returnee, hand in the air: I have noticed a difference. The fresh meats and produce are kind of bland, less flavorful than what I was used to in Hong Kong. Is this a result of GMO or factory farming? I don't know why this is. And of course anything even slightly pre-prepared is chock full of sugar, corn syrup or some sort of sweeteners. Inedible for us, so far. OTOH: Our tap water is amazing, (from an underground aquifer, run off from the Tetons and Absaroka mountains in WY. Luckily, no fracking in our area.) Growing as much of our own food as we can is a definite must.<br><br>RE: Russia: I was not as politically aware at the time, but I do remember the break up and being aware through the news and mostly a few friends who were in 'expanding business opportunities' that as soon as the iron curtain fell, US businesses went in to "help", like carpet-baggers to carve up the entire region. I guess at that time, the path of the economic hit-men was well worn and the go-to strategy for our leaders. No actually helping them was the furthest thing from what happened or was intended. <br><br>The IMF &amp; WB IMHO; are not in thrall to the US or any nation, but to themselves and whatever wealth cabal of internationalists, (be they companies or individuals) that can be served and of service to themselves. I don't think these two would collapse just because the US does, (apropos to your backstory.)<br><br><br><a href=#c5427251094135457145 title="comment permalink">8/21/16, 10:20 AM</a><br><br>

Beware of dualistic thinking. It can mean they revere their ancestors of what ever racial construct they are.

And just because someone reveres their ancestor, doesn't mean that your ancestors are inferior.

I will try to post a map on the Green Wizard site. (I tried out Google Maps with the coordinates presented me a few years ago, and it was about five kilometers off. I'll see if I can obtain better coordinates.)<br><br>There are two paths up, both from the south of the mountain. They have a Facebook page, which appears to be entirely in Japanese: https://www.facebook.com/Asakawa-Kompira-shrine-402489516435190/ (I don't do Facebook, so they don't give me a clear view of the page, but it appears the map Facebook provides is mistaken.)<br><br>Here is a recent article on foreigners involved in Shinto: http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2016/05/04/issues/foreign-priests-find-spiritual-home-shinto/#.V7pLWJiLSUk<br><br><br>Off topic, but speaking of "climate weirding," we are having quite a time here in Japan too. It might be ascribable to El Nino. The Pacific high pressure region is larger and stronger than before, and apparently hotter as well. Two typhoons have formed up in the past week just to the southeast of Tokyo, i.e., far north of where they have formed in the past. Just prior to that the winds at our latitude had turned slightly easterly, bringing a typhoon of southerly origins up into Hokkaido, which was hard hit. Normally typhoons come aground in Honshu or islands south of that, and then bumble northeastward along the archipelago, winding up spent in Hokkaido.<br><br>We have had sustained easterlies since that. That is a first as far as I know. Japan now has "trade winds" at Tokyo's latitude (about 35 degrees). For as long as I have been watching, the trade wind zone extended to Okinawa (26 degrees). Constant westerlies are normal in Honshu, as they are across most of the contiguous States.<br><br>The first northerly-formed typhoon followed a course 180 degrees opposite of the normal, and it now sits just south of Shikoku gathering steam in what constitutes the new doldrums. That typhoon has been producing a strong southeasterly flow, sending the second northerly typhoon straight into Hokkaido, where it is now, and has now brought up a second southerly typhoon right smack-dab into Tokyo. It is bringing us torrential rain as I write, and appears aimed right at Tokyo Bay, for a lovely bowling ball bash straight into Japan's political/financial heart. Thank goodness it's not the biggest typhoon we've ever seen.<br><br><a href=#c5892955016885659106 title="comment permalink">8/21/16, 6:31 PM</a><br><br>

I'd say rather that in most of those cases, warmer temperatures caused increased harvests and a population boom, which then had to go somewhere -- and that usually involves some degree of violence. Still, I'd like some of my scientifically literate readers to go over the study and see what they think. <br><br>Caryn, an excellent point! The whole notion that racial purity is a good thing was obviously come up with by people who've never paid attention to animal breeding. Purebred dogs, for example, are neurotic, sickly, brittle, and useless. If you want a strong, healthy, intelligent, and independent dog, you get a mixed breed. In the same way, every great civilization in human history arose out of a mixing of different ethnic groups, and perished when its ruling caste became obsessed with pure blood lines and so became inbred. <br><br>Pygmycory, no question, English is the ten dollar harlot of languages, eager to mingle linguistic genes with anyone who's in the mood. Did you know that it contains words from ancient Babylonian? "Abyss" is one -- that was pronounced "Apsu" on the banks of the Euphrates three thousand years ago. <br><br>Caryn, stay tuned!<br><br>Ceworthe, likewise!<br><br>Scotlyn, exactly. The reaction to Black Lives Matter, and more generally to the ongoing extrajudicial executions of young black men, has been eye-opening to me -- it's very clear to me that far too many white people in this country know exactly what the score is, and are willing to come up with the most specious reasons to justify police actions and denounce BLM, because they know their own privileged status is on the line. <br><br>Inohuri, this is one of the reasons I'm in favor of legalizing industrial hemp -- much less dependent on toxic pesticides et al. and it grows like a weed (so to speak) in much of North America.

I am not sure this has happened at anytime in the past that can be inferred. The three-cell system is pretty stable overall, even if the middle cell (the one that most of the readers here live within) is weak and variable compared to the tropical and polar cells. What is likely and probably even already happening is a poleward growth of the tropical cell, pushing the subtropical deserts farther from the equator. This is disruptive enough on its own!<br><br>We in the mid-latitudes essentially live in the eddy created between the two big atmospheric cells. Since both of them rotate the same way (up on their southern edges, down on their northern edges) there has to be an eddy between them just as you can't have two wheels rotating the same way that touch each other. So all our mid-latitude instability is from the swirling of this weak eddy in between the two powerful direct-drive cells. And thus it is very liable to change the turbulent ways it swirls and spins if the big wheels move around!<br><br><a href=#c2911065058140138665 title="comment permalink">8/21/16, 8:30 PM</a><br><br>

I try to do my shopping early Sunday mornings when the stores are mostly void of customers. This week as I entered the store I looked to my right at the young person approaching the entrance along with me and was immediately aware of his pleasant attitude and smile. It was also obvious that he was bi-racial and I couldn't help but think that I almost never saw bi-racial youth of his age around here in the past. The feeling that I picked up from him, however, was one of self-confidence and wholesomeness--the very traits that any society would want in their young men.<br>Later, in the store as I was checking out, I began to talk with the checker who was a young black woman in her thirties. The subject somehow got around to the death of my mother a year and a half ago. She then told me the story of her mother's death exactly three years ago. They had moved to Indiana so that her husband could have a decent job. While up there, they received the shock of their lives: her mother died suddenly in her sleep. In dealing with that tragedy they began seriously to look for ways to migrate back to South Alabama. She told me that Indiana was OK, but that she was "country girl" and this is the place that she felt most at home. Her husband was able to get a job with the local electric utility consortium and home they came! She and I agreed that most humans have a strong homing instinct and that that is good. (She said the thing she liked most about Indiana was that it just never got as hot as the weather does down here.)<br>Just maybe, the days of politicians being able to use race to divide the people at the bottom are coming to an end!<br><br><a href=#c2682078379698224220 title="comment permalink">8/22/16, 5:40 AM</a><br><br>

Inbreeding is a problem in populations like modern humans that have not experienced it in their recent evolutionary past. It is not a problem in species or populations (including many WILD species and populations) that have been experiencing it for many generations. Inbreeding is in fact HOW plants and animals were domesticated. It amplifies whatever genetics you have, and by bringing advantageous and deleterious traits forward it allows you to select for or against them much more rapidly. It basically floors the accelerator on evolution. <br><br>This "purebred dogs are worse" crap is nonsense. Find me a real study that shows this by someone who does not have a dog in this fight. There are problems with BAD breeders who do not select out the undesirable traits, but there are problems with bad people in any activity. Sure many purebreds have health and behavioral problems. So do many mutts. The problems with purebreds tend to be more predictable based on known ancestry. Mutts not so much. <br><br>Since I know I will be bombarded with random tales of good and bad dogs, I'll tell you about our present collection of dogs. We are down to two. One is a purebred Rhodesian Ridgeback, a magnificent and utterly structurally sound beast, 100 pounds of healthy muscle hung on a skeleton a racehorse (ALSO produced by inbreedng I might note) would be proud of. And his temperament is as stable, sound, and gentle as you could ever ask for. Our other dog is a smallish houndy mix. He is high strung and destructive. He killed our entire flock of chickens in his first few days here. <br>To generalize.. the most popular dog in the US for decades has been the Labrador Reteriever. This is because of the many generations of INBREEDING that allowed the development of what is nearly the perfect compromise temperament for the suburban family dog. With tightly bred lines you get PREDICTABILITY. <br><br>We've had an assortment of mutts and purebreds over the decades. With purebreds you have some basis for understanding what you are seeing, and knowing what health and behavior problems to be on the lookout for. Each mixed breed is a crapshoot. And I can't really say that we've had more behavioral and health problems overall with one group or the other. <br><br>Sorry JMG but your generalization about purebred and mixed breed dogs is utterly unsupportable amd ridiculously generalized. It's as true as "Men are this way, women are that way" or "Black people are like this, white people are like that."<br><br><a href=#c5322187128636524236 title="comment permalink">8/22/16, 7:12 AM</a><br><br>

Still, the Atlantic Republic should be able to lease a copper line from the Lakeland border to Toledo and shovel data down it a lot cheaper than they're paying for satellite. Heck, a couple of salvaged 56k modems over dial-up would suffice for e-mail and such.

Enjoyable reading. I wanted to make a comment about your last post about that cultural environment known as "The Art World". The thing is that the discussions, or the didactic explanation about art seemed to center around abstraction, generally the Abstract Expressionist and in particular Jackson Pollock. The humor I find is that Abstract Expressionism was new seventy years ago and people are still thinking its new. i say this because I got an MFA a few years back. Painting is rather passe in the art world, or rather its not the giant that everyone supposes it is. Yes there is the Artspeak that says you just have to open your eyes, heart and mind to Abstraction and you will see what it is all about. Sure enough, but in my time just in Grad school, painting was just that which hung on a wall. The cutting edge is video, instillation, performance, mixed media (the combination of video, performance, etc.) I know of the didactic talking down one gets in that environment but its also about power, who says what is what. So much of the Art World has a narrative or mythos of the arts breaking the rules, challenging power, upsetting the status quo. This mythos stretches to the Impressionist, the critics who panned it and how the artist is this symbol of bringing a new way of seeing, doing, thinking, etc. BUT it is now the status quo of what one has to deal with in art schools and art departments. It is the way one must work; how is the work changing things, how is it doing something different and being profound. Its also about money, and a lot of money! No one really talks about that, and that those that today are getting into a museum are both darlings of the Cutorial Clergy Class, and Art Theorist but more importantly those who spend serious money. Long gone are the days of artist struggling in there garrets and hovels seeking truth and being despised by the establishment. You want the establishments support, attention, press and the very rich to spend lavishly on what you do. I know that I will be countered in another comment about what I just wrote here. I know I got an MFA, in the Art World there is always an answer to any comment or question even if it has not been spoken.<br><br><a href=#c2391650307903228806 title="comment permalink">8/22/16, 10:32 AM</a><br><br>

We generally raise Buff Orpingtons on pasture, and pick up a bunch of cockerels cheap each year for meat. We thought we'd try Cornish Rock X, which is the usual meat breed found in stores. Just to see. We ordered a dozen of them, and raised them in with our Buffies. First, half of them died. Second, because we raised them on pasture, they took a couple weeks longer to make butcher weight than had we fed them their special meal. Third, they had only a little better taste and texture than their factory farmed kindred.<br>Being chickens, they aren't GMO, just excessively hybridized. We haven't bothered with them again. Too expensive and the results weren't the quality we expect in chicken. We'll stick to our Buffies, who are hardy and tasty, even if they are escape artists and keep flying the runs, the little beggars.<br>I don't know for certain, but I expect the same thing has been done with other livestock and crops, that is, maximizing production size and minimizing production time at the expense of flavor, texture, and health of animal or plant.<br><br><a href=#c4949697887689969514 title="comment permalink">8/22/16, 1:08 PM</a><br><br>

He told me he got out of the business because breeding for traits such as lilac point Siamese and other novelties was resulting in litters in which half the kittens had cleft palates and had to be put down. Of course, for some reason, the household cat genotype is far less plastic than that of the domestic dog. <br><br>With dogs, what commonly happens is that a particular breed becomes popular because of association with a famous person or a media event (101 Dalmatians, for example) and everyone who has an intact specimen starts breeding with no regard to bloodlines. They sell every puppy instead of culling or at least neutering any with inferior traits, as reputable breeders do. They also tend to exaggerate what are seen as the desirable traits, so you get bulldogs with shorter and shorter muzzles and more and more bowed legs and German Shepherds with exaggerated sloped hips. This happens to some extent to any breed that is bred more for appearance than for temperament and working ability. So you there are AKC bulldogs that can only give birth by C-section, greyhounds that can't run, Dalmatians that are nervous wrecks who pee themselves when approached by a stranger, and so forth. Greed vs. common sense. Same thing happening in the horse industry with breeders turning out more horses than the depressed market can find buyers for. <br><br>Most anthropologists now regard human race as a social construct. Look at the "one drop" rule in the American South by which any African blood made a person Negro. Meanwhile in Mexico the distinctions between Indios and Mestizos are based more on language and culture than on genetic makeup. Indios live out in the sticks and speak their tribal language while Mestizos speak Spanish. They may have identical genetics but happen to have lived close to a mission school. I have an American friend whose Mexican husband was rather offended when she pointed out his resemblance to Mayan bas reliefs. She thought it was cool, but he thought it was an insult to be identified as an Indio. Meanwhile, at the higher reaches of Mexican society everyone claims Spanish blood. Considering the small numbers of Spaniards who traveled to the New World, and especially the small number of Spanish women, and the large numbers of Indians the Spanish would have had to breed like rabbits to have produced so many descendants.<br><br>I agree with many of the points made in Farrell's _Myth of Male Superiority_. It is true that men get many of the dangerous and unpleasant jobs. He does leave out, if I recall correctly, that most early cultures recognized the dangers of childbirth as a counterweight. Young men serve the community by going to war and risking their lives. Young women serve it by pregnancy and childbirth, which had a high fatality rate during many historic periods. His other point is that we tend to confuse the idea that men have all the the high status positions with the idea that all men have high status. Just because the rulers are all men does not mean that every man is a ruler, any more than the fact that all the rulers are white means that every white is a ruler. Prestige rubs off, so even the gutter snipe in a male supremist society feels superior to almost any woman he encounters, while even Pap Finn, In _Huckleberry Finn_, an ignorant, drunken layabout, feels superior to the college educated Northern Negro he meets. But the elites manipulate the prestige to keep everyone down.

Ten were found more frequently among purebred dogs, and one such disorder was more common in mixed-breeds." There's much more on the internet (pet insurance premiums etc,) but this was one of the less... colorful references. In the mildest words possible, closed registries and the inbreeding that results, have not done dogs any favors. <br><br>Some closed or nearly-closed lines (like with Arabian or Icelandic Horses) can be incredible, but in both those cases, they originated by consistently selecting for function and disposition in the face of a very harsh environment.<br><br>I've closely known seven dogs, two purebred, and five mutts.<br><br>The two purebreds, were my childhood Labrador who lived to thirteen, and a guide dog line Golden retriever.

I gave her these three answers:<br><br>1: The Amish, who had lived separately amongst the general population for years. I know there are a couple of diseases that only they suffer from, as well as some diseases among the general population that pretty much leave them alone.<br>2: Iceland. Traceable from a certain group, isolated for hundreds of years. Don't seem to have been deeply harmed, outside of a gentle downward tendency in population (more from climate pressures than anything).<br>3: Mormons. A small, self-selected group plus polygamy led to a narrower (known) starting pool than the general population. One would have to use people who can trace themselves from the original Utah settlers (and it is interesting that this was the one choice that my questioner disagreed with me on), but I do believe it has been done.<br><br>Naturally my choices were limited by my racial identity. Now I would point out old-line Tibet, the Maori in New Zealand, the Aborigines in Australia, and the curious case of Pitcairn Island (where a British man (who killed the other men off) and some Polynesian women settled down and their their progeny have pretty much intermixed with each other). The Basques would deserve a mention (as their language has probably aided their internal cohesion), as would other groups I'm probably not remembering or don't know about.<br><br>The conclusion one could draw seems obvious – make the beginning group large enough (or mixed enough) and you can inbreed for a while without any major detriment. Grow the group large enough, and at a certain point it ceases to be inbreeding even if you don't touch outside populations.<br><br>(And as for the Spanish Habsburgs: The Habsburgs took royal inbreeding to such an extreme that they ended up emulating repeated brother-sister matings. While the occasional 1st cousin (or uncle/niece) mating is unlikely to cause major problems, repeating the experience over several generations DOES seem to be deleterious without the occasional outsider to refresh the gene pool.)<br><br><a href=#c4809220428227181868 title="comment permalink">8/23/16, 6:45 AM</a><br><br>

I suspected this may generate some comparison to pure-bred animals as it is our only (or primary?) experience with purposeful 'inbreeding'; But there is a a massive difference in purposefully inbreeding or cross-breeding animals for selective positive traits and bypassing negative traits than there has ever been in human inbreeding wherein the purpose is not to keep or discard selective traits in their offspring, only to keep their bloodline 'pure' in some way. Marrying and procreating staying within a group, a tribe, a clan, a family… The circle of socially acceptable options growing ever smaller until only nuclear family members are acceptable - resulting in, well, in the Spanish royal family or the hemophiliac ancient Egyptians. If I'm wrong, If anyone knows of a more practical or logical reason, please share.<br><br>When confronted with ideas, (in this case - 'racial purity'), my mind generally wanders to "what is the end-game of this strategy?" Which may be useful or maybe not. It's just how my brain works.<br><br>Also, as a former globe-trotting expat, (LOL): I have noticed that an interest in, even obsession with ancestry and heritage is very much a New World issue. I suppose because we are the descendants of migrants who are not in our ancestral lands. We've lost that connection to our pasts that Old World peoples seem to take for granted. I'I always thought it was a purely USA quirk, but abroad, Ive noticed it in Aussies, NZ'ers, Latin Americans as well. And as Rita pointed out with Mexicans she's encountered, I've met several Aussies who strongly INSIST they came from 'Settler Stock', NOT Convict Stock' thankyouverymuch! My Han Chinese friend bristling at being mistaken for a Hakka... IMHO: This is as silly and hilarious as we (USA) Americans proudly proclaiming "Irish" or "WASP" or whatever.

If you're raising birds, that's kind of important. But it's just possible that the mix might have a good quality that you would want in a dog. If you always breed for and select out the same characteristics, how will you ever develop new ones? Keeping some random variation going is a valuable natural resource in the dog population and, since most people do not actually have a need for a very specialized dog, it's a resource that can be conserved with little effort.<br><br>I can certainly give you lots of anecdotes of mix breed dogs that serve as excellent, valuable guards and companions to a wide range of humans I know.

I'm envious of Mexicans leaving, perhaps the bastardization of the old saying should be "(Mexican) go home, and take me with you." I'm envious of anyone who has somewhere besides the US to go right now. Sigh.<br>Also, Mexico wasn't just "whitened" by the initial Spanish Criolo population, but by successive waves of immigrants, as well. Germans developed the mines in Mexico, and that is where the accordion and brass instruments of Mariachi come from, if you listen carefully to Mariachi, it sounds a lot like German "oompah". Irish, Italians, Russians, and other Europeans I'm not aware of immigrated to Mexico, particularly the DF, and presumably are partly responsible for the lighter skin tones. Chinese and other Asians immigrated to Mexico, as well.<br>Regarding skin cancer, I've already had way too many sunburns, and I think my grandfather may have had melanoma, but has definitely had carcinomas. If there is one cosmetic procedure I go for, it'd be a laser peel to burn off the precancerous sun damage. I look pretty young for a pale 40, but I can still see the damage. Maybe if I do go to Mexico, I'll get a laser peel there...<br><br><a href=#c8083924512406330243 title="comment permalink">8/23/16, 2:55 PM</a><br><br>

It is complex and large isn't it? I also rather suspect that the word: "insidious; or perhaps even "grooming" is appropriate to that effect of technology and its impact on social behaviour.<br><br>I saw the quantum launch too in the newspaper. The conclusion that I drew from the article is that the only likely reason that another country would announce that it has developed a super duper new techno wonder communication method for a satellite and then show it being launched into space in the mainstream newspapers is because they know that we are numptys. They really do know our weakness for new stuff and I'll bet they were laughing at us whilst they were calculating the estimates for how much of our dwindling resources we'd chuck into that boondoggle. And they on the other hand are quietly producing working planes, ships and subs. I'm constantly gobsmacked at our sheer lack of strategic vision. We need to get back to basics, but alas that requires too many people to get their faces out of the feed troughs.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c4809675925189751648 title="comment permalink">8/23/16, 3:55 PM</a><br><br>

The article attributed this to the repeated cousin marriage. <br><br>Oddly, some cultures make a distinction between parallel cousins and cross cousins. A cross cousin is the child of the opposite sex sibling of your parent. So the child of your paternal aunt or your maternal uncle is cross, while the child of your paternal uncle or maternal aunt is parallel. Obviously this distinction has no genetic meaning. And, as someone else pointed out, most human inbreeding is for economic or political reasons, not an actual attempt to breed for good qualities. So the cousin marriages are to keep land or other property within the family and the royal marriages likewise are to maintain or form political alliances, not a eugenic attempt at super rulers.<br>On the other hand, most anthropology sees exogamy (marrying strangers) as beneficial because it increase the number of relatives you can be expected to help your family. If your son-in-law is already the son of your uncle and would have obligations to help you in a feud, lend you money, help with the barn raising, you haven't gained anything. If your son-in-law is from a different clan you have a whole new set of people to call on in bad times.<br>Most of this makes little sense to many middle and upper class Americans because many barely feel an obligation to immediate blood relatives, let alone the in-laws. I haven't seen one lately, but it seems like the bumper sticker that sums up much of the last 50 years is usually on the back of a huge RV and reads "We're spending our grandchildren's inheritance." For most of history and in most of the world that statement would put one outside the pale of proper human behavior.<br><br><br><a href=#c903027350233253627 title="comment permalink">8/23/16, 6:19 PM</a><br><br>
