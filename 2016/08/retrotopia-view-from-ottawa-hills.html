<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the twenty-third installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. On his last full day in the Lakeland Republic, our narrator pays a visit to industrial magnate Janice Mikkelson and gets a different perspective on the Republic and the lessons of its history...</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The next morning I was up early, and walked to Kaufer’s News while the sky was still that vague gray color that won’t tell you yet whether it’s clear or overcast. The <i>Blade</i> had done the smart thing and printed extra copies of the morning paper—the stack in the bin was almost as tall as I was—and I watched three other people buy copies as I walked up the street to the newsstand. The Lakeland Republic flag snapped in a brisk wind from the flagpole out in front of the Capitol, and lights already burned in the windows. The Republic’s government had a long day ahead of it, and so did I. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Back in the hotel, I settled down in a chair and spent a few minutes checking the news. Most of the front section was about the war down south, of course; both sides’ naval forces were still duking it out with long-range missiles, and the Confederate advance toward Dallas-Fort Worth had begun to slow as Texan forces reached the war zone and flung themselves into the struggle. The presidents of Missouri and New England and the prime ministers of East and West Canada and Quebec had joined Meeker in calling for an immediate ceasefire and a negotiated settlement of the dispute over the Gulf oil fields; back home, outgoing President Barfield and president-elect Montrose would be holding a joint press conference later that day to announce something of the same sort. That last story made my eyebrows go up. The Dem-Reps had been sore losers in a big way since their landslide defeat a few weeks back; if Barfield had loosened up enough to appear on a stage with his replacement, things might have shifted, and not in a bad way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There was more—another attempt at a ceasefire in the Californian civil war, another report by an international panel on the worsening phosphate shortage, another recap of the satellite situation that ran through a roster of collisions, and estimated that the world had less than three months left before all satellite services in the midrange orbits were out of commission for the next dozen centuries or so—but I folded the paper after a glance at each of those and tossed it on the desk. I had a little over a day left to spend in the Lakeland Republic before catching the train back home, and part of that would be spent with Janice Mikkelson. In the meantime, I had decisions to make that would affect the lives of a lot of people I’d never meet. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You learn to get used to that if you’re in politics, but if you get too used to it you land in trouble really fast. Half the reason the Dem-Reps had been clobbered in our elections a few weeks back is that they’d gotten into the habit of thinking that the only people who mattered politically were the people who had the money and connections to show up at fundraisers and get their interests represented by lobbyists—and much more than half the reason why Montrose’s New Alliance swept the legislative races and put her into the presidency with the strongest mandate in a generation was that she’d had the sense to look past the lobbyists and fundraising dinners, and reach out to everyone whose interests had been ignored for the last thirty years. I’d played a certain part in that strategy, and the choices ahead of me might also play a certain part in determining whether Montrose’s victory would turn out to be a long-term gamechanger or a flash in the pan. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So I sat there in my room for what seemed like a very long time, listening to the faint clop-clop of horsedrawn taxis and the clatter-and-hum of electric streetcars on the street outside, sometimes paging through my notes, and sometimes staring at nothing in particular while following a train of thought right out to its end. Finally I happened to glance at the clock, and saw that I had just about enough time to grab something to eat for lunch before I caught a taxi for Ottawa Hills, where Mikkelson lived. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So I made sure I was presentable, headed downstairs to the hotel restaurant, and got soup, sandwich, and a cup of chicory coffee. Sam Capoferro was playing his usual lunch gig on the piano, and he gave me a nod and a grin when I came in and another one when I went out. Half an hour after leaving my room I was tucked into the cab of a two-wheel taxi, heading northwest from the Capitol district through<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>one mostly residential neighborhood after another. I’d gotten used to Lakeland habits by then, and so it didn’t surprise me that the houses looked sturdy and old-fashioned, with flower beds out front that would be blazing with colors come spring; that trees were everywhere; that there were little retail districts at intervals, close enough that people could walk to do most of their everyday shopping; that the schools didn’t look like prisons, the libraries didn’t look like prisons—in fact, I passed something I’m pretty sure was the county jail and even that didn’t look like a prison. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The houses got bigger as we went up out of the Maumee River valley into the hills beyond. None of the trees looked more than thirty years old—I recalled from some half-forgotten history vid that there was a major battle west of Toledo during the Second Civil War—and all the houses looked better than a century older than that, even though I knew they were all recent construction. Finally the taxi turned off a winding road onto a circular driveway, and brought me up to the door of a genuine mansion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The place was the sort of big half-timbered pile that makes you think of ivy-covered English aristocrats and nineteenth-century New York robber baron industrialists. I gave it a slightly glazed look, then paid the cabby and went to the door, and I kid you not, it opened right as I got there. The doorman asked my name and business in the sort of utterly polite tone that sounds ever so slightly snotty, which amused me, and then handed me over to some other category of flunkey in formal wear, who took me up one of the grandest grand staircases I’ve ever seen, down a corridor lined with the kind of old-fashioned oil paintings that actually looked like something, and into a big windowed room with a grand piano near one wall, an assortment of tastefully overpriced furniture, and Janice Mikkelson. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We shook hands, she asked about my preferred drink, and then sent the flunkey off to get a couple of martinis while we walked over to the windows. Down below was a formal garden, with a crew of gardeners doing whatever it is that gardeners do in late November; further off were the roofs of other houses not quite as fancy as the one I was in; further still was the Toledo city skyline, with the half-finished Capitol dome rising up over everything else, the bridges over the river beyond that, and green and brown landscape stretching off to the east. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Quite a place,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She chuckled. “Thank you. I try to set an example.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave her a startled look, but just then the flunkey came back in with the martinis. Mikkelson thanked him, which was another surprise, and then we took our drinks and waited while he vanished. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’d like to talk business first, if you don’t mind,” she said then. I’m not in the habit of arguing with the very rich, and so I agreed and we spent half an hour discussing the prospects of selling Mikkelson locomotives, rolling stock, and streetcar systems to the Atlantic Republic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ve got one requirement,” she said, emphasizing the number with a sharp gesture. “If other transport modes get a subsidy, rail and streetcars get an equal subsidy. If rail and streetcars don’t get subsidized, neither does anything else. Are you at all familiar with the way they handled funding for different transport modes back in the old Union?”<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not to speak of,” I admitted. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Roads, highways and airports got huge subsidies from federal, state, and local governments, and so did car and airplane manufacturers. Rail? Pennies on the hundred-dollar bill, and then the politicians yelled that rail was a waste of public funds and should get its subsidies cut even further. I won’t enter a market that’s run on those terms—it’s like gambling in a crooked casino. Equal subsidies for all modes, or no subsidies for any, I’m fine with that.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Do you do a lot of export on those terms?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“A fair amount.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Missouri’s gone to a no-subsidies system, the same as we have, and they’re buying my locomotives and rolling stock as funds permit. Quebec treats urban transit as a public utility, which works for me—I’ve sold three streetcar systems there since the borders opened, and my people and theirs are negotiating two more. East Canada? The car manufacturers still have too much clout to allow parity for rail, so no dice. The Confederacy’s still sore about the way the ‘49 war went, so they buy from Brazil.” She shrugged. “Their loss. Our products are better.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I don’t happen to know about the subsidy regime back home,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Don’t worry about it. You’ve got some highway and airport subsidies and a lot of public funding for roads, but no domestic auto or aircraft industries and no subsidies for buying those from overseas. If Montrose’s people are willing to negotiate, we can work something out—and from what I hear, your urban transit is a disaster area, so her administration could get even more popular than it is by getting streetcar systems up and running in half a dozen of your big cities.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All in all, it wasn’t exactly hard for me to figure out why she was the richest person in the Lakeland Republic; we talked over the possibilities, I agreed to discuss the matter with Ellen Montrose when I got back home, and the conversation strayed elsewhere. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When we got to the third martini each, I asked, “You said you try to set an example. I’m still trying to parse that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That got me an assessing look: “I was the first of our homegrown millionaires here in the Lakeland Republic—there’s a good dozen of us now, and there’ll be more in due time, but I was first through that particular gate.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She gestured around at the mansion. “Quite a place, as you said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>During the Second Civil War, my brother and I—we were the only two of our family who survived the bombing of Toledo in 2025—we lived in the basement of a wrecked house in a suburb thirty miles south of here. We ate a lot of rat, and were glad to get it, and so I decided then and there that if I survived, I was going to live in the biggest house in the state of Ohio, and all I’d have to do is snap my fingers and somebody would bring me a roast turkey, just like that.” She laughed reminiscently. “I got so sick of roast turkey.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I laughed along with her, but I knew that she meant it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>‘Did your brother survive the war?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Fortunately, yes—he’s younger than I am, and wasn’t old enough to be drafted by either side until the war was over. He’s a professor of political science at Milwaukee these days—he came out of the whole business wanting to know why it is that nations do dumb things. Me, I just wanted to get rich.” She sipped her martini. “And fortunately I learned an important lesson on how to do that and survive. Do you mind hearing an ugly story?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not at all,” I said, wondering what she had in mind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“This was right after the war, when I was working any job I could get, trying to put aside enough cash to start my first business. I got hired as day labor to do salvage on what was left of a gated community, west of here a ways. It was one of the really high-end places, where the very rich planned to hole up when things came crashing down; it had its own private security force, airstrip, power plant, farms, the whole nine yards.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Now here’s the thing. There were sixty big houses for the families that lived there, and every single one of them was full of what’s left when you leave dead people lying around for four years. As far as we could tell, right after the old federal government lost control of the Midwest, the security guards turned off the alarm systems one night and went from house to house. They shot everyone but the domestic staff, took all the gold and goodies they could carry, and headed off somewhere else. That wasn’t the only place that happened, either.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I heard some really ugly stories from the Hamptons back in the day,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I bet you did. The thing that really made an impression on me at the time, though, is that they didn’t shoot the domestic staff. All the skeletons were up in the family quarters. That told me that it wasn’t just about the money. There was a grudge involved—and if you know how the rich used to treat everyone else in the old Union, you know why.” She sipped more booze. “Rich people only exist because the rest of society tolerates us, you know. Have you ever considered why they do that?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I shook my head, and she went on. “Part of it’s because we give them a place to anchor their unused dreams. Poeple here daydream about the rich the way that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>people in Britain follow the doings of their royal family. They’ll put up with the most astonishing things from the people they idolize, the people they allow to get rich and stay rich, so long as the rich keep their side of the deal. I could get by with a quarter of the staff I have here; I could get by without the four-star dinners with a big tip for everyone right down to the dishwashers, the big donations to every charitable cause in sight, the private railroad car with its own fulltime chef, for God’s sake—but that’s my side of the bargain.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“It gives everyone else something to dream about,” I guessed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yes, and it also pays one hell of a lot of wages and salaries.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I took that in. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“They tolerate me because I live out their dreams for them,” Mikkelson said. “They can afford to tolerate me because I don’t let myself become too expensive a luxury, and they want to tolerate me because their sister’s best friend got a hundred-buck tip the last time I had dinner at the restaurant where she waits tables, and their cousin’s husband works in the garden down there for a good wage and a big bonus come Christmas, and a guy they know from high school just got promoted off the shop floor at the Mikkelson factory and is getting a degree in engineering on my nickel.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“As I recall,” I said, “You get some pretty fair tax benefits from that last one.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Of course.” She smiled. “And I lobbied like you wouldn’t believe to get that into the tax code. Partly because I don’t mind being paid to do the right thing, and partly because I knew it would keep my work force happy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Half the reason Mikkelson products are better quality than anybody else’s is that all my people know that if the company wins, they win. There’s a stock ownership plan, bonuses based on the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>annual profit, plenty of opportunity to move from the shop floor to better-paying jobs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All of it gets me a break on taxes, but it also means that I and all my limited partners do better in the long run, and so do my employees and the union.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave her a puzzled look. “I didn’t know you still had unions here.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Couldn’t get by without them. Of course we have binding arbitration on contracts—if my people and the union can’t reach an agreement, the Department of Labor sends in an arbitration team and they decide what the new contract will be—but the union does a lot of the day-to-day management of the work force. When I need to sort something out with my factory employees, I can pick up a phone and call the local president here in Toledo, say, and settle it in ten minutes or less. They know their jobs depend on the company making a profit, and the union funds have a big stake in Mikkelson stock and seats on the board, so it’s in our interest to work together.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She turned toward the windows, looked out over the Toledo skyline. “That was what nobody seemed to be able to figure out in the old Union,” she said. “You can cooperate and compromise, share the gains, and keep things going for the long term, or you can try to grab everything for yourself and shove the poor and the weak to the wall, and watch it all come crashing down. In world politics, the United States tried to grab everything; in domestic politics, the executive branch tried to grab everything; in the economy, the rich tried to grab everything—and down it came.” She glanced back at me over her shoulder. “I wonder if anyone thinks about that in Philadelphia.” </div>
<br>
It was a hell of a good question, and I didn’t have an answer for it.</div>

CLASS WARFARE!” like parrots being boiled alive.

I'd happily be on the receiving end of that noblesse oblige. <br><br>25 years after communism went down, and 40 or more after any serious social or economic disturbance in the US that business leaders couldn't be insulated from, it's pretty obvious why said business leaders feel so untouchable. They have a long track record of getting whatever they want. And that entitlement breeds contempt. <br><br>But times are changing. I remember back in the early 90s, when I first moved to the US, how striking it was that US popular media treated CEOs like celebrities, great men (usually men), people to be admired. Having grown up the UK, where business leaders were treated with a bit of suspicion and mild contempt, at least through to the early 80s, it was a bit of shock. But there seems to be less lionizing of business leaders here now, a strengthening popular assumption that they are not to be trusted - more Henry F Potters than lovable Lee Iacoccas. That's certainly the case among my 20 something children. I hope that realization grows, and that it changes behavior. At the very least it could help to discourage some bright people from trying to join those doomed ranks in future. <br><br>Thanks again for writing Retrotopia. I am very much looking forward to the book. If it does well, maybe there could be room for an old fashioned tie-in board game, where players vie to take their respective parts of the old US back down the road of progress!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c3182332030065629313 title="comment permalink">8/31/16, 7:24 PM</a><br><br>

It really is that simple. <br><br>Howard, exactly. One of the things I've tried to do in this narrative is point out some of the many ways that the privileged classes in today's America are sedulously knotting ropes, looping them about their own necks, and holding out the other end for the convenience of the first mob to show up. <br><br>Whomever, good catch; I've edited the story to put prime ministers in their proper habitats. <br><br>Mark, hmm! The idea of a board game is enticing -- set up the rules so that you can only win by going retro, but give players the opportunity to invest in high-tech gewgaws and go broke. It might be educational. <br><br>Michael, Berry's categorization is useful but a bit too rigidly drawn. Mikkelson is an old-fashioned industrial magnate who wants to be an enduring success; her goal isn't quarterly profits but the overall growth of her business; she's fortunate to live at a time when there have been immense rewards available to successful entrepreneurs and plenty of opportunity to start from square one; and she's also learned some hard lessons about reciprocity and sharing the wealth.

More broadly, though, you're right; there's a lot of good in the old union system, and with a less adversarial (and immediate profit oriented!) attitude dividing labor and management, both sides could prosper. <br><br>Ben, thanks for the heads up!

One would like, rather, an arrangement in which there are no plutocrats such as Ms Mikkelson, and in which the workers instead organize themselves into co-ops. They should own their own plant and tools. They should elect plain-living managers at ordinary (not at Janice Mikkelson) salaries from within their own plain ranks. They should eschew not only outside management but also outside capital, such as is in our current malign system raised by issuing shares on the malign public bourses.<br><br>That style of organization has been in place in Mondragon, in the Basque Country, since 1960 or so. Mondragon has manufactured appliances, the heavy "white goods" such as washing machines. The same style of organization is been in place since the 1950s in Britain, at a chemicals concern trading under the name Scott Bader Commonwealth (cf <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Bader rel=nofollow>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Bader</a>). <br><br>What we ultimately want for industry is the same feeling that so many of us have upon walking into our credit union. We look in the case of our local credit union at the teller counters - and I presume in the case of Mondragon and Scott Bader industry, at the drill presses and lathes, or at the vats and pumps - and we say, "Yes, I myself own some shares in that, and all the shares are held by people like me - that is to say, by people who, like me, frequent these same rooms, and who share my modest and plain economic interests."<br><br>This mode of organization may prove economically inefficient. However, on a properly articulated theological anthropology, economic efficiency counts for less than human dignity. I here follow the view of one of the people JMG has cited with approbation, analyst Schumacher (a key early figure at Scott Bader). <br><br>Catholic readers of JMG's ADR should note not only that Schumacher was Catholic, but that the Mondragon and Scott Bader enterprises are current leading implementations of Leo XIII's <i>Laborem Exercens</i>. <br><br>I have to admit to not having read <i>Laboren Exercens</i> yet. However, I have dipped a little, perhaps every few months, into what is perhaps the main current online magazine for today's <i>Laborem Exercens</i> thinkers, the <i>Distributist Review</i> (at <a href=http://distributistreview.com/ rel=nofollow>http://distributistreview.com/</a>). <br><br><br><br>Tom <br><br>(Catholic proponent of Schumacher, in Estonian diaspora just north of Toronto; <br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a>)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c5120675270360692196 title="comment permalink">8/31/16, 9:06 PM</a><br><br>

Historically, that's a common problem with nouveaux-riches -- they're arrogant, graceless and greedy, with no trace of the sense of <i>noblesse oblige</i> that comes with old money -- and again, historically speaking, they either get a clue or end up dangling from lampposts. Tolerably often, the old-money rich assist in the stringing-up process, since the nouveaux-riches risk the delicate balance on which all the rich depend. <br><br>Wondering, didn't you catch that? It's hemp paper, of course -- just like the sheet of paper on which the Declaration of Independence is written. The Lakeland Republic grows a great deal of industrial hemp and uses it for paper, fabric, and cordage, among other things. We'd do the same thing now if we had the brains the gods gave geese. <br><br>Shane, this time wasn't precognition.

The whole thing fell apart after the 2008 banking crisis, but an unfortunate side effect is almost no unionisation left in the private sector. Almost all union jobs are publuc sector jobs.

There are a wide variety of worker-owned business models. They are more common than you think. In my hometown in Texas, the phone company is a co op (VTCI). Every year they divide up all the profits and mail them back to the customers as refund checks, which makes the customers very happy. Now, as a business, they don't want to send all that money back to the customers, so they have a strong incentive to invest in aand grow the business. That's why they ran fiber optic cable to a town of 400 people in the late '90's, (yes I know that's progress talking, but hopefully you still get the point, that without owners and shareholders, the business grew and innovated to a very high degree and still sent rebate checks back to all their customers every year. If you want to see loyalty, call any number 956-944-xxxx and try talk them into switching phone companies.). Second example, in the Illinois town where I live now, there's an employee owned steel company. It's by far the best job in town. You have to know somebody to get hired there. A high percentage of their employees retire in their 30s and 40s, and not executives, the regular guys on the floor. Final example, in Latin America there are factories closed by companies that moved overseas, leaving the buildings and equipment behind, and workers took over the businesses and illegally ran them, they suddenly became profitable when the money wasn't siphoned off the top. This led to a lot of lawsuits, in one country it led to a long, protracted application process for legally owning your guerilla business. I wish I remembered more detail about that for you. My whole point is that there are a lot of different ways for groups of people to own a business and I'm sure some of them would be viable in some places in lakeland. maybe there will be room for a few in the novel :)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c1099169644686185365 title="comment permalink">9/1/16, 12:22 AM</a><br><br>

My take on that issue is that when a perquisite or sense of entitlement is taken for granted then the foundations on which those two expectations were made are sitting on some very shaky ground indeed. And I see a lot of that going on. Your Janice Mikkelson character was clearly clever enough to know that she is tolerated as long as the demands don't become too excessive and/or her actions adversely affect other people who are doing the tolerating side of that equation as they are her foundation.<br><br>I've been pondering your recent discussion about the benefits of the page system employed in the middle ages which seeks to address this matter. It is really a very wise move.<br><br>I've had a bit of a rubbish day today as one of my prized leg horn chickens became sick and died, and another of my Isa Brown chickens was also showing advanced signs of sickness and I had to neck her.

The idea that affection for place, for land, people and community is a significant contributing factor to a flourishing local economy is not something discussed in economic circles.. but it follows.<br><br>Janice Mikkelson clearly shows affection for her country, city, home and employees. She is driven by past deprivation to pursue wealth, but she has worked out how to be sustainably wealthy - by reinvesting in her employees, her business and her community. Berry's example of James B Duke, who endowed a university, but drove his suppliers, small farmers, to the wall, reminded me of a story in Annie Dillard's 'An American Childhood' which she mostly spent in one of the free libraries established by philanthropist millionaire Andrew Carnegie. Apparently later in life she met one of Carnegie's steel workers who said, yes, the free libraries were nice, but being paid a living wage would have been much better.<br><br>No doubt Ms Mikkelson is also a patron of the arts and supports Lakeland's libraries, but crucially, she is treating her workers like human beings - paying them well and helping to educate them, and apparently being given tax breaks to do so. <br><br>One of the striking things about Lakeland is its human-centred politics. Imagine the well-being of humans being the central pillar of policy making. Oh right, that was the central project of democracy, wasn't it? Oops, clearly I haven't been paying attention..<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c3739988001585845117 title="comment permalink">9/1/16, 3:35 AM</a><br><br>

They knew that the local populace hated them even more than their boss, and if he were killed, they would be killed, too. And that's exactly what happened.<br><br>When you can't use immigrants because of local conditions, you create parallel forces. Saddam Hussein created a parallel army, called the Republican Guard. Hitler created the SS, who were deliberately designed to frighten ordinary Germans (black uniforms, professed fanaticism and ruthlessness) so that they had zero chance of being allowed to survive if Hitler had been toppled. The SS were a parallel army. Hitler, for good reasons, didn't trust the Wehrmacht, which was the regular army. Wehrmacht generals tried several times to have him arrested, killed, etc, but their attempts were always foiled by the SS.<br><br>What Janice Mikkelson does, incidentally, is what every Western expat in Third World countries learns he has to do: hire local servants. It is expected that the rich, as a civic duty, create jobs for the poor. <br><br>Until the Industrial Revolution, the European rich had servants. Lots of servants. The richer you were, the more servants you had. If you didn't have servants, you were an eccentric, ostracized by your peers. In 19th century France, to be considered a member of <i>la bourgeoisie</i>, you needed a maidservant (Jules Verne's heroes all have at least one servant). With the Industrial Revolution and the opening of overseas territories to colonization, those non-productive jobs ceased to be socially necessary, and they became almost marginal.<br><br>If you read "The Diary of a Chambermaid", by Octave Mirbeau, you can see that in late 19th century France, abortion (which was illegal) was nevertheless very frequent. The servant class were people who were discouraged from having children, since their wages were barely sufficient to feed them, they were housed in garrets, etc. They were the poorest fringe of 19th century European society, just above the homeless. Célestine, the heroine of the novel, is a maidservant because that's the only job she could have, except for prostitution.<br><br>I guess that Janice Mikkelson doesn't encourage her servants to have large families.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c3803565511922244751 title="comment permalink">9/1/16, 3:40 AM</a><br><br>

I was looking forward to the meeting of Carr and Mikkelson. And the meeting was interesting in many ways. But I didn't get the answer to one important question which is: Why does Mikkelson choose to live in a society that seems to have embraced the principle "Progress is the enemy of prosperity"? You may say that she doesn't care much for that principle, but then why stop at building railroads or insist on an equal subsidy regime for all technologies? Why not also get into car manufacturing where subsidies make it possible for her to rake in the profits?<br><br>It is admirable that she believes in spreading the wealth but the challenge (more so for those who haven't ditched the myth of progress) is to do it in a way that does not just reproduce prosperity-destroying-progress. If not, how can we distinguish Mikkelson's charity from that of today's super-rich?<br><br>The only distinction that I can get from this episode is that Mikkelson's is a genuine rags to riches story and most of today's super-rich are those born and raised in privilege. So maybe her sensibilities are different. But is that one difference sufficient to answer the questions that I have raised?<br><br>Thanks once again for this entertaining story.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c4580291848925059155 title="comment permalink">9/1/16, 4:38 AM</a><br><br>

Despite the name, I can tell you that there are not really any hills to speak of in Ottawa Hills, a place that is technically, in formal terms as a municipality, a village, although in real practical terms, it is basically just a zone of suburbia, with nothing you'll find that looks like a village in arrangement and function (although who knows how that might change in a future time as in this story). <br><br>It is, basically, upper middle class suburbia. It's also actually nestled, as it became over time in the past with the City of Toledo growing and annexing more area, largely within the city of Toledo, almost surrounded by it, with the exception of area where it's bordered by Sylvania, another suburban zone that was once a semi separate small city, with its own actual city center Main Street area, that eventually met the growing city of Toledo and became suburban territory for the general metropolitan area.<br><br>One little thing; the Ottawa River, one of the two rivers that run through Toledo, runs through Ottawa Hills, although as it runs through there, it's basically a small stream, which then passes through the University of Toledo campus as well. On the other hand, the river eventually opens out into quite a wide river as it reaches the area of Toledo called Point Place, a unique area in the larger Toledo area, as it nears the lake (and the area where I grew up).<br><br>That area is something of a subject of its own, and maybe something that might have played much more of a role in this story, in this possible future. Being where it is, it's quite a boating area, with a large marina zone near the lake (and Michigan). Local lore tells of the Prohibition era, when, apparently, that area was, aside from being a kind of outer semi separate zone in the greater Toledo area in those days that was a place where many people had small weekend cottages (for fishing and boating fun), also quite a hotbed of, shall we say, underground commerce, involving the import of adult beverages from Canada and some questionable characters. It would be interesting to consider how that area might be in the speculative future of this tale. (And of course, for a long time, Toledo has been, and is, an international port, being where it is, including being a part of the St. Lawrence seaway.)<br><br>JLE<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c5534295276795726731 title="comment permalink">9/1/16, 6:23 AM</a><br><br>

Mikkelson's exposition on the lower orders looking up to the rich interests me though its only superficially similar to what I have experienced. I belong to what the english would call 'village gentry'; and whenever I am in my ancestral village-home, our old family servant is unnerved and displeased if he sees me performing some 'menial' task; like washing the dishes, or doing the ironing. I am always a bit mystified as to why he would do so. Though it is true that the village pecking order is taken for granted by everyone, rich,poor, middling or aspiring, and no one seems to mind. Of course, there are injustices and grudges, but there is an almost-ritualised way in which the village poor make their voices heard. They will often appeal as victims of fate, and emphasize their helplessness, rather than directly condemn their 'superior'. As a former leftist I used to be offended by this 'class - indoctrination'. Its only by spending time in such situations, however, that one realises the cussedness of human beings. Oddly enough, I find that quite comforting.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c4348069071500281313 title="comment permalink">9/1/16, 8:56 AM</a><br><br>

Poeple here daydream about the rich the way that people in Britain follow the doings of their royal family. They’ll put up with the most astonishing things from the people they idolize, the people they allow to get rich and stay rich, so long as the rich keep their side of the deal. I could get by with a quarter of the staff I have here; I could get by without the four-star dinners with a big tip for everyone right down to the dishwashers, the big donations to every charitable cause in sight, the private railroad car with its own fulltime chef, for God’s sake—but that’s my side of the bargain."<br><br>I'm wondering how realistic this is - well, this is fiction, so let's say rather 'how consistent is this fictional world with the really real one?' <br><br>Would people in the conditions you've described in the LR truly daydream about the rich in the same way Brits follow the royal family?? This doesn't seem to ring true for me. Certainly, some small percentage, but would it really be a major social force as it's being presented here?<br><br>The notion that the 'common folk' need 'the rich' to put on such a big show - that they need this particular 'place to anchor their unused dreams' - as I read over this again and again, I found myself unconvinced, just not buying it. <br><br>Could just be me, of course. <br><br>Still, I'd like to understand if there is solid historical precedent to accept such a thesis - and also if there are other historical precedents for similar situations which proved unsustainable.

So taking the concept of wealth in an industrial capitalist society and engaging with it on its own terms, looking at benefits and drawbacks, and how it can be directed into something more useful and less self terminating than it is now is something that may be a pretty unique thing to do out here on the fringes. I'd never really given much thought to the reason that names like Walton and Koch bring such different emotions to people than names like Rockefeller and Vanderbilt. You've already mentioned the role the concept of noblesse oblige plays in managing the aristocracy, and that also plays into the Chivalric codes of the high Middle Ages. But another cultural motif I'm seeing playing out with Mikkelson (though it's a bit early for her), is the role generosity plays among the privileged classes in dark age societies. One of the things Mikkelson seems to be coming to realize is that, as resource constraints begin to tighten, holding onto wealth and power requires becoming an invaluable resource to the community... If she were living a few centuries from that time, she would be catching right on to the mindset that allows a Jarl with a mead hall to maintain the support of the masses by throwing massive feasts and public sacrifices that keep food flowing to the common folk. As it is, her empire probably doesn't have that sort of longevity, since after a few generations, there'll probably be less of a role in society for industrial magnates, but the obligation of the privileged to provide is definitely a lesson her successors will have to learn if they want to have a change.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c1920759429242366041 title="comment permalink">9/1/16, 11:54 AM</a><br><br>

She reveals something about herself when she says: <i>People here daydream about the rich the way that people in Britain follow the doings of their royal family. They'll put up with the most astonishing things from the people they idolize, the people they allow to get rich and stay rich /.../ </i> What she reveals is that she willing to accommodate people's daydreams. It's like the Government of Ontario here, feeding on the dreams of the poor by selling them lottery tickets. The Government is aware that its ticket-buyers - poor, for the most part - are living in a fantasy, and yet is even complacent, is even comfortable, in that awareness. Lurking in Ms Mikkelson is a certain quietly benevolent devaluing of the little guy. <br><br>I, for my part, do not want to see myself or my family benefiting from the Baroness's largesse. Better to be poor than to earn a handsome wage burnishing her carriage-lamps in Ottawa Hills. There is prostitution; and there is work for the Baroness; and no matter how poor we may be, there is a third possible thing to which we can at least aspire, namely work with tools and plant fully owned by ourselves and our immediate co-workers. <br><br>(2) @"jessi thompson"("9/1/16, 12:22 AM"): Thanks for examples of co-ops, both within and outside the USA. <br><br>(3) @"Don Plummer" ("9/1/16, 4:42 AM"): Distributism should not be seen as distinctively Catholic or distinctively Christian. It is part of a "Common Fund of Virtue", serving as calipers or voltmeter for testing and appraising particular theologies. In general, the decision to support one or another religious movement is taken by first deciding what is morally right and then seeing whether the movement under scrutiny backs it. It would be illogical to first join a religious movement and then decide, on the basis of the movement's edicts, what is morally right. (A closely related point is put by some influential 20th-century writer in the following terms: morally right behaviour is not morally right because approved by God; rather, God approves such behaviour because it is morally right.) <br><br>(4) @"Shane W" ("9/1/16, 5:27 AM"): A numerical test is helpful. If a company offers stock options, and yet only a minority of its shares are held by the workers, then the company is from a moral standpoint doing badly. If a company offers stock option with the result that a plurality percentage of its shares is held by workers, then the company is doing rather well. The larger the achieved plurality percentage, the better it is doing. <br><br><br>Tom (in Ontario, Canada) <br><br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a><br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c6793456892194151818 title="comment permalink">9/1/16, 1:24 PM</a><br><br>

It's a lesson that Donald Trump has learned, it seems. I wonder if you had this in mind while writing this. I was able to dig up and read a transcript of his "big immigration policy speech" from a few days back. (It is so hard to dig up anything of substance from most news or news aggregator sites these days! Especially if you want to get information on this candidate. It is almost exclusively sputtering froth about his "obviously self-evident" idiocy.) A surprisingly decent speech it was, all things considered. There was clear mention of American workers being a policy priority. A few mentions, in fact. <br><br>Donald Trump is certainly saying the right things in this respect, although based on his track record as a smoke-blower, I have doubts whether he will follow through on his promises. <br><br>While we're still in the "all-talk phase," however, it's startlingly refreshing to hear him speak so frankly about the plight of American workers. It's also amazing to hear him say he'll enforce current laws. (It's quite sad that for decades the enforcement of current law hasn't simply been a given in national politics. I wish somebody would talk about enforcing financial regulations.) <br><br>I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually believe there's a chance he may follow through on his promises to try to help American workers. Enforcing existing law is straightforward and seems to be within the realm of the possible, and part of me believes he's narcissistic enough to follow through on at least some of his promises, if only because his ego could not bear to lose the source of his popularity.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c8119740187892712422 title="comment permalink">9/1/16, 3:20 PM</a><br><br>

I do think the combination of meritocracy and noblesse oblige, which Mikkelson is a good example of is one of the keys to a great society. It's definitely a common pattern. I recently learned that much of the public infrastructure the Romans built was usually sponsored by one or more members of the aristocratic class rather than the government. If you got your water from an aqueduct or prayed in a temple built by an aristocrat, well, during tough times you'd feel much less inclined to pull out your torch and gladius.<br><br>Although I am uneasy with unearned income, of which Mikkelson certainly has plenty of, I do appreciate the difference between entrepreneurship and rent-seeking. At the same time, I find the notion that humans do not require hierarchy to function laughable. If I got to design a worker's co-op, I would apply Napoleon's insight that men will get themselves killed for a scrap of ribbon and reward more senior and more competent people with ranks, uniforms and relatively modest pay raises.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c8426016315844497595 title="comment permalink">9/1/16, 3:44 PM</a><br><br>

Although no one in my family is upper class, I do have a family member who owns a fairly successful accounting business in the town I live in-he isn't rich by any means, but has a storefront on main street and probably more money than is average for our somewhat depressed area. He's also fairly involved in our town's civic life-on the board of directors of pretty much all our local charitable and civic institutions, and he gives large tips and can go on long rants about businesses (like payday lenders) that he feels exploit poor people.<br><br>By contrast, I work for a large national electronics retailer. Said retailer has about four different posters in every break room about how much they care about you and how the company is such a great place to work-when in reality, they pay like crap, there's no real advancement except into management (which is very cliquish, and which has far fewer openings than applicants), and pretty much every employee is officially part time with the 39-hour-a-week routine (full time jobs are something of a reward for people who stick around a for a year or so and kiss the right behind). I'm a computer technician, so I'm somewhat more insulated from the above than, say, the cashiers, but it does not inspire confidence, and pretty much every employee I've talked too is quite cynical about the company and our leadership. (I remember one time, we where watching a training video with an actor in a cashier's uniform speaking, and someone turned to me, pointed at the person on the TV, and said "Haha, you don't work in a store, why the heck do we need to listen to you?") I feel like, in previous eras, most lower-class people, at least outside large cities, would have worked for employers like my family member who knew them and cared about them somewhat, rather than large faceless corporation that goes on loudly about how much they care about you while really doing anything but.<br><br>And on a somewhat unrelated note, I found this song from Quebec on youtube a while back and feel like it could be this blog's theme song if it were in English.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2V3NrvThlg<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c479377705660633287 title="comment permalink">9/1/16, 3:49 PM</a><br><br>

Ever. I don't think that's as much of a 'thing' these days as it used to be, but they are certainly not the 'type' to do such a tacky, showy thing anyway. (&amp; yes, I do think that THAT says something about the declining relationship between politics and the public in this age.) OTOH: I also see in our little 'Red-State' town in rural WY loads and loads of yard signs - all for local, down-ballot candidates and positions. Zero for either candidate for the presidential race. Since I now work in a decidedly working-class venue, I can say with some authority: my fellow grocery clerks and food preparers HATE both candidates. Gary Johnson might do well here, or they'll secretly vote for Trump as the lesser of two evils. <br><br>On the installment of Retrotopia&gt; Thank You immensely, JMG. I always enjoy this ride! I do agree with Janice Mikkleson on how we commoners do love to gawp at the lifestyles of the rich and famous. It's a Love/Hate and we're inclined to "love" them if they at least give a good show of being generous and charitable - good people. I thought it was a little weird that she just said it out loud like that. It's hard to say without coming off as a conceited sense of grandeur, hmm, choppy but whatever. It's true.<br><br>What I'd like to add, (as someone who has studied costume and fashion history) is that FASHION has a great deal to do with this. We humans have always always self-adorned. ((An old costume joke: "What separates us from the animals? Why our ability to accessorize, of course!")) Since we lived in caves, we painted ourselves, stuck shiny bones and bits of metal through our ears, noses, whatevers, we didn't just drape ourselves in animal skins, we painted, fringed and beaded those skins, cut them to interesting shapes…We figured out how to weave weeds into fabric and immediately started DYEING it pretty colors. We've always adorned ourselves, AND whenever we could throughout history - we changed, we followed the trends or fashions of the day. We are creative, and this is one way we can express it. We like change &amp; fashion. It's a part of who we are as human animals. <br><br>A big part of the appeal of Royalty and the wealthy is fashion. What are they wearing? How is the cut of their gowns?, coats? How do they wear their hair? Then we copy them. It's as old as human societies and in it's own unique way - it's in every society. It's one of Maslow's needs, (oh you all thought the 'clothing' bit in "...food shelter and clothing" was to keep warm?! Hahahaha! <br><br>So here's me giving a writerly writing tip to a writer, ha! You can flip me the bird behind your keyboard, ignore my buttinski 2-cents, no worries, but I'm going to say it anyway. :) If La Mikkleson is aware of her role as the Lakeland Dowager, Patroness or Matron-About-Town - she would also be very very very aware of and considered in her clothing. She would trust her own impeccable sense of style or if she doesn't have one - employ someone who does. She would also hire a team of designers, seamstresses, cobblers, milliners as well as her train-cook. If she shows up dowdy and boring or heaven forfend…unkempt! in public - it's over for her. She will lose a lot of her good will. Unfair, shallow, but true.<br><br>We love the Royals, Still swooning over Princess Di. We can forgive the Kardashians their vulgarity, They are where they are because we love to hate-watch them, but they know better than to show up in public without full makeup, hair and cool clothes.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c5547769242040140083 title="comment permalink">9/1/16, 5:08 PM</a><br><br>

There was a worn spot in the couch thanks to the simple act of reading the newspaper, and as a small kid I often ended up there when reading my books, because you know, that's where the adults sat to read, so that's where I would be too! Your addition of simple details makes this story feel familiar and comfortable, something you reminiscence about and yet, realize you want to create in your own life.<br>To Steve's point, I'd never thought about how "the people of Walmart" (a real website, that is a true testament to the fact that people today often don't bother to make themselves presentable) would run out of fodder were the environment in which people lived something that inspired them aesthetically. I should have made the connection. I work in a cube environment and the walls are grey. Everywhere. Grey. And as such I dress, in a most minimal effort fashion, in a revolving set of 'office appropriate' outfits that are black, grey, and white, because, frankly, it feels like a funeral to me, so I'm not going to show up dressed like I'm going to a party. <br>As to riches and generosity, you are right, the two do go hand in hand. I've been quite remiss, as I focus on paying off a few things and my own life, to give generously to those in my community who might need it.

The only things that changed season to season were small things like a feather in the cap, what kind of feather, what color, where at what angle on the cap. Boots with buckles, or laces and bows. same boots -just altered, (our ability to accessorize.) Even the poor could grab a nice looking feather and stick it in their caps, or buy a scrap of fabric to make shoe bows. Even the poor could sew and alter the cut: high or low waist, loose or close fitting of their skirts or breeches. Only the truly destitute were left out. Royalty in Europe set the trends on both sides of the pond, for good and sometimes for ill. <br><br>Post Industrial Revolution, fashion in the 20th Century changed noticeably about every decade. Season to season there would be small new things, but the big changes happened only every 10 years or so, with overlap of course. In America, the very rich Industrialists, Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Astors: Society ladies and gents set them. That is why Edward Bernais used society girls to launch his tobacco smoking campaign and thus give birth to the advertising industry. Getting people to buy what they don't even need! In the UK &amp; Europe, still Royalty and Titled Gentry. Then Hollywood stars and starlets nudged into the society pages and joined their ranks. Towards the end of the century, advertising took over and even the paid ads, (models) were superstars we commoners followed.<br><br>Now in the 21st Century we seem to have filled all of the notional space here too. Fashions have changed so fast, so often there really is no overall trend one can find. Consumers of fashion or people who like fashion, are bombarded with everything, like spaghetti on the wall - the design houses &amp; fly-by-nights just throw it all at once and hope something sticks. So of course, nothing really does. You can't show you're the head of the pack when the pack is meandering cats all going their separate ways.<br><br>Interestingly - now is also the time period we have little 'love' for our celebrities or even Royals and often active hate and disdain for our Society Ladies and Gents. I know there are more concrete reasons for this, but I can't stop feeling: We cannot hope to emulate them or their look, (and that 'look', playing dress-up, is a lot of the dreaming Janice Mikkleson talks about in Retrotopia.) or use them as inspiration for our own visual adornments. Fashionwise: they're as confused as we are. We have little to no use for them anymore.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c573302408450614394 title="comment permalink">9/1/16, 6:15 PM</a><br><br>

I'd be delighted if there were many, many more. <br><br>Leo, I get that. My wife and I lived very close to the edge for many years, before my writing became a steady enough income stream that we could move someplace where the cost of living is very low. Life in a nation in steep decline is not easy. <br><br>Cherokee, condolences on your chickens! I'm not at all surprised that the mongrel hens are more robust, of course. With regard to your more general point, exactly -- one of the things I hope to point out with this story is the role that mutual obligations have in maintaining any kind of functioning society. <br><br>Jo, exactly. As I pointed out in an earlier episode, the Lakeland Republic's tax code is set up to reward employers who treat their work force as an asset worth investing in. In the US today, our tax code is set up to punish employers who do that, and reward those who get rid of as many jobs as possible. That's a fine example of the sort of perverse incentives that are playing so large a role in running this country into the ground. <br><br>Vilko, my guess is that Mikkelson doesn't concern herself with the family size of her servants, but they don't get a raise just because they have extra children. The entire Lakeland Republic system is set up that way; because earned income isn't taxed, there's no deductions for child care, no per-child exemption, none of that. If you choose to have children it's your responsibility to cover the costs yourself. <br><br>Don, thanks for the report. I suspect, honestly, it's because we've got a race between the two most detested people in American public life, and many of those who support one or the other candidate are holding their noses. <br><br>Shrama, why shouldn't she? She lived through the same experiences as the other Lakelanders we've met; she's obviously on good terms with politicians, as shown by her first-name basis conversation with Melanie Berger; she has every reason to share the same values as the other citizens of her nation, and she's been able to fulfill her dreams in that nation, while upholding those values. What would make her ditch her values and do something she has every reason to see as self-defeating and stupid, just because it corresponds to some outside notion of how rich people behave? <br><br>KoldMilk, good! I may just put something on that into the revised version of the story: "We don't treat people as resources. What do you do to a resource? You exploit it."<br><br>Shane, that's because their CEOs didn't have to clean out corpses from a gated community where it was all too obvious where current notions of privilege led...<br><br>Sam, if you'll scroll up a bit, MawKernewek has one. There are several in circulation just now. <br><br>Shane, it's the strike and lockout that, more than anything else, turned labor and management into each other's enemies. The policies I set in place in the Lakeland Republic are designed to make those unnecessary by having a third party come in and force a settlement. <br><br>Patricia, the bees are more important than the bumper stickers, no question.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c6265351358770765024 title="comment permalink">9/1/16, 6:59 PM</a><br><br>

That's why the police are getting issued all that military kit, and being trained to regard all citizens as potential enemies; it's also why they're spending less and less time on ordinary crimes. They've been turned into soldiers, without the public ever quite realizing that, and active-duty soldiers by and large don't make good cops. <br><br>Shane, I hope Gray wins -- I'm not a fan of either of the Pauls, by a long shot. <br><br>Jleagan, thank you! I was basing my portrayal on what I could glean from Google and a few other sources, and will adjust accordingly. <br><br>Peter VE, much of <i>Retrotopia</i> has been in exactly the same conversational form, when it's not simply Carr's interior monologue. That's standard for utopian fiction, since there's usually a lot of information to get across. <br><br>Sebastien, thank you! I'll be in touch. <br><br>John, the Cthulhu for President campaign is even more mordant than usual, since both sides are using lesser-evil arguments for all they're worth! <br><br>Mister R., thank you.

It might have saved a lot of people, himself included, a lot of misery. <br><br>Aron, interesting. The one non-Trump sign I've seen here recently simply said "No Trump, Not Now, Not Ever." <br><br>Lordyburd, it's partly custom and partly that servants have a living to make, and if you do their work for them, how are they going to eat? <br><br>Gwizard, as someone else pointed out, look at the magazines and tabloids on display the next time you're at the supermarket. A lot of people in America these days obsess about the doings of celebrities. A hundred years ago, it was the rich who filled that niche of popular entertainment -- every daily newspaper used to have society pages, which chronicled the doings of local wealthy families. It's a common human phenomenon, and so I don't think it's unreasonable to see it repeating in the Lakeland Republic, with Janice Mikkelson as one of the objects of popular fascination. <br><br>David, both of those would be useful steps.

I've shown in earlier episodes that the Lakeland political system is rather more subject to popular moods -- the fact that there are a lot of political parties, and coalitions can be brought down if one party decides to bolt, helps with that -- and also that politicians have figured out that popular sentiment against big business is something they can ride into power. Like every other system, though, Lakeland's isn't foolproof. <br><br>Sylvia, and that's another challenge that every system has to face. As I showed when Carr visited the stock market, though, speculation is heavily taxed, so there are fewer triggers for stock market crashes like the one in 1929. <br><br>BC Pagan, thank you!<br><br>Toomas, well, as I can't reliably tell a papal bull from a holy cow, I didn't notice...<br><br>RPC, as noted back when Carr visited the stock market, a lot of people, even of very modest means, invest in the stock market in order to get dividends. Any time you're making money off money, though, you face steep tax penalties, so the investor class is relatively small. <br><br>Neo, got it in one. There are reasons why the Lakeland Republic doesn't have television. I wonder if the SubGenii have a presence there? ;-)<br><br>Temporaryreality, I wish I'd had more time to offer suggestions! I suspect it's rather too late as I type this, but my immediate thought is to suggest that you bring up reality -- the issues that you've raised would make a good start. Ask the assembled political flacks if they're going to make any plans for dealing with the real world, or are they going to keep on living in la-la land? <br><br>Stuart, one of the things that has to be kept in mind with <i>Retrotopia</i> is that it is, in fact, a <i><b>Retro</b>topia</i> -- that is, a society that's set out to improve things substantially by bringing back things that worked in the past, to replace things that don't work now. That imposes certain limits on the proposals I'm making. Of course there are plenty of things that could be done to restructure a technic society to eliminate extreme wealth disparities and so on, but if they weren't in evidence somewhere in America's past, they're not relevant to this particular project. Does that make <i>Retrotopia</i> flawed? Of course -- and thus it's like every other human society. <br><br>Eric, good. Yes, that's exactly what I'm doing, and one of the reasons I'm doing it is that it's possible that at least some wealthy people will end up reading this and might just take a second look at what they're doing and what it's likely to bring down on their heads. You're right, by the way, that the Mikkelson industrial empire is a temporary thing; she became as rich as she is largely because the Lakeland Republic had to rebuild all its infrastructure from the ground up, and barring another massive war, that won't be needed again. Three or four generations down the road, the company will be much smaller, and her massive stockholdings will be dispersed among dozens of her brother's descendants -- but it'll be a different society by that time, and tier three may be the highest one that's still viable. <br><br>MawKernewek, you may have forgotten this, but in an episode <a href=../../2015/10/retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html rel=nofollow>late last year</a> Carr visited a public library, and we got to see what public libraries are like in the Atlantic Republic through his eyes.

The fact remains that a lot of people are happy to do otherwise. <br><br>Armata, fascinating. No, I don't read Lind regularly, but it almost looks as though he's been reading me -- it stood out, for example, that he used the same two states I did when talking about how idiotic it is to try to force the same social habits on widely disparate parts of the US. Certainly, though, he's talking about many of the same themes I am, though coming at them from a different angle, and his take on the predicament of our times makes more sense to me than that of most other self-proclaimed conservatives. I wonder if he'd be open to getting a review copy of <i>Retrotopia</i> when it comes out; of course he'd have the same reaction to Toledo sexual mores as Toomas, but the rest of it might well be of interest to him and his readers. <br><br>Chuck, the kind of self-terminating idiocy we see among today's American rich is really quite an anomaly in history. Far more often than not, elite groups figure out early on that they have to keep the loyalty of the masses if they're going to avoid tumbrils et al., and do the necessary things as a matter of course. The reason our rich aren't that smart, I think, is because most of today's rich aren't old money; they're nouveaux riches, and those are notoriously selfish, graceless and grasping until they've been around long enough to get a clue. Mikkelson got a clue by another route, and her example has helped set a fashion among the emergent rich; the relative stability of the Lakeland economy, which discourages the boom and bust cycles that bring nouveaux riches to the top, ought to take it from there. <br><br>Blue Sun, exactly. Whether or not he wins -- and I still think he has quite a good chance of winning -- his candidacy is a major inflection point in US politics. From here on in, anyone who wants a shot at power knows how to get it...<br><br>Nachtgurke, glad to see that someone caught that. I've mentioned half a dozen shortages and will be putting in more as I revise -- basically, every time Carr opens the paper, he's going to read about another shortage!<br><br>Justin, human beings love to be honored. The scrap of ribbon is simply an anchor for the feeling of being regarded with admiration and respect -- and yes, people will readily die for that. One of the catastrophic failures of industrial society is its refusal to grant that to anyone outside a very narrow circle. <br><br>Steven, your relative the accountant is an example of what was once the foundation of American society -- the successful businessperson who is active in his local community and keeps the public welfare in mind. The twilight of that class is in many ways the twilight of this nation. Thank you for the song, btw -- very listenable!<br><br>Cherokee, hah! A very good point. <br><br>PatriciaT, thank you. One of the idiotic things about current American tax law is that it's set up to punish actions that further the public good and reward actions that do the opposite.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c2751224674697495180 title="comment permalink">9/1/16, 7:58 PM</a><br><br>

I had the sense that while comments were invited, it seems rather like a done-deal. I missed whatever meeting was held in which exit clauses were brought up (if they were). One commentor spoke a few times about topics like "zero net energy" (without defining what she meant by it), and limiting fossil fuel use (while promoting electricity (insert eye-roll here). One commissioner mentioned, in the "healthy communities" section, a hope for increased efforts to encourage kids to walk to school (so, defining school attendance boundaries for walkability and having programs to improve safety and encouraging parents to allow their kids out of the car. I had to leave before the major land-use chapter was discussed.<br><br>In general it seemed like (and I'll confirm this after I read the behemoth of a document) that the focus is on new development rather than ways to improve the existing infrastructure (so, more low-income housing by creating dense new tracts rather than re-zoning and infill in existing areas) - someone commented that the current plan adequately covers some aspects that new development claims to solve - but you know...

My point though was a bit different. There are two aspects to any individual's economic and financial choices: How to make money and how to spend money. I think that Mikkelson's conversation with Carr addresses the latter but not the former. The only obvious point that deals with the former is that Mikkelson will not gamble in a rigged casino. But then what if the casino was rigged in her favour?<br><br>It is true that doing so would have been, as you say, stupid and self-defeating. Yet, I am not at all sure that today's super rich share those sentiments or for that matter, have sufficient reasons and facts to agree with that assessment. That is why hearing a well articulated justification from Mikkelson's mouth for her money making choices would have made the conversation more complete. <br><br>Put in other words what I am asking is: Does recognizing that progress is the enemy of prosperity put any constraints on how the super rich make their money or not (and distinct from how they spend their money)?

The amount of rage out here in this corner of Dixieland by the losers of the last two presidential contests is greater than I've seen since the 1960s. The abuse that a white person gets on social media for daring to defend any action by the current president or for doubting any of the conspiracy theories about Ms Clinton is all the warning I need. Black people, oddly enough, get a pass even by the most screaming partisan Republicans, because it's a given that they are going to be Democrats.<br><br>As far as signage in town: No Clinton signs seen yet, several Trump signs in the whiter sections of town, and they're almost all on houses that also display Confederate flags or the Mississippi flag and signs for keeping it the way it is, that is with the Confederate battle flag as part of it.<br><br>Of course, it makes little difference what I do. The Republicans could have nominated a giraffe and it would get Mississippi's electoral votes.

Plurality wins or a simple runoff of the top two will knock out the third party pretty quickly. In the US model, third party candidates split the vote of the more like-minded voters and ensure the victory of the candidate who is least representative of the majority's views. AKA spoiler candidate or throwing away your vote, the Bush-Gore-Nader election being a notorious example.<br><br>You could fix this by having a different voting system such as ranked choice (currently used for local elections in Oakland, CA and San Francisco) or approval voting (about which I know nothing) or primary elections with different rules, or an electoral college with electors allowed to exercise their own judgement. The latter would be really retro; you would have to go back to the Federalist period to see that working the way the Framers envisioned. <br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c7438719343666890437 title="comment permalink">9/2/16, 1:17 AM</a><br><br>

If you don't object I have a couple of questions about the future that you illustrate in the story, firstly I have gone back over the last four episodes and made a note of the character's names then divided them into two lists. <br>List 1 Pre Hart-Celler <br>Peter Carr<br> Ellen Montrose<br> Janice Mikkelson<br> Sam Capoferro<br> Melanie Berger<br> President Meeker <br>Velma Streiber<br>John Bayard MacElroy<br>Hank Barker<br>President Applegate<br>Stuart Macallan<br>Jonathan Two Hawks<br>Vera McTavish<br>Lashonda Marvell<br>Meg Amberger<br>Fred Vanich<br>TomPappas<br>Michael Bickerstaff<br><br>List 2 Post Hart-Celler<br>Jaya and Ramaraj Patel<br>Maria Vargas Ruz<br>Sharon, a gorgeous Asian woman<br><br>The Pre Hart-Celler list is quite a bit longer which leads to my first question. What have you done with all the mestizos? If we assume that Trump wins the forthcoming election ( quite possible) and that he comes good on his promise to deport all illegal aliens (less likely but not inconceivable) it would remove several millions, but that still leaves tens of millions of Latinos who hold US citizenship. Where are they? Trumps deportations would likely have the effect of reducing competition for jobs and housing among the working class which would probably cause wages to rise and home prices to fall to some extent.

Re peak phosphate. I work on a dairy farm, and the discussion at breakfast time in the dairy turned to clover in dairy pasture and its companion curse, bloat. The older generation of my employers had plenty of experience, but the younger generation missed out on the fun because by the time he was involved the pastures had been converted to rye grasses, which are fertilised with urea. I can recall my father cursing clover and wishing for some modern pastures just before selling his dairy farm in 1971. For the non farmers, clover in a pasture mix fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere in the soil, and nitrogen promotes grass growth. In a cows rumen in large quantities it can create excessive gas which can cause the cow discomfort, and if untreated, death. Cures include running the cow, shocking with the wash down hose, puncturing the rumen with a large needle(don't stand behind the needle when you do this, folks!)and bloat oil in the water trough. In modern temperate dairy farming, clover is replaced with synthetic urea fertilizer derived from gas via petrochemical processes. As peak oil passes, dairying will have to re-aquaint itself with clover, and bloat.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>eagle eye<br><br>Chris, there is a technical term for the reason mongrels do better than purebreds,<br>hybrid vigor.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c2779950551279155636 title="comment permalink">9/2/16, 3:40 AM</a><br><br>

This doesn't align at all with our experience in creating clothing for historical reenactment for 1775-1850. About every 25-30 years women's fashions completely changed over in style, construction (type of sewing), and fabric patterns. It varied by rural and urban, ethnic group, and state. This is a site we use to research and purchase the fabric itself http://www.reproductionfabrics.com/rdr.php?go=costumers You'll see that the fabric patterns and colors totally change every 20-30 years.<br><br>The style of clothing and fabric used quickly showed what class of person and how in tune with the times you were. City people in early America looked to the courts of Europe to see what royalty was wearing. Rural people who worked all day with their hands had simpler dress, but their "going out to town" outfit tried to model what was in style. <br><br>In terms of fashion today.....well that is dictated by corporations who have teams of people tell us what is next. And the glitterati too of course. It varies every year what the fashion conscious would wear. Thus the trend "trashion" - clothes meant to last for 5-7 wearings - making it through a season and then can be thrown away. H&amp;M, Forever 21 and Primemark all sell trashion.<br><br>The disturbing trend I see now is that 40 something women and men dress like teenagers. A trip to a fashionable mall - the kind full of skinny people - and you will see the phenomena. A mom and daughter will walk by - both with skinny jeans or pixie shorts or yoga pants, and have a matching spaghetti strap tank, or tissue paper thing t-shirt. Fathers and sons both wear jeans and t-shirts with some sort of graphic on it. Thankfully the baseball caps are finally fading among the fashionable. One time my teens and I played a sort of bingo game with it; the winner being who could spot five matches first and it took a disappointing short amount of time.<br><br>It is still extremely easy to tell by looking at what an adult is wearing and their haircut what kind of job they have, if they live with their parents, how educated they are, and if they are "going somewhere" in life or just kind of existing. I think this is why Facebook loves our photos and has developed all this tech to analyze them. The marketing data it produces must be extraordinary and tell them a lot about who we really are, not what we say is so in the words that accompany the photo.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c5199083613713809649 title="comment permalink">9/2/16, 4:43 AM</a><br><br>

I just commented on this to my husband a few weeks ago. <br><br>Living in the reddest corner of WA, I usually see MANY signs and bumper stickers for the Republican Presidential candidate (this is my third election cycle here). I have seen NOTHING for Trump. NOTHING. I still expect this corner of the country to go heavily Trump, but I find it telling that so few people are willing to go public with it. And I don't think people here are brave enough for a Hillary sticker. Might be dangerous.<br><br>I can't vote for Trump. We regularly hire (legal) Mexican immigrants for help with yard work. They are honest, peaceful and most are reasonably priced. Many are struggling to survive, which is one of the main reasons I hire them. The money they receive goes to support the 8 other people living in their 2-bedroom apartment. One county over from us is 72% Hispanic and there are a LOT of migrants brought in to work the farms here. My kids attend a martial arts program in that county and I have a friend whose children go to school in a school that is 65% ESL. What I have learned from these regular contacts is that the Hispanic community here is TERRIFIED of Trump, terrified of what will happen to families and friends if he is elected (they are also resentful of Republicans for 'turning their backs' on the Hispanic community). Hispanic kids talk about it at school and at martial arts, twisting their hair and holding their breath. It's really sad. Yes, immigration is a problem (although I don't see any white people lining up to take the hand-harvesting agricultural 'jobs' for dirt wages and 14-hour days....) and we need to secure the borders. And maybe it's hard to do that without terrorizing other people by villanizing them. I don't know. I sure hate what I see, though.

She's purposefully emitting an easy-going, approachable vibe in her boating shoes, and beautifully drapey/tailored, but slightly sloppy threads. It's a great look, but If I were to costume 'Retrotopia' the movie: I'd be looking a lot at Christine Lagarde, (Head of the IMF). I agree with JMG, from his writing of her position and how she got there, where she came from, the seriousness of it and her perspective and grit. Impeccable bespoke tailoring with just a small hint of flair - like a beautifully batik or embroidered LLR hemp scarf, or a single piece of divinely crafted LLR made jewelry. (She also understands foreign made fashion is likely to rankle peoples' feathers.) And OF COURSE that sleek cropped white hair. Yes, mostly if not always trousers, not skirts. I'd also look at Robin Wright's character Clair Underwood on 'House Of Cards', but without the skin-tight cut to the clothes. And no high heels. I love a shined wing-tipped shoe on women in fine wool trousers. THAT is an elegant, but strong look. :)<br><br>I do like the idea of the more flashy Portia De Rossi wife though. She would be loads of fun to dress!<br><br>@Candace: Agreed. Although, I've kind of given up on fashion around 15 to 20 years ago. The overriding trends of each decade visually express the political and social feelings, attitudes, identifications of the populace in their times. The 80's - a reaction to the austerity and crunchy-granola lifestyle of the 70's, all about patent leather/plastic, big hair, flashy ostentatious shows of wealth, or at least glitz! the 90's - a reaction against that - grunge, and deconstructed/ kind of post-punk: thrift store finds in asymmetrical layers, lots of buckles and hardware. Doc Marten shoes or boots. 2000 - started with a cleaned up version of those deconstructed clothes - all neutral colors, weird asymmetrical angles and layers…. but then as described on a post in Green Wizards - "Fast Fashion" a la Zara, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and H&amp;M took over and a new exciting 'trend' hit the stores and streets every single week. Thrift stores are pretty well tapped out of the good finds. There was/is no cohesion, so nothing is out of style, therefore nothing scan be IN style. The designers and knock-off shops together just threw everything at us like spaghetti on a wall. <br><br>So yeah, not at all decipherable - Hey!

Leaving out the worst things from the past that most of us remember - the Swanson "TV Dinner"; the TV itself, with "My Favorite Martian"; the ubiquitous smoking ("Kindly fasten your safety belts and extinguish all cigarettes in preparation for takeoff") - I pick out three that JMG might or might not want to ponder. <br><br>(1) Cinema. Oh boy. Although we still have cinema, it felt different during the Cold War. Cinema used to be above all a production - even in rather sleepy Truro, Nova Scotia, we had dark red upholstery in the cavernous screening room, and special elegant little lamps along the walls, and lots of incandescent bulbs in the street marquee. Part of what had to be projected onto the Silver Screen was Glamour. One wonders if Lakeland has cinema, and if so, to what extent it penetrates into lower-tier villages. (Here I recall how in my one-room 1958-1962 schoolhouse well outside Truro, someone official would occasionally come with a projector, and all of us kids would stare entranced. This again was Glamour.) - Another part of the pleasantly earnest visual culture was the Home Movie, on 8 mm Kodachrome. - People who could not justify the expense of the Home Movie still sometimes did what Dad and I did, shooting endless 35-mm slides. It was considered great fun to set up a bulky, clumsy screen, and a projector, and show slides, of such dull matters as a Day at the Beach. Thinking back, the slide show seems nuts, akin to Victorians sitting in parlours, handing round a stereoscope with sepia views of Venice. And how <i>seriously</i> everyone took it! <br><br>(2) Postal service. In 1960s Nova Scotia, the mails were as regular as they must have been in 1960s West Germany. You knew for sure that a letter picked up by the rural letter carrier from the roadside box on Monday would reach Cousin Jaan and Cousin Maret in Montréal on Wednesday. Part of the secret in this was the mail-sorting car on trains: the Monday-morning letter probably went out on one of the two or so daily Montréal-bound trains, from the Truro station, later in the day (we had the fast "Ocean Limited" and the slower "Scotian"), to be sorted en route. - In 1974-1978 Britain, I encountered something still more impressive, namely a cheap first-class service. You could put onto a so-called inland letter either some modest postage for "second class" or just a little bit more for "first class".

I am thinking of one person wisely not voicing opinions, thus avoiding being screamed at by the local white OTT 'Republican' voice.

Basil Liddell Hart’s essay in my copy of 70s’s <i>‘Civilian Resistance as a National Defence’</i> sums up some of the lessons from historical violent resistance, particularly guerrilla warfare. Recurrent patterns over perhaps centuries are worth avoiding at almost any cost. (Our youngest daughter is recently returned from her first visit to Belfast.

Your legendary US facility for frequently physically re-locating and subsuming opinions within rolling modernity and novel sub-cultures may yet outlast the chasms of class / minority / origin expressed in gun ownership, homicide, incarceration and health and poverty statistics, where the USA is a clear outlier among well-off urban industrial countries.<br> <br>best<br>Phil<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c6884240003555539843 title="comment permalink">9/2/16, 7:43 AM</a><br><br>

But this week’s installment of Retrotopia hit a little too close to home, literally. I live in Ottawa Hills. This morning I rode my bicycle through the ‘Estate Section’ as it’s called, past a few of the mansions that could have served as the blueprint for Mikkelson’s home in a future rebuilt Ottawa Hills. Over the last year my wife and I have enjoyed comparing the capitol of the Lakeland Republic to the Toledo that we know. We’ve been impressed that you’ve gotten so much of the city and northwest Ohio right without spending time here yourself. Jleagon and Genevieve were right though - there really aren’t any hills in Ottawa Hills, just a small valley along a creek that we grandly call the Ottawa River. You can’t see the Toledo skyline from here. Most of northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan are pretty flat and so you’d also be hard-pressed to get gravity systems to do much work for you. The canals are long gone, but there is one beautiful canal section in a park along the Maumee River with a canal boat, functioning lock, and a water-powered lumber mill.<br><br>I think Toledo is a good choice for a future capital for the same reasons that people built a city here in the first place -a strategic center for transportation via water and surrounded by some of the best farmland in the world. And Toledo is full of clever people who can fix anything that breaks, old or new. A few problems would have to be solved however. Without annual dredging, the Toledo shipping channel in Lake Erie would quickly silt in and shipping would be restricted to shallow-draft craft that would be unstable on the open lake. On the other hand, without highly mechanized agriculture, hundreds of thousands of acres of present farmland would return to the former Great Black Swamp, which would reduce the siltation problem. With the return of more wetlands, waterfowl populations would increase and duck could be an important protein source for the population.<br><br>If, in the process of completing the book, you feel the need to spend some time in Toledo please let us know!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c7416088635515758386 title="comment permalink">9/2/16, 7:59 AM</a><br><br>

I've often been struck by the role unions traditionally had in helping people seeking employment find jobs within an industry, in which a job seeker would go to a union office, show an up to date union dues card, and be directed to hiring opportunities. Many unions had relationships with the management of companies that would give union members preference in hiring, and union membership protected not only wages and working conditions, but job security. Membership in voluntary organizations also used to play a huge role in labor culture and could help members find work. Those aspects of labor culture seems to have gone out of style beginning with the second half of the twentieth century, and since the role of voluntary organizations, trade unions, fraternal orders, etc. in American community life has been explored on the Archdruid Report in the past, it may count as another retro thing worth discussing in the finished novel at some point, and could be pretty easily worked into the events of Chapter 7 when Carr visits the Mikkelson factory (since suggestions were requested). It's all a far cry from today's labor culture of spamming every business in a 200 mile radius with resumes before finally giving up and lying on a Wallmart resume so they don't reject you for being overqualified.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c5216595386716536239 title="comment permalink">9/2/16, 8:13 AM</a><br><br>

Essentially they were created in most major cities in the late 1830's early 1840's. (Interestingly this maps with the formalization and standardization of the postal system in the early 1840's and production of fountain pens, but that is another tangent.) So as the first hints of industrialization and corporations began in the United States in the early 1840's we got police. Huh. (scratches head) I've heard people rant that the police are there to protect private property and keep people in their place, but I never went back and looked at the history and connected the dots. <br><br>The other sad fact I read was that even though their slogan is "to protect and serve", in 2005 the Supreme Court ruled that it is not a police officer's duty to protect citizens from harm.

I watched it live and Trump was presidential, serious and engaging. He walked, talked and looked like a president. <br><br>Of course, the red meat speech afterwards was designed to keep his right-wing base happy. What was most interesting was the fact that he has massively moderated his position (only criminals will be deported now, the rest will at some stage become legalized - no details yet) on illegal immigration.<br><br>Trump has moved to a political space which the majority of Americans would be happy with. Criminals get deported but otherwise hard-working illegal immigrants who have stayed within the law will find some kind of legalization down the line.

Hopefully will get a bit more traffic for your novel.<br><br>Regarding the wealthy, they would be smart to follow the example of what us Brits call "old money" aristocracy. Old Money families might live in a big family estate, but they drive old cars, wear old clothes and happily pop into the local to have a beer with the local village folk. Down to earth, not flashy and keep up good relations with the local community. Its a smart way to operate and it has avoided a revolution in this country for centuries. <br><br>The American rich would be wise to learn from their example!!<br><br>Regarding your views on Europe, I am inclined to agree with you. I still think that the crisis will need to escalate to some degree of violence on the streets before your forecast of mass deportations of Muslims becomes a reality.

In the area where I live, I have noticed a complete absence of Trump and Hillary campaign signs. There are the usual signs for state and local races, but even those seem to be less prevalent then in any previous election season I can remember. There were some Bernie Sanders signs and bumper stickers, but I haven't seen any for a while. Spengler points out the Decline of the West that one of the signs of a failing democracy is that people become more and more apathetic to the point where respectable people cease to take part in elections at all, which paves the way first for the sort of special interest corruption we see on display in abundance and then the rise of populist demagogues like Trump.<br><br>I wonder if the lack of Hillary and Trump stickers and yard signs is because people know that both candidates are widely loathed and people are afraid to show their support for either for fear of triggering an unwelcome reaction for neighbors, co-workers, etc? That's the impression I get.<br><br>I did observe something that I found very interesting when I went to the local county fair. I made a point of going to both the Democratic and Republican Party booths and talking to the people who were volunteering there. At the Democrat booth, they had the obligatory Hillary Clinton cardboard cutout and campaign posters, but there seemed to be a distinct lack of enthusiasm for her candidacy. Mainly, the local Democrats were interested in talking about their local and state level candidates and spent a lot of time discussing how bad Trump is. <br><br>But as Eric Hoffer pointed out in The True Believer, you can't win people over solely by talking about how bad the other side is, you have to give people a reason to support your side. I remember in our discussion of why the environmentalist movement failed, that was one of the key reasons. You can't expect to win people over with doom-and-gloom hairshirt rhetoric, especially when so many of the people in the environmental movement are obviously talking the talk but not walking the walk. You have to offer people a positive alternative and something to hope for. That doesn't mean you have to lie to people and blow green smoke up their posteriors, but you do have to offer them a vision of how things can be better by getting rid of the current order of things and replacing it with something saner and more sustainable, which is one of the things I appreciate about your Retrotopia series and Lind's vision of Retroculture.<br><br>In the course of my conversations at the Democratic Party booth, which included discussions with local Democratic candidates for office, I brought up Hillary no fewer than three times and made a point of not criticizing her, but all three times the people at the booth quickly steered the conversation in other directions. There appeared to be an undertone of embarrassment. It was like being at a family get-together and bringing up a touchy issue like an alcoholic father or crazy aunt.

There were several people there who were wearing Donald Trump t shirts and seemed to be very fired up about Trump's candidacy. The difference in enthusiasm was unmistakable.<br><br>I also had a very interesting conversation with an older lady who is a longtime friend of the family and a longtime local conservative activist. She and her husband both volunteered to work at the Republican booth during the local Fourth of July festival as they have done for a great many years.<br><br>She said the thing that really struck her this year was how many young people came up to the booth and expressed support for Trump. She said the she couldn't remember the last time she saw that much enthusiasm for a Republican candidate among the young, except for maybe Reagan or Nixon. She also said that several of the young people she spoke to told her they were Bernie Sanders supporters who felt cheated and screwed over by the way the Democratic primaries were rigged in favor of Clinton. They said that they will not vote for Clinton and are now supporting Trump. We had a LOT of local Democrats, especially the young, who turned out in support of Sanders and I wonder how many of them will end up voting for Trump instead of falling in line behind Clinton. I get the sense that many of Sanders' supporters felt betrayed when he sold out to Hillary at the Democratic National Convention.<br><br>Like Lord Beria, I suspect there are a lot of Trump supporters out there who won't come out and say so because of the way that Trump and his supporters have been relentlessly demonized by the mainstream press. I suspect that like the Brexit vote, we will see a lot of people who tell pollsters and people they know they are voting for Hillary or that they don't support either and then vote for Trump in the privacy of the voting booth.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c6632973939272181734 title="comment permalink">9/2/16, 3:37 PM</a><br><br>

I've read your blog and your comments here, and I feel sure of this much: they had only one bad day in their entire lives.<br><br>I think I get your point. People who contribute to the common good as a matter of course have earned my respect, and my thoughts drive my actions. In the absence of external pressures or limitations, I will choose to collaborate, cooperate and cohabitate with respectable people, and would expect that as another willing contributor to the common good, I would be deemed respectable and worthy of social and professional commerce. So far, no need for (and no point in) anyone to demand respect.<br><br>When things prove unpleasant for me, I look to myself first and see what I did to help bring that about. Rarely, I encounter pure bigotry. In that case, the answer is obvious: keep it in perspective, or find another collaborator. But usually the fault lies with my either having acted foolishly or having had dishonorable intentions myself. There is no need or reason for me to demand respect in either case.<br><br>I recollect from sharp experience that those who <i>lead with</i> a demand for respect are not the most deserving thereof. That aside, given my mindset, it follows that if I shun someone, then either he has not proven to be a contributor, or proven to be a detractor, or I am too dull to recognize his true worth. If it's the third, why is he bothering with me at all? Why does he not choose to collaborate with those who do respect him, and get on with his respectable life? Why choose instead to be angry, and pointlessly so?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c6820320057239215978 title="comment permalink">9/2/16, 3:57 PM</a><br><br>

The source is mostly Radio Metropoli (local news and public interest AM station).<br><br>Trump's visit to Mexico.<br><br>As some of you probably know, last Wednesday DT came to Mexico City to meet with president Enrique Pena-Nieto (EPN). There are some interesting developments that I would like to share within this readership.<br><br>1. Even if DT may have presented a "though on Mexico" spin in his Arizona speech (I've avoided the US media to prevent mental polution on this issue), the guy came down here as a true politician. Local news report that the guy addressed the migration issue as a "Humanitarian Crisis" for the first time, and reframed the immigration problem as a Central American issue that affects both US and Mexico. Also for the first time, he addressed the elephant in the root that is the gun traffic from US to Mexico (which to my knowledge, Obama's administration has been pretending not to exist since the leaks about "Fast and the Furious" operation came out). Last but not least, he's reported to have said that he will not be rejecting NAFTA, but renegociate it so that US, Mexico, Canada, and eventually the rest of the Americas can better protect their interest against the external forces of Asian economies.<br><br>In other words, the man came to smooth out past insults and seek allies. Not that he's not going to weasel out of any and every thing said there, but at least he knows how to play the game.<br><br>2. The population could not care any less about what DT said, they're just mad at the fact he had the audacity to come down here. ie. People call to a radio show and ask how is it that he's not been formally declared "persona non-grata" already. Furthermore, they're incensed with EPN for extending the invitation in the first place. Our president popularity is probably at an all-time low. People are already comparing him to Santa-Anna (you know, the one-legged bozo who happened to lose half our national territory to the US in the 19th century). I've heard the question "how is it the Brazilians kicked out their president, again?" to be raised at least once.<br><br>2.a. A related note. There was a huge mistake in protocol during the visit. I don't know the details, but basically, EPN received DT *as* *equals*. The political analyst said something about appearing together in public or so, which is a kind of de-facto acknowledging DT as a chief of state. Same analyst claimed that the experience of the presidential staff is not consistent with the sort of crass mistake this was, but I cannot think of a rational reason for having done that on purpose. Whatever if might be, it seems like a big vote of confidence for TP, and another big political cost for EPN.<br><br>3. This is mostly speculation for my part, but it feels like people are now waiting for Hillary Clinton (HC) to also come (they were both invited, but only DT accepted so far), and to be received at least as well as DT was. I don't think she will, and this will be perceived as a rebuff and offense. I don't think this will cause a violent explosion, given that the timeframes will allow for pleanty of time for tempers to cool off; but I think that it will create resentment, and that would set the tone of how she'd be perceived here if she were to win November election.<br><br>4. It does not help EPN that he presented the report of his 4th year just yesterday. The news this morning were filled to the brim with critics for the inconsistencies and the attempts of spinning for positive angles. This and the State Congress giving themselves a raise to match their peers at Mexico City - and a raise that is in the ballpark of the median wage in the State - stole the news this morning.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c3532119943598226973 title="comment permalink">9/2/16, 4:26 PM</a><br><br>

East of the Cascades we saw a few Trump signs, usually medium or small billboards on large farms or ranches, but not many, and no others. We live in Eastern Jefferson County, near Port Townsend (with a significant population of SF Bay Area ex-pats), we are 36 Nautical Miles West and Left of famously liberal Seattle and King County. In the last presidential election, the conservative, rural areas of the county voted for Obama two to one over Romney, and the ratio was _much_ higher in Port Townsend. I see a lot of cars that still have Sanders stickers, and a few houses with signs. A lot of cars with Clinton stickers and quite a few houses. I saw one house with a Trump sign, it disappeared right after the wrath of Khan incident; I may infer the owner was either a veteran or simply didn't wish to publicly acknowledge such stupidity. There is one Cruz sign on the island, it's on a recent clear cut; which says something to me.<br><br>It's my observation that many people's fashion sense locks in about high school, coming of age, or college graduation. I still dress the way I did at 18, but have switched from Levi's to Carhartts because of the pockets. As a reenactor I'm familiar with styles of many periods. Most pre 1900 Western men's clothes are more practical than current, and I really prefer the looks of pre 1800.

OK, how about these three.<br><br> Have an export law that says nothing that is not surplus to the Republic can be exported elsewhere. During the Irish Famine when a million people starved to death, that country was still forced to export food out of the country. An earlier famine was averted when food exports were banned from leaving Ireland. Russia recently learnt that not growing enough food is now a weapon against it and has over the past two years embarked on a major campaign to grow or make enough for themselves and it is working. This export law would stop a self-sufficient Lakeland Republic introducing a major vulnerability in to itself down the track.<br> As another suggestion, how about a strong mention of fraternal organizations. Here in Oz, they were a major part of life with people contributing a weekly sum to such organizations to cover themselves for when they were sick or to pay for funeral expenses. There was also a major social aspect to them and it served to bind the bonds of community together. Members would also be able to help each other out via the contacts made with work and other such matters. All this mostly died out when this country federated and then not long after introduced social security.<br> This next suggestion is not something, as far as I know, part of the past and hence not right for your Retrotopia though I think deserves consideration on its own merit. When people go to vote, they do it in private so as to ensure a secret ballot, right? OK, how about this then. When the Legislature of the Lakeland Republic votes on measures and laws, they also us a paper-based secret ballot. Can you hear the lobbyists scream already? No party would know how each representative would vote and if they toed the "party" line or not. The party whip would be obsolete. Industries and lobbyists could not simply bribe a politician and know that that person would stay bought as is the case right now. Essentially, each vote would be a conscience vote. In addition, anyone trying to subvert such votes would be charged with treason. At the moment, doing so seems to carry no costs for those caught doing so but a charge of treason (which it is) may give pause to thought.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c5990641262958108598 title="comment permalink">9/2/16, 5:20 PM</a><br><br>

Pampered and lavishly dressed, his duties are to see to the running of the household, the education and proper cultivation of the children, managing Janice's philanthropic obligations and running charity drives, keeping the couple's social schedule, throwing parties, and entertaining guests with his charm and musical talents.<br><br>Their relationship is comfortable and proper, and they couldn't see life without their languid evenings by the fire after her tiresome day's work.<br><br>But she has a villa up north where once a month she flies to her passion: her Brad Pitt boytoy she keeps hidden from the respectable set. Mr Mikkelson of course suspects but says nothing, and in fact now and then has a woman on the side himself, discretely, of course. Though really he has no passions like larger-than-life Janice does, and in moments of quiet, he feels an emptiness he can't make go away.<br><br>--- On the other hand, maybe Janice is VERY retro. History shows powerful women like Elizabeth or Catherine the Great have no equal, and they certainly don't marry down. But powerful or not, Janice has a woman's heart, to say nothing of a grown woman's loins. She has a great love.<br><br>She has a Prince-Consort. (Not sure that's the right term but I'm going with it.)<br><br>He is an industrialist himself, though for his best efforts is not as rich or prominent. But he's talented and outgoing, and to Janice he seems positively swashbuckling. His ethical standards are if anything even more progressive and high-minded than hers, and she admires him desperately. They can't marry, for complicated reasons involving politics and an agreement with an ex-wife, but they're seen together universally at social functions, comfortably laughing amid a crowd or exchanging quiet confidences in each other's ears. She brings him along even to meetings with politicians and industry magnates; this is seen as a minor embarrassment, maybe a weakness, but in no other way is Janice weak, so it passes by with only the usual amount of gossip. They exchange near-daily handwritten letters, and in their moments alone together, she is truly happy.<br><br>---- On the other, OTHER hand, maybe she's full progressive. She's bi and poly, and is married to a band of men and women---like a progressive, inclusive biblical patriarch. They collectively raise one another's children. Now and then Janice marries a destitute woman and adopts her kid, saving them both from a life of poverty. The public appreciates this as another admirable beneficence, like hiring lots of gardeners or donating the public a new park.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c2989364333864203854 title="comment permalink">9/2/16, 5:30 PM</a><br><br>

I asked about signage because there seems to be a remarkable discrepancy between this election and previous elections along those lines. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, yes, and that's definitely something to specify. I'm thinking proportional representation on the European model might be a good choice, as that's proven itself in practice on a national level in more than one country. Still, I'll look over the options and see what makes most sense. <br><br>Mikep, according to the 2010 census, Hispanic people accounted for only 7.4% of the population of Toledo, and Asians for 1.1%. (You've missed an Asian name, by the way -- Fred Hayakawa, whose clothing store S. Ehrenberger praised.) My take on the likely future of the US is that the Hispanic population is likely to decline significantly for a while as ethnic strife redefines itself from white vs. black to Anglo (any race) vs. Hispanic (any race). Between that and the class differential -- remember that Carr is a significant political figure and is mostly running with the upper to upper middle classes -- the proportion of names is about right. <br><br>DarkOptimism, many thanks for the link! <br><br>Unknown Eagle Eye, there are plenty of other plants that fix nitrogen in the soil. Do none of them make bloat-free cattle fodder? <br><br>Latefall, I think the US sources are mostly gone at this point; if you want phosphate in your soil, you pretty much have to start recycling urine and feces...which of course the Lakelanders do, as already noted. <br><br>Justin, it does indeed, and yes, I'll be inserting something on that. (The very short form is that you don't have a massive drug crime problem if, like the Netherlands today or the US before 1919, you treat it as a health issue rather than a crime. More generally, the US used to get by with many, many fewer laws, and that was an important part of the much less burdensome legal system we had back then. Passing laws is also subject to the law of diminishing returns!) <br><br>Don, so noted and thank you! <br><br>Janet, thanks for the data points. <br><br>Shane, so noted and I've added 'em to the list. <br><br>James, those are on the list also. <br><br>Donald, there are two more installments, but the next one is the big one -- after that it's denouement. As for the university, the entire higher education system was basically flattened during the war and had to be rebuilt from the ground up. Since apprenticeship plays a much larger role in Lakeland professional training, the universities are much more like universities in the 1890s, say, when they focused on the scholarly disciplines and the higher reaches of medicine and law, rather than providing job training for every imaginable profession. <br><br>David, exactly.

Thanks for the proposed technologies!<br><br>Toomas, thank you for those three suggestions -- they're on the to-consider list. <br><br>Phil, the difference between Belfast and Toledo is that in my imagined future, the Midwest solidly supported the rebel side, and won. It's rather more like the Republic of Ireland, which also went through a lot of really nasty guerrilla warfare in the 20th century but has settled down relatively calmly since then. <br><br>Toomas, please thank your correspondent! I'd been careful to insert some bits about accommodations for the mobility impaired, in the scenes with Tom Pappas, but hadn't included corresponding accommodations for sensory impairment. That can easily be remedied, though. <br><br>T Bruce, thank you! It took me all of five minutes looking at the map of the midwest, scoping out the Lakeland Republic, to realize that Toledo's the natural capital -- centrally located, with straightforward rail and waterway links to every part of the country, and an important lake port as well. I've already corrected the geographical issues; regrettably, I don't expect to get to Toledo while I'm writing this, but maybe I can schedule a booksigning there once the book is out. ;-)<br><br>Eric, yes, yes, and yes. Thank you. <br><br>Fred, another good point to consider. <br><br>David, those are on the to-consider list. I'm imagining an analog computer for orbital calculations, though -- some gorgeous things were once done with metal gears! <br><br>BoysMom, exactly. In an important sense, the supplanting of local old money by national new money is a major factor in what's gone wrong in America over the last century or so. <br><br>Fred, the next thing to consider is how law enforcement was handled in the US before that time. It makes an interesting contrast. <br><br>Patricia, well, I can't comment on the videos, but Sharon Mikkelson (nee Wu) is indeed one of the premier hostesses in Lakeland high society. <br><br>Lordberia, many thanks for the review -- I'll get that to my publisher, who will doubtless splash it around. It would be helpful if the American rich were to learn something -- they seem more or less incapable of learning anything just now! <br><br>Donalfagan, thanks for the data point. <br><br>Howard, no doubt. Probably produced by electric sheep. <br><br>Armata, a soap opera indeed. I suggest titling it "As the Republic Burns." <br><br>Gwizard, so noted.

My primary understanding of economics is that it is a subset of ecology, thermodynamics, energy flows, resources, etc. My secondary understanding of economics is that it is a social phenomenon, a study of incentives. The current system has fewer and fewer incentives to participate, to do one's best. The incentives are becoming more and more perverse.

Even excluding the worst abuse cases, (old stories of horses dropping dead in harness etc), jerking on the wheel of a car in anger, or jerking on a horses mouth in anger have very different effects, even if the emotion and physical action is similar. So how does the Lakeland Republic respond to and handle the welfare of working animals? <br><br>I had the whimsical and perhaps, annoying idea of an animal welfare society subsidizing and selling rugged bicycles at a reduced cost as one of their good works, but would enjoy seeing how your utopia handles things.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c3255115290532048466 title="comment permalink">9/2/16, 9:48 PM</a><br><br>

When I was a kid, we had to make do with the few books the library happened to stock in large print. And there weren't many.

It is an issue that concerns me greatly. I tend to invest in social currency, but it doesn't always work out well as people are fixated on the monetary side of social relationships whether they are honest about that or not.<br><br>I may have mentioned to you that the last people who I gave a tour of the farm to, I did at the behest of a friend. I didn't know these people and my wife and I gave them half a day of our time talking about this place and their plans (they have land nearby). At the end they said thanks for our time. I sat down to write my blog, but they took my wife out to a nearby pub for dinner, and they did not even offer to pay for her dinner or even buy her a drink as a thanks despite the evidence that they were very well financed. And I saw them a few weeks after that in the nearby area and I thought to myself: Fracking townies. True story. I explained their actions to my mate who instigated the visit and he knows me well enough to be mortified by that couples actions. I couldn't believe it that they would so alienate people in the area before they even moved in.

There was some rapid chatter, the farmer grabbed a tin of veterinary instruments off a nearby shelf, and ran out of the office saying, "Follow me. You'll want to see this."<br><br>In the corral was a very unhappy-looking cow. I couldn't tell if it was excessively pregnant or someone had inflated it with a bicycle pump. Its midriff bulged out hugely to both sides, one side more than the other.<br><br>The farmer explained there was a certain weed in the pasture that made them blow up like this.<br><br>He took a needle from his tin of instruments. It looked like a skinny 9" nail. He put it inside a pipe which it fitted snugly with the point protruding, and stabbed the pipe and needle with some violence into the most blown-up side of the cow. He pulled the needle out, leaving the pipe stuck in the cow, and the cow proceeded to deflate like a balloon going down with a hiss of gas.<br><br>Once the hissing stopped the farmer repeated the procedure on the cow's other side.<br><br>The cow seemed to take all of this in its stride. From memory, once it was back to normal it behaved like any other cow. I was pretty shattered. I doubted I could have done what the farmer did.

The Midwest/Rust Belt functions roughly the same as the South did in the 1800s-mid 1900s, an economically depressed area that is a source of outmigration, not in-migration. Therefore, it is much less diverse than other parts of the country save certain areas (Chicago comes to mind). When I lived there, it was decidedly less Hispanic, more "white bread" than the South, save some well established Hispanic communities near Findlay and Lorain. If we do enter insurgency soon, I'd expect most of the Midwest to remain less diverse than other parts of the country. Although, in all fairness, Northwest OH and greater Detroit MI are home to the largest Arab American community, so more Arabic names would be in keeping w/the areas current ethnic mix, unless they were run off or worse during the wars/uprisings...<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c2553597165404314388 title="comment permalink">9/3/16, 8:09 AM</a><br><br>

I live in the Southern US, which was European feudalism transferred to the New World, and we had a rich history of a strict class system. Although the Twelve Southerners warned against it in I'll Take My Stand, we embraced industrialization, and during the 20th century, the Solid South flipped to fundamentalist neoliberalism and the GOP, a nouveau riche metastasized along with some of the worst suburban sprawl the US has ever seen, and the Old South/old money faded away. Had we simply taken a Burkean approach and left the class system in place and simply adjusted the wealth gap to defuse the racial animosity it spawned, perhaps through land redistribution or other creative policies, then we wouldn't be facing the deindustrial mess we've created for ourselves by going whole hog for Yankee industrialism.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c3578575003260550885 title="comment permalink">9/3/16, 8:18 AM</a><br><br>

It's rather more like the Republic of Ireland, which also went through a lot of really nasty guerrilla warfare in the 20th century but has settled down relatively calmly since then.”<br><br>A very good point, but I still fear you misunderstand Ireland and long term recurrence of the effects of guerrilla and civil war. Violence has been endemic recurrently in Ireland over centuries, despite initially at least in the 20th C being initiated against the wishes of the majority. These things, however, work long term. An independent Eire (1923) lost the industrial north of the island (Ulster) mostly because there were elements within a majority population there – mainly protestant - who were prepared as early as 1912 for armed insurrection in favour of Union (remaining in Britain). See the formation of the Ulster Volunteer Force 1912, Sir Edward Carson, gun running 1913 and etc. <br> <br>The initial 20thC civil war was put off by the 1914 conflict. The course of Irish politics and its relationships with Irish Diaspora and larger polities, Britain (initially British Empire), USA and latterly EU, usefully starts here in this summary. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence <br> <br>Quote “In the 1918 [British] general election Irish voters showed their disapproval of British policy [post 1916] by giving Sinn Féin 70% (73 seats out of 105,) of Irish seats, 25 of these uncontested. Sinn Féin won 91% of the seats outside of Ulster on 46.9% of votes cast, but was in a minority in Ulster, where unionists were in a majority. Sinn Féin pledged not to sit in the UK Parliament at Westminster, but rather to set up an Irish Parliament. This parliament, known as the First Dáil, and its ministry, called the Aireacht, consisting only of Sinn Féin members, met at the Mansion House on 21 January 1919.”<br><br>Civil War against the British administration escalated violently from 1919 until mid-1921 when a truce was called. However, the civil war continued sporadically and elided into a military conflict between Republican armed factions after Irish partial independence in 1922 (in The Irish Free State). The politics of that time have continued to the present day - a similar split in the IRA 1970 signalled a resumption of armed struggle. The most recent civil war from 1970 until May 1998, was conducted across Eire, Northern Ireland (Ulster), and England, but not in Scotland. Some minority factions of militias, Republican and Unionist, have not fully stood down. Currently half of Belfast housing estates are plastered with Union Jacks. It is not clear yet whether we have seen a permanent end of civil war.<br> <br>Footnote – context and background <br>Agrarian Eire never got materially separated out from the British mainland, at least arguably not until Eire modernised after joining the EU in 1973. (A similar ‘modernising’ trajectory was seen in Spain and Portugal). Rural populations, as elsewhere, migrated into industrial urban areas through the 19th Century and this continued in the 20th C. The population of Eire (from 1922) continued to decline until 1970s. Net emigration continued; for example 250,000 out of a then population of 3 million went to work in Britain’s 1940’s wartime economy and 50,000 joined British armed forces despite majority approval in Eire for 'neutrality'.<br><br>Population started its modern increase from circa 1975. Rapid economic acceleration in Eire was 1989 to 2008, in contrast with the decline of old industrial areas in Britain. A significant part of the Irish population in the past has worked permanently or frequently in mainland Britain. (Apparently 10% of UK citizens have at least one Irish grandparent. Parts of previously industrialised West Scotland are 50% Catholic as a result of persistent migration from Catholic Ireland.)<br><br>I can only add that in my personal experience all this has happened among lovely peaceful people who are as horrified as you and I.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c3842378564309784865 title="comment permalink">9/3/16, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

The bank wants its money back, not a physical property to maintain and pay taxes and insurance on. The bank can't just let the weeds grow or the taxes accrue, or the city/county will seize the property. The bank has to hire people to maintain and fix up the houses, and that's very labor intensive and costly. Furthermore, often the borrower who's being foreclosed upon will deliberately vandalize and ruin a property right before leaving. Toilets and sinks torn out of their moorings, walls demolished with hammers, broken windows, broken pipes, ripped-out wires, filth everywhere. Banks don't make their money on foreclosures, they make it on good loans to reliable borrowers. The bank does not "steal" houses, not even from those who rashly signed what they later claimed not to understand.<br><br>The other thing that often happens with foreclosures is that the owner has borrowed 2 or 3 times on the house. If the bank holds the 3rd mortgage, forecloses, and ends up owning the house, it must keep the 1st and 2nd paid up, or the 1st or 2nd will foreclose on the same property. These are a couple of reasons that it's hard for a person to get a good deal on a foreclosed house. It's the rare property that's unencumbered and in good shape, and if it is, then it sells for market value anyway.<br><br>I'm not saying that banks are always honest and upright. I am very much against the equally fallacious and offensive idea that the Evil Rich Whites (bankers, in this case) always STEAL from The Poor, who in turn are always honest in thought, word and deed, and never make bad decisions - especially about money.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c7175258943918981845 title="comment permalink">9/3/16, 1:24 PM</a><br><br>

No one can deport one and prevent the others from going with the deportee. I don't understand why citizens, legal immigrants, or those with valid work visas are so fearful for themselves. In fact, I keep hearing that citizens of latino descent are very angry at illegal latino border-jumpers, so it doesn't make sense for them to resist the carrying out of our laws.<br><br>I look at it this way: I'm not a drug dealer, so I have no reason to be TERRIFIED of the sheriff just because of a dealer who lives up the road.

It turned out to be my limited training in classical economics, muttering "opportunity cost!" Which might not be a valid issue, considering that so much of classical economics doesn't work anyhow. It seems clear that the way Mikkelson spends her money is better for the community than many other options, such as hoarding it or buying expensive imported luxuries or paying bribes for regulatory favors. And yet, might it be better still not to take the money from the company in the first place, leaving it to be reinvested instead? In theory, instead of hiring gardeners, she could be training and hiring more machinists to make more streetcars.<br><br>On the other hand, machinists don't contribute to the Mikkelsons' first lines of personal defense at night, the way groundskeepers or the hall boy in a manor house might do. And there's the celebrity role to consider as well. Is that something that's actually beneficial, or just something that's bound to happen no matter what? If the latter, then it's not really necessary to spend money on it.<br><br>(There's an old Scrooge McDuck comic where Scrooge has run out of room in his money bin, so he hires Donald Duck to spend some of his money. Donald takes a few excess bags of cash and runs wild buying luxury cars and expensive restaurant meals and other extravagances, with Scrooge tagging along in continual apoplexy about the wastefulness. In the end, Scrooge discovers he's ended up with more money than before, because it turns out he owns the luxury car company and the fancy restaurants and the other stores Donald was spending the money at. That punchline is a cartoon impossibility, but the whole scenario isn't that much different from the old story about Ford wanting to pay his auto workers enough to afford his cars. It seems to make sense at first, but there's a by-your-bootstraps catch hidden in there somewhere. You can only close that gap if your workers were underpaid, or your product overpriced, to begin with. If someone tried to start a yacht company with a business model based on paying its workers enough to afford its yachts, they'd be seen as delusional. Anyhow, at least, Mikkelson isn't diversified enough to have Scrooge's problem disposing of money.)<br><br>And on a different level entirely (so we don't need a gripping hand), this part of the story is about advising already-wealthy people about how to spend their money (and they're not going to give it back to the markets or corporations they got it from), so it would be no use at all for Mikkelson not to have high personal income as a given.<br><br>None of this is serious criticism, just late-night musings.<br><br>As for what from the past might still be missing: what is there for adolescent to young adult males to do that's foolishly dangerous, without causing too much disruption or collateral damage, or killing or disabling too many of them? Presumably you don't want to feature e.g. street gang rumbles or rampant dueling in a 'topia. Bare-knuckle boxing, and American football with circa 1910 style equipment, are options, but is there anything less dependent on size and strength? Streetcar surfing would have plenty of historical analogues (though it wouldn't be exactly retro). Similarly, with plenty of working horses around, various kinds of stunt riding might be popular. or some regional variation of rodeo.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c973632902842426502 title="comment permalink">9/3/16, 10:23 PM</a><br><br>

I may put in a mosque somewhere. <br><br>Tim, solar water heaters and wind turbines were mentioned on Carr's train trips, but yes, I can see about adding more of that. <br><br>Christine, I'll consider it. My favorite folly is Sham Castle, on the eastern skyline as seen from Bath; somebody decided that having a romantic-looking castle there would improve the view from the city, and built it. (When my wife and I visited Bath in 2003, over dinner one night we concocted an entire fake history for the Earls of Sham, from the founder of the family, Fulk de Faux, who misled the Saxons concerning William the Conqueror's landing site, down through the generations to the current Earl, Fitzwilliam Abercrombie Kevin Eglinton de Faux, who restored the family fortune by luring unwary investors into buying helium-3 mining rights on the Moon.)<br><br>Phil, so noted. <br><br>Tim, already added -- I've had Carr notice a Masonic lodge and a Grange hall while walking around Hicksville. <br><br>Golocyte, sorry to -- what's the phrase? -- harsh your squee. <br><br>Marryin', remember that the Lakeland Republic has diesel-electric locomotives and combined-cycle turbines; linotype machines are well within their capacity, and so is the manufacture of paper from industrial hemp on the large scale. I've already inserted a paper mill into the revised manuscript!<br><br>Nastarana, I agree about Tudor clothing -- there's much to be said about most eras of clothing, but not that one. I find the classic Roman toga-over-tunic outfit both dignified and comfortable -- remember that the toga is basically a Highland <i>plaid mor</i> of all white woolen cloth, very well suited to cold weather. As for agriculture, we got a pretty good overview of that when Carr was looking out the window of the train in the first two episodes, but I'll see whether more could be added into the Hicksville sequence. <br><br>Inohuri, interesting! I was thinking more like a larger and more precise version of the Antikythera mechanism, but optical computers would also be a nice bit of retro tech. <br><br>Rob, depends on how many of them survived being melted down for munitions in the Second Civil War, and whether any of them were available in the Midwest. My guess is that "few" is the operative answer in both cases. <br><br>Armata, this whole election is turning very, very weird. Hillary Clinton apparently hasn't given a press conference yet this year, and her staff says <a href=http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-09-03/hillary-promises-deliver-regular-press-conferences-one-condition rel=nofollow>she won't do so until she's elected</a> -- can you think of another candidate who's been that reticent? She's also refused to visit the storm victims in Louisiana and apparently isn't going to respond to the invitation from President Pena-Nieto of Mexico. You have to wonder what's up. <br><br>Maxine, thank you -- that sounds scrumptious. <br><br>Hubertus, I didn't neglect agriculture at all; I discussed it at length in early episodes of the story. In 1900, by the way, when horsedrawn equipment was still standard on US farms, only 38% of the population worked in agriculture; I figure that in the Lakeland Republic it's less than that, maybe around 33%.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c270013970578715091 title="comment permalink">9/3/16, 10:41 PM</a><br><br>

Ick. <br><br>Patricia, the Masons are as far as I know the only fraternal order that restricts membership in its women's branch to relatives of Masons. The Odd Fellows accept men and women on an equal basis, and so does the Grange; most others have women's branches ("auxiliaries" isn't a term much used these days, that I know of) that are open to any woman who cares to join. There are also lodges that are primarily or exclusively women's organizations, such as the Royal Neighbors and P.E.O. You might ask any elderly women you know about women's lodge organizations in your community; very few of them advertise much these days, but they're almost always willing to consider an applicant who finds out about them via word of mouth. <br><br>Olivier, duly noted. I don't know how much space I can give to that, but I'll consider it. <br><br>Myriad, yes, I considered the issue of opportunity cost. However, since Mikkelson Manufacturing can raise capital easily on the stock market, and there are a variety of concrete benefits to be gained by spending some money elsewhere, I think there's a good argument for Mikkelson's strategy. With regard to young men, that's part of what the universal military service is for -- give young men (and women) two years blazing away at targets with a variety of firearms from handguns up to 75mm howitzers, and two weeks every summer doing the same thing, and their need for other opportunities for heroics goes down a bit.

It may be a good idea to put a brief explanation of peak oil into the story. Most people outside blogs like this have little understanding of this subject. Yes there were some stories in the main stream media about peak oil back round 2008, but all these problems have been solved by fracking and the US is on its way to energy independence.

So for example, it take a lot less energy and raw materials to build and run a bicycle than a car. Of course you can do a lot more with a car than a bicycle, which is why people prefer a car and this is not a problem in a society which has access to increasing amounts of fossil fuels. As fracking has solved the energy problem there is no reason why we should go back using a bicycle and should stick to cars. <br><br>Now you and me know that fracking has not solved anything, which is why it might be important to put something in the story for those readers who are not familiar with this subject<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c8217409941825263944 title="comment permalink">9/4/16, 2:28 AM</a><br><br>

I was pretty amazed by how humorous and metafictional it was --over 400 years before postmodernism supposedly began! Beyond the sheer delight at his many ideas, I loved how cleverly More protected his own upstanding reputation by deftly raising clouds of doubt as to which of these radical ideas he, the "real life" More, was really arguing for, versus which were thought experiments or mere humorous provocation. <br><br>(Incidentally, I was also shocked to discover that the first portrait of More I found looked uncannily like me. No I am not suggestion a "past life connection" or anything like that-- let's put it this way, if I was Thomas More in a past life, I've seriously slipped down several rungs on the karmic ladder of human greatness. Maybe I'll just chalk it up to psychological identification. Still it was quite an interesting moment.)<br><br>I wondered whether Peter Carr might have been a bit of an homage to More-- the guileless frame narrator who also happens to be on a diplomatic mission-- streamlined one more degree of efficiency to actually be directly on a diplomacy mission to the Utopia he is recounting.<br><br>Of course you are under no obligation to attempt to cover all of the same ground More did, but there is one main area I noticed that you've basically left alone which More spent quite a bit of (sometimes gory) detail going into: the penal system. I know that's been suggested before, but I'll second that motion.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c8241440151732746806 title="comment permalink">9/4/16, 8:04 AM</a><br><br>

The closest retro technology is arguably record players. (And by the way-- are there record players or jukeboxes or so forth in Retrotopia? Or have you avoided them because they're basically made of pure plastic? I do seem to recall a reference to radio in there somewhere, but can't remember any records right now.)<br><br>But I would actually suggest a related form, which used to be of startling popularity in America-- the radio. Even eschewing recording technology, there's still "talk", news, sports, as well as transmissions of live music. But in terms of the sheer production pace and power of imagination-- as well as bang for your buck in production values-- the form that I'd most like to see in any Retrotopia would definitely be radio theater. By which I mean all genres-- dramatic, comedic, and other. One of the best things my parents ever bought us when I was a kid was a small collection of old radio shows-- Jack Benny, Amos 'n Andy, Abbot and Costello-- interspersed with musical guests playing pop hits of the time by Ellington, Basie, Glenn Miller, and so on. The only bummer was advertising, though it was seriously less annoying than today ("This song brought to you by our sponsor..."). But I'm not sure how to get around that, even in a Retrotopia... listener funded radio? Hmmm.<br><br>Another suggestion, one that would make any utopia a real eu-topia for me, would be to expand even further the references to performing arts which exist on a <i>purely social level</i>. The opera and our slightly too-omnipresent friendly neighborhood jazz pianist are much appreciated by this particular jazz pianist; but the barbershop quartet was probably the most lovely surprise in the story for me, and I was also delighted by the atheist hymnal. Other retro "social entertainment technologies" suggesting a vibrant inner community life might include:<br><br>...social dancing. Let us not forget that the vast majority of young musical trends first gain their legs by being a socially agreed upon backdrop for sexed-up young people to do mating dances in close proximity to one another, as Fats Waller's ouvre demonstrates many times over.<br><br>...street performers of genuine skill (musical, theatrical, or dextrous) out and about at any places and times where crowds get thick-- say, the drone shoot. Or weekends on market streets. As well as more small scale live entertainment at restaurants which are not purely of a live music bent, though which still might involve the house musicians in support-- variety acts, sleight of hand, flashy dancers, two man comedy teams.<br><br>...casual social demonstrations of artistic skill, of any kind, performed after meals in a fashion that is clearly suggesting custom and habit (by which I mean, *not* because it's a particularly special occasion). This can be of any kind-- musical, poetic, dramatic, kinetic, visual, and may involve collaborations of more than one performer. The less likely, less obviously charismatic the performer, the better.<br><br>Apologies if any of these actually were included and I've simply forgotten!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c1401823572688850360 title="comment permalink">9/4/16, 8:23 AM</a><br><br>

One of the things Mikkelson seems to be coming to realize is that, as resource constraints begin to tighten, holding onto wealth and power requires becoming an invaluable resource to the community... <b>If she were living a few centuries from that time, she would be catching right on to the mindset that allows a Jarl with a mead hall to maintain the support of the masses by throwing massive feasts and public sacrifices that keep food flowing to the common folk."</b><br><br>Bingo! I found this quote on the Future History page over at the Atomic Rockets website, talking about the origins of the words "Lord" and "Lady"<br><br><i>"When getting down to basics, remember that the word Lord comes from the Old English word hlaford, which was derived from the Old English hlafweard. The word hlaf means "bread" or "loaf" and weard means "keeper" or "guardian", so Lord means "Keeper of the food". You give your allegiance to your lord because he's the one who gives you food. Meanwhile Lady come from the Old English word hlæfdige. -Dige means "maid", and is derived from dæge or "maker of dough."<br><br>In other words, the Lord brings home the bacon, and the Lady cooks it. And the Lord's men are loyal because he feeds them."</i><br><br>I once read that Norse kings were sometimes referred to as "enemies of gold", because they were expected to disburse the gold and other plunder that came into their hands to their followers and were not allowed to keep it for themselves. Native American chiefs in the Pacific Northwest would hold public feasts called "potlatches", where they would vie with one another to see which chief could give away the most possessions to the people of their community. The more that a chief gave away during a potlatch, the more he gained social prestige and political power. The Prophet Mohammed likewise gained support in part because he had a reputation for being extremely generous to his followers, freely giving away wealth and even personal possessions to those who were in need or simply asked. His wives once reproached him for taking better care of followers he barely knew than his own family because he gave away most of what he had to others who he believed were needy. <br><br>As someone else pointed out in the comments section, Roman aristocrats would pay for the construction of temples, markets, aqueducts, stadiums and other public buildings and would compete with one other to be seen as public benefactors. A Roman politician who wanted to be considered for election to Consul first had to have served previously as Aedile. The Aediles were the public officials who presided over the gladiatorial games, chariot races and other forms of public entertainment. The Aediles (as with the Consuls, there were two Aediles at any given time) were expected to pay for most of the expenses involved out of their own pockets, so a Roman politician who wanted to hold the highest offices had to show that not only did he have a great deal of wealth but that he was extremely generous with that wealth.

There are many people, including myself, who suspect that there were a lot of incriminating documents that got shredded and emails that were purged from servers to cover up what really happened. There was a huge coverup, followed by a whitewash similar to the one that Loretta Lynch engineered on behalf of Hillary Clinton in the email scandal. Eric Holder should have gone to prison for perjury and obstruction of justice for his role in the Fast and Furious debacle. <br><br>One of the things I like about Trump is he has specifically called for existing laws to be enforced rigorously and without favoritism. One of things that has really disturbed me about the Obama administration is its penchant for selective enforcement of the law and its frequent refusal to enforce laws it doesn't like or finds inconvenient. How can you have the rule of law when the president and both of his attorney generals (Holder and Lynch) have made a habit of repeatedly refusing to enforce the law when they find it inconvenient to do so? Doesn't that make a complete mockery of the whole concept? And how can you have a functioning democracy or market economy unless you have the rule of law?<br><br>This is a pattern we've seen over and over again in the Fast and Furious scandal, the Hillary Clinton email scandal, the New Black Panther voter intimidation case, the refusal of the Obama administration to hold Wall Street accountable for the widespread fraud and corruption that very nearly triggered a global depression in 2008 and many, many other cases. Trump also successfully demanded that this year's Republican platform call for the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagal Act. It was the repeal of the Glass-Steagal Act by Bill Clinton that opened the floodgates to the speculative excesses that ultimately resulted in the 2008 economic crisis.<br><br>I sincerely hope that if Trump is elected President we will see Eric Holder, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Lois Lerner and other public officials who have abused the public trust and engaged in criminal behavior while in office hauled into court and held accountable for their actions. If the Brazilians can oust not one but two presidents in the last couple of decades for committing serious acts of misconduct while in office, why can't we hold senior government officials who are clearly guilty of serious wrongdoing accountable under the law in the USA? Sounds like we have some learning to do from Latin America's biggest democracy!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c5265646236014799875 title="comment permalink">9/4/16, 3:17 PM</a><br><br>

You should note that the farmer was careful to stand to one side of the needle. Cows are remarkably resilient creatures in many respects. We have a heifer at work who is recovering from 5 hours of help with a calving that would otherwise have killed her. Presenting with 3 feet and a head was cured with persistance and piano wire by two remarkable vets. And I have just spent my last few days off working on a rotary dairy, with a herd of cows for whom it is a new experience. Some of the dumber ones insist on trying to squeeze into a closing gap and I am amazed at how much squash they will take and just back out and move into the next bail when you back the platform up. (after 5 weeks things are on the improve, but you still have to have eyes in the back of your head) All this is relevant to the broader subject of this blog, because farming feeds the urban masses, and the long decline suggested by our host indicates that our current highly productive agriculture is a transitory thing, and that food will become less manufactured, less available, less certain, and more expensive. That is, unless we as individuals are more involved in feeding ourselves. The average urban dweller is now so disconnected from agriculture they scarcely understand that cows produce milk, sheep produce wool, milk makes cheese, and so on. They certainly have a minimal understanding of the complexities of running any sort of livestock enterprise, and absolutely zero understanding of the efforts and risks involved in doing so while the climate is becoming unpredictable.<br><br>To underscore that point, my employer milks some 470 cows. Last year we made less than 30% of the normal amount of hay and silage, and by using the stored surplus from the previous year and buying in palm kernel from Indonesia we are making it through, but the beef cattle and dry heifers are very thin. The weather bureau is equivocating about spring rainfall prospects and if we have a dryer than normal spring and do not get the usual growth peak next year will need to see milking cow numbers drop accordingly. Rinse and repeat across all agricultural enterprises and it is easy to see prices spiking. The beef industry locally is already seeing that with per kilo prices a record levels and supply continuing to tighten.<br><br>Factor in the madness in the middle east, and the south china sea and the old curse of "interesting times" starts to look appallingly relevant.<br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c3926881968229484578 title="comment permalink">9/4/16, 3:22 PM</a><br><br>

The NYT published a rare semi-critical article about where she's been. Here's an excerpt:<br><br>"Mr. Trump has pointed to Mrs. Clinton’s noticeably scant schedule of campaign events this summer to suggest she has been hiding from the public. But Mrs. Clinton has been more than accessible to those who reside in some of the country’s most moneyed enclaves and are willing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to see her. In the last two weeks of August, Mrs. Clinton raked in roughly $50 million at 22 fund-raising events, averaging around $150,000 an hour, according to a New York Times tally.<br><br>And while Mrs. Clinton has faced criticism for her failure to hold a news conference for months, she has fielded hundreds of questions from the ultrarich in places like the Hamptons, Martha’s Vineyard, Beverly Hills and Silicon Valley.<br><br>“It’s the old adage, you go to where the money is,” said Jay S. Jacobs, a prominent New York Democrat.<br><br>Mrs. Clinton raised about $143 million in August, the campaign’s best month yet. At a single event on Tuesday in Sagaponack, N.Y., 10 people paid at least $250,000 to meet her, raising $2.5 million.<br><br>If Mr. Trump appears to be waging his campaign in rallies and network interviews, Mrs. Clinton’s second presidential bid seems to amount to a series of high-dollar fund-raisers with public appearances added to the schedule when they can be fit in. Last week, for example, she diverged just once from her packed fund-raising schedule to deliver a speech."<br><br>The article goes on and on like this. Apparently Clinton is only comfortable in the presence of huge mega-donors, and spends as much time as possible inside the mega-rich bubble, to a much greater extent than is normal even by DC's standards. The Clintons have been a major fixture in the Hamptons for years now, where they rent out a 12,000 square foot home in East Hampton and another mansion in Sagaponack. This year, Clinton fundraisers are the top-tier social event of the summer there, where the mega-rich attend largely to show their status to each other. She has picked up most of Romney's rich supporters too; Trump does not fit in that enclave and is generally not welcome there.<br><br>Her campaign has come up with a tiered structure of donations for access to her, where the people who can fork out at least $100,000 get to actually experience something of her human side, take a photo with her, and ask a few real questions for a couple of hours. But not too real - even they are expected to tone it down if she gets too uncomfortable, a rule enforced by longtime Clinton confidant Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, of the (in)famous banking family. Invitations for these sorts of events tell attendees that they have to "write, not raise, at least $100,000", so Clinton does not have to interact even with the sorts of people who are not rich enough to cut those checks personally but who support her enough to raise $100,000 for her from other people. <br><br>On an intellectual level, I know that our elites are walling themselves off from the rest of society and engaging in the sort of dysfunctional behavior that is characteristic of declining societies shortly before the internal proletariat rise up and overthrow them. But it's still shocking to see just how dire the situation really is, and how badly this sort of rot has taken over the political system.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c3574996864867918203 title="comment permalink">9/4/16, 5:30 PM</a><br><br>

I found several sources that say he's proposing to limit the wire transfers until Mexico pays $10 billion for the wall. I doubt that's ever going to happen. However, I'm glad he's not overlooking the $25 billion a year that Mexico receives, the bulk of which is in US dollars.<br><br>One source was a story on CNN that talked about the old sick parents that "Juan", who at 19 was already married and had one child, had left behind when he decided to illegally enter my country. (I note with discouragement that as is the norm rather than the exception among poor people, he says he's struggling, but he makes babies.) I wonder whether he has siblings and whether they help the parents. His parents seemed no more impoverished than plenty of senior citizens within our borders. Elderly people in dangerous parts of Chicago die in extreme temps every summer, because they can't afford to use air conditioning and are afraid to open the windows. That's been going on for decades in a wealthy, industrialized country.<br><br>But I keep coming back to one theme: if they're here legally, why the terror? Is it <i>really</i> just that they can't send those anonymous**, untraceable wires to their families? Consider this: they figured out how to come here to work and live legally, which makes them pretty resourceful people, I'd say; they have scads of grassroots organizations, plus the big players in Big Poverty like La Raza and the Catholic Church, and not one offers alternative ways for legal Mexican immigrants to send money home? Why do none of them have basic checking accounts and send checks via snail mail? I understand they might not have had exposure to such first world things before they came here, but come on. And Big Poverty is always ready to help.<br><br>**Yes, I picked that gem up in researching: currently, no ID is needed to send money. Now that inspires not terror, but uneasiness, in me.<br><br>Then there's that pesky right we have to limit the amount and destination of monies leaving our borders. If history's any indication, though, cries of "racism" should be able to kill that off with a quickness if need be.<br> <br><br><br>I didn't follow the link.

I've already included references to the fracking fad of the twenty-teens and how badly it turned out, but I can certainly check to make sure the basic concepts of peak oil are covered. <br><br>Patricia, a lot of people treat Masonry as the standard model of fraternal order, which it isn't -- the Odd Fellows were the model on which most other fraternal orders drew. I don't happen to know Janice Mikkelson's organizational involvements, and I don't know that there'll be room in the story to get into that -- a lot of what I'll be doing at this point is putting in easter eggs for those who pay attention -- but we'll see. <br><br>Shane, I was thinking of that -- though apparently she's got ample time to have a conversation <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/us/politics/hillary-clinton-fundraising.html?ref=politics&amp;_r=0" rel=nofollow>with anyone who writes her a six figure check</a>. <br><br>Quin, it's more or less impossible to write a utopian narrative without either deliberate or unconscious homages to the guy who invented the genre; I didn't set out to refer to More's tale in crafting mine, but of course the influences are there. As for radio theater, I've already decided to have Carr listen to the radio when he's sick in bed, after getting the flu, and so a radio theater show would fit there. (When I was in my early teens, the oldies station in Seattle used to play radio theater on weekend evenings -- some old shows, some original productions -- so I've got some familiarity with the genre.) As for your other suggestions, I've added them to the list. <br><br>Donald, hmm. I'll consider it. <br><br>Armata, yep. If you want fewer criminals, (a) minimize extreme income disparities, (b) make sure that there's work at a living wage for anyone who wants it, and (c) limit the number of things that are illegal to those crimes against persons or property that are actually serious enough to merit bringing in the lumbering machinery of the criminal legal system. It's not rocket science. <br><br>As for the Clinton campaign, I'm really scratching my head here. I know she's a poor speaker and turnout at her rallies has been embarassingly low, but a candidate who hides from the press and the voters is in trouble. The major newspapers are starting to turn on her -- as per the NYT article you cited -- and that will just get worse if she continues to stonewall the press. <br><br>John, I'm impressed that the present day insurance industry even remembers fraternal insurance! As for Clinton, though, it's part of every candidate's job to face down that sort of thing -- do you recall how effortlessly Obama did so four and eight years ago? The longer Clinton hides from the press, and the more time she spends in the echo-chamber atmosphere of her very rich friends, the more ammo she's handing Trump. <br><br>Kevin, I'll see if I can fit that in. Real democracies use paper ballots and count them by hand in public; we don't, with predictable consequences. <br><br>Glenn, if so, they were reading it before 2014, which is the date on that study!<br><br>Grebulocities, yep. The thing to notice is that the NY Times is actually talking about it. This suggests to me that she may have succeeded in alienating some of her notional allies in the media and the corporate networks behind it. If the Times starts goving Trump more sympathetic coverage, that'll be a sign that things are really beginning a tectonic shift.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c2614090330959756646 title="comment permalink">9/4/16, 8:38 PM</a><br><br>

Also, old money tends to care a lot about societal stability, because they know that without it their position is in serious risk, whereas nouveau riches usually ascended to their current position through opportunities granted them by chaos and luck, so they do not fear turmoil that much - they don't know the risks.

It is also worthwhile mentioning that people are placing machines between themselves and other people (like we are here), except some people then forget that the machine is merely used for communication in that particular instance and they may try to communicate with the other person as they would for a machine, and that is not a recipe for good communication either!<br><br>Anyway, you may be surprised to know just how many of those machines I have to repair here - virtually every week. I joked to my wife this evening that I could include a section on the blog titled: Rubbish (I'd probably use a different word rhyming with the word “Scrap”!) product of the week... Mind you, I'm getting pretty good at some small appliance repairs.<br><br>Oh, the other point, I almost forgot to mention, I haven’t been feeling so well this week due to a cold, and this morning now that I was feeling better, I steeled myself to read the Saturday newspapers business section. Wow. What did you once say about common garden variety corruption becoming a huge problem? Mate, it was like the first six pages in the business section covered that issue on a lot of multiple fronts. And then I noticed that US reach must be waning because the EU has requested that Apple repay a huge back tax to the EU via Ireland and they weren't very polite or nice about the matter either. In fact, I'd use the word "Candid" to describe their assessment of the situation.<br><br>The other interesting thing that I noticed, was that Ford is closing local car manufacturing here after almost 60 years on October 7. General Motors and Toyota will soon follow suit I believe. In all that sad and strategically very poor option taken for what I believe are ideological reasons, I noticed one fascinating statistic. Due to the recent shift from purchasing local product, Australian's now import more cars from Germany than are locally produced. The interesting thing is that the removal of the tariffs that once protected the local car manufacturing until only historically recently benefits whom? Interesting huh? Oh yeah, apparently 250,000 people (estimated and including all of the parts suppliers and all other related industries) will soon be out of work too. <br><br>Far out...

Thanks also to Al ("9/2/16, 9:56 PM") for raising the Braille-related topic of large print. <br><br>My Catholic corespondent from Australia, who started this line of discussion, has now sent me remarks on guide dogs, in two separate e-mails: <br><br>((HER_FIRST_SET_OF_REMARKS_ON_GUIDE_DOGS))<br>Guide dogging is also, in my thinking, a form of mobility/travel for those with little or no sight that will easily transition down through a shifting resource landscape. Despite the prevalence of advanced international breeding programmes designed to produce guide dogs with the sturdiest of health, excellent temperament for the job etc., with a little forward thinking, these processes are durable enough to weather the downward stepping of society, for instance, good guide dog sires travelling with their handlers via wind-jammer or railway from guide dog school to guide dog school (keeping the genetics strong enough to ensure good guiding bloodlines whilst remaining broad enough to minimise the negatives of in-breeding).<br>((/HER_FIRST_SET_OF_REMARKS_ON_GUIDE_DOGS))<br><br>((HER_SECOND_SET_OF_REMARKS_ON_GUIDE_DOGS))<br>/../ at a recent International Guide Dog Federation conference held in Split, Croatia, archival footage from the beginnings of the guide dog movement in Europe showed dogs in training taught traffic work learning to negotiate road crossings comprising both automotive and animal-drawn vehicles with no ill effects to either guide dogs, their trainers, (later their blind or vision impaired handlers) or transportation animals. We have now marked a century since the birth of the modern guide dog movement (Germany 1916, its successor and far more successor schools in continuous operation since 1917). Guide Dogs US: 1928/29, guide Dogs Italy 1930/31, Guide Dogs UK 1930/1934, Guide Dogs Australia, 1951. Using the Retrotopia tier system, Guide Dogging is a tier 4 and 5 technology, with easy application in tier 3 environments and, with a little tweaking, tier 2 or even tier 1. Now preventative treatments for the scourge of the guide dog world (heartworm) present a more difficult challenge. Pre the arrival of preventative medication, the only partially successful treatment of this fatal condition consisted of a course of arsenic therapy that more often than not killed the dog before the heartworm dispatched said animal.Same goes for rabies prevention. if these treatments can be reproduced in a low tier environment, along with the necessary pathology work, the guide dog movement from the alps to the tropics will enjoy a flourishing life down the curve of descent.<br>((/HER_SECOND_SET_OF_REMARKS_ON_GUIDE_DOGS)) <br><br>My correspondent additionally underscores the theology of disability, noting that in its best articulation this is a matter of "neither reducing us to objects of need/pity/unhelpful sympathy on the one hand nor objects of loathing, responsible for our own plight, economic burdens on the other". I propose to keep theology largely out of my postings here, but on the other hand to write on a theological matter related to hers in the next 24 hours or so, over at my own blog, <a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a>.

I should have known about this before, but did not. Today, not having the time for thorough research, I nevertheless note the following: (a) Fagor got in some sense taken over or bought out by some conventional company (so this is not a total loss of productive power, setback though it clearly is for the worker-ownership movement). (b) According to Wikipedia and the Mondragon grouping's own Web, this worker-ownership movement continues to be large (with 74,335 employees in 2015, according to a Wikipedia sidebar). The large headcount provides necessary context for commmenter gwizard43's remark ("9/2/16, 2:45 PM") that Fagor employs 2,000 people in Basque Country and an additional 3,500 in France, China, Poland, and Morocco. <br><br>(2) It was right for commenters to stress the difficulty of setting up worker-owned enterprises in the current environment of predatory external-ownership capitalism. Nevertheless. all worthwhile civil-justice movements face obstacles. <br><br>One way forward might be to develop and market consumer goods which are designed in the opposite way to what we get in WalMart: let the goods be as durable as possible, as Amish-plain as possible, and as internally simple as possible, with even a repair manual supplied at time of sale. The manual should hardware design explicit, in the spirit of GNU/Linux - right down to the tolerances on machined parts, and right down to acceptable voltage ranges at test points in such rudimentary electronics as might still prove necessary. <br><br>One product consumers might like to see developed is a Peltier-cooler ice wand. This device would have no moving parts beyond one microswitch, and would create a fist-sized or melon-sized ball of ice when immersed in a tub of water. <br><br>The microswitch would be useful for turning current on and off. Let it, for instance, switch current off to the Peltier thermocouple whenever the ice ball exceeds a certain size, i.e., whenever the buoyancy of the wand-and-ice-assemblage exceeds a certain limit. <br><br>The ice wand might perhaps be developed into a more robust small-scale refrigeration solution than the silly "bar fridges" that are now sold at WalMart and the like, under such names as "Danby". These silly "bar fridges" last for only two or five years, have lots of moving parts and lots of electronics, and are said by repair specialists to be not worth repairing once they break. <br><br>A single-person household could keep most perishables cold and dry in glass jars in a single chilled-water tub, while keeping such water-tolerant things as beets and carrots and eggs right in the chilled water. <br><br>For a family, a couple of tubs, and a couple of wands, would be appropriate. <br> <br>Tom (presently keeping perishables cold in a "bar fridge", alas) <br><br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a><br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c3548095278586674459 title="comment permalink">9/5/16, 8:26 AM</a><br><br>

Whaddya think? :)<br><br>@Fred: Yes, sorry, I knew that that fashion history timeline was painted with far too broad a brush. I was worried that I could get into a REALLY lengthy explanation. The eras your group are re-enacting, (1775 to 1850?) are at the tail end of "Pre-Industrial" and into the boom of the textile revolution - when changes in style would have happen much more rapidly - due to the inventions of the steam engine, iron casting and smelting, the spinning jenny, industrial looms and mills, etc… as opposed to the previous cottage industry of home looms and home spinning wheels. The textile revolution began around 1775 actually, well before wide use of fossil fuels. It was the "Silicon Valley" "Tech-start-up" revolution of it's time. <br><br>I also probably should have put more emphasis on "noticeable" changes. Perhaps as a re-enactor, you would notice detailed differences in period more acutely than a 'lay-person'? The overall silhouette changed drastically, 'noticeably' - ROUGHLY every 100 years - until the 19th C. when industrial made textiles were much more widely available. <br><br>Oh! And where I got the information: My education and at one time my profession was as a Costume Designer for Theatre and Film. I got the information from costume history classes/lectures, independent research on various time periods for plays and films I worked on. Library archives, Museums, individual collections, etc…(before internet!) Apart from the formal education (?) - probably similar to your own research. <br><br>RE: Tudor clothing: Keep in mind the harsh angular, HEAVY stuffed sofa clothing we widely see in drawings and research of the period was super expensive, (MASSIVE amounts of embroidered and treated fabrics and boned bodices!) and only worn by the wealthy, even then, IMHO; likely only in public displays. There are paintings of the time - the commoners wore a watered down version that was much more comfy and practical. I would think on their 'off' days, even the rich would dress without schlepping all that around. In those days - because it was so expensive - one's clothing was the single largest public indicator of one's wealth and station in life.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c2595703641817517584 title="comment permalink">9/5/16, 9:22 AM</a><br><br>

Production of Audio books in earnest truly gained steam in 1930 with the release of the RCA/Victor 'Portable' phonograph player especially designed to play 33.3RPM discs that were themselves developed by said company to enable a half decent amount of recording time/space per 12" album. The sighted world has much to thank their brethren with vision impairment for including the development of LP technology, the typewriter, the safety pin and the vegetable peeler to name a few (but I digress). Post War, work commenced on production of the 16.25RPM disc and player to provide still greater playing time and space per album. The original player could be ordered in either a mechanical or electric form that enabled those in the 1930’s without access to electricity to nonetheless enjoy listening to audio books. In the US, the Library of Congress played a significant role in the provision and distribution of material in raised formats (originally Braille and Moon - the only character-based raised reading system to have survived into our time) along with audio. Furthermore, various large and small libraries for those with little or no sight sprang up around the US and Western world; the American Printing House for the Blind commenced production of text books for school children in the 1850’s, with the Perkins institute for the Blind, now Perkins School for the Blind opening its doors in the late 1830’s (using Boston Line Type as its raised print medium of choice, Braille not being adopted in the US until the latter half of the 19th century, New York Point giving it a run for its money right up until the dawn of the 20th century, only killed off in its tracks by the advent of the mechanical Braille writer, the analagus NYP writer, the Kleidograph unable to provide the competition necessary for NYP to triumph). This, coupled with the near universality of Braille as the reading medium of choice (adhering to French lettering and punctuation conventions) also placed NYP at a distinct disadvantage, though NYP took up less space than Braille. In 1916, the US adopted English Braille adhering to French lettering and punctuation conventions as the national raised lettering script of choice for educational purposes. Astoundingly, in the closing years of the 19th century to 1916, a student with little or no sight may have been expected to be fluent with three or even four distinct and different raised print systems, with a person eighty years of age in 1916 potentially having been necessitated to learn up to five systems (initially educated learning Boston Line Type, transitioning to Moon type, having to increasingly become conversant with American Braille and NYP in the latter years of the 19th century, finally necessitated to be familiar with in excess of 240 phonetic and grammatical conventions in non-US-based English Braille that uses French lettering as its basis). A concise history of raised print for readers with little or no sight http://www.tsbvi.edu/seehear/spring06/history.htm. I can heartily recommend 'The Unseen Minority; A Social History of Blindness' by Frances A Koestler, extensive, Enlightening, perfect for Retrotopia-type research and at times darkly chilling (especially ch25, 'The loneliest people').<br>((/HER_REMARKS_ON_AUDIOBOOKS))<br><br><br>Hastily, cheerfully, <br><br><br>Tom <br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a><br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c6552703992110815320 title="comment permalink">9/5/16, 9:58 AM</a><br><br>

I want to point out a couple of things:<br><br>Leaving aside the cries of the SJWs who don't want banks to foreclose on people who buy things they don't need and can't afford, are you sure those houses had actually been foreclosed upon and taken back by the bank? Or were they tied up in court by lawyers provided by Big Poverty who say that because the bank sold the mortgage to 16 investors, those 16 investors are the only ones with the legal right to foreclose? Were they held up in court by those "free" lawyers claiming that ThePoor did not understand what they were signing and so "deserve" a free house? Are those advocates -- I mean, lawyers -- helping ThePoor to file bankruptcy so that the house can't be taken (depending on State law)?<br><br>I can't imagine any thriving enterprise deliberately letting its assets rot. I suggest that the houses were not (yet) the bank's assets.<br><br>You mention the area was majority white and conservative. I suspect it was not wealthy, because there were gangs present, and because it also suggests that there were few voices making themselves heard about those empty houses. I live near a small, impoverished town though it's neither white nor conservative, and because no one complains, the letter carrier doesn't bother to close mailboxes, and the library is basically a hangout where people eat, drink, talk on their cell phones, and panhandle.<br><br>If gangs had taken over houses, I suspect many people were afraid to complain. I've been in that position. I'm not disparaging them. I suspect the city council was afraid too. But I can't see how the bank benefited, so why would they lobby for the houses to remain derelict?<br><br>I'm afraid I don't get your last sentence. Abandoned houses most certainly drive down housing prices. If I wanted a house that was next to the only empty house within 2-3 blocks, I'd drive the price down. But I wouldn't even buy a house in an area littered with empty, overgrown properties, so the market would drive the price down. If I wanted to sell at market and my competition is a handful of foreclosed, well-maintained properties that are selling at a deep discount, guess what that does to my asking price? This is why I don't understand why you say otherwise.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c3396951850341685709 title="comment permalink">9/5/16, 12:46 PM</a><br><br>

Recently, both my oldest brother and my oldest dog have been diagnosed with cancer. My brother's recent treatment is doing a better job of killing him than the stage IV lung cancer he has. <br><br>I remember when my father asked his hospice nurse if his cancer had come back. She asked him if he would do chemotherapy or treat it in any way. He said no. Then he said he didn't need to know if his cancer was back. He was able to stay at home and eat what he wanted and actually enjoy his last few months of life. The hospice workers called and we were able to be around him and say our goodbyes as he slipped into his last coma and peacefully died at home surrounded by his family. <br><br>I was offered radiation treatments for my dog at a high cost that would have taken him from home for a month, subjected him to awful daily treatments, that might or might not have extended his life for a few months, and that would have left him most likely needing an invasive stent to be able to eliminate. I could not do that to him, and I hope to make his final months with me as good as can happen. I also hope my brother finds the courage to tell his doctors, "Don't offer me more life at any cost; let me know how my remaining time can be the best it can be." My hope is in the Lakeland Republic, as in other areas, the thought is "how can we give quality of life?" even in facing death.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c3628024628694535983 title="comment permalink">9/5/16, 1:30 PM</a><br><br>

They were only displaced by coal powered concrete to accomplish the large and spacious spans of grand public buildings. They are low carbon as they only require fired clay tiles compared to high fire Portland cement and reinforcing steel rebar. Think of NYC Grand Central Station as one of the more famous extant examples. The Guastavino Fireproof Construction Company was competing quite successfully for state Capitol jobs if I remember correctly so maybe even for the LR Capitol dome.<br><br>2. Can you give us a mule/ox/draft horse drawn canal barge moving an enormous load through a bustling section of Toledo?? That would be cool!<br><br>3.

JMG, you recently wrote, "The Democratic Party is the place where environmental causes go to die." If only that were the worst of it. Living at the edge of a commercial forest, I'm not surprised to walk down that road and find people's trash. If it doesn't fit in your can, it's cheaper and easier to dump it where nobody's looking. I don't like that, but I get it. What I don't get is driving into a neighborhood and seeing all the trash along the street. We can't stop people from tossing cans and papers from their cars, but why is it okay to just let it lie where you live? Sure, I realize some people physically cannot bend over and bag a beer bottle, but most of us can. So then I go to a potluck where bins are set out with obvious signs indicating to put one's food scraps here, paper trash there, utensils in another bin, plates one more. Yet I still saw a pile of plates in that bin with piles of food on top of them. Do we have to be so rude to people that clean their homes, provide live music, put up tents, brew beer for us that we can't respond to their simple request to scrape our own plates?! This complacency about our own trash explains a lot about our complacency about the trash throughout our little planet.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c7612885022118809058 title="comment permalink">9/5/16, 3:59 PM</a><br><br>

Factories and corporate offices sprang up, jobs got created, and millions of families (including my own) went from sitting on tractors to sitting behind desks in just a few generations. And, probably predictably, we adopted all the gaudiest aspects of the wider American culture we could.<br><br>Today, while the South certainly still has poor areas, it also has the sort of areas where I grew up-miles and miles of endless suburbia, landscapes of cookie-cutter McMansions and strip malls sprawled helter-skelter out over former farmland, where one utterly forgettable town blends seamlessly into another. They don't really look Southern, they just look like generic suburban America, to the nth degree. And their residents have a lot of the nouveaux rich attitudes that JMG has discussed ("My family pulled itself up by the bootstraps, why can't all those ghetto people do the same?"). Furthermore, a lot of the still-poor parts of the South are close enough to the suburban parts (in distance and family relations) that people in them still hope to one day escape the trailers and become suburbanites themselves. Its certainly a dimming hope nowadays, but I think it explains why poor people here fall for ideas like "prosperity theology", which baffle and repulse outsiders.<br><br>Its sad, really-for all its faults, the culture of the Old South (which you can still see in places, especially among the older generation) prized hospitality, politeness, honor, and looking out for one another-and in pretty much every area of the South that has money, its been replaced by a generic, kitschy, utterly bourgeiosie culture that only cares about getting rich, and seems to go out of its way to be as safe and uncreative as possible.

If charity were to be given directly, there would be either a loss of dignity or a sense of unfulfillable obligations on the part of the recipient. And the donor would be burdened to distraction with applications for aid. However, if a rich man gives to the church, the church is only obligated to care for his soul. (In a sense, the equation balances.) Then the church can fulfill its Christ-directed duty to care for the poor, the sick, and the elderly; not because it is economically rational to do so, but because it is chartered by Christ to do so. The church officer who dispenses aid has some power that comes with discretion, but is still not creating the sense of obligation that giving "of his own money" would imply. He is only acting as an agent for the abstract church.<br><br>(Please read neutral gender in masculine pronouns above.)<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c54064140063560981 title="comment permalink">9/5/16, 6:10 PM</a><br><br>

It so happens that nouveaux riches have a reputation from ancient times for being arrogant, graceless and greedy, while old money has an equally enduring reputation for avoiding those habits more often than not. How we explain that is secondary to the fact that it does seem to happen that way. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, thanks for the link. <br><br>Fred, that's fascinating.

It occurs to me that in a society that uses the radio spectrum more intelligently than ours, there could also be several Lakeland radio stations devoted to reading books aloud; you tune in at 10am to this one, let's say, and it's a chapter from the latest popular romance novel, while at 2pm it's a chapter from a mystery novel, and so on. <br><br>Mark, hmm!

Most Americans hate their lives these days, and for good reason: outside of the narrowing circle of privilege, the vast majority of the options available to Americans really, profoundly suck, and the more enthusiastically those options are being pushed by the media and the voices of authority, the more reliably they suck.

Once persecutions start, they don't exactly make a fine point for legalities and fine shades of grey. In short: It's not illegals faxing $$$ down south, it's the legals threatened with the nation reneging on their promise and citizens threatened with being booted out of their own nation.<br><br>It's actually a simple formulation that too many people seem to have forgotten: <i>Your Brother Is My Brother.</i> Done properly, it creates cohesion in a group and insures that the not-undeserving poor are taken care of well enough to have a reason to live in peace.<br><br><b>On why many empty houses aren't being foreclosed upon:</b> Many times a bank will send out a letter threatening to foreclose on the house, the family with the mortgage will leave the house...and...the bank will just not foreclose. The house becomes an empty, often festering wreck of itself (many times the people being foreclosed upon trash their house – "if I'm not living in it, the bank can have the dump I'll make of it") and does nothing to lower values because it stays off the market, the bank keeps the foreclosure off its books (and since oftentimes it's already sold portions of the mortgage to other people, they're not really losing as much as it would seem. The retirement funds that invested in these "AAA grade investments," on the other hand...) and the family gets a bit of a breather – until something happens, or they try to improve their lot and find out that their credit score has become irredeemably bad thanks to them being years behind on mortgage payments to a house they haven't lived in for years. It also doesn't help that the law places responsibility to foreclose the house upon everyone who has a stake in a mortgage, and since more often than not the bank will cut other people into the mortgage through REITS and other investment "products" all groups – including those whose members are unknown – must agree to the foreclosure.<br><br>And so the house sits in limbo. The people who lived in it aren't going to move back, the banks, happy that they got most if not all the money they originally invested into the house loan back, aren't going to take it over (nor do they want to, nor in many cases CAN they), and the cities are unwilling to rock the boat...until someone squats and realizes they can strip-mine the house for cash, by which time often the city has slid down to being unable to take care of the property due to financial problems of its own.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c6071031029904724572 title="comment permalink">9/5/16, 10:13 PM</a><br><br>

There are farms that treat their animals very well: clean floors (relatively), food that is healthy, bedding that is changed regularly, vaccines and quick health care when needed etc. I've also been to farms that are quite dirty, crowded, and we're called in last minute. Those types of farms don't tend to be profitable in the long term. If you don't take care of them up front, they'll be sickly and not produce milk well, gain weight well, or breed well. If you don't know how to treat them right, you'll never compete with the farms that know what they're doing when you add in the medical fees and low production. <br>This doesn't mean that you have to be "buddy buddy" with the livestock. Work/farm animals are tools and investments, not pets and not kids. The Amish in our area for example, are very good with their animals, not because they are sentimental, but because they have to be. You can afford to get mad at a tractor and throw a wrench at it, but you do that to a horse, you've just ruined it. Even if it can be physically healed (which isn't always the case), good luck getting it to trust and obey you again. And replacing an animal isn't like replacing a car. It can take years to breed and train a horse correctly. Yes, I'm sure that some animals were literally worked to death back in the day. We probably hear about it in literature because it was dramatic and strange to the author, not because it was standard practice. People took their animals very seriously, which is why horse theft was punishable by death in much of the South West.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c3246117867349971032 title="comment permalink">9/6/16, 10:02 AM</a><br><br>

We give the cows a bit of Bloat Guard and can get three well-managed grazings off of each paddock. The beauty of the system is that we don't have to have a planter, swather, baler to manage the alfalfa crop- we just move the cows through it.

Yet characters like Janice Mikkelson and Ellen Montrose would be being born right now, have been born in the last ten years, or would be born very soon. Have a look at the US popular baby names for 2016. Middle-aged women in 2065 are most likely to be called Emma, Olivia, Ava, Sophia, Isabella. Men will be Liam, Noah, Ethan, Lucas, Nathan. Of course there will be outliers, but take it from someone who works with 6 year olds - these are really, really common names. Janice and Ellen are nowhere:)<br><br>Even Peter and Melanie are unlikely. Assuming they are around 35ish, they will be born 15 years from now. Peter and Melanie are names from my generation (mid-40's) and Peter and Melanie will be the age of my grandchildren. Older names do become fashionable again, but only after about 100 years or so. Today's children are being named after their great-grandparents. Their own grandparents are called hopelessly dowdy names like Jennifer, Angela, Melissa, Jason, Robert, Brian, and my own name, Joanne.

That company collects the mortgage payments, pays the taxes and distributes the results to the people who own the pool or the tranches. It's also the entity that can file for bankruptcy. The people who own the pool or the tranches don't really have anything to do with the administration. Even if it's been sliced into tranches, there are seldom more than five, ranging from the top (falsely) rated AAA to the final one, which was usually called "toxic waste" when I was in the investment part of the insurance industry.<br><br>As far as foreclosure fallout from the 2008 debacle, there are two kinds of states: administrative and judicial. The administrative states have pretty much worked through the backlog, the judicial states still have a backlog of foreclosures to work through. Stats from the federal mortgage agencies indicate that the percentage of their book of business that's over 90 days past due or in foreclosure is between 1 and 2%, compared to less (but not a whole lot less) than 1% in more normal times.<br><br>There are several cities that have decided that they're never going to get back to their old population, and are systematically eliminating subdivisions that have too many abandoned houses so they can turn off the services they're providing to them.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-ottawa-hills.html#c981595096476894117 title="comment permalink">9/6/16, 8:18 PM</a><br><br>

One of the main points he makes is about the out of whack balance between private and public economies in the USA and the fact that historically there has always been a mistrust of the public economy with its taxes which fund services such as schools, prisons, police, sewage, etc. viewed as “nonproductive”, and glorification of the private economy’s “self-made men“ who are seen as being productive. The neo-liberal project to privatize everything is just the culmination of this mind-set.
