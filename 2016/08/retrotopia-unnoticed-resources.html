<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the twenty-first installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator discovers that the differences between the Lakeland Republic and his own country include a sharp variance in vulnerability to sudden political and economic shocks...<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The briefing finally wound up a little before one o’clock, and Stuart Macallan invited all of us to lunch in one of the formal dining rooms downstairs. I gathered that the ambassadors were having lunch with Meeker in the president’s private dining room one floor up, but the meal was nothing to complain about: sandwiches on croissants, French onion soup, pear slices, Brie, and choice of beverages. You could tell something about each of the diplomats by watching the latter—the ones who downed strong coffee to deal with too little sleep, the ones who tipped back a local beer to be social, and the ones who got something stronger than beer to keep from having to think about just how bad this mess could get.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I sat with Hank Barker from the Missouri Republic delegation, and a couple of other people from the trade end of things—Jonathan Two Hawks, also from Missouri, Vera McTavish from East Canada, and one of the familiar faces in the room, Lashonda Marvell from the Free City of Chicago—I’d taken part in rough-draft negotiations on a trade-in-services agreement with Chicago six years back, and she’d been on the other side of that. Two Hawks and McTavish were coffee drinkers, Marvell and I ordered beer, and Barker got bourbon straight, downed it, and then ordered another. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They were all interested in access to the Erie Canal, of course. It had never really occurred to me how big a resource that was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>People in the Atlantic Republic government treat it as a relic, but with the Mississippi closed to ship traffic by a shooting war, it had suddenly become the one way around the potential bottleneck of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. While I wasn’t an official envoy, they all knew perfectly well that Montrose’s landslide election win meant that the current embassy staff might not have the same clout in Philadelphia they once did, and they wanted to make nice with the new team. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I was perfectly willing to play that game, for that matter. Transit fees on international shipments down the Erie Canal would bring in hard currency at a time when we could really use that, and if the whole business was handled right, it would leave the other nations involved owing the Atlantic Republic favors that could be called in later on. So, between bites of sandwich, I sketched out the kind of terms we’d want—I modeled them shamelessly on the draft agreement I’d worked out with the Lakeland Republic, of course—and they tossed back questions and counteroffers. It was a good lively discussion, the fun part of trade negotiations, and I think we really made some progress toward a set of agreements that would be win-win for everybody. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The official Atlantic Republic delegation sat pretty much by themselves over on the other side of the room, and gave me flat unreadable looks now and then. They knew perfectly well what I was doing, and what the people from the other delegations were doing. They were all Barfield’s people, most of them would be out of a job in January, and since I wasn’t here in an official capacity, I hadn’t bothered them and they’d returned the favor. Still, that was before this morning. Once the lunch broke up and people started heading out, I shook hands with everyone at my table, made sure they had my contact info back in Philadelphia, and headed over to the handful of Atlantic people still sitting at theirs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of them was a guy I knew from back when I was in business, and I went up to him and shook his hand. “Hi, Frank.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Hi, Peter,” he said. “Hell of a situation.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I won’t argue.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He eyed my clothes, and said, “Gone native, I see.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I laughed. “When in Rome. I got tired of people looking at me like a two-headed calf.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Whatever floats your boat,” he said. “What can I do for you?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“What’s official policy on sending a message to the President-elect via diplomatic links?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He gave me a bleak look. “‘All reasonable accommodation,’” he quoted. “You guys pounded us fair and square, and it’s your baby now.” With a sudden edged smile: “Frankly, now that this new thing’s blown up, I’m glad I’ll be out the door in two months.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I bet,” I said. We talked about the details, and the upshot was that the two of us took a taxi to the Atlantic embassy six blocks away on Lakeland’s Embassy Row. From the outside, it was a nice stone building of typical Lakeland design, like the other embassies, and the Atlantic flag, navy-white-navy with a gold anchor in the middle and a gold star in the upper left, whipped back and forth in a raw wind. Go through the door and everything’s brushed aluminum and black plastic, with the kind of abstract art on the walls that looks like an overenthusiastic dog gobbled an artist’s paint tubes and then threw up. I’d spent most of my adult life in settings like that, and gotten used to thinking of them as modern, cutting-edge, and so on. For the first time it really sank in just how incredibly ugly it all was. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, I followed Frank to the communications center down in the basement, got handed over to the comm manager and shown to a desk with a veescreen terminal. For the first time since I’d crossed the border, I had the once-familiar sensation of an image field projected into my visual cortex, and was surprised by how intrusive it felt. Still, I had work to do. I typed out something to Meg Amberger, the transition team’s trade-policy person, letting her know about the potential shipping agreements with Missouri, East Canada, and Chicago, and asked her to tell the boss that the negotiations with Lakeland had gone well—I figured she could use the good news. I added four words that I knew Meg wouldn’t understand, but would pass on anyway, and then hit the SEND button. A moment later that was on its way; I thanked the manager and left the comm center. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Frank was waiting for me outside the door. “Normally I’d invite you to come around and check your veemail here, but we’re down to essential traffic only.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It took me a moment to realize what he was saying. “Satellite trouble?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yeah. One more thing on top of everything else we’re having to deal with.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I eyed him, considered the options. “Can I buy you a drink?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He paused, then nodded. “Sure.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He knew exactly what I was asking, of course. We went outside again, and he waved down a taxi and gave the driver an address I recognized, over on the other end of downtown. All the bars and restaurants close to Embassy Row are wired for sound by somebody or other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you’re embassy staff or intelligence, you know where your people have mikes, so you can take contacts there when you want something recorded, and you usually know where at least some of the other countries have mikes, so you can feed them true or false information as the situation requires. If you want to talk off the record, though, you go somewhere well away from Embassy Row, and never the same place twice, so it’s harder for anybody else’s spooks to try to listen in. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So we rolled through the streets of Toledo behind the amiable clop-clop-clop of the horse, Frank looking glum and uncomfortable in his bioplastic suit, me being glad that old-fashioned wool suiting keeps out the chill. Neither of us said much of anything until we got out of the taxi. We were in front of the Harbor Club, the place where I’d listened to Sam Capoferro and his Frogtown Five and talked to Fred Vanich. It was open and surprisingly busy for three in the afternoon, but we had no trouble getting a table over to one side, across from the piano Sam had played. A spry old lady with silver hair and dark brown skin sat there now, playing Chopin with an ease that showed she’d had her fingers on a keyboard since she was six or so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The waiter came over as soon as we were settled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I ordered a martini, and Frank gave me a sidelong look and ordered a double shot of vodka, straight. The bartender didn’t waste any time, either.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“So,” I said, once the drinks arrived. “Satellite trouble, and everything else.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You know we lease satellite services from a Chinese firm, right?” Fred took a slug of his drink “We’re supposed to have four high-speed channels. Right now we’ve got one, and it’s high speed only if you give that phrase a really broad definition. Rumor has it that at least two embassies have no realtime comm links home at all, though nobody’s admitting it, and it won’t many more fender benders in orbit before our provider calls force majeure and we’re shut out completely. Everybody’s trying to figure out some way to get satellite service back, but it’s going to be a while.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“A long while,” I said. “How did embassies phone home before there were satellites?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It seemed like an obvious question, but Frank looked at me as though I’d sprouted a spare head. “I have no idea,” he said. “Who cares?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Anyway, our provider’s trying to see if there’s a way to get armored satellites out to the Moon’s Lagrange points or something, but that may be years out.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“But that’s just one more mess on top of the others. You know the Philly stock market’s down hard.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Along with everyone else’s,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Worse.” He gestured with his drink, which was getting toward half empty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“We had a lot more foreign investment than anybody realized—it was all through shell corporations, you know the drill—and when telecom stocks started dragging the market down, you had the usual flight to safety. The Department of Finance stepped in, of course, and propped things up with hard currency loans, but they’ve only got so much on hand and the World Bank isn’t handing over any more. So even before this damn war broke out, we were looking at a major economic crisis—and now this. I honestly don’t know how we’re going to make it.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We’ve had economic crises before,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“It’s different this time. Finance is running in circles like a bunch of robot tanks with a defective program, and everybody else is trying to get as much money out of the markets as they can without making too much noise, and when the hard currency runs short the bottom’s going to drop right out. I hope your boss has something up her sleeve, or we’re going to be in for it.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I motioned for him to go on, and he said, “And now the war. This stays off the record.” I nodded, and he went on. “Our NIS people here talked with their opposite numbers back home.” NIS was National Intelligence Service, our spook shop in Philadelphia. “They’ve got sources down south. Word is that along with the drilling platforms, at least eighteen Confederate production platforms got blown to scrap, and fourteen of them were running stripper well farms.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Meaning?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Meaning that there’s not enough output to pay for replacing the platforms once the fighting’s over. A lot of the Gulf oil industry works legacy fields, right? If the situation’s similar on the Texas side, and that’s the current best guess, a big fraction of Gulf oil production is g, o, n, e,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>gone, for good. That means another price spike, and maybe worse.” He gave me an uneasy look; I gestured for him to continue, and he said, “Actual shortages. As in ‘No, we don’t have any at all’ shortages. How do you deal with something like that?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“There’ve been oil shortages before,” I reminded him. “How did people deal with those?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I don’t have the least idea,” he said. “That was then, this is now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But the people back in Philly are just aghast. They’re trying to game possible responses and coming up blank. I don’t know if there’s any option that will work at all.” He finished his drink, waved down a waiter and ordered a refill. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded and said something to keep him talking, and for the next two hours or so got an increasingly detailed account of just how screwed the Atlantic Republic was going to be without viable satellite services, economic stability, or a reliable source of petroleum—we used less of that latter than most of the other North American republics, and a lot less than anybody thought of using back before the Second Civil War, but it was still something we couldn’t give up without landing in a world of hurt. All the while, though, I was trying to fit my head around the way he’d blown off my questions. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The penny didn’t drop until I got him onto a taxi—he was pretty wobbly by then, so I paid his fare and told the driver where to take him—and stood there on the sidewalk watching the back of the thing pull away. Two weeks ago, I realized, I’d have done exactly the same thing. That was then, this is now, it’s different this time, that’s history, we need to be thinking ahead of the times, not behind them: how many times had I mouthed those same catchphrases? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d meant to flag down another cab, but turned and started walking instead taking the distant pale shape of the unfinished Capitol dome as my guide. Around me, Toledo went about its business as though this was just another day. The sky had cleared off, the wind was brisk but not too raw, and people were out on the sidewalks, shopping or heading for swing shift jobs or just taking in some fresh air. The crisis that had the Atlantic Republic tottering was just another piece of news to them. It was interesting news; a paperboy came trotting along the street shouting “Extra! Latest news on the war down south!” and found plety of customers. Still, they didn’t have to care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It wasn’t something that was going to throw them out of work and shred the fabric of their daily lives. And the reason was—</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The reason was that they had stopped saying “It’s different this time,” and treated the past as a resource rather than an irrelevance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I kept walking. Everything I saw around me—the horsedrawn cabs, the streetcars, the comfortable and attractive brick buildings, the clothing on the people—had been quarried out of the past and refitted for use in the present, because they worked better than the alternatives. The insight that had come crashing into my thoughts in the middle of <i>Parsifal</i>
returned: for us, for people in the North American republics and elsewhere in the industrial world, the period of exploration was over, the period of performance had arrived, and we had plenty of data about what worked and what didn’t, if only we chose to use it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A streetcar went by, packed with workers on their way home from the day shift; the conductor’s bell went ding-di-ding ding, the way conductors’ bells went on those same streets a hundred and fifty years before. I knew perfectly well why nobody in Philadelphia had considered putting streetcars back on the streets of the Atlantic Republic’s cities, to do a job they did better, and for much less money, than the shiny high-tech modern equivalents. I’d been in the middle of the groupthink that made progress look like the only option even when progress was half a century into negative returns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Everyone I knew was well aware that “newer” had stopped meaning “better” a long time ago, that every upgrade meant more problems and fewer benefits, that the latest must-have technologies did less and cost more than the last round, but nobody seemed to be able to draw the obvious conclusion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I shook my head and kept walking, while those ideas circled in my head. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It must have been most of an hour later when I realized I’d overshot my hotel by a good six blocks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The Capitol dome was something like a dozen blocks behind me, and I’d strayed into an upscale neighborhood of row houses with little shops at the street corners. I turned around, headed back toward the dome. By the time I got there, it must have been past five o’clock, and people were trickling out of the Capitol entrance, heading toward the street and the line of cabs that waited there for fares. I recognized one of them at a glance; fortunately, she saw me and turned up the sidewalk to meet me. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Hello, Melanie,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That got a tired smile. “Hello, Peter. Hell of a day.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I won’t argue.” I considered the options. “Up for dinner?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“About that.” </div>
<br>
I gestured to one of the cabs; she smiled again, and the cabby bounded down from his seat and opened the door for us.<br>
<br>

In other fiction-related news, I'm pleased to announce that Founders House, the publishing firm of the <i>After Oil </i>anthologies, is launching a new magazine of science fiction and fantasy, titled Mythic. They're soliciting stories for the first issue right now. Publisher Shaun Kilgore is looking for science fiction and fantasy that moves past the stereotypes of the genre -- science fiction that isn't all about spaceships and rayguns, and fantasy that isn't infested with dragons and elves -- and he's indicated to me that submissions of deindustrial SF will be welcome. Check out the website <a href=http://www.mythicmag.com/ >here</a>.</div>

Or maybe we just hate to admit it's been done and we can't truly emulate our heroes...like being forced to admit there's no mountains left to conquer. <br><br>PS You first reference "East Canada" in the story, but then talk about "West Canada" when the narrator files his report.

I'll have to try that next time somebody tries to insist that the past is irrelevant. <br><br>Peakfuture, good. The Atlantic Republic flag has horizontal stripes like your second example; the navy blue is rather darker -- a good deep navy blue -- and the gold anchor extends into the blue stripes above and below. The Chicago flag is good. The Confederate flag in 2065, by the way, is the famous "Bonnie Blue Flag" -- a single white star at the center of a blue field -- and the song "The Bonnie Blue Flag" is the official national anthem, though you'll hear "Dixie" at least as often; it has the same role as, say, "America the Beautiful" does in the US today. Texas still has the same flag it has today.

Gibbon is essential -- biases and all, it's a monumental, brilliant work -- and all three are worth saving. I really do have to do a post on what to do now that the libraries have given up on their historic role and have turned themselves into venues for pop media. <br><br>Buho62, I really think it's a matter of intellectual fashion. There have been plenty of periods in history in which the idea of performance has been not only accepted, but prized above innovation: "now that we know what works, let's do it!" also has a certain charm, after all. Thank you for catching the continuity error, btw -- I've fixed it. <br><br>Kevin, thank you.

All that dithering and avoidance in the comment section last week was tiring for my poor brain...<br><br>"with the kind of abstract art on the walls that looks like an overenthusiastic dog gobbled an artist’s paint tubes and then threw up" Haha! That is funny stuff. You reminded me that many long years ago when I lived in the city, the neighbours kids chucked a bouncy multi-coloured ball into the backyard. It was unfortunate that the children wanted the ball back because the dogs ate it - I assumed because it was very chewy - and then proceeded over the next few days to defecate coloured piles of manure.

The kids certainly didn't want the ball back after all that artwork processing!<br><br>Ah, the Kessler syndrome in the story seems to be escalating too. The sky will soon be closed!

What whoever posted that on Imagur is showing is what they call the "now-cast," meaning if the election was held right at that instant. The other two forecasts are a good deal more informative, since they have different balances of trend-spotting versus noise suppression.<br><br>Polls immediately after the conventions tend to have a "bounce," that frequently dissipates after a couple of weeks. Although Hillary's bounce looks more like a pole vault - it's way out of what's been typical of the last few election cycles. Come back at the end of August, and it's more likely that the polls will be a reasonable forecast.<br><br>By the way - Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo is saying he misread Trump.

I know this is more to illustrate a point rather than a prediction, but it really doesn't seem like too much has changed in the Atlantic Republic over the decades. <br><br>When Carr thinks to himself, "and we had plenty of data about what worked and what didn’t, if only we chose to use it", that seems fair for the immediate future (or the era of scarcity industrialism, to use the terminology from <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i>). <br><br>On the other hand, there should still be a lot of notional space for exploring what a truly post-industrial society would look like in the slightly longer term, so they might just get their nice shiny Age of Exploration after all. At least the Lakeland Republic should be in a much better position to start that project than most other countries.<br><br>Oh, and I really had to smile when "it's different this time" came up. Nice touch. <br><br>While we're on the subject of your fiction, I'll second one of the commentators from a few weeks back who asked about the trade paperback version of <i>The Weird of Hali: Innsmouth</i>. I'd love to read it, but since international shipping costs as much as the book itself, I'll wait for the paperback. I do hope it's not too far off, though!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c3961797002360152634 title="comment permalink">8/4/16, 4:32 AM</a><br><br>

The global rise is an average. The local rise depends on a number of factors including gravity, currents, subsidence, topography, and more. Currents are why water if piling up on the East Coast of the U.S.; subsidence is the reason the southern coast of Louisiana is sinking so fast, and gravity is why certain South Pacific islands are disappearing faster than you can say 'evacuate.'

A friend of mine is a librarian at the local community college and since I was there to drop off some free newsletters, I popped in to her office to say hi. After a bit of chit chat, she asked me if I would help her with the libraries project to cull the collection of craft and manual arts books since they were short on space and couldn't keep everything. She knew I had some knowledge of several past arts and skills and I said sure and we trekked over to the stacks where these books were housed. There was a lot of fluff, and a few really useful books some of which she said they would keep. However, the really sad thing was that they would be keeping them not because they were useful to anyone at this community college studying wood working, metal working, calligraphy, embroidery or any other useful practical skill, but because they were something of a reference to the distant past. The way she explained it to me seemed to make these books something of an anachronistic place holder only. Maybe something that would show the college had had a useful purpose at one time. Some of the culled books had been in the collection since the time when the college had been a "technical" college and teaching manual and practical skills was it's purpose. Quite a number of them and not been checked out for many years if at all. <br><br>Thanks for sharing your great essays and fiction. I look forward to the upcoming post on libraries. Maybe you can share your list of essential books for understanding our current predicament too.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c8334824353324250497 title="comment permalink">8/4/16, 7:35 AM</a><br><br>

You cannot have enough backup comms. <br><br>Our head-of-mission in London, August Torma, was significantly handicapped in the crisis years following the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939-08-23 by lacking a rudimentary radiotelegraph room. Back home, the Republic of Estonia was undergoing a type of holocaust. **BUT** Torma had to be able to confer, and could not easily confer, with a couple of our other ambassadors, stranded abroad as he was, and eventually working with a govt-in-exile. It would have been helpful to have had radiotelegraph links both with Stockholm and with Washington, perhaps especially with Stockholm. <br><br>An embassy must on no account gamble that public infrastructure will continue being available in crises. We need at the very least a rooftop antenna farm, in the 3 MHz through 30 MHz regime, and some basement comms room radiotelegraphy gear with linear amplifier. It might suffice to forego the current burst technologies, and to rely simply on Morse, even with straight key in the manner of my relative Peeter M at the front in the 1918-1920 War of Independence.

Some years ago, the bursar's office set up an easy way for people to pay for tuition, fees, health insurance, etc online with our credit or debit cards. It was new, it was modern, it was efficient, it would save them all sorts of fuss and bother and piles of paper and clerical salaries, etc. <br><br>BUT - UNM has never lost an opportunity to nickel-and-dime its people to death, so just this past month they announced a 2.75% fee for all uses of credit and debit cards and suggested we go to direct withdrawal from our savings or checking accounts.

I commented to Varun in a recent letter that I have realized that I allowed myself to become more emotionally invested in this election than is warranted, given our prospects. The desire for change is great (but, as you have frequently pointed out, change is not always for the better), since the alternative is a continuance of our plodding along the path of imperial decline while simultaneously denying that we are do any such thing. Then, even as I was describing this realization in the letter, I had a sudden image in my mind of a clutch of fourth-century Romans frantically debating and fretting over the present crop of contenders for the Western purple. I actually laughed out loud, as that image clarified everything for me. Even the purest, best-intentioned Emperor cannot alter the underlying trajectory -- at best, he/she could deflect it onto a less unpalatable path. Our energy can be put to much better use working at our local level to do that same thing, likely more effectively.<br><br>I'm looking forward to the last few episodes of Carr's adventures.

Re-reading the first episode left me with these unanswered question: If riding a train was a first-time experience for Peter Carr, how is it that he got around the AR up until now? How for instance did he get from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh to even catch the train? What is the mode of transportation in the 2065 Atlantic Republic?<br><br>I finished reading <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> last evening (my copy ordered direct from Karnac books the week before). That book was more fleshed out and longer than I was expecting as compared to the five-part treatise shared here in the blog. The book reads much like a Tom Clancy book or the Cornelius Ryan histories of WWII (The Longest Day, A Bridge too Far), with multiple short sections making up each chapter and describing multiple events and place at the same time. A great read. A follow-on story might be how each of the different Republics came into being - we only get a glimpse in the last chapter of just one.<br><br>But then this raises another question on <i>Retrotopia</i> (for which I may have missed the answer if it was given) - how is it that the 13-state republic that forms at the end of <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> is now two separate republics (LR and AR) in 2065, forty years later?

When I visited London in both 1993 and 1994, I saw all kinds of embassies across Westminster that still had wide-band caged dipole antennas on their roofs. The hotel I stayed at both times in South Kensington had one such embassy across the street with that characteristic antenna.

The old canal paralleled the Maumee river and the side cut was to get around one of the many dams installed to maintain a working water level in the river for canal boats through the dry months of summer. Unfortunately there has been something of a dam removal craze the last three decades and many of the water works that made the river navigable for canal boats have been destroyed. The only remaining dam in the area now is in Waterville where a water powered mill museum had to sue the state to keep their dam from being removed. The good part of that story is, because the dam remains a mile long section of the canal was restored and gives tourists historical rides on a mule drawn canal boat complete with reenactors running the whole thing.<br>http://metroparkstoledo.com/features-and-rentals/canal-experience/<br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c1947065002092195076 title="comment permalink">8/4/16, 11:23 AM</a><br><br>

Here in Vancouver on any given day, it looks like only about a third of the people are using the computers for games or other useless stuff, so I consider that pretty good! The caveat is that my research consists of glancing around me, as I'm obviously not gonna hang around people looking over their shoulders.<br><br>Mr. Greer, I note with considerable dismay that your "East Canadian" character favors coffee over Lakeland Republic craft beer. Is this to suggest that our beloved, beer-soaked, hardworking East Coasters are going to be replaced by the kind of snobby, yuppie, liberal, latte-sipping twits that we have in over-abundance here in the West? Please tell me this is just something you made up off the top of your head without your usual careful thinking and attention to detail, and that there's actually no reason to believe any such thing will come to pass. It's far and away the most depressing thing you've ever said on this blog. I can handle the idea that my once-cherished modernity will grind to a long, painful, drawn-out close and and that many of the things I love, including the internet, high-grade marijuana, video games, and heavy-metal music will see their end in my lifetime because we won't waste ever-less available electricity on them anymore. I accept that. I can also accept that widespread famine caused by dysfunctional agriculture due to climate change and declining availability of petrochemical fertilizers is all but inevitable and may well finish me personally. But this other thing? Too awful to contemplate. Hit the button please, Mr. Putin!! Friends south of the border, Vote for Hillary!

When we encounter actual global ways of life outside the Lakeland Republic, I do find myself comparing to other future narratives set in this time period you’ve written (other stories set in roughly the Retrotopia era: Christmas 2050 (2050), Adam's Story (2060s), and Pink Slip for the Progress Fairy (2048-2089)). Now, I know part of the intent there is to give a perspective of a recognizably modern mind as a foil in order to work within the confines of the utopian genre, and of course you’ve said multiple times in comments that decline isn’t the important theme in this particular narrative, which is why you've directly kept references to aspects of the future directly related to the long descent, peak oil, climate change, etcetera to a minimum. However, I also know that you’ve got some rules when it comes to future fiction, and of course the headings to these tag them as explorations of the possible futures discussed in this blog.<br><br>Outside the Lakeland Republic this 2065 doesn’t actually doesn’t look that different from the present, if anything having tropes from mainstream sci-fi projections of the near future (such as th veescreen terminal). Even the civil war is really just the sort of thing that happens at least once a century. It isn’t until you look at it from the perspective of someone like Carr, who has gone to the Lakeland Republic and is now looking back at the technology in his embassy that you see the evidences of decline, and in terms of the stages of collapse discussed elsewhere, it really looks like the Kessler syndrome and the Texas/Confederate war are only just now beginning to push this world into the early phases of scarcity industrialism, since the Lakeland Republic is the only nation mentioned that has begun to make policy based moves away from things like personal automobiles, commercial air travel, and widespread internet use, while for the rest of the world there are still resources to maintain those things (but not for much longer), and new tight oil technologies (such as the stripper well farms) are still managing to cover enough of the difference to keep today’s business as usual going.<br><br>One of the things that’s emerging here is a crisis that’s finally going to force the rest of the world to adopt a scarcity industrial model (which the Lakeland Republic has already adopted voluntarily through public policy), since here, abundance industrialism has been pushed up to its edge, able to be maintained but not repaired if something goes wrong for a variety of reasons. Meanwhile, the external environmental impacts: sea level rise, collapse of ocean food chains from ocean acidification and pollution runoff, growing belt shifts, tropical disease influx, mass migration, desertification, etcetera all seem to be moving at a glacial pace, with mostly the same sort of news on those topics you tend to see today just projected forward slightly. Is this version of 2065 within the realm of possibility for you then? Or are you intentionally taking the absolute best case scenario that doesn’t require space bats to present, giving the mildest feasible end of climate projections, assuming a 2030 or later petroleum peak, and giving the oceans and the biosphere a major boost in resilience to make the point that even if limits weren’t an issue and progress was possible, it would still be self-limiting? If this is within the scope of possible futures, it’d be interesting to get a grasp of the best case/worst case possible scenarios for the future, and where the line between possible and beyond the pale lie on either end of the spectrum… in your own fiction, so far, it seems like the extremes are this on one end, and Adam’s Story (with its abandoned highways, wandering soldier bands, and one tiny fortified village) on the other. Or have you sidestepped the question by showing us the world through the eyes of the rich, which skews the usual ground level perspective? <br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c1675736712163062642 title="comment permalink">8/4/16, 11:40 AM</a><br><br>

At the beginning, he made lots of operational errors, and now he is skilled in observations (today correctly noting, for instance, what various diplomats are drinking). Is this perhaps worth pondering as you revise your work for your eventual book publisher? <br><br>If it were my book, I would keep Mr Carr's rather likeable current persona, but make him more skilled (and thus more likeable) in the opening chapters.

I think my friend was given, by the Canadian recruitment officer chatting with him in Britain, a nasty hypothetical scenario, in which as First Secretary in the Canadian Embassy in Ruritania he had to choose between (a) tragically betraying someone who trusted him and (b) keeping the folks back home in Ottawa ignorant of a fact they, the folks back home, would have been anxious to ascertain. To be accepted into the Canadian foreign service was evidently no easy matter. - And I note now that Estonia is trying to do its bit in training prospective diplomats from external countries, including Bhutan and Myanmar, via the Estonian School of Diplomacy (<a href=http://www.edk.edu.ee/index.php/eng rel=nofollow>http://www.edk.edu.ee/index.php/eng</a>), one would again imagine for long-term careers.<br><br>(2) There has, on the other hand, been something of a 20th-century tradition in the USA of making the head-of-mission a political appointment, as a sort of reward at the end of a long career spent inside the Beltway, not in close connection with Foggy Bottom. There has perhaps historically been some unease in the USA over the idea of the head of mission being too much a Foreign Ministry (i.e., a Foggy Bottom, a "State Department") careerist. <br><br>Which of these two models do Lakeland and the Atlantic Republic favour? Have they made the same choice, or have they diverged? <br><br><br>Tom <br><br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a><br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c4193930714670115704 title="comment permalink">8/4/16, 4:28 PM</a><br><br>

It is NOT much consolation to realize that in living in Vancouver, you are in one of the few Canadian cities whose winters fall short of being lethal. <br><br>Perhaps you will from time to time be able to tell us what you notice in the Vancouver homeless community - for instance, how good or bad you find the Vancouver police to be, and what you are noticing about the specific problems of the First Nations homeless?

I'd sum it up as "How dare you ask us to learn from our mistakes" -- of course that was the core theme of a lot of the pushback here, too. <br><br>Bush, I figure the novel version will help. <br><br>Scotlyn, your storytelling skills may be basic, but storytelling can be learned. The thing that can't be learned is the passion that leads one person to pursue a project that others haven't done yet. I'd encourage you to consider it. <br><br>Cherokee, your dogs should have gone to art school. If they'd simply had MFA degrees, those multicolored artworks of theirs would probably have a place of honor at some godforsaken museum of modern art. (The effective definition of "art" today is "anything produced, by any means, by someone with an MFA.")<br><br>Shane, heh heh heh. You know, I think it would be a good idea to take the election debate somewhere else, as you've suggested -- it's off topic except on specifically political posts. Many thanks!<br><br>Spanish Fly, nah, North American art museums started purging their collections of old works in the 2020s, the way libraries here do today.

That seems reasonable to me, though it isn't the only possibility by a long shot. As for <i>The Weird of Hali: Innsmouth</i>, the trade paper edition will go into production once a certain large fraction of the hardback edition has sold. It's selling tolerably well, but the timing of the paperback as well as the next volume in the series (which is already done and at the publisher) will depend on just how fast things proceed from here.<br><br>Rebecca, thank you.

One of the reasons I made wool a mainstay of the Missouri Republic economy is precisely that it works well in arid climates. Another is that wool really is better suited to clothing than plastic!<br><br>Kayr, the post on libraries is being moved way up the stack, as public libraries -- through no fault of librarians -- are defaulting on their historic role and turning into yet another delivery system for manufactured corporate pseudoculture. As for a list of books, I don't have such a list -- it's much more important for people to find their own, diverse book collections, so we don't get into the kind of mental monoculture that dominates so much collective thinking today. <br><br>Nrgmiserncaz, yep. Time to look for alternatives. Fortunately the past has one to suggest. <br><br>Over the Hill, yes, I figured I'd get some pushback about that. <i>De gustibus non disputandum</i> and all, but in my view Western visual art ran off the rails in the late 19th century and plunged into a self-referential bubble that has destroyed its ability to communicate to anybody outside a narrow and arrogant circle of cognoscenti. As it happens, I'll be discussing that in quite a bit more detail in next week's post, which I promise you, you will not like. I grant that by engaging with abstract expressionism one may come to a deeper understanding of the modern world; both of them, after all, are artificial, overrated, overpriced, and stunningly ugly -- but again, we'll get to that next week. <br><br>Toomas, Toomas, you never fail to delight me. "The Wolf and the Tart" -- that is to say, two normal, healthy people who don't happen to share your religious beliefs and the sexual customs deriving from the latter, and so handle their interactions in ways that you wouldn't. Which is fine, of course -- as already noted, I'm quite sure that in the religious and cultural diversity of the Lakeland Republic, there are plenty of people who share your religious and sexual opinions, and wouldn't do what Peter and Melanie are doing. The fact remains that he's an Atheist, she's nothing in particular (not even agnostic so much as uninterested) when it comes to religion, and it would be a violation of the consistency of their characters to act other than they have. Now, as for your comments on embassy communications, of course, you're quite correct -- notice, though, that the bad modern habit of ditching "outdated" backup technologies is very much the sort of thing that the Atlantic Republic would do. <br><br>Patricia, the UNM story is very funny indeed. As for the Atlantic military, I'm sure they've got contingency plans, to the extent that they've been able to get funding for them through the political process; yes, they'll be more realistic than the civilian government, but the necessary subordination of military to civilian authority places hard limits on what they can do. <br><br>David, that's an excellent point. Of course Romans in the fourth and fifth centuries did get amazingly bent out of shape about which feckless and interchangeable candidate was going to wear the imperial purple, and of course it mattered, in anything but the shortest of short terms, diddly-squat. That's worth keeping in mind as the current electoral circus stumbles through its routines. <br><br>Kevin, Carr got to Pittsburgh by car, of course. Wealthy and well-connected people in the Atlantic Republic have cars, and an increasingly costly system of toll roads links the major cities and other elite destinations. As for your broader question, <i>Retrotopia</i> and <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> are not set in the same future, of course. I'm a little surprised that you missed that -- in <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i>, after all, the US broke up as a result of a runaway constitutional convention, while in <i>Retrotopia</i>, the breakup involved the Second Civil War and four years of brutal street-by-street fighting.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c4538086238197508900 title="comment permalink">8/4/16, 7:06 PM</a><br><br>

I'm enjoying the world you present. In my own fiction, one of my goals has been to show that despite such world-shaking events and real hardship, life goes on much as before, with people falling in love and working together, the usual scoundrels still scheming, and more challenges, triumphs and defeats. Much happiness lies in accepting that things change, and moving on ahead in ways that are still possible.<br><br>Off topic, but it looks like you were right about many people in America respecting Vladimir Putin. The TV that my husband still insists on watching was blaring some emergency announcement from America's feckless, ahem, fearless leader that Trump was going to be investigated for some scam or other. (It reminds me of his brave stand in public against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.) <br><br>I guess the red scare didn't work quite as well as intended.<br><br>I suppose that the ability to travel that we have enjoyed widely the past thirty or so years and more recently also getting around on the Internet have had some of the positive effect I was hoping they would. We can go over there in one way or another and make friends, and quite a bunch of us did while we had the chance. (BTW, hoping to make my ecotours much more meaningful from an ecological perspective, I took the ship from Niigata to Vladivostok once for planning, and it was fun, but the Japanese don't have time. I kept getting complaints that I wasn't running three-day tours. There was a trade-off. Russia was a such a severe culture shock for the Japanese, that there was no way for tour leaders to shield them from it, which is what they demanded. But it really opened their eyes.)<br><br>Also way off topic, but a milestone in a worrisome sense, the number of farmers in Japan fell below 2 million for the first time (they don't say since when, but I reckon since about 2000 years ago, a while after rice arrived in the archipelago) as of last Saturday. My husband, Shinobu, says he and I are both officially counted among those 2 million. Twenty-five years ago, Japan had 5 million farmers. Shinobu says there are probably about five farmers in our "county" (Fujinomiya City) who actually make a living at it. The rest are on pensions or, like us, have someone bringing in an income some other way. Some have gone into debt to put up masses of solar panels, which will pay for themselves in eight years if we don't get a major typhoon here in the meantime.<br><br>I talked to one of the men making a living at it--I was impressed that he could. He was cultivating retired farmers' fields for them (you lose tax exemption if you fail to). But he was dealing with various cancers from all the gunk he was applying to the fields. A lot of farmers we know are so deeply in debt from government-run rackets that they've disowned their children so that the debt won't be passed down to them.<br><br>The situation is so bad even a new program providing prospective farmers under 45 years age with an income of about $18,000/year is not attracting very many. One man showed up near us and has started working the field across the street from ours. He'd heard some no-till ideas, and it sounded easy enough to him. Our own experience is that nearly every kind of crop demands vigorous weeding, and he's got a field that has been fallow three years, so the weeds will be impressive. I hope he will not be discouraged. He has a sign up asking for donations of equipment he is lacking. This is a town where the citizens typically steal these items from each other, regardless of need.<br><br>I'm going to have to start keeping a list of the people our town drives away, and what did it for them. The local "unwelcome committee" is unique in Japan as far as I know in using shotguns.<br><br>To summarize the above rant: Japan is so screwed!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c762486021914930389 title="comment permalink">8/4/16, 7:08 PM</a><br><br>

Anyone have a suggestion for the Missouri Republic? <br><br>Fred, no, I haven't read that; it came out right about the time I drifted away from reading new science fiction, though that was mostly a result of the oversupply of cyberpunk -- living in Seattle, I had to deal with Eighties hacker-and-slacker culture every wretched day, and I didn't want to have to choke down more of it in my SF reading. Still, I may give it a look one of these days. <br><br>Space Seeder, relax, there's still vast amounts of beer being guzzled in East Canada in 2065. The East Canadian trade attache had been up since three in the morning, and she was downing strong black coffee -- no lattes for her! -- to stay awake and alert while trying to work out an end run around Quebec. Once the day winds down, of course she's going to have a brew or three, if not something stronger. I hope you have someplace safe and dry to sleep, btw -- homelessness in a maritime Pacific climate is no joke. <br><br>Michael, of course -- but the Atlantic Republic bought into the latest high-tech gizmo system for their embassy communications, which is why they're fracked. <br><br>Donalfagan, I'm perfectly tolerant of abstract art; if there are people who want to paint it, and others who want to buy it, that's their business and none of mine. I simply reserve the right, in terms of the principle of dissensus, to roll my eyes, walk away, and comment accordingly on my blog. <br><br>Eric, good. <i>Adam's Story</i> was written when I still had a frankly unrealistic sense of the speed of decline; I still think it's a good story, and makes some valid points, but I really doubt things are going to move that fast in the real world. <i>Retrotopia</i> is in some ways unrealistically slow in terms of decline, but that's because like all utopian fiction, it's about the present, and I need a recognizably present-day society to bounce the alternatives against. <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> and <i>Star's Reach</i> are closer to what I currently expect -- that is to say, I expect US global hegemony to come apart messily in or around the 2020s, and I expect a dark age society vaguely like the one in <i>Star's Reach</i> to be in place around the 25th century. Make of that what you will. <br><br>MickGspot, funny. May I share a story of my own? In kindergarten, when we were getting ready for Washington's birthday -- it wasn't Presidents' Day yet -- we all got taught the words to "My Country 'Tis Of Thee" by one of those earnest teachers, very common at that time, who liked to teach by asking questions and hoping that somebody would come up with the right answers. When we got to the line "Land where our fathers died," I was the one called on to explain how they died, and I informed the teacher that they'd been eaten by alligators. My logic was straightforward: we'd learned all about the exploration of North America by Columbus et seq.; I knew, from a steady mental diet of Tarzan movies and the like, that one of the chief risks faced by explorers was that of being eaten by alligators; so I drew the reasonable conclusion. The teacher got very flustered, especially when I explained my reasoning, and managed to extract the desired answer from someone else. I went home baffled -- not for the first time, nor, of course, for the last. <br><br>Lunchbox, I hope somebody finishes the digging -- but digging a canal is a lot of hard work, of course, and I'm not sure the proprietors of small boats would be willing or able to pay for that.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c7294760930440931 title="comment permalink">8/4/16, 7:30 PM</a><br><br>

I am reminded of your blog entry from July 13 admonishing scientists to not assume that their opinions are valid outside their areas of expertise. Perhaps Archdruid/historians claiming not to process the world visually, should refrain from commenting on visual art. The dog barf comment was an uninformed sounding description that was beneath the caliber of your typical writing. I have a BFA from one of those snooty art schools (I actually took classes in the same venerated room Thomas Hart Benton taught decades earlier). I paint landscapes, mostly representationally but I am used to the arguments…”well I know what I like,” actually most art viewers have no clue what they like...they like what they know. They are affronted when something intellectually challenging, or outside the popular discourse is put in from of them. Kind of like most anything written about on this blog. Good art, serious art is a byproduct of an intellectual exploration, it can be realistically depicting the awe in a beautiful scene, or it can be the optical experimentation of placing two colors next to one another, or whatever else the artist finds fascinating. All one really needs to know about painting is this - all painting is abstract. Period. It is just shapes of colors. The act of painting is abstracting experiences in a 3 dimensional world and depicting it in 2 dimensions. That’s all. Next time you find yourself in front of artwork you don’t like, ask what is the threat? There are very real reasons you don’t like something, the discordant colors, the unbalanced composition, lack of skill by the artist, emotions triggered by subject matter, etc. Spend a few more seconds with it, it’s a good exercise in learning a little bit more about yourself.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c6732780491655000658 title="comment permalink">8/4/16, 7:51 PM</a><br><br>

What's even funnier is that the J-20 and PAK FA will probably be ready for front line service before the Lardbucket. The latest news suggests the F-35 won't be ready for combat until 2020 if not later.<br><br>Come to think of it, I remember there was a classified Australian study which was leaked to the press not too long ago. It concluded that the F-35 is inferior to the Su-35, which is the current top of the line Russian fighter and which is also being bought by the PLAAF. In particular, the study used state of the art computer simulations which included the latest intelligence, engineering and flight test date for both planes. It showed that our side could expect to lose five Lardbuckets for every two Su-35's shot down in air to air combat.<br><br>And did any of you see the latest bad news about the aptly named <a href=https://news.usni.org/2016/07/12/cvn-78-delivery-pushed-back-due-first-class-issues rel=nofollow>USS Gerald Ford</a>? None of the key systems seem to work right. With the failure rate on the fancy new electro-magnetic catapults, there's a better than 1 in 10 chance of failure per launch. So even in a TLG scenario, there's a good chance many of the Lardbucket pilots won't even make it into the air and will get to eat supersonic cruise missiles along with the rest of the crew. <br><br>I think its pretty much a foregone conclusion that if we are foolish enough to get into a war with the Russians and/or the Chinese, we will get curb-stomped in short order.

If you'd like to give copies if <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> to your local politicians, of course, I'd be delighted -- the whole point of that book was cautionary, along the lines of "this could happen if we don't get a clue." <br><br>Soilmaker, Logsdon's definitely a keeper. I wonder -- is the material in those old county extension books still in copyright, or was it ever in copyright? A "best of" anthology might be worth putting together. <br><br>Tarm, nah, you missed some of the details. In the earlier episodes, it was made clear that the border had been opened three years ago. As for Carr's cluelessness, he's in exactly the position one of Donald Trump's advisers might be in if, in the middle of November, after a landslide Trump victory, Trump suddenly up and sent him to Laos, say, or Moldova. (I'm using Trump as an example here because it's been made clear in the story that Ellen Montrose, the Atlantic president-elect, is a political outsider, as Trump is.) The envoy would have little time for briefing, and how many Americans know squat about the political realities or social customs in Laos or Moldova? That's the situation Carr is in. <br><br>Bob, exactly -- though the Toledo trolleys are electric rather than horsedrawn; remember the poop-powered methane plant we visited earlier? <br><br>Joel, thank you! The post on how an effective movement to counter anthropogenic climate change might be handled is tentatively scheduled for the 25th, for what that's worth. <br><br>Toomas, so noted. One of the complexities of writing a novel this way is that there's often a lot of continuity reworking needed in the early episodes by the time the latter episodes get written. As far as diplomacy, I'm figuring that the Atlantic Republic will have inherited some part of the culture of corruption and favoritism that's so much a part of public life in the big east coast cities, and so diplomatic posts will tend to be handed out as political plums. Lakeland? Good question; we haven't had any occasion to encounter Lakeland diplomats, of course. Thank you for the anecdote, which is priceless!<br><br>Eric, jamming technology is fairly selective; you've got to broadcast static or a countersignal on the specific bands you want to jam. It would be a piece of cake for the Lakeland government to leave certain bands unjammed (but carefully monitored) for the use of foreign embassies, on the condition that those bands only transmit encrypted embassy traffic and are not used to broadcast to Lakeland audiences. <br><br>Sylvia, yep. I applaud you for your willingness to slog through that turkey!<br><br>Ceworthe, hmm! I had understood that it's still possible to travel by canal from Lake Erie to the Hudson River on the Erie Canal; is that not the case? <br><br>Shane, most Americans put BC in Cascadia. Most of the Canadians I've met shudder at the thought of being politically connected to any portion of the US, with one exception -- I've heard from people in the Maritime Provinces that given the choice, they'd much rather join New England than Quebec. Thus the lines I've drawn. <br><br>Over the Hill (if I may), I'm wryly amused by the way that you're jumping from my lack of appreciation for abstract expressionism to an insistence that I must be planning on flogging the abstract expressionists out of the gates of the future! That, for what it's worth, is exactly the sort of posturing that has given so much of the modern art scene a reputation for pretentious silliness. <br><br>Siliconguy, I'd say choose the third party you like best and give it a boost. <br><br>Mgalimba, I've recommended King's book here repeatedly, for what that's worth.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c1950570958802972582 title="comment permalink">8/4/16, 8:13 PM</a><br><br>

I hope Japan can pull itself out of its nose dive. <br><br>Karen, funny. You've jumped to a galaxy of conclusions, to begin with. I appreciate a very wide range of art, extending from cave art through the works of the classical and Western tradition to East Asian and Northwest Coast Native American art; I have original works in my home, as well as some very high quality reproductions, and the scale and breadth of my art library might surprise you. (The visual media I don't appreciate, as I've said here repeatedly, are those that involve little shapes jerking around on glass screens.) My wife has a BFA in art history, and we make a point of visiting art museums when we travel. These days, though, we avoid the modern wings of same, because we've seen our fill of dog barf and have no interest in looking at more. <br><br>I know it's very popular in the art scene these days to insist that those people who don't find the latest fashionable drivel to their taste must be threatened by it, or what have you, but I've discussed the matter with a great many others who share my lack of appreciation for the drivel just mentioned, and nobody with whom I discussed the matter feels threatened; the word you want is "bored." What most of today's artists are doing goes out of its way not to communicate anything to those who aren't participants in the self-referential bubble of the contemporary arts scene. The mere fact that an artist finds something fascinating does not mean that anyone else is obliged to share that experience -- it is the artist's job, or it was the artist's job back before western art ran off the rails into solipsistic head games, to give the viewer a reason to care. But again, I'll be talking about that in much more detail next week. <br><br>Submarine, the funny thing is that I seem to have given US military technology more credit than it deserves in <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i>.

In art, there needs to be room for things that are just pretty, even if they are shallow. <br><br>I also think that realism and representational art got shoved aside too harshly. I like some abstract art too, but it IS elitist. The entire art world is elitist. It comes from a very long history of rich people and elites buying paintings, supporting artists, and cultivating trends. It creates an environment where elite artists and buyers reinforce each other and exclude everyone else. Why is a rich person's opinion about art more valid than a poor person's? Because they are the ones who buy paintings. Poor people get free paintings but guilting them out of their artist friends (please stop doing this to your artist friends lol offer SOMETHING in return.)<br><br>I think for some people, especially in the beginning, there was an attraction to abstract art BECAUSE it was divisive. Either you "get it" or you don't. So some art was valued precisely because people who weren't the hippest, trendiest in the art scene didn't like it. That's where the flood of mediocre abstract expressionism came from, and that's why art had to get weirder and weirder to stay cool. Meanwhile, now there's a lot of artists combining elements of abstract and representational art, which is like taking the best of both worlds (when done skillfully).<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c3055381894739195159 title="comment permalink">8/4/16, 8:48 PM</a><br><br>

Newfoundland will do very well for itself, sea level rise won't have much of an impact on them and climate change will probably improve crop yields there rather than decrease them.<br><br>The rest of the Maritimes - PEI, NB, NS (and CB?) will likely have quite a small population in 2065. The official birth rate in 2011 here in Nova Scotia was 1.6, but considering the numbers who leave the province and don't come back, the functional birth rate is probably around 1. The situation is similar in the rest of the Maritimes.<br><br>An agricultural revitalization might reverse things for a while, but ultimately most of the good farmland in the Maritimes is approximately at sea level. I'm sure in 500 years Nova Scotia, which will be two major islands, will look a lot like Ireland did 500 years ago.<br><br>So to follow up with questions about the identity and flag of the Maritimes in 2065? Probably not a whole lot. If anything, once Canada ceases to exist, New Brunswick is probably going to end up wanting to be part of Quebec, and it's possible that Quebec's political power extends all the way to Yarmouth for a while because Nova Scotia will be such a non-entity if our birth rates and emigration stay in free fall. PEI will do very well for itself until seas and climate end farming there and will certainly maintain an identity even after PEI becomes a sandbar in much the same manner the Acadians did.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c4444142729848916523 title="comment permalink">8/4/16, 10:05 PM</a><br><br>

As an aside, I would have thought that as the Lakeland Republic had been isolated for a generation that there would have been a drift in accents and dialect making Carr's first days requiring him to adjust to a different speech pattern than what he was used to as well as unfamiliar words.<br> Franks's reaction to the question of how embassies communicated before satellite's reminded me of something that happened in WW2 during the aerial invasion of the Netherlands. A parachute division was dropped onto what turned out to be major German formations leading to devastating losses. Making a bad situation into a catastrophic one was that the radios refused to function at all with some only having a range of a few hundred meters and others none at all. Allied command was thus in the dark about what was happening with the invasion force. In all this, not one person in the Division thought about simply knocking on somebody's door and politely asking them if they could borrow the phone as the phone lines were still working perfectly fine during all this.<br> As for using armoured satellites to replace those destroyed, why not just simply wait for satellites to be developed that have their own deflector shields. I think the later more likely than the former. A question that I do have. With the scenario that is being sketched out between satellites failures, oil supplies, technology misapplication and so forth - are you trying to sketch out what the top reverse slope of a Seneca Cliff (https://damnthematrix.wordpress.com/tag/seneca-cliff/) would look like?

They might consider, for a start, accepting that a great many people (including many who have extensive aesthetic educations) don't enjoy the kind of art that many modern artists prefer to make; that they have just as much right to their own aesthetic judgments as the artists do; and that bullying them from a standpoint of assumed aesthetic superiority is not an effective way to encourage them to reassess their opinion. That would clear away a great many of the barriers to communication. <br><br>Jessi, agreed -- there are some very beautiful and impressive things that can be done with the fusion of realism and abstraction; I'm thinking here especially of Morris Graves, whose works I got to see in great and welcome profusion when I lived in Seattle. There are also impressive things that can be done with the purely abstract. My point is simply that this doesn't make any abstraction that somebody with an MFA chooses to splatter on a canvas interesting, or worthy of attention, to anybody but the artist. <br><br>Nastarana, of course it does, but it's not going to invite the embassy staff of either to a briefing intended for neutral nations! I'm sure President Meeker has had meetings with the ambassadors from both warring powers, in order to communicate Lakeland's neutrality and insist on that neutrality being respected; no doubt the Lakeland embassies in Richmond and Austin are busy passing on the same points to the governments of both nations. <br><br>Prez, that sounds like a lot of fun. Tell me, is there an organic spray you can use to get rid of Pokemons? I want a 55 gallon drum, please.<br><br>Justin, interesting. I'd heard several people from the Maritimes talk about a possible union with New England as a future possibility, given the breakup of the US and Canada. Do you feel this is unlikely? <br><br>Kevin, thirty years isn't enough to cause significant linguistic drift, though the slang will probably differ. As for the Seneca Cliff, no, because I disagree with that entire concept. My study of the declines and falls of civilizations leads me to see that as a long ragged process with many ups and downs, not a cliff at all. 2065 is the beginning of a significant leg down in the twilight of the industrial age, but it's not the end of the world by a long shot, just another round of crises causing more high-end tech to be abandoned and more energy production to be shut in permanently.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c7749378156393998279 title="comment permalink">8/5/16, 12:20 AM</a><br><br>

I wonder -- is the material in those old county extension books still in copyright, or was it ever in copyright? A "best of" anthology might be worth putting together.”<br><br>I wasn’t sure about the copyright status of county extension materials but according to an Ohio State University website, I believe county extension materials are copyrighted but can be used as long as you acknowledge the source. thttp://extension.osu.edu/policy-and-procedures-handbook/v-legal-matters-and-risk-management/copyright/copyright-and-fair-use. <br><br>It’s interesting that you thought of an anthology. I turns out that the extension book I like the best “Gardening for Food and Fun” was an anthology of extension articles published in 1977 by the US Department of Agriculture. I checked Amazon and the original hardcover book is still available if anyone is interested. Someone republished a paperback version but reviewer said it was a poor quality scanned copy. The information on the paperback copy says the author is the US Department of Agriculture but it was published by Fredonia Books (NL) (March 21, 2006). Does this mean that anyone can create a newer version as long as the US Department of Agriculture is acknowledged? I searched and found that the Department of Agriculture published several anthologies, many of which I was able to find on Amazon.<br><br>Another good source of old gardening books is local library book sales. Older gardening books have fewer pictures but much more information. Although after reading lesson 3 in Green Wizardry I’ll have to learn to rephrase that and say much more data!

Climate change activism, education and political process in ”representative” West have all been examined under harsh, but not malevolent light. I thought to share couple of (subjective) perceptions I have made by following the debates of comment sections.<br><br>This ”class war consciousness” against native working classes you have described from your own point of view so well has staggering power to hold otherwise intelligent people in its’s thrall. Here in Scandinavia, and more generally in Western Europe, grassroots rebellion against this new status quo and ancien regime has started at least decade ago. Right-wing populist parties have brought SJW taboo subjects such as resistance against immigration and free trade to political table many years ago. Outcries of racism and fascism have followed in every country with boring predictability. People talking about real concerns in their real lives are turned into somekind cartoon Nazi monsters in hysteric propaganda of Looney Left and SJW crowd. Psychology of this outcry has been very similar in every country: blight of working class is somehow regocnised, but ideologically pure Brahmins of intelligentsia sentence political reflection of this blight with harsh words. People are voting wrong, and their canditates are stupid and vulgar. They should vote Sanders, not Trump. Onwards to progressive Utopia! Same temper tantrum was experienced in every European country in the early stages of New Right rising to the parliaments. Trump is the reflection of your nation’s populist Right stirring first time murky waters of politics with their new-found strength. It won’t go away, even if SJW’s preach hard their Holy Trinity of anti-racism/feminism/LBGT pedestalizing. Boogey man is out of the closet now in USA also.<br><br>The observation: debate on your comment sections have followed same, well-worn path that has been experienced here in Europe many years ago. Shrill denouncements and power fantasies projected by faithful SJW's have been as predictable as shrieks of monkey tribe from whom the territory is taken by new, aggressive monkey tribe. Desmond Morris would be thrilled to follow how ritualistic and ceremonial our "deep thinking" really is. There is no depth in it. It is just intellectualized war noise of one monkey tribe ready to attack other monkey tribe, threatening their vital interests. Tribe is everything, the truth. All universalist ideas and moral posturing are just hollow stories and lies, frosting on the cake. These progressive persons... they are just as ready to burn in righteous fire all heretics and infidels as those religious fanatics and Nazi monsters they so despise. Only difference is who they are willing to tie to the pyre.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c6808067148336939295 title="comment permalink">8/5/16, 5:54 AM</a><br><br>

Well, visiting Halle in former East Germany was surreal experience now. People are afraid and angry. Atmosphere of fear and violence is quite pervasive. Middle class persons speak against immigration, if they see you as sympathetic listener. In Germany, ashamed and ridiculed so hard after WW2, this was thought crime just two years ago. No middle class German person then was willing to participate in anti-immigration conversation. Oh boy things have changed! Atmosphere is like is Soviet Union during it’s last years, as told by my father. He was frequent visitor into CCCP during Finnish-Soviet economic alliance, and he told many times that during late 80’s Soviet citizens just started to talk about taboo subjects semi-openly. He told how shocking that was to him, back then. Same kind of change has now happened in Germany among it’s citizenry.<br><br>Fear is everywhere. Immigrant attackers have brought stupendous amounts of violence into Germany, much of this information is left out from mainstream media. Effect has been that people does not trust mainstream media anymore. Even middle-aged bartenders are now reading news from shady internet sites nowadays in Germany. They also fear immigrants and violence even more, knowing that they cannot trust media to cover "unpleasant subjects". There are also heavily armed police check points in many ordinary places, like at the gates of popular observation post. Security checks are also quite thorough. "Liberal normalcy" is totally lost in everyday lives of people. In a weird way it resembles semi-militaristic feeling of Jerusalem, where every road trip through ”safety fences” is quite a adventure, and where getting into Armenian quarters or Church of Holy Sepulchre takes an innovative mind if there have been "incidents".<br><br>Immigrants are also scared. In Germany, very short hair is shunned as a style because it’s ”far-rightness”. In Finland we have no such prejudices against militaristic hair style, so in we went to this kebab restaurant with our short hair styles. Poor guy working on the counter actually fled the premise. Later he told us that he thought some kind of NSU-hit squad had entered the restaurant. He was really scared, shuddering was visible after he realized we were just some tourists trying to buy food from him. We told him that we like our kebab and makers of it very much, and that in Finland short, militaristic hair style is quite common. It took long time for him to look relaxed again. <br><br>Atmosphere of distrust and fear. Common identity broken beyond repair. Total nihilism and distrust towards ruling political class. Rising tide of violence and sexual harrasment. These are ingredients slowly brewing in the contemporary cauldron of Western Europe. It shall not end well.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c961830010732168648 title="comment permalink">8/5/16, 6:10 AM</a><br><br>

Retrotopia is in some ways unrealistically slow in terms of decline, but that's because like all utopian fiction, it's about the present, and I need a recognizably present-day society to bounce the alternatives against. Twilight's Last Gleaming and Star's Reach are closer to what I currently expect -- that is to say, I expect US global hegemony to come apart messily in or around the 2020s, and I expect a dark age society vaguely like the one in Star's Reach to be in place around the 25th century. Make of that what you will."<br><br>Of course, in Star's Reach, they still had the infrastructure to build Star's Reach itself in the 2200s if I recall, and you put Retrotopia's second civil war in the 2020s, so it still fits into the window, though it looks like Retrotopia's future religious makeup would probably be Shakers and Mormons, rather than Gaians.

And Popular Art continued creating arts for the masses which had some really good stuff. <br><br>Music picked up the African strain - blues, ragtime, jazz, soul, doo-wop - climaxing in rock'n'roll - and ran with it. Whether that's played out now is a good question, though I think the break dancing that accompanied some of it will survive. And I'm sorry, folks, but when you have just come from a course on Old English Poetry and listen to rap and hip-hop, even gangsta' rap, you can no longer dismiss it as "not art." It is simply "barbarian art." <br><br>The visual arts (and Heinlein pointed this out ages ago) turned into industrial and commercial design and illustrations. Yes, Norman Rockwell, and also Thomas Hart Benton. And I can think of one widely praised abstract artist who could have made a fortune in wallpaper and fabric design had he chosen to do so. Especially in inventing new plaids. <br><br>The Opera &amp; Theater niche was filled by Broadway, then the movies. The local classical music station plays quite a few Broadway show tunes and movie musical numbers, and TV themes like "Victory At Sea" which are very listenable. And the movies created a new genre, the animated film - how many people still visualize Robin Hood as a singing animated fox? Which in turn revived the ancient tradition of the animal fable. <br><br>At any rate, while the Art World of the day was going off on those tangents you have rightly been deploring (I don't like that sort of thing either) and sneering at us peasants and our middlebrow tastes, the peasants were sneering right back. <br><br>Which may all be moot now - that particular creative streak may have come to an end, or it may not have. I have completely lost track of what's going on in popular music, frex, though I do intend to get the Zootopia DVD and watch it. <br><br>BTW, is this sort of split new in history? For all that Spengler's first volume is actually Art History rather than historical cycles per se, I have not a clue. <br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c5855751139758024558 title="comment permalink">8/5/16, 8:17 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you for your kind words. I'll try to address your questions as best I can here.<br><br>- Homelessness itself. In a lot of ways, yes, it is pretty awful. To the best of my knowledge, it exists everywhere that there's a capitalist/free market structure to the economy, where we all compete for places in it, because if there were no penalty for failing, or for refusing to compete, then a lot of people wouldn't bother themselves to. I'm not trying to make any value judgements about whether a different system would be better than this one, just that capitalism doesn't work if it doesn't penalize failure.<br><br>- Having said that, many people who still have means recognize, as you do, the inhumanity inherent in a society that discards some of it's members like garbage. Some people express this by giving money to panhandlers, which may make them (the panhandlers) happier in that they're a step closer to their next beer, or joint, or other drug, but it doesn't do much other good, as the rumors seem to be mostly true, at least here where I live: They're not collecting money for food/clothes/bus ticket home, or whatever. A good way to handle a panhandler, I've found in both my former and current life, is to look them in the eye and say, "No, sorry, I can't help you, dude.", instead of averting your gaze or crossing the street to avoid them or whatever. That at least gives them some dignity. I've only seen it from the one side since I will NOT beg, but I can tell you that of all the things we're denied by mainstream society, dignity is the worst.<br><br>(note - crossing the street to avoid crazy or violent people is quite understandable!)<br><br>- Haha. That last point got a little bogged down in panhandling, which I didn't intend. The point I meant to make is that those who help us the most effectively are those that support organizations that provide food, shelter, and hygiene services, either by donating or by volunteering. The ones that I'm most grateful for here in Vancouver are Salvation Army, for their meals, The Gathering Place for showers and other hygiene needs, and Union Gospel Mission for meals and shelter, although regarding that last I prefer to sleep outside as much as I can.<br><br>(cut here for length)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c2631081479273599421 title="comment permalink">8/5/16, 12:54 PM</a><br><br>

Sleeping outside is WAY better than going to a shelter and being surrounded by anger, depression, and mental instability. I'm hoping that I can do it year round. I'm putting off getting myself a blanket as long as I can, in favor of acclimatizing myself to the chill of the wee hours. <br><br>- My experience of the police is that they are unfailingly polite if I am polite to them. One drunken time (years ago, in my old life) I wasn't, and I got put on the hood of a cop car, but that was my fault. It sure looks to me that if I'm polite and mindful of the fact that they have all the power, my encounters with them need be only minimally unpleasant. This includes a recent occasion when a cop ejected me from a Tim Horton's for sleeping on the table. I say all this as someone who is unenthusiastic about rules and authority.<br><br>- First Nations: The salient fact is that they're way over-represented. Hardly surprising: My people introduced Old World diseases to their territory, wiped out most of them that way, invaded their lands, brutally suppressed and contained the remnants of their once-proud peoples and all but eradicated their culture, so obviously they're going to be more vulnerable than most. There are various services to address the needs of First Nations homeless, drug users, &amp;c, as there should be, but I'm a white guy with no First Nations family connections, so I don't know much more than that.<br><br>- Homeless Self-Organizing: Unlikely. We tend to be people who don't much care for rules, and also we don't trust anyone, least of all each other.<br><br>Anyway, thanks again Tom.<br><br>I have to close this session now because it's almost lunchtime over at UGM and I'm quite a ways away from it. I look forward to coming back and following the rest of the discussion.<br><br>Oh, Tom, I almost forgot: What answer were your friend's diplomat trainers looking for when they posed that dilemma? I assume it's "betray the confidence and report to the government".

In former times, when I first became aware of it (1977-82, say) it would have been fair to say that Alberta saw BC as kind of loopy-left and BC saw Alberta as overly-hardnosed right, but I think the worst it ever was, was that they saw each other as kind of weird cousins. The effect appears to be much diminished these days as both have moved in the others' direction.

I don't want to speak for our friends in the Maritimes but perhaps the lobster will become a major part of the economy there as they migrate steadily northward due to warming waters. Feel free to enlighten me on this.<br>The eastern white pines were of importance because they are enormous. The Royal Navy so valued their trunks for masts the British authorities emblazoned the taller ones with the King's Broad Arrow, which marked them as property of the Crown. This antagonized the colonists who had their own use for the trees and helped fuel support for the Revolution. This reminds me somewhat of the relations between the federal government and people in the rural west today.<br>I was lucky enough to grow up near a stand of very old white pines that covered an entire mountainside. Many of them were almost 200 feet tall, six to eight feet in diameter, and the lowest branches were perhaps 80 feet above the ground. I used to camp in there, and I still remember the awesome deep tone of the wind far above. This place had a lot to do with who I am. I like to think that my practical Puritan ancestors had a similar experience there, but perhaps that is wishful thinking.<br>These trees survived hundreds of years of settlement by not being near a river, having the right landowners, and being on the leeward side of the mountain when hurricanes made it this far north. Then in 1989 a rare tornado came out of the northwest and knocked almost all of them down. I have always been grateful to have known this place and it is good to know that sometime in the future when our endless growth is curtailed there will be room for great forests.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c1117618646312968027 title="comment permalink">8/5/16, 4:17 PM</a><br><br>

I have been reading Revolt Against The Modern World by Julius Evola. I just finished part one.<br><br>First off, I have to agree that the modern world has lost all spiritual connection to space/place, lost the cyclic and ritualistic aspects of time, lost the essential bonds of family and fraternity, and has elevated materialism and scientific rationalism above all good sense. <br><br>But defending slavery, the caste system, racism, oppression of women, imperialism, and the notion that the poor are inherently spiritually unworthy and deserve their low status and exploitation by claiming that the warrior king paradigm of conquest, competition, hierarchy and greed is the original and correct state of affairs makes me want to embrace my inner holy warrior and bash his head in with his own book.<br><br>The Atlantic Republic et al are the obvious end game of that mentality. <br> <br>The "superior" races and classes he claims are the most fit to own land and rule things are the capitalist imperialists that have wrecked the world in every way.<br><br>He claims real Traditional societies from antiquity embraced the oppressive, exploitative and misogynist actions because these ways are attuned to the underlying spiritual energies of the universe (the quantum continuum, we would say) and the greed and competition are therefore right and normal - as opposed to a sharing, nurturing, egalitarian society that he claims is dark, evil and feminine.<br><br>The winners clearly wrote this history.<br><br>Judaism does have a deep notion of connecting spiritually with and sanctifying even the most ordinary tasks (and also sufers from the embedded patriarchy nonsense) so the idea of expanding a spiritual dimension back into modern society, respecting cyclical time and ritual, and sanctifying our space/land resonate with me. But his social policy recommendations suck, to say the least.<br><br>I don't know what happened in deep antiquity to cause the overthrow of the mother-goddesses, so to speak, and replace them with the warrior kings.

I figured that the perpetually butthurt (and not always without good reason) Acadians might side with the Quebecois, but Nova Scotia and PEI is nearly all Scots-Irish, and although we do our thing with Boston, I don't see much cultural connection other than the historical circumstances (and lots of Irish people).

Yes, coastal infrastructure will be destroyed, but there are lots of reasonable places to rebuild something not too far as the crow flies from the present shoreline.

I see a certain amount of blame of society about it. I am wondering how did you become homeless?<br>I have a brother who is homeless in Los Angeles. He has spent the last 30 years or so on the street, but most of those years he kept a kind of small truck called a step van but it was quite a hassle what with finding a place to park it. About 2 or 3 years ago, his van was impounded when the lot he had been parking in was sold and the new owner was not amused. I am not sure if he kept the area clean...<br><br>So now he is truly on the street and my husband and I have invited him to come live here, but with the condition that he get food stamps or other benefits. He doesn't want to use his social security number, so he may not do it, although he didn't protest about that much.<br><br>And I don't even know if he can travel by bus what with the new scrutiny of identity. He does not have a valid driver's license. However, a local guy here goes back and forth to Cali and has agreed to bring him and I expect him here in about a week or so. I live on the east coast.<br><br>He is homeless because he is, as the Russian expression has it, "quietly scrambled" i.e., pleasantly mentally ill. He says he chose it because he didn't want to pay rent. He has no bad habits and is in pretty good shape according to my ex. He's now in his early 60s. He is rigid in his thinking and goes to church all the time. <br><br>I don't blame anyone for this nor does he. <br><br>He does not plan to stay. Mostly because of church I think. But perhaps he will like it here. He agreed to come, pretty enthusiastically, once it was clear that he will get a ride back home in October. He is not unhappy. He's got his life there. He is on the city council. <br>The main issue is that he has his stuff in a storage unit and I have been paying for it, and I tell him that can't go on forever. He gets vague, because he thinks he has plans to learn how to flip real estate and spends most of his internet time on that.<br>We are homesteaders in the country, as different from LA as it gets. But he has done some community gardening and we once lived in the country and I believe he liked it. He is not unhappy at all, but he is getting older.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c5421383341135990083 title="comment permalink">8/5/16, 7:12 PM</a><br><br>

But when the camera makes a close-up, and pastes the little sad thing into a page of paper, all the dimensions are lost and the results end up ugly.<br><br>And, the fact that it takes someone to know about perpective in order to "get it", is an evidence that the photographs are not for the consumption of the general public. They need to walk into the building, and see the work of art from the right angle in order to be touched by it. And it was Michelangelo's job to put those images 20 metres above the ground for the commoners to not just see, but feel them; not the job of the commoners to go learn architecture so they also could enjoy the same ugly art in a canvas at 2 meters of their noses.<br><br>I know nothing of Abstract Art to have an opinion about it, one way or the other... but I think much of what is happening in this discussion may be explained by the lack of perspective.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c8480217012117134406 title="comment permalink">8/5/16, 7:19 PM</a><br><br>

As an artist and, well, now a former art teacher to children: Abstract art may seem easy, just random blobs of color or lines that just magically happen to look pleasing, balanced, dynamic, evoke a feeling or a resonance of some sort in the viewer: It's one of the hardest styles to actually do well without it looking like a dog's dinner, (or as JMG described, a dog's vomit.) Anyone who thinks it's easy: give it a go. No matter how 'plebian' you think your aesthetics are - you will not be satisfied that your blobs are just right, in size, shapes, colour juxtaposition... just evocative of a feeling or place or time.... It's HARD!<br><br>I was always under the impression it was the tail-end, the filling of that last bit of notional space of the idea of visual art reflecting or taking on Western Civilizations embrace of Sigmund Freud's work and the concept of psychology, the existence of the subconscious, a viewer's primal reactions to art as stimuli, etc. Abstract expressionism is meant to short-circuit or bypass the rational analytical side of the viewer's mind and engage a completely pure emotional response. There are definitely some well celebrated abstract expressionist paintings that can do that. No education in art is or should be needed, (perhaps other than the instruction to 'let go of preconceived notions and feel. What is the painting feeling like to you?') <br><br>I fully agree that abstract expressionism and the more recent popular school 'conceptual art' ( a whole 'nother can-o-worms!) have been utterly hijacked by theorists, art dealers who would rather the great unwashed did NOT 'get' it. For young artists wishing to make a big name for themselves in such a world, it's mostly, or maybe all about creating that hype. Getting a pass from these gate keepers.<br><br> Like Dr. Seuss's Star-Bellied Sneetches, it's human nature to want to be above the crowd: elite, in-the-know, (how can you be 'in-the-know' if everybody else is too?) This has driven those gate keepers of taste and 'relevant' art to great dizzy profits. But IMHO, like all vulture capitalists, they've shot themselves in the foot. They've become the parasite that killed host. <br><br>A governmental office, corporate headquarters or big bank that has money to burn on interior design, including the art wants something both cutting edge and ultimately safe and they don't know what they're looking at and don't trust their own tastes. It's not their bag, they hire "experts" to make those selections; so you get the worst of both worlds. I would personally not have interpreted JMG's dissing description of the Atlantic Republic's interior design and artwork as a slam against all modern or even all abstract expressionist art. It's like slamming elevator muzak of the Beatles. It's not slamming the Beatles.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c6073251344415639588 title="comment permalink">8/5/16, 9:25 PM</a><br><br>

Until quite recently, to wash the dishes, folks in rural areas would go outside or into a little shed with a small stream running through it. Our house has this lovely little trout-inhabited intensely cold gushing spring-fed pool by the front door.<br><br>If the monsters are good enough to stay on the sidewalk, I suppose I won't need to use it, but it's nice to have handy at times like these.<br><br>@Onething, Japan is not monolithic, though they attempt to appear that way. As I note, the use of shotguns is rare enough to be possibly unique to our town. Coldness to newcomers, on the other hand, is pretty widespread. I've not been shot at yet, but my husband has and a friend living just outside of town gets shot at regularly. The fellow living out back, whose wife of some 12 years up and divorced him a few years back for physical abuse, likes hunting, and in a real collapse scenario, I half expect to be undone by him. (Thank goodness yesterday we got an offer to view a house in a town a few miles away with a better reputation.) Twenty-three years ago, in a drunken fit, he came and bashed the door of our house in, smashing the glass to smithereens, and meanwhile the neighbors implored with my husband not to call the police. We never replaced the glass. It's still boarded up.<br><br>These days we are good friends with the policeman--a detective because of all the mysterious crime in the area. His son is being bullied at the grade school. They've driven a succession of cops away like that.<br><br>If I provide western aliases for the citizens and geographic features (Inokashira translates as Hogshead, with Fuji as "The Mountain" on the east, and the mountains to the west), a description of life here sounds amazingly like that in the Ozarks.<br><br>There are historical reasons for that. This was the border between fiefdoms toward the end of the warring period, and some of that rivalry is still being played out among the inhabitants. Some houses have the Takeda crest, and others have the Tokugawa. Toward the end of the Edo period, a high-profile gangster had some of his men come settle this area. Psychopathic traits seem more prominent here than elsewhere, with kleptomania being part of it.<br><br>Crop theft is a big problem all over Japan, though, and we hear the Ag cooperative is to blame, trying to discourage competition to their racket.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c3970357070583832176 title="comment permalink">8/5/16, 10:45 PM</a><br><br>

It'll be interesting to see who ends up in power in Germany as things work out. <br><br>Patricia, okay, that one's even funnier than the alligators. I admit to wondering whether the pilgrims were being peeping toms or whether they'd brought crowbars to strip the land of its mineral wealth -- or both. <br><br>David, yes, I saw that.

Yes, the solstice trilogy is pretty close to my current take on things; no, <i>Dark Age America</i> doesn't build on that -- it avoids fiction altogether. I may someday do a fictional history of the decline and fall of industrial civilization -- one of those multigenerational novels, probably -- if I can find a publisher willing to offer a competitive advance. <br><br>Over The Hill, no, I didn't think you were paying attention. What I'm objecting to, as you'll notice if you take the time to read what I was saying, is the insistence that nobody has the right to criticize art except for the inhabitants of the self-referential bubble of modern art. Thus I put an aesthetic judgment in the mouth of a fictional character, and you and Karen piled into me with what amounted to an insistence that I have no right to my own opinions about art if they disagree with yours. You're continuing to twist what I'm saying in an attempt to justify cheap shots -- perhaps you can show me some justification for your claim that I'm somehow opposed to the use of new materials, for example -- and that's just trolling. If you keep it up I will ban you from this blog. <br><br>Patricia, no, it's not new. It's a common element of the schism between the dominant minority and the internal proletariat -- as high culture becomes the exclusive preserve of the political class, and its purveyors go out of their way to make sure nobody outside a self-selecting elite appreciates it, the rest of the people turn to other art forms, usually from other cultures, to provide what the artists of their own society have stopped providing.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c3664914090964574567 title="comment permalink">8/6/16, 1:02 AM</a><br><br>

He had 20 children during the course of two successive marriages and named 17 of them in his will.

Some of them include the branch that migrated to Nova Scotia (being loyalists) in or about 1770-1780, adopting an altered spelling of the name, which I carry to this day. Then there were those who between the WW's left Nova Scotia and emigrated to Boston (specifically Waltham) including my grandfather, who set up a grocery largely patronised by a large emigre community of Eastern Canadians among whom he met my grandmother. My father's childhood summers (1940's 1950's) were spent in Nova Scotia and we still consider ourselves closely related to folk in both Maritime regions. <br><br>Justin, I wonder is it still the case that Boston is the "Big Smoke" that exerts a particular pull on Nova Scotian young people? <br><br>For my part I have no doubt the connections across that border run deep.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c3459908185170255886 title="comment permalink">8/6/16, 1:13 AM</a><br><br>

On the other hand, they simply don't hold my interest. I've stood gamely in front of works by a range of modern artists -- not just abstract expressionists, by the way -- and reliably get bored after five minutes. There simply isn't that much to them. A Renaissance master or, say, one of the better French symbolists? Give me half an hour at least, and I'll be back several times to look at it again with fresh eyes. It's not "okay, that's a mildly interesting effect with paint" -- there are depths within depths. <br><br>Chaos, I'd forgotten that you were responsible for one of my Hugo nominations! Many thanks for that. <br><br>Peter VE, it means the artist figured out how to get a lot of money for a stuffed bear impaled on a lampshade. A good deal of what passes for modern art makes perfect sense if you assume that it's deadpan put-on, and the soi-disant artists have just figured out how to extract big money from clueless bureaucrats. <br><br>William, America reinvents itself a couple of times each century, and I'm convinced that the next place that's going to happen is the Great Lakes rust belt states.

Thanks also for the culinary example; I'd always wondered why I tend to prefer Italian restaurants to French... ;-)<br><br>Donalfagan, I don't draw a line at all. As I noted earlier, I find some of the artists who blend the abstract with the representational -- Morris Graves was the example I cited there -- very moving. I find Degas, Seurat, de Kooning et al. rather less interesting than their predecessors, and their successors very quickly descend to the point where their product is worth something between five minutes of looking -- "Okay, that's a mildly interesting visual effect; pity the artist didn't put it into a picture worth looking at twice" -- and a roll of the eyes and on to the next thing on the wall. <br><br>Picasso's another matter. I love his representational work, find some of his semiabstract stuff worth prolonged looking, but am always left with a sense of immense talent gone to waste.

I'll look forward to your comments when we get to discussing <i>Revolt Against the Modern World</i> on the other blog. <br><br>Caryn, fair enough. What happens, though, when you "let yourself go" in front of a piece of abstract expressionism and the only response that comes through amounts to "that looks like a dog ate some paint tubes and threw up"? Because a lot of it gets that reaction from me. The stuff that doesn't, well, then it's usually "Okay, that's a mildly interesting visual effect, too bad the artist didn't put anything else worth looking at onto the canvas." A representational work of art in the great western tradition -- or for that matter in other traditions, such as the Japanese -- has many, many levels and layers of meaning and experience that can be encountered by the viewer; it's not just a mildly interesting visual experience, and those forms of art that limit themselves to the latter, to my mind, reflect a profoundly impoverished sense of what art is and what it can do. <br><br>But of course you're right about the influence of Star-Bellied Sneetch Syndrome, and the other dysfunctions that plague the arts today. <br><br>Patricia, fascinating.

Fascinating! I've never encountered that here. Everyone I've ever known in KY traditionally views everything to the north as foreign and "other" and regards the Ohio River as a border/demarcation point between North &amp; South. Surnames, religious preferences, culture, food all seem to drastically change as you go from one side to the other, w/a small "DMZ" in between, and people on the other side seem to feel just as strongly that KY is foreign and "other" as well. I'm really amazed that people you've talked to feel differently. We must be encountering different people.<br>RE: Maritimes<br>the peninsula connecting NB &amp; NS is very low lying and marshy, and I'd expect would be one of the first casualties of sea level rise. If this is so, then Nova Scotia could be an island w/in 50-100 years, maybe sooner? How will loss of land connection affect NS? Also, I was told that New Brunswick is pretty much divided down the middle between the French North &amp; English South, and is pretty much a linguistic 50/50, which is why it's the only totally bilingual province. My question to those from there/inthe the know, how would this affect their loyalty to Quebec?<br>Personally, I love Nfld. as an example of one of the most intact traditional societies still around in North America. It truly felt like Retrotopia when I was there. I felt like I was going back 40-50 years to the KY of my, or even my parents', youth. The community cohesiveness, social norms, manners, tight-knit/native born. A real gem! (I was in Eastport for (Canadian) Thanksgiving) It made me realize just how much we've lost here in KY.

They quite simply cannot. You state that you get it that Michelangelo was about perspective and was working on a flat surface. At no point, except at the apex of the shallow arch of the ceiling, could the surface be considered flat. This curvature of the ceiling proper and the extreme curvatures of the pendentives of the corners required Michelangelo to experiment and distort the figures all out of natural proportions so that they would appear normal and natural from the "perspective" of a viewer standing on the floor of the chapel. I concur with you that the photographic composite photographs of the ceiling are totally unsatisfying.<br><br>When I was studying Art History in the late 1970s, my professor had some incredible closeup photos of the distortions that were evident in the figures in the pendentives and seeing those was all the evidence I ever needed to affirm the genius of Michelangelo.

I assume it's "betray the confidence and report to the government". Is that correct?</i> I could be very wrong, but my guess is that the government wanted that answer either indignantly rejected or else embraced only with moral agonizing and hedging. My guess is that a quick and easy acceptance of "betray the confidence and report to the government" would knock you out of consideration for diplomatic recruitment. A key skill in the profession is the ability to appreciate and process nuance. Perhaps what was of main interest to the interviewer (but I could, as I say, be very wrong) was not the answer as such but the way the answer was given. <br><br>I should add for the benefit of other readers, outside Canada, that the Canadian "Foreign Ministry" (for a long time called "External Affairs") was until the times of Stephen Harper one of the success stories in the Canadian civil service. "External Affairs", although founded in 1909, was strengthened after the Hitler war under Lester B. Pearson. Mr Pearson got the Nobel Peace Prize for standing up to the United Kingdom over 1956 Suez, in a way that not only taught the UK a necessary lesson but enhanced the peacekeeping power of the UN. "External Affairs", or as it is now known "Global Affairs Canada" (<i>Affaires mondiales Canada</i>), has kept Mr Pearson's Nobel medal in its Ottawa lobby, in a display case. <br><br>Mr Pearson published some memoirs. <br><br>Also interesting as a writer is Nova Scotian diplomat Charles Ritchie (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stewart_Almon_Ritchie rel=nofollow>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stewart_Almon_Ritchie</a>. My Mum and I both found Ritchie's memoirs, which cover among other things his eccentric Halifax family and his prewar education in the UK, priceless. He recalls one of his friends describing Halifax in that era: "like 'the provincial town of Z___', in a Russian novel." <br><br><br>Cheerfully, <br>thinking fondly now of bygone days in Halifax, <br>but in fact writing from just north of Toronto, <br><br><br>Tom <br><br>PS: You might have further queries, or something, for me at some stage. In that case, do feel free to use not only this ADR blog but additionally my e-mail: Toomas(dot)Karmo(at)gmail(dot)com (taking care to make your subject line fairly arresting, say "Tom: Space Seeder asks u whether u have scoop re V.V.Putin Web maskirovka ops". I am not terribly good with e-mail. But if you do not get a reply in a couple of days, query again (taking care, as I say, to make your subject line rather clear). <br><br>PPS: Your political judgement seems accurate: <i>I doubt if anything as minor as the balkanization of the US will stop us bellowing that WE ARE NOT AMERICANS.</i> This theme was already old, old, old when Sir John A. MacDonald and George Brown pondered it in the 1860s. :-)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c8763127513475594671 title="comment permalink">8/6/16, 9:06 AM</a><br><br>

One of the small mercies in Toronto is that the number of cups held out on any one stretch of street is not that large, despite the large total number of homeless: perhaps 5,000 or 10,000 total, and yet only say five cups on all of Bay Street from Union Station up to Queen; one can take care of say two of these without oneself becoming a martyr.<br><br>Many of the indigent will be in unipolar depression, or worse, and the coin plonking into the cup can raise spirits. <br><br>Although some will object that these funds will be spent on beer or marijuana, I say: <i>Well, let them be spent thus. If you are feeling bad, it is normal (even though not respectable or fully right) to drink and smoke.</i> - I knew a priest who had connections in Toronto's poshest district, Rosedale. He told me that in Rosedale, unhappy wealthy women started their drinking day at 11.00 am or so, with some solitary sherry or suchlike. I am not saying this is fully right, only that it is the kind of thing that people do when unhappy, and that it goes on everywhere, Rosedale evidently included. <br><br>(2) Yes, I can see the difficulty in the homeless organizing. (You mention this.) It is hard to trust other people, especially when some of them are not only in unipolar depression but in more serious psychiatric pathologies. Nevertheless, one would dream of a setup in which some homeless form a co-op, and organize themselves into a tent city (we had such a thing in Toronto for some years), and make a few things that they sell for income. <br><br>One possibility is rubber-tyre sandals. Even though myself poor, I would be willing to pay 22 CAD for a pair. <br><br>Another possibility is beeswax candles. The craft-shop chain called Michael's sells rolls of wicking. Here in Toronto, real beeswax can be had clean, for high prices, in organic food stores, **BUT** also can be had from some organization representing the beekeepers, on Bloor Street. Ideally one would get one's wax dirty, and therefore cheap - and not even from the beekeepers' org, but from some beekeeper directly. The right lingo in negotiations is this: "Our co-op would like to make a deal, buying from you dirty CAPPINGS every October, which we will ourselves melt and filter and clean for our candle trade." (The "cappings" are what cover the comb, and what get sliced off in September or so with electrically heated knife in the presently universal, albeit unfortunate, Langstroth beekeeping method.) <br><br>Rubber-tyred road vehicles, and candles made from petroleum waxes (such as are sold at Dollarama), are two of our current social evils. <br><br><br>Hastily, now having to leave blogosphere,<br><br><br>Tom <br><br><a rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a><br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c6002948019094918378 title="comment permalink">8/6/16, 9:36 AM</a><br><br>

What are you trying to get across, how are you trying to get across, why should the viewer/reader/audience care – and why should the audience care one hundred years from now, when the experience may have changed to the point where what you're viewing/reading/watching may be seen as historical instead of as present-day? I think of it with every poem and story that I write (whether I think of it deeply, or just in a "so this is what the work is about" toss-off way, the thought enters into my mind when I write).<br><br>So, what meaning do I see when I look at paintings?<br> • When I look at the Sistine Chapel, I get it – the creation of mankind, complete with the spark of God that separates us from the other animals (amongst other things...)<br> • When I look at Manet's <i>Le déjeuner sur l'herbs,</i> I get it – and while the meaning I ascribe to it changes over the years, there is meaning there (as well as the original meaning intended by the painter).<br> • When I look at Andrew Wyeth's <i>Christina's World,</i> I get it and find myself mesmerized by it whenever I see it (Went to the MOMA once, stood staring at the painting for a half hour. Wasn't the only one who had a deep connection with it.).<br> • When I see a depression era DPW painting in a public building, I get it – reasonably realistic paintings of people in a not-necessarily-realistic setting (and a bit of subversiveness thrown in, if you know what to look for...).<br> • When I look at Stalin-Era Socialist Realist paintings, I get them – the world as it should be, painted for the world to see and understand and for citizens of the USSR to emulate.<br> • When I look at a badly painted icon of the Eucharist, I get it – Here's God so eager to join up with us that he becomes (or joins with the) food so we can eat him and in that way make him part of us.<br> • When I look at Thomas Kinkaid, I get it – he depicts an idealized version of home at home in nature in his wildly successful cottage paintings.<br> • When I look at Abstract Art, I get...nothing. Maybe a "Hmmm, this is nice." if I like the aesthetics.<br><br>Now you're right that there ARE forms of abstract art that are widespread. You bring up various forms of art that are practiced in the Muslim world. However, you ever consider that Islamic abstractions are themselves loaded with meanings that even the most illiterate person understands, and has understood for over a thousand years, in a world where abstract art has had to carry that burden? The Mosque has its shape because that shape has come to communicate the center of religious life; and the text on the buildings (and in books and on paper) stands as an island of beauty in a world where depictions of the real world are forbidden by Godly fiat.<br><br>As for calligraphy – that's abstraction tied down to the work of communicating meaning to people. Done properly, the letters are <b>BOTH</b> things of beauty and carriers of meaning.<br><br>My point being that, if abstraction is to be more than a tool of corporations and the CIA (and just so you know, I think a lot of recent artistic movements in various art forms were promoted by certain corporate and government entities for their meaninglessness) it's going to have to commit itself to the expression of shared meanings. Otherwise it will only be seen by most people as space filler for corporate offices, government offices, and university museums; signifying a Senifeldian nothing.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c1793950586679208570 title="comment permalink">8/6/16, 9:43 AM</a><br><br>

I read that, seems true. Where I work there are art work reproductions hanging everywhere and I noticed some by a British 19th century painter, mostly representing greek muses and such but they all look identical, like male faces. So realism, even by best classical artists sometimes only goes so far. La Gioconda looks female to me even if leonardo da vinci was gay. So individual perception of reality is important in even classical realistic art. So-called modern art is not anything the average Joe like me, thank God, comes into contact with. If my information on michelangelo is incorrect JMG's wife can easily repute it. At any rate art is not true to life but when it is then its influence must be quite strong. I understand French students like Shakespeare for its naturalness, their own (modern?) authors being contrived, self conscious in many cases. German films sometimes unwatchable due to bad texts, bad unfluent camera work, wooden unpracticed actors. I recall a comment by michael caine(made 80 films or so, lives for it ) regarding teaching actors, that you should not notice that two people are practicing their lines, it should look so natural. So when you start rreading period literature or looking at art works from certain eras you have to make an effort to fall into their mindset. Like upper clas 19th century brits thought differently or ancient greeks. What is 'natural' is everywhere and at everytime different although if successful it defines future views of that particular culture.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c2551682964393118547 title="comment permalink">8/6/16, 10:56 AM</a><br><br>

Aren't we the ones who choose to buy all this plastic crap and rack up so many miles in our vehicles? Are these ads available to view somewhere? I'd like to see them.<br><br>onething: I'd actually expected to be an early casualty of the crisis of our time, that the construction industry of which I was a part would slow down drastically and that it would look to cheaper foreign labor for it's needs. That probably would have done it, but something else got there first: When my then-partner's sister and niece who she was living with got deported back to Mexico, I went to live with her in the expensive area where she was, so she could stay close to her clients. Subsequently, our apartment and belongings were destroyed in a sprinkler flood, and my vehicle was written off in a crash. I maxed out my credit and monthly budget to fix these problems. I had to rent in my name an even more expensive place at the last minute--you know, this isn't my favorite topic, so I'm gonna finish in broad outlines. I burned out the clutch in my new-used car, couldn't get to work anymore, my girlfriend cut me loose, and then over the following year I had a short bumpy ride to the bottom. I'd say in essence that I'm here because I trusted the wrong person, didn't know when to stop and look out for number one, and because, like your brother, I'm high-functioning mentally ill. <br><br>I remain here rather than climb back out for two reasons: One is that I'm closeted (to most people) bisexual, and I'm really sick to death of hearing how much the other construction guys hate fa**ots. The other is that I expect a really quick decline of our society and economy, so there's no point in climbing a ladder of success that's sinking into quicksand, which brings me to...<br><br><br>Mr. Greer: Why have you adjusted your thinking as regards the rate of decline?

I've written down that author/title you passed along, and I'll look it up in the catalog before I leave. If you'd like a really gritty and true account of a kind of homelessness that's a lot harder that what I deal with, look for a book by an author called "Cadillac Man". That's the man's street name, but he writes under it as well. I'd pass along the title as well, but I don't remember it and the book got stolen, so I can't check. Thank you for your kind words.<br><br><br><br><br>Allexis: Once, in the original Civilization, I caused so much global warming that all my land turned to swamp and my cities disappeared off the map one by one.

That terminology is not used down here, and neither is the term: "terminal degree".<br><br>Down here the basic under graduate arts degree is a Bachelor of Arts (or BA) for short. Some cheeky people suggest that the term, BA is an acronym for the cheeky slang: B#$ger All. Master of Arts is the post graduate and then there would also be the PhD of Arts - I assume that as I've never actually met anyone with a doctorate in that area, but then they would probably not hang in my social circles. Sometimes those things are given away by Universities as an honorary title for a particularly accomplished - or perhaps if I were being cynical, well financed - individual.<br><br>That is all pretty dull isn't it?<br><br>Anyway, at school I recall reading an Australian book titled: "My Brother Jack" by the author George Johnston. It was published back in 1964 and I distinctly recalled that one of the older characters in the story had achieved a BA from one of the Universities down here and it was explained in very unsubtle terms in the book by the narrator that that had been achieved back in the day when such a title was worth something. I'm pretty sure that that claim was meant to be shocking, and it certainly shocked me given the date of publication and I doubted that things had improved much since then.<br><br>I've always suspected that the University system is now run as a method of outsourcing the costs of training onto the employee rather than the employer. I respect the effort involved in attaining a University qualification - and have done so myself (it is a sacrifice) - but, well, it is used more nowadays as a barrier to entry for professions rather than as a place to train young minds, although again that depends on whose perspective you are considering!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c5950337447320436468 title="comment permalink">8/6/16, 5:38 PM</a><br><br>

It can still be found on YouTube. While his approach has been criticised as reactionary, I think there's at least a few points on this subject that you would agree with.<br>On the subject of a "decline" version of Sid Meier's Civilization, I think the discussion has inadvertently struck on a major issue with the strategy/simulation genre of computer games, as well as a lot of other genres. <br>Titles like Civilization are described as 4X games because of the goals driving the player: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate. The goal is never to adapt to static or dwindling resources (including people), but to continually find and exploit more. I cannot think of a single strategy game that works in any other way.<br>Once a point is reached where the addition of more resources is unnecessary or unwieldy, the game becomes boring and the player begins to feel like an overworked administrator. The developers of the original Civilization realised this, hence the ability to end the game "peacefully" by devoting the amassing resources into the construction of a vehicle for space colonisation. <br>I have done a bit of hobby game development, and I have toyed with the idea of a decline-themed game that would operate on a more personal, neighbourhood scale (something like the scale of the recent Stardew Valley). The player could be tasked with transitioning a typical modern suburb into a more adaptive local economy, as breadwinners are layed off and technological amenities become too expensive. There could be all kinds of appropriate technologies and permaculture principles in play.<br>The challenge would be to provide rewards for the player not based on the accumulation of stuff and the profit motive.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c2014644658773324416 title="comment permalink">8/6/16, 7:21 PM</a><br><br>

I think I'd honestly rather start all over than try to fix that mess.<br><br>JMG,<br><br>Are you aware of a rather amusing bug in the original Civilization? All the AI factions were lead by a historical figure associated with that culture, and India's leader was Mohandas Gandhi. In addition, each faction was given an aggression rating between 1 and 10 that factored into an algorithm that determined how warlike it was. Gandhi, naturally, had a 1, and for the majority of the game would go out of his way to be peaceful.<br><br>The problem is that when a civilization switches to Democracy as its form of government, it reduces the aggression rating by 2. (I can hear your laughter, but that's far from the most unrealistic thing in Civilization.) That lowered Gandhi's to -1... except the field in memory where that value was stored was apparently declared as "unsigned" meaning it didn't accept negative numbers and rolled around the largest possible value: 255.<br><br>The result is that upon achieving democracy, Gandhi immediately sets out to nuke the world. The "nuclear Gandhi" effect became such a popular in-joke in the Civilization crowd that every game since has made Gandhi the most likely to start nuclear war in the late game.<br><br>Interestingly, at least one major programming language invented after Civilization intentionally left out the feature of unsigned integers because of such problems with them!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c3809039071779368073 title="comment permalink">8/6/16, 7:24 PM</a><br><br>

I use to play a lot of Age of Empires with its mixture of military, economy and technology so I can see it now. You would start off with a 21st century civilisation but with declined resources. As the costs of those resources went up, whole branches of your 'technology tree' would become unavailable. You would then have to select earlier technologies, Retrotopia style, to replace capabilities that you have lost.<br> Water, power, sewerage &amp; communications grids would gradually become unworkable while any transport long-distance of resources would also become not viable. You would also be faced with choices of which infrastructure to save with your remaining resources but careful - ignoring water quality means that whole segments of your population either die or need large resources to heal. <br> Selecting resources such as animal-power (sorry people, it has to come back) would make old technology branches available to use. The point of the game would be to stabilise your civilisation to the point that your population would enjoy a reasonable standard of living without falling into total collapse and depopulation.<br> Moral dilemmas could also come into play as you might decide to devote most of your resources to maintain a high standard of living to a small segment of the population at the expense of the rest (at the cost of most of those resources being devoted to security to maintain them in safety). Hmmmm - I'd play that game.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c7160516949178052846 title="comment permalink">8/6/16, 8:43 PM</a><br><br>

Additionally, the intensity of the subject matter--no less than the totality of the biblical history of the Old Testament--would actually not have been something that the average Catholic would have been completely conversant with. Remember, there was not at this time widespread knowledge of the Bible in vernacular languages.<br>Also, she said that the initial impact to her was much more "abstract" than she would have expected. This was long before the restoration of the frescoes, when centuries of grime was removed and the glorious colors were revealed.<br><br>One last thought: I believe all art is fitted within some sort of context, or at least that has been the case throughout all human history. With the 20th century and the advent of Abstract Expressionism, art was completely dissociated from any recognizable context. The viewer was ask to "bring" or make up his own context in experiencing the work of art. I guess for most ordinary mortals--of which I count myself one--that context is sometimes very hard to find.<br><br>Also, we must remember that the Sistine Chapel Ceiling would never have come into existence except for the monomaniacal insistence of one Giuliano della Rovere. So some of the genius that I appreciate in these frescoes has to belong to the Pope, because the artist would never have gone there on his own. It begs the question that centuries into the future will the pairing of any patrons and artists provide the context for art which in our own time is incomprehensible to so many?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c279720416870661475 title="comment permalink">8/6/16, 9:05 PM</a><br><br>

More soon!<br><br>MawKernewek, got it -- but it would be nice to see decline and fall hardwired into a game. <br><br>Fred, well, if it didn't convince you, it didn't -- obviously I disagree! <br><br>Shane, specifically people in northern Kentucky who see their state's natural alignment as being with southern Illinois and southern Ohio. (Indiana's kind of an odd duck compared to all its neighbors.) For what it's worth, I see the lower Ohio valley as being one of the most likely places for a major new nation to arise in the wake of the coming dark ages, say 800 years from now; I imagine it expanding from that heartland north to the Great Lakes and east to the Appalachians, where it can find relatively secure borders, and then contending with one or more nations further south while having to deal with the occasional inroads of the nomadic peoples of the arid plains west of whatever the Mississippi is called then. <br><br>Kevin, no blame; I get the desire to build a coherent future history! It's just not what I did in this case. <br><br>Caryn, of course! The thing is, you can express that primal attraction in representational painting, too. One of the things that I find wryly amusing is the talk about how important and challenging it is, say, to put the blobs of color in an abstract painting in a relationship that feels harmonious and balanced. Of course it is; that's called "composition," and every competent representational painter does it in every painting. It's just that the representational painter also does a lot of other things, so the painting isn't just an exercise in composition. Colors are the same way; representational artists routinely do amazing things with color juxtapositions, too, it's just that they also do more. <br><br>Jon, I wonder if the researchers are taking into account the fact that everybody in today's America knows that the media are riddled with dishonesty and distortion, and when something is presented to them using the kind of rhetoric normally used in the media to convince people of something, they automatically assume that it's a lie. I encounter that reaction quite a bit these days -- it's one of the reasons I don't use standard media tactics to communicate. <br><br>Donald, thank you! As for Peter Carr's destiny, heh heh heh...<br><br>Shane, that would be my guess. <br><br>Lynnet, thank you. Even as a retired archdruid, I don't expect my opinions to be taken as anything but one guy's ideas, your mileage may vary; my aesthetic opinions are highly idiosyncratic, and the opinions of my fictional characters are even more so!<br><br>MickGSpot, interesting. You had a better experience than many, then. <br><br>Space Seeder, I've spent a lot of my spare time reading up on how civilizations decline and fall, and then comparing that to how ours is doing the same thing. That played a large role in the mid-course corrections that led me to see the slope of decline as somewhat less steep than I'd thought back in 2006 and 2007. Mind you, it may be less steep but it's also more fractal, meaning that sudden lurches in any direction are a larger feature than I'd originally thought. Timing decline and fall is like timing a stock market crash -- you can be sure it's going to happen but trying to guess just when is a sucker's game. In your place, I'd base my decision about staying out or jumping back in on local conditions, not on anybody's abstract timeline.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c4996674246667105001 title="comment permalink">8/7/16, 12:05 AM</a><br><br>

I think a lot of inspirational books like that get written in the hope of sparking pride among the Japanese and encouraging them to take the lead in changes that ought to be made for a sustainable future. Shinto, for example, is nature oriented, and has played a limited role in preserving habitats. On the other hand, it is also oriented toward the new, and tends to give its blessing to new enterprises, including those that are ill-advised and environmentally destructive, with the idea being that if we all pray hard enough everything will work out as planned. (I go along with them and pray too, but I also pray that people will regain their ability to perceive and deal with reality.)<br><br>Japan has one advantage in having lots of older people still alive who remember details of an actual sustainable existence and can provide valuable knowledge to those of us coming to them with questions. Not one of these older people that I know of realizes the value of that knowledge, including an ancient priestess I consult with frequently, bringing a noteboook and pen. We "doomers" are a despised minority even in societies that allow more freedom of individual expression than Japan. I avoid bringing the topic up. The few younger people I know personally trying to make the rural-urban-rural "U-turn" work out find it extremely discouraging.<br><br>The government initiative promoting farming by younger, idealistic, but inexperienced people, providing them a livable income, does give me a glimmer of hope in the midst of this. Maybe more people will take it up as time goes on. I think the biggest obstacle right now is the bright and beautiful cyber world and the fact young people can rely on their parents with their pensions for food and shelter. When we visit friends and family, their kids (20s, 30s) never even come out of their rooms to greet guests.<br><br>I suppose Pokemon Go is a slight step forward in that regard.

MA, likewise, is the generic master's degree. Most US universities include a notionally separate College of Fine and Performing Arts to hand out BFAs and MFAs, and having an MFA is what makes you an official artist, i.e., someone who can hang a urinal upside down on the wall of a gallery and have everyone pretend that it's Art. <br><br>Nathan, nothing would be easier. Your goal in playing Decline and Fall is to survive. If you make one too many dumb moves, the looters overwhelm your last defenses and down you go. So it's an endurance game, where you face one challenge after another and try to hold everything together no matter what the game throws at you. If you keep going long enough, you turn into a small-scale equivalent of Byzantium, the one more or less civilized society in a dark age world, with a disproportionate influence on the world around you -- but even then you have to watch out for the next wave of invaders.

Down here, the specialisations tend to get their nomenclature all separately identified. So, like, although business is part of the humanities (or arts), the degree is either Bachelor of Business (BBus with the sub specialty) or Bachelor of Commerce (BCom again with the sub specialty). Plus every man and their dog wants a different nomenclature, so arts down here is really just the traditional arts subjects, although I doubt they teach them the same way as they did in the now distant past. Still, I reckon we are hell bent down here on vocational degrees rather than a more general sort of a degree.<br><br>And you may laugh about this one, but down here, they deftly side stepped that obvious problem with the sciences and added a little "c" to that title, thus it becomes: BSc... Pretty sneaky solution huh? :-)!<br><br>Oh yeah, and Masters courses follow the same gear in that a post graduate business degree becomes the MBA (or otherwise known as Masters of Business Administration).<br><br>I've never met anyone who has completed a fine arts degree, although I used to have a flat mate that was working on one, and I now believe works in aged care (which would be both a surprising and enlightening area in which to work).<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c6421678067121086130 title="comment permalink">8/7/16, 4:13 AM</a><br><br>

A few things. "Northern KY", as commonly understood in KY, refers specifically to the small area of the state that rightfully may be considered suburban Cincinnati. If you have a KY phone book handy, or can google "KY LATA's/calling areas", it would be the part of the state in the Cincinnati calling area, the part of the state on Cincinnati Bell (Cincinnati &amp; area is one of the only cities in the country w/its own local telephone company), roughly anything between the Ohio River north of Williamstown or Walton/Verona.<br>The area of KY across the river from Southern Ill. all the way to the Tenn state line, including Paducah, Owensboro, and Bowling Green, is properly known as Western KY. The (Jackson) Purchase area, where Paducah is, near the Mississippi, is a very odd mix of many state outposts very far from their states' population centers, save Tennessee. Southern Ill. is so far removed from Chicagoland, and even Champaign/Urbana and Bloomington/Normal. Same thing goes for the Missouri bootheel. To a lesser extent, Western KY is likewise removed from KY's urban centers--Paducah is a good six hours away from Lexington. The one big exception to this "state outpost" thing is Tennessee &amp; Nashville, which is why Tennessee and Nashville have such an outsized influence on this area. For residents of any of this area (Bootheel, Southern Ill, Western KY), Nashville is the closest big city (w/St. Louis a distant second), and when they're going to the city for anything, they're going to Nashville. Likewise, Bowling Green was the provisional Confederate Capital of KY. Nashville, while not exactly a border city like Cincinnati or Louisville, is still less than 50 miles from the KY line and w/in an hour of Bowling Green.<br>Louisville is probably the most divided area. It's equidistant from both Indy and Nashville, and both cities probably have as much influence/cross pollination with Louisville, though I'd say Louisville probably has stronger ties to Nashville. I'd ask Bill about this one.<br>So, if I broke it down: Western KY--strong ties to Tenn, historically large slaveholding/large rural black communities, strongest Confederate support. Central KY, split loyalties, Lou leans Northern/Union, Lex. leans Confederate--most divided area, Northern KY, most Northern area of the state, solidly Yankee, Eastern KY, Appalachian culture, historically supported the Union, presently, pro-Southern/Confederate.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c212206122380272693 title="comment permalink">8/7/16, 8:11 AM</a><br><br>

Even though they'll accept that they're not in the Confederacy, they're going to want flexible border crossing, controls, and trade to maintain their ties to Tennessee.<br>Another thing to consider is religious ties. Nashville is "Protestant Rome", and the headquarters of the Southern Baptist Convention and a lot of other evangelical denominations, which dominate KY.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c3070884265389167878 title="comment permalink">8/7/16, 8:22 AM</a><br><br>

I've never been so pleased to be disabused of a false belief! About legalization, I'm a little worried about that. You see, here, the way the de facto legal weed we have is just perfect. The pot breeders and cultivators are at the top of their game and you can get the product in many storefronts. There's no bothersome regulations about max THC percentage, or anything else, because it's technically illegal. This is perfect from my perspective! Any change would be a disimprovement. <br><br>What's a little funny about that is, I was reading a Germaine Greer book in an attempt to complete JMG's "want to throw the book at the wall" assignment (it was worth the read but useless as regards the assignment - I wasn't even mildly irritated) and she made the exact same argument about pot something like a generation ago.<br><br><br>Toomas: Thanks for that insight. I don't get much insight into real world diplomatic circles. Thanks also for the contact info. I'll keep that and get back to you as soon as I know what questions I should be asking. :-)<br><br>Oh, and notes from your next comment: I don't seem to recall seeing many native panhandlers lately. I'll make sure to pay better attention to verify that, but it seems to be they're overwhelmingly white. I see natives at the free dinners and binning, but not so much panhandling.<br><br>(added later) Oh dear. I see that you actually said "indigent", not "indigenous". Oops. Well anyway, there's a little bit of information for you in response to something you didn't actually say. :-)<br> <br>Also, when I said that thing about the unlikeliness of homeless organizing, I'd forgotten all about the totally-for-political-attention I walk by on Hastings Street every day, as well as one from back in 2003, so, the goes to show you how much attention I do pay sometimes. Oops. Captain Obvious is on vacation, substituting for him now is Captain Oblivious.<br><br><br>Mr. Greer: That's good advice. I think for me that means keeping things on the "try to work only when I need something particular" model, with an eye to making such improvements as don't commit me too deeply to the failing economic model.<br><br>BTW, I have to tell you that you make a really entertaining critic. The way you express yourself about culture elements that you don't like, eg. the dog's barf thing, something you said in a book about reality knocking sense into us with a series of well-aged timbers or words to that effect, that thing you said one time about how watching video is as appealing as a bowl full of warm snot. Priceless!<br><br>I think since I find that so entertaining, that I should offer up my own art for tossing and goring. It's only fair. If I give you a link to a song I recorded, will you listen to some portion of it and report back in your creative way about how awful it is? I say this without a hint of bad feeling. I'm not obliged to care what you think about my music, but I'd sure enjoy provoking one of your gems of criticism that I find so funny.<br><br>The song is on youtube, but don't worry, there's no reason to bother about the flickering rectangles.<br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c8485878653319433529 title="comment permalink">8/7/16, 1:29 PM</a><br><br>

Surrealism is also a contender. I have long thought that the Romantics began the breaking of the connection between artist and society. Artists in early Europe seem not to have been apart from society as a whole. They were professionals who created what the patrons, whether Popes, wealthy merchants or a rising middle class wanted. But somehow the idea rose that the artist should be a tortured individual, misunderstood and scorned during their lifetime, unless "discovered" by a critic or gallery owner or private collector of great insight. So any art whether visual, plastic, literary, etc. that is actually liked by many people is scorned by the art establishment and we end up with gimmicky novels that avoid using a particular letter of the alphabet or have no story or no character that one could possibly care about, and paintings that no one really wants to look at, public sculpture that is just an expensive joke, concerts that consist of complete silence, etc. <br><br>I sometimes wonder whether some of the founding Impressionists were actually going blind in their later years. Any art historian on the list willing to comment on this?<br><br>About Beelzebub's skating rink--one might recall that Dante's _Inferno_ is actually frozen at the center--the three headed Satan is trapped in the ice with the three greatest sinners in each mouth: Judas Iscariot, Brutus and Cassius--contemned as traitors to benefactors, the worst sin in Dante's view. The iciness would seem to symbolize distance from God's love. Back when, as a TA, I had to guide students through the text, I had two exercises to draw the students into discussion. In one I would put Dante's scheme on the board and have the class add sinners from more recent eras. In the other I would allow them to rearrange the whole thing, reordering the sins. Usually ended up with child molesting or other child abuse in the center as worst sin.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c3289075455529338743 title="comment permalink">8/7/16, 1:45 PM</a><br><br>

Clemenceau would then get in his car and drive to Giverny to see his old friend and encourage him to continue his work. This story, to me, has always said more about true friendship and human caring than about art.

Did you know that a growing number of counties in the US have stopped repairing their roads and streets, and are letting them go back to gravel, because they can't afford asphalt any more? I'm glad that somebody was willing to pick up the dirigible concept, though -- that's a technology that deserves a second try. <br><br>Nuku, there are indeed criteria for sorting out good art from bad art, and we'll be talking about those extensively next week. <br><br>Cherokee, yeah, BSc shows up here now and again, precisely for the same reason. I've never seen a BBus or a BCom here -- though we do have MBAs. (This is read as "Must Be Avoided" in many circles, because MBAs very often come out of university with their heads stuffed full of economic fantasy and, unchecked, can very easily run a company into the ground.) As for BFAs, my wife has one in art history, and I know half a dozen other people with BFAs in one or another branch of the arts; they may be more common here than down under. <br><br>Mister R., remember that both campaigns are busy pulling out all the stops to get the voters so worked up emotionally that they stop thinking, and can be buffaloed in one or the other direction. Neither candidate is going to nuke the world -- think of what that would do to the value of their investments! -- and neither one is the bugbear the other side's trying to claim they are. Are there good reasons to vote for one above the other, or, say, to vote third party and rattle the cage of the two-party system? You bet -- but don't let it get to you. We're voting to see which of two profoundly flawed and dubiously competent figures gets to stand on the quarterdeck yelling orders for a while as water pours into the lower decks and flames flicker from the hatches. <br><br>Trippticket, fair enough; I'd say contentment is a precondition or a result of those things. Or maybe I'm just being overly literal-minded. <br><br>Shane, that makes sense. The implication, of course, is that it would depend a great deal on the politics of the moment which way the convention chose to go after Partition. I'm quite sure, by the way, that in 2065 there's fairly easy passage from the Lakeland Republic to the Confederacy and back again, and people from Bowling Green can take the train down to Nashville with only a brief stop at the border -- rather like going from the US to Canada. The 2049 war hasn't been forgotten, but as noted in the story, the two countries are no longer jamming each other's radio broadcasts, and the Confederacy will have taken pains to ensure that it didn't have to face a second front in Tennessee when it prepared for war with Texas. <br><br>Cfraenkel, you're forgetting that this is in 2065, when the low orbits have been closed for decades due to an earlier Kessler Syndrome and the geosynchronous orbits are already having a rising rate of collision. The midrange orbits where the 2065 Kessler syndrome is happening have been packed with far more satellites, and far more space junk, than they have in them in 2016 -- thus the problem. <br><br>Space Seeder, by all means post a link! I warn you, however, that I may disappoint you and like it...<br><br>Rita, of course! There are plenty of options -- I happened to pick on the abstract expressionists because so much of what they did does in fact resemble technicolor dog vomit, but equal fun could have been had with quite a few other absurdities -- and, as I also said, there are modern artists who've done things that I appreciate. <br><br>Patricia, funny. <br><br>Cherokee, it did indeed. The first rounds of looters in the decline and fall of Rome wore fancy togas. <br><br>Thomas, yes, I've already got a publisher lined up.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c4982419172519804191 title="comment permalink">8/7/16, 7:32 PM</a><br><br>

It is, apparently, the must see thing in the art world at present, has revitalised inter-state and international tourism to the island and has been credited with revitalising flagging retail spending in our capital city, Hobart. <br><br>It is an eclectic blend of antiquities, old art, and modern art. Its owner is a unique individual, David Walsh, who made his money as part of a very successful professional gambling syndicate. He is a child of the working class, done well. Entry is free to Tasmanians, everyone else gets to pay, and his opening shindig was notable in that not a single politician was invited. The building is quarried out of a sandstone cliff, under a vineyard. on a peninsula jutting into an estuary in the middle of suburbia.<br><br>I have made the trip there once so far, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Most enjoyable was the commentary from Walsh on the various exhibits. You are issued with an Ipod and as you tour the gallery it uses its geolocation ability to id the exhibit you are standing in front of and provide detail about the artist or historical importance, artwank and provenance. Also included are Walsh's own comments, many of which are priceless. I left with the feeling that much of it is a glorious piss take. (an Aussie phrase meaning making fun of something or someone by refusing to take them seriously) There is a background theme of sex and death, but to focus on that misses the incredible range and depth of what constitutes art that is on display in a truly impressive setting.<br><br>A feel for what the museum and the man are like can be got here: https://monablog(dot)net/<br><br>On more serious matters, great episode, cannot wait to see where this goes next.<br><br>The progress as the enemy of prosperity meme has been well and truly adopted by my employers lately, as every cent of expenditure on their dairy farm is being forced to justify its existence.

Britain, France, the Benelux, Sweden, Germany and Austria are all on course to be majority Muslim by the end of the century with the combination of demographics and the migrations to come. Ireland’s future is Britain’s future because there is an open border via northern Ireland which predates the EU and will almost certainly remain open for political reasons. <br><br>Greece and Italy are slowly being cut off from northern Europe as they can’t protect their border coastlines, so the trend is for migrants to find themselves trapped and increasingly frustrated in the south (where, by the way, open borders activists give some of them fence-cutting weapons and the local police are being bribed to provide information to smugglers on gaps in the barriers and surveillance systems. Where police or the growing vigilante groups respond violently to such illegal immigration, the migrants will respond by arming themselves in defence.) <br><br>Central and eastern Europe seem to be on a very different trajectory. Their cultural memories of Ottoman rule and raiding and outsider perspective on western Europe’s terrorism and integration problems mean overwhelming opposition to Islamic immigration or settlement. Although whether they can hold out when confronted with fines and the loss of EU bribes must be an open question. <br><br>What I’m wondering is, to what extent is demographics and geography destiny? Central and eastern Europe are directly in the path of migration and will be sandwiched between a better armed Islamic western Europe and an unpredictable Russia to the east. A Russia which has its own Islamist extremists. <br><br>Could eastern Europe's cultures be effective barriers in themselves? Western Europe has no such cultural barriers and is a lost cause for those of us who’d like to preserve parts of that civilization. It can’t be preserved under the conditions of religious civil warfare that are currently warming up. But maybe the east could act as Byzantium for us this time? <br><br>Mallow <br><br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c9188804512431817184 title="comment permalink">8/8/16, 3:23 AM</a><br><br>

I once had a history professor who gave a mini-speech to the class about how you could tell how "intellectual" somebody was by what kind of art they put in their house. If someone put some kind of abstract modern art in their living room, it meant they were "intelligent" because they didn't mind being around art that was "difficult", "challenging", and "meant something" (all his words, as best I can remember them). But, he continued, people who put nature scenes in their house were much "shallower", because a nature scene just looks pretty without "meaning anything".<br><br>Having heard this sort of drivel day in and day out, I get quite tired of being told I'm "unintelligent" for thinking that squirting paint tubes all over a canvas, or signing one's name on a urinal, doesn't exactly make one an artist.<br><br>And on a more serious note, please go and read the link I just posted.

Jorgenson</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Sorry for the wall of text, but here's a strategy that seems to work well on some people. Of course, pick your battles carefully. We can not change an entire culture in one go, and we will have to fight the culture. This is an uphill battle, and therefore one which will be exhausting. I'm sure there are other tactics, but I think they'd need a full blog post. I'm also not sure I'm qualified to give them, however I have a method that works somewhat well:<br><br>People won't listen to comments that they aren't ready for. In order to get someone to follow you, you need to figure out when and what to bring up. The trick is to wait until someone brings something up themself, and then help provide context. For best results, something that the other person just can not explain. For example, someone brings up negative interest rates and how weird they are. Explain the origins: the economy can't be disconnected from the physical world. Negative interest bonds are evidence something weird is happening to the economy, likely at a physical level. Here's why...<br><br>Continue the discussion, careful to stop when the other person is unwilling to take the line of thought further. Bring it up again in a few days or weeks, depending on the person, and see if you can get them a little farther.<br><br>Keep this going for a while, and eventually you reach a point where quite a few people ask, "Well, what's the point of living then?" They invested so much in the myth of progress that the thought of a world without it fills them with existential despair: fill that void, give them meaning, and you've got a new ally in preparing for the long descent. :)<br><br>This will be the hardest step. It has to be something that gives them meaning, and will probably be something quite idiosyncratic. In any case, unless you know the person well, it may not be possible for you to do. However, if you have meaning for your life, and I'm sure almost everyone here does, then talk to them about it. Maybe it'll be enough, maybe not. In any case, it may get them thinking. At least one person I know has independently found meaning in her life and is now willing to join in my "crazy" quest to prepare for the long descent.<br><br>If someone already sees a hole in the myth of progress (such as a friend of mine who doesn't like cell phones or social media much), this offers a way in, and can be used quite effectively. I'm not sure if it's because it means they already can somewhat see the problems with the rest of it, or if it's because it indicates someone willing to part with conventional wisdom, or both, but it's much easier to convince someone who already sees a flaw.<br><br>Also, a very important point, a partial ally is better than nothing! If you have someone who's willing to take up gardening, great! Teach them and see what you can do together. Or better yet, someone wants to learn to do something you don't know how to do yourself that will be helpful? Join them in learning it! The idea is that each step of the way will provide a little more experience, and the more anyone experiences this new world, and find they like it, the less difficult it will be for them to accept that this is the way the world is. Even if they don't buy into the long descent, maybe they will later. Even if they don't, this skill will be quite useful for them anyway.<br><br>Finally, remember to pick your battles carefully. Some people will not listen yet. Others probably never will. Convincing a person is worth trying, it will also require a lot of time, patience, and thought. This means that you will not be able to convince everyone. Not even close, but even one person is better than none. It is easier the better you know each other, the more both of you value your relationship, but even people you don't know well are often willing to listen as long as it's not too much in one go.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c8967223129459505986 title="comment permalink">8/9/16, 5:50 AM</a><br><br>

While water issues won't be a problem in the US east, sea level rise will be an issue in the Northeast &amp; Southeast.<br>I don't know how this will effect Canada. Certainly, climate change will probably make Alberta and the prairies less inhabitable? The decline of the tar sands industry will lead to large numbers of people leaving? I would say that what will drive population trends in the Maritimes is not current trends based on the recent past, but whether the Maritimes offers a suitable, hospitable climate, and how much sea level rise will affect the land. If it does offer suitable land, then climate refugees will naturally come and inhabit it.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c1819668712045661107 title="comment permalink">8/9/16, 8:00 AM</a><br><br>

Further, what is equally consistent in people who have this need, is that none of them ever seem to have any clear idea of what they actually mean by that word, they just need to be "more" of it than you, and no matter what circumstances they find themselves in, they will manage to come up with some kind of narrative that explaines to themselves and others why they are so "more" of it, and/or stage some kind of ritual theater (that lecture you attended, Steven, can hardly be described in any other fashion) that awkwardly coerces other people to behave in accordance with said narrative and thus affirm to them their innate "more-ness" (I bet half the students went out and bought some ugly junk so they could be intelligent too).<br><br>I have been trying to contemplate just what exactly is it supposed to mean to be "intelligent" (because, honest to the gods, I don't know what it means). At first I assumed that perhaps it had something to do with being proficient at thinking, but then I remebered how angry people who are "intelligent" become when you try to force them to think about something, so that cannot be it.

However a lot of the good farmland here is literally at sea level - most of the really rich Acadian farmland is literally reclaimed tidal zones. Similarly, the Annapolis valley is close to sea level. My point though, is that Alberta and Ontario are not just work camps anymore where single men go to make money and will leave if there are better opportunities elsewhere. The issue is that a Nova Scotian goes to work in Calgary or Fort Mac, meets a girl or guy from somewhere else, has kids with them and then gradually becomes an Albertan.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c8512414845394512933 title="comment permalink">8/9/16, 4:52 PM</a><br><br>

You can rationalize and excusify and "it's different this time"ize all you like, but that does not change the fact that at present Trump is blowing it. Plenty of time for things to change, but so far, not happening. The independents and undecideds are finally breaking, and most are breaking for Clinton AT THE PRESENT. Plus the media narrative is set: Trump is unstable. Just like Al Gore exagerates, Mitt Romney is an out of touch elitist (also used on George H.W. Bush and John Kerry), John McCain is a grouchy old fuddy duddy. These narratives tend to be self-sustaining, regardless of factual basis.

The Maritimes may be populated in the future not just by returnees with roots in the area, but new arrivals with no roots in the area looking for some place to live. By the same token, it may not matter how deep one puts down roots in a place, like, say Alberta, if jobs dry up and blow away and global warming makes it uninhabitable. I know in the US that has been the case. Appalachian folk are some of the most deeply rooted, and it has mystified social scientists why they stay in the teeth of everything, but the constant grinding of poverty and all the other social ills finally wears down even the most established mountain folk. Most of the mountain folk didn't want to leave, but were forced to. Same thing is true about the Midwestern rust belt--a lot of those folk were deeply rooted and established in their communities, but when all the factories closed, were left w/no choice but to pack up and leave. I'd love to know if there some kind of studies of the relative "transience" and "rootedness" of people, and along what pressure point do they finally throw in the towel and decide to leave? Interesting sociology--some people are very transient and willing to seek opportunity wherever they can find it, while, on the other end, some people are so rooted that they'd rather die that pick up and seek opportunity elsewhere. I guess all along the spectrum between the two are pressure points whereby people in distressed/collapsing areas are willing to pack and leave.<br>I think we're going to see a dramatic reversal in the near future in North America of which areas are considered "distressed/collapsing" and which areas are considered "up and coming/growing"--I think that is JMG's premise behind Retrotopia. My guess is that the US will be harder hit that Canada, b/c since the end of WW II, the highest growth areas are ecologically the least habitable in an age of limits. The only high growth areas we have that will remain habitable in decent numbers are the parts of the South unaffected by sea level rise.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c8893017634577496028 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 7:11 AM</a><br><br>

At what point in the election cycle were the forecasts yoiu mention made? How much polling had actually been done?

Those again sound very much like the sorts of context-free cherry-picked statements climate change denialists make about climate science and climate data. <br><br>I pay little attention to any polling results in primaries because the electorate is harder to anticipate and the polling data are skimpy. The general election is a very different beast. And when the "polls are wrong" in these cases it is often that the mood of the electorate actually changed. Even in the primaries there is a lot of suggestive evidence that Sanders outperformed the polls because he got a late spike when he actually began campaigning hard in a state in the final weeks before each primary.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c6166730833606193735 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 7:42 AM</a><br><br>

Your claims are vague and without details. List for me the states where the model predicted a 90% chance close to election time and then Sanders won. I've been scanning through the archived forecast data and so far have only found the forecasts to have been wrong when the forecast probabilities were substantially lower than that. So, exactly which states were you talking about? And why not use endorsements in a multifactor model? They are historically significant, and the endorsement effect in the model is based on this history. They are a big part of why Sanders did so poorly in many southern states where large voting blocks generally followed the democratic machinery's recommendations and Sanders was never even seriously considered by most primary voters.<br><br>And once again I must repeat, I do not like either of these major party candidates, am not advocating for them, and will not be voting for either of them. I'm just trying to look realisticly at the trends.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c9054797815858804213></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/07380265274897536807 rel=nofollow>JoAnna</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I'm sorry to be coming in to this very interesting topic so late in the game, but I'll dive in with a few of my thoughts anyway, and then do my best to catch up. (Apologies for the mistaken double post.) Two points:<br><br>1.) As a professional violinist, I perform quite a bit of "new" music as well as standard war-horses, and I heartily agree with most of your article. The artists in your Emperor story have done a great deal of damage to culture by discouraging people from having their own opinions. By not allowing people to own their own careful appreciation or lack thereof for art, in some ways it destroys art's legitimacy and place in society. If everyone feels that they just don't "get" art, why should they go to a concert or art gallery? When it seems their opinion isn't informed enough to matter, they often chuck ALL of it in to the dustbin, and say they just "don't like classical music" or art galleries, or whatever. VERY frustrating for me, when honestly, there's just a lot of badly performed, badly presented (and particularly in the case of modern music, badly written) classical music out there. (I think with shrinking money and opportunities in the arts, especially here in the U.S., there's also something of a circling of the wagons effect -- we're all trying to band together and not disparage each other, since we know how tough it is out there.) There is a huge variety of styles and time periods to choose from, and just because someone hears a smattering of a Mozart symphony in a crowded train station and doesn't like it, doesn't mean they couldn't have a profound spiritual reaction to a vibrant, outstanding live performance of a Mahler or Brahms Symphony.<br><br>However, there's also the larger educational and contextual problems in our culture, as you've been pointing out in these posts. If people have no experience evaluating ideas, or lack the time and emotional ability to focus in on their own reactions to artwork, would a great performance of Brahms or Bach even make an impression on them? I go back and forth on that quite a bit.<br><br>2.) This then ties in with the issue of the "future" of artistic careers that another person brought up. Maybe the Western classical canon is just playing itself out (sadly) and the art of the next time-period will be something completely different and speak to people in another way. Maybe it will change a bit and thrive. From a descent perspective, my husband and I often talk about folk music and chamber works being the most likely to survive and thrive in the music world. Plus, what makes something great "art" can be so many different things to different people! (The difficulty of your canon definition is that it requires an institution and a specific cultural framework to exist within, of course. My email signature is a quote from a 1967 documentary about Sister Corita Kent, "We have no art. We do everything as well as we can.” I think it's an idea from Balinese culture, but I can't verify that at all.) I also teach violin privately on the side, and my colleagues and I have all discussed the moral dilemma of working with young people who may be considering making music their career. If I had children, I certainly wouldn't encourage them to consider the standard Symphonic or other "normal" performance career route as their future. They have to be aware of how the world is changing, and understand that it might be an even more challenging path than usual.<br><br>I'm still trying to figure out what I'll explore for the 3rd homework assignment. For assignment #2, I fought my way through 'The Reason for God' by Keller and was practically driven nuts by how much special pleading and cherry-picking he rammed through in its second half.... Very good exercise though! :)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-unnoticed-resources.html#c9054797815858804213 title="comment permalink">8/13/16, 9:38 AM</a><br><br>
