<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week’s episode of the Retrotopia narrative ended up launching, rather to my surprise, an extensive discussion about the nature of art. The spark that set off this unexpected blaze was a passing comment on the part of the story’s protagonist, who described the abstract paintings on the walls of the Atlantic Republic embassy in Toledo in somewhat rude language. That was meant as a throwaway line, one more display of the way the protagonist’s views had changed during his visit to my imaginary Lakeland Republic—but it fielded me a minor flurry of denunciation from people who couldn’t stand the fact that a character of mine had expressed a lack of appreciation for one variety of modern art.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who’ve come in for bullying from the art crowd know exactly what sort of thing those tirades included. Those who’ve evaded that experience so far—well, I was told that I had no right to have an opinion on the subject, that I don’t know anything about art, that I obviously prefer Norman Rockwell, that I’m offended by intellectual challenges, that I’m offended by new techniques and media, that I feel threatened by modern art, that I’m in favor of censorship, and that I’d change my mind if I just stood in front of an abstract expressionist canvas and tried to understand my reactions.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s worth noting that none of these claims happens to be true, but let’s set that aside for a moment and take a look at what happened. I had a character in a story express an opinion about art—an opinion, by the way, that was relevant to the story and also to the character—and that was enough to send some of my readers into a fair imitation of a Donald Duck splutterfest. This isn’t the first time, or the hundred and first time, that I’ve watched that same sequence unfold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Across the spectrum of contemporary art, if you display a lack of enthusiasm for anything produced by someone whose claim to the status of “artist” is accepted by the art scene, you can expect to field something of the kind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That can be highly entertaining—I certainly found the latest round of it a source of wry amusement—but it’s also relevant to the subject of the current series of posts on education for the deindustrial era. One of the core things you should expect to get from any education worth the name is the ability to sort out gold from garbage: to recognize, in the fields of learning and creativity, the differences between genuine insight, recycled cliché, and pretentious noise. To get that ability, it’s crucial to recognize that there are two kinds of bad practice in the arts, sciences, and scholarship. </div>
<br>
The first of them can be called, without too much distortion, lowbrow trash. What defines lowbrow trash is that it rehashes the overfamiliar. It deploys stereotyped effects in stereotyped ways to evoke stereotyped sentiment. It tends to be popular among the poor, because people who have to bear the brutal insecurities every complex society inflicts on its more vulnerable members desperately need the reassurance of the familiar, and if black velvet paintings of dogs playing poker are what’s available to meet that need, then that’s what will go on their walls. (There are better options, but these days those generally aren’t available to the poor.) The apotheosis of lowbrow trash is kitsch, which wallows so enthusiastically in rehashed sentiment that it achieves unintentional self-parody. <br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There is also, as it happens, lowbrow trash in scholarship and science. Here you find the histories that regurgitate every currently accepted stereotype about this or that corner of the past, the scientific papers that “prove” some bit of conventional wisdom by excluding contradictory data—this is easy to do if you know your way around experimental design—and so on. These also have their own forms of kitsch, though you often need a little more specialized education to catch the unintentional self-parody.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That said, lowbrow trash is only one side of the picture. There’s another side, and since this entire discussion started with a bit of fiction, I don’t think it’s out of line to ask my readers to gather around old Father Goose for a few minutes and listen to a story called “The Emperor’s New Art.”<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This all happened right after the events of “The Emperor’s New Clothes;” any of my readers who don’t happen to know that tale can find a pleasant online version<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> <a href=http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/68/fairy-tales-and-other-traditional-stories/5637/the-emperors-new-clothes/ >here</a>. </span>The two fraudulent tailors who’d sold the emperor a suit of nonexistent clothes were marched to the nearest border and thrown out of the empire with a warning never to return. They had very little money and knew better to try the same scam on the ruler of the next empire over, since even in those days, news traveled fast. So there they sat on a stone fence, trying to figure out what they were going to do.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<br>
“I know,” said the taller of the two. “The emperor of this land is an art lover. We can become painters.”<br>
<br>
“But neither of us knows the first thing about painting!” the shorter tailor replied. <br>
<br>
“Neither of us knows the first thing about making clothing, either,” the taller one reminded him. “Let’s see if we have enough money between us to buy some art supplies.”<br>
<br>
Now since this is a fairy tale, there was an art supply store waiting just down the road, and the two found they had just enough money between them to buy a canvas, some brushes, a set of paints in flimsy tubes, and a spray bottle of fixative. That didn’t leave them enough money to rent a studio, or even a room for the night, and the day was almost over, so they found a dry place under some trees and went to sleep with their art supplies safe, as they thought, between them. <br>
<br>
Late that night a stray dog came trotting by. He was not too bright, and to him, the tubes of paint looked like puppy treats. He sneaked up between the two tailors and gobbled up the paint tubes in three quick gulps, breaking them open with his teeth in the process. Before he could trot away, though, the first mouthful of paint hit his stomach and made it lurch. The second mouthful made it lurch again, and the third—well, to make a long and somewhat anatomical story short, he proceeded to throw up the paint, along with everything else he’d eaten that evening, right onto the canvas. He then backed away, and ran off to find some tasty grass to settle his stomach. <br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
The two tailors woke at sunrise to find their paint tubes gone and a great deal of technicolor dog barf all over their one canvas. “Oh, no!” cried the shorter tailor. “Our art supplies are spoiled and we have no money to buy more. We’ll never become famous painters now!”<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Nonsense,” said the taller one. “You never did have enough imagination.” He carefully dried the canvas in the sun and sprayed fixative over it. “Here is our first masterpiece.”<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<br>
So they proceeded to the palace of the emperor. On the way they grew beards and let their hair get long, and they stole an assortment of ill-fitting clothing from clotheslines along the way so they could look eccentric and bohemian. So attired, they presented themselves to the imperial art committee and said, “We are great artists, so brilliant, so avant-garde, and so tormented by our talent that our work can only be understood by the truly sophisticated. Ordinary people—well! Ordinary people look at our paintings and say, ‘That looks like dog barf,’ but that simply shows how pedestrian their tastes are, how little they understand the true sublimity of which art is capable. But you, ladies and gentlemen, you are persons of refined taste and deep aesthetic sensitivity. We know that you will appreciate—” He held up the canvas on which the dog had thrown up. “—the first great work of the Borborygmist school of art!”<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course the first thought of every member of the imperial art committee was, “That looks like dog barf.” As soon as that thought entered their minds, though, every one of them thought, “Oh, no! Does that mean that my tastes are pedestrian and I don’t understand the true sublimity of which art is capable?” So none of them said anything at first. Then one, who felt a little more insecure than the others and felt he had to prove that he didn’t have pedestrian tastes, said, “This is indeed a great work of art.” All the others thought, “He must have refined taste and deep aesthetic sensitivity.” So they all began to praise the painting, and the more they looked at it, the more they succeeded in convincing themselves that it couldn’t be what it obviously was, that is, a canvas on which a dog had thrown up.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So the two artists sold the painting to the Emperor for a tidy sum. The Emperor didn’t actually think much of it—his first thought on seeing it was, “That looks like dog barf”—but since all the members of the imperial art committee insisted that it was a great masterpiece and only people with pedestrian tastes thought it looked like dog barf, he kept his mouth shut and tried to convince himself that it really was a masterpiece. One day, though, when the painting had been put on display for the public, and the artists and the members of the art committee and the Emperor himself were standing there beaming, a little child came up, took one look at the painting, and said, “That looks like dog barf.”<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The artists, the committee members, and the Emperor all looked down their noses at the child and said, “Child, you obviously know nothing about art.” So the child went away, and the artists lived happily ever after—and that, my children, is most of what you need to know about the history of modern art.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That is to say, lowbrow trash is not the only kind of trash that needs to be recognized as such by the educated person. There is also highbrow trash. Where lowbrow trash communicates overfamiliar sentiments in overfamiliar ways, highbrow trash avoids communication by saying nothing that can be interpreted outside of a narrow circle of cognoscenti. It’s meant to exclude, so that its purveyors and connoisseurs can feel superior to those who those who don’t get it. As lowbrow trash appeals to the poor, who need the comforts of familiarity in an insecure world, highbrow trash appeals to the affluent, who tend to be sheltered from adversity and so get bored easily, and who also tend to flock to anything that will allow them to parade their supposed superiority to the poor.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<br>
There’s plenty of highbrow trash in the realms of scholarship and the sciences, just as there’s plenty of lowbrow trash there. As with lowbrow trash, too, there’s a far end to the spectrum, a point at which it achieves self-parody and becomes unintentionally funny. There is unfortunately no common word for this latter, no equivalent word to kitsch, so one needs to be coined; the term I have in mind is “warhol.”<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is not to express any lack of respect for Andy Warhol, whose name provides that label. Quite the contrary, I admire the man immensely. He was arguably the twentieth century’s greatest satirist, a comic genius so versatile and so subtle that some of the butts of his humor haven’t yet realized that the joke was on them. This was the man who meticulously copied a supermarket box of Brillo pads and sold that as a work of art. No less a philosopher than Arthur Danto spent a good fraction of his career trying to come up with an aesthetic philosophy and a definition of art that would allow Warhol’s Brillo box to keep its status as an artwork, and never seems to have gotten the joke.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There is, as it happens, precisely one theory of art that justifies the claim that Warhol’s Brillo box is art. It’s the theory that there are certain very, very special people called “artists” who are so tremendously creative, so overwhelmingly sensitive, so dripping with sheer aesthetic oomph, that anything they treat as art is, <i>ipse dixit</i>, art. If an eight-year-old boy hangs a urinal on a nail on the wall for people to see, that’s a prank, but if Marcel Duchamp does it, it’s a great work of art. Why? Because art oozes out of every pore of his body, that’s why, and there's a puddle of it on the urinal to this day. It’s understandable that artists should find this way of defining art congenial to their egos, but it’s just as understandable that Andy Warhol’s wicked sense of humor would zero in on so comically arrogant a claim, and push it past its logical extreme into rank absurdity<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'>. </span></div>
<br>
Let us please get real: a urinal does not become a work of art because an artist sticks it on a wall, nor does a Brillo box become a work of art because Andy Warhol decides to pull the art world’s collective leg. Plenty of other examples could be added—there’s no shortage of highbrow trash these days, and no shortage of warhol, either—and an important part of education is developing a strong enough personal sense of aesthetic and intellectual taste that when a couple of former tailors come along with dog barf on a canvas and insist that this is the first great masterpiece of the Borborygmist school of art, the educated person is confident enough to say, “No, that’s dog barf.”<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
How do you develop that kind of personal sense? There’s a very simple, straightforward way; it’s been standard practice in every literate society for thousands of years, and the current intellectual climate in today’s United States treats it as three steps lower than evil incarnate.<br>
<br>
That is to say, you have a canon. </div>
<br>
A canon is a set of works in any given field that are generally accepted as masterpieces. In a healthy culture, pretty much every educated person has encountered and studied the works that belong to the canon of that culture. The word “canon” literally means “measure,” and that’s what a canon does: it gives you something to measure other works of the same kind. Let’s take literature as an example. There are, in every literature and every branch of literature, certain works that stand head and shoulders above the rest, and an important part of education consists of reading those works, thinking about them, studying them, figuring out what makes them great (and also where they stumble), and developing a personal sense of literary taste by exposure to them. Is the canon the only thing you read? Of course not—what’s the use of a means of measuring if you don’t use it to measure something other than itself?<br>
<br>
A canon, by the way, is always contested, it’s always in flux, and it’s always unfair. Different works rise up into the canon and drift back out of it in response to the vagaries of taste. There have been times when Shakespeare’s plays were cast out from the canon as too vulgar, and novels most people now find insufferably stuffy were considered marvels of literary genius. That’s inevitable, because a canon is always and only a summary of the collective aesthetic and intellectual taste of an age, and inevitably suffers from the blind spots of the age. If there’s some kind of absolute ideal of beauty or sublimity out there, of the sort Plato imagined, it’s not accessible to mere human beings. All we have to work with is our own, hopefully more or less educated reactions to works of art, science, and scholarship. <br>
<br>
So each culture in each age, with rare exceptions, adapts the canon of arts, sciences, and scholarship that it considers important, adding some works and deleting others, on the basis of its own inevitably flawed perceptions, and proceeds to use that as a basis for education. The exceptions are periods like the present, when the schism in society anatomized by Arnold Toynbee in <i>A Study of History</i> shatters the sense of shared values that binds a society together, and you end up with a polarized mess in which the dominant minority and the internal proletariat glare at each other across a wasteland of smoking ruins. At such times, the dominant minority plunges with gusto into highbrow trash, the internal proletariat plunges with equal verve into lowbrow trash, and both sides pretend that those are the only two possible options—that those who don’t like abstract expressionism must therefore love Norman Rockwell, and vice versa.<br>
<br>
That’s not good for art, or for that matter science or scholarship. One of the things that individuals who care about any of these things can contribute to their welfare is to cast aside the dubious enticements of both kinds of trash, try to construct some approximation of a canon in the fields that matter to them, and educate themselves in the time-honored method of repeated exposure to, and reflection on, really first-rate works. It’s from such efforts, once the schism in society completes its trajectory, that a new canon emerges, and the heritage of the past gets handed on to guide the creative minds of the future. <br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A couple of additional notes may be useful here. First, just because you’ve identified something as trash, highbrow or lowbrow, doesn’t mean you have to avoid it. Trash can be fun. I inherit from my misspent youth, for example, an amused delight in really bad fantasy fiction, the kind of thing that Poul Anderson anatomized brilliantly in his essay “On Thud and Blunder,” and there are books I keep on hand when I want to wallow in that sort of thing. For all I know, there are people who have a similar reaction to abstract expressionist paintings, though I admit I’ve never met one.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></span></div>
<br>
Second, just because you know it’s good doesn’t mean you have to like it. I don’t happen to like Italian opera, for example. I know that it contains a good selection of world-class masterpieces, but they’re not to my taste, and so I leave them to those who delight in them. I have a similar reaction to rap music, and to a variety of other art genres. My wife has a BFA in art history, and we routinely visit art museums when we travel, but our tastes differ somewhat—she’s gaga for the Impressionists, who I find pleasant but not the overwhelming experience they are for her; our roles reverse when it comes to the French Symbolists; by mutual consent, we avoid the modern art wing altogether and make a beeline for the Japanese gallery and the medieval and Renaissance European collections. Meanwhile, other people are making their own choices, and so should you. <br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finally, laughter is an appropriate response to art. It’s an even more appropriate response to highbrow or lowbrow trash, and of course it’s all but inescapable when you encounter kitsch or warhol. If the reaction you have when you stand in front of a canvas covered with dog barf is hysterical giggling, by all means giggle. It’s a salutary corrective to the cult of humorlessness that so often obsesses the purveyors and connoisseurs of highbrow trash.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'> </span></div>
<br>
With that in mind, we can proceed to...<br>

Homework Assignment #3<br>
<br>
As previously noted, since this sequence of posts is on education, there’s going to be homework. Your homework for the next month or so is to find three works in one field of art, science, or scholarship. One should be a work of lowbrow trash, one should be a work of highbrow trash, and the third should be a classic. All of them should be in the same genre—for example, you might choose three science fiction novels, or three paintings, or three operas, or three historical essays, or three books on physics. <br>
<br>
The highbrow trash will probably be hardest to find, as this goes into and out of style in various genres, while lowbrow trash is eternal. If you happen to choose science fiction, for example, most of the over-the-top highbrow trash appeared in the New Wave era of the 1970s, when a good many writers decided to prove that SF was High Literature, and got pompous, humorless, and dull in the usual way. Lowbrow trash? Any bookstore or public library will have it by the yard; look for clichés that were already dated when the original Star Trek premiered. Classics? By and large, old Hugo Award winners qualify. <br>
<br>
Put some time into all three works. Notice the difference in your responses to them. Also notice the objective differences in them. Don’t hesitate to laugh where appropriate.<br>
<br>
*********************<br>
Finally, I'm pleased to say that sales of the limited edition of the first of my <i>Weird of Hali</i> novels, <i>Innsmouth</i>, are going well. One implication is that if you want a complete set of the hardback edition, you have a limited amount of time left...and the second and third novels in the series, <i>Kingsport</i> and <i>Chorazin</i>, are already written. Copies can be purchased <a href=http://www.miskatonicbooks.com/THE-WEIRD-OF-HALI-INNSMOUTH-by-John-Michael-Greer-Signed-Limited-Edition-Hardcover.html>here</a>. </div>

Then I had a hilarious exchange with someone at work discussing 20th century opera who nervously said "well, I've got music friends who think he's too poppy because he also writes movie music". I mean, commercially successful movie music does have to be at least SOMEWHAT accessible; no one outside the arthouse is going to sit through a movie that used Schoenberg as the score. Yet merely trying to make something at least basically accessible alone made them ultimately tainted in their eyes (or to put it another way, in what Universe is Philip Glass poppy???). Speaking of Schoenberg, my wife who was a professional opera singer thinks exactly what you just said about 12-tone, that it's just a bunch of people trying to be extra-obscure and unlistenable so they could feel superior.

The least wanted song particular is an amazing creation featuring 22 minutes of an Operatic Soprano rapping country and western lyrics intertwined with atonal and strident political messages.<br><br><a href=#c4212245835586965292 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 3:00 PM</a><br><br>

The toilet thing was not, by most accounts, actually a deliberate attempt to be avant-garde; I thought that it's pretty darn well understood that he was, to use contemporary lingo, "trolling" if not the gallery, then somebody else. (And if it wasn't his "work", then it was probably submitted for a Dadaist friend. Dadaism being art trolling made formal.)<br><br>Another thing that most non-painters don't know is that making a well-composed abstract piece is ridiculously difficult. And no no, I'm not talking about your Pollocks or your Malevichs; to do what Mondrian does with trees or Matisse does with paper takes a not insignificant amount of skill.<br><br>"For all I know, there are people who have a similar reaction to abstract expressionist paintings, though I admit I’ve never met one."<br><br>Most students and faculty who aren't in the fine arts department of art colleges feel similarly. I never actually understood who the elite is that's supposed to like this stuff, because I've never met an art instructor who did, nor have I met another working artist who does. It's a artificially inflated market like many others, but all art suffers from that problem - it's the nature of the gallery scene. People buy the more blandly dense stuff as investments that sit in storage rooms for a few years, not because they actually like it, and I thought that this was reasonably well-understood?<br><br>At any rate, it's always amusing to me when someone says that only the elites appreciate abstract expressionism - I've never met an elite who did.

I offered Bill Watterson, and was told that he doesn't count because he's a "commercial" artist. The line that the artist chose to draw is unforgettable to me. Instead of Watterson being disqualified for not having a sufficiently airy philosophical motive (which would be a snobby kind of judgment, but understandable), she was choosing to exclude artists who consent to mass production of their work -- in other words, the only true modern art is art that only the ultra-rich can own, and 98% of humanity will never even be able to see. This is a sure way to figure out what sort of people are trying to hype up and push highbrow trash for career reasons, rather than simply discovering unknown classics.<br><br>For fun, here's what I would offer for the homework assignment in my home field of religious studies:<br><br>Lowbrow trash: <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> (2003); <i>Zeitgeist Part I</i> (2007) and its source material, Acharya S, <i>The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold</i> (1999). Note that these products are far more interested in appealing to a desirable narrative than providing logical rigor. Their world-upending melodrama makes them more popular with the general public than the highbrow trash.<br><br>Highbrow trash: The works of Bart Ehrman, such as <i>Misquoting Jesus</i> (2005). These are more rigorous books, but consider how they are meant to affect your interpretation of Christianity and your beliefs about the Christians who live around you, and refer again to JMG's definition of "highbrow trash". Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens might be classified as either highbrow or lowbrow trash -- I would lean towards highbrow.<br><br>Classics: Zhuangzi; Plotinus; Nagarjuna; "On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despisers" by Friedrich Schleiermacher (1799); "The Bugbear of Literacy" by Ananda Coomaraswamy (1944); <i>Alone with the Alone</i> by Henry Corbin (1969).

My apologies if some of this feels off-topic. I’m writing this after just reading all of the comments on the last article as well as the current article. Things might get jumbled.<br> <br>I graduated from an MFA program a while back. Thinking back on it, I was naïve in a lot of ways. After writing on my own for several years, it seemed logical to get involved in a more intense program that would push me beyond my limits. Thing is, MFA programs don’t really push people that much. There were some exceptions, but it seemed like many of the students thought of the degree as a badge-holding position among the Art Police. This put me at odds with some of my schoolmates, many of whom seemed more interested in being told what was art rather than learning how to identify art. It’s an important distinction. <br><br>I’m a traditional storyteller. I value deep characters, humor, settings, things most book-nerds probably appreciate. That didn’t sit well with some of my colleagues. If I wasn’t at the edges of the notional space, I was relying too much on “the trappings of genre,” (their words, not mine). Storytelling didn’t appear to matter much; in fact, if a person accidentally had a moment of pleasure while reading one of my stories, people seemed to view it as a strike against me. It got a little disheartening after a while. <br><br>That’s saying something. I’ve always been my own harshest critic, yet I’ve managed to survive my own slings and arrows and keep at this for years and years, (happily, even! I come to the blank page with a smile on my face, every day!) yet these people were getting me down. Fortunately, toward the end of the program it started to sink in that I was witnessing exactly the phenomenon you describe in this article: a pack of self-proclaimed creative elites protecting the ring that they’d peed in the snow.<br><br>I’m graduated now, back on my own outside the pee circle. Life is good out here. I’m reading whatever I want again, still hacking away at the writing, and getting ever closer to having my first good novel (I think) after three prior attempts. <br>This is all not to say that the criticisms given to me weren’t correct or valid. Many were. Many were valuable and helpful, too. I’m not perfect. I may not even be good. But when the criticism is more about what you’re doing rather than how you’re doing it, some skepticism might be a good thing. Especially when it’s clear that the criticizer is framing the issue in terms of the art they approve of versus the art they don’t.<br> <br>Thanks for writing this. A lot of us scribblers-in-obscurity read your blog and I hope we all take what you’ve said to heart. I know I did. <br><br>Great assignment, by the way! <br><br><br><a href=#c8400224391220138073 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 3:36 PM</a><br><br>

In one episode, they had an art competition, with a somewhat-regular artist painting some abstract modern art piece, an artist whose pet monkey threw small paint-filled balloons at the canvas, and the Joker, who never actually touched brush to canvas. Even back then, I noticed there was nothing produced I would call art, even though the Joker's blank canvas won (because they didn't want him to loose his vandals and minions on Gotham City).<br><br>The live action Batman series was campy to the extreme, likely fits your definition of kitsch to the tee, and even included "POW!" and "BAM!" in between the punches during fit scenes.

"Highbrow trash" (seen in avant-garde painting, music, sculpture, dance, performance art, the animated shorts in many modern animation festivals) focuses on new unusual techniques, and again doesn't care much about MEANING, being content to "experiment" without bothering to say anything. <br><br>In a "lowbrow" blockbuster movie the viewer is meant to be wowed by the special effects and explosions. In a "highbrow" avant-garde film the viewer is meant to be wowed by the unusual cinematic language. In both cases, form takes precedence over meaning.<br><br>Personally, I sometimes like watching both, and experience them in about the same way - is it really so different to be wowed by a good explosion and action sequence vs. unusual camera techniques and lighting? Sometimes it can be pretty hard to tell whether a "formalist" artwork is highbrow or lowbrow, anyway (example: Richard Williams' unfinished animated feature "The Thief and the Cobbler". A great example of both the appeal and the danger of formalism - he was so focused on making beautiful animation that he let story and characters fall to pieces).<br><br>I think that also explains why the Western "highbrow" art movement has been so interested in appropriating commercial "kitsch" into their art in the past century. Both are formalist. There's a natural affinity.<br><br>Non-formalist art, by contrast, COMMUNICATES MEANING (not necessarily in words, of course!). It can use either "lowbrow" or "highbrow" artistic language, but it uses them appropriately, to communicate something more than just the technique itself.<br><br>By the way, Andy Warhol's equivalent in music is John Cage (and my professors in the music department were equally gaga over him as I imagine art professors are over Andy Warhol). He was just as much of a practical joker, as one can clearly see watching his televised performance of "Water Walk": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSulycqZH-U<br><br><a href=#c4713620266419083862 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 3:45 PM</a><br><br>

The modern wing made quite an impression on me. <br><br>One display looked like large cardboard shipping cartons scattered on the floor. My uncle and I touched one, until warned by the guard. They were made of metal. Warhol?<br><br>Another consisted of urethane foam impaled on lengths of rebar, looking like day-glow bugs. I will call it "dog barf on sticks." The artist was there. A viewer asked, "What's it supposed to be?" He answered, "It's not supposed to be anything." Ah, clarity. Highbrow trash?<br><br>Two pieces I liked. One was a tall prism, about ten feet tall, situated in a semicircular bay window so sunlight made rainbows across the floor. Another was a small gable roofed shed, clad inside and out with mirrors. Viewers were invited to take off their shoes and walk inside along a short, s-shaped passage, and view the ever changing reflections inside. I would call them both playful, even though art critics have overused that word for years.<br><br><a href=#c7757410699018865748 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 3:47 PM</a><br><br>

And the political maneuvering to obtain membership in the Academy will be vicious.<br><br>Harold Bloom of Yale University is one of the keepers of the canon of English Literature. He gets to say what's great and what's not, and you don't. One of his pronouncements concerned Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

My father was a Professor of The Humanities, and he and I had extended arguments about "what is art?", which we never resolved. I finally concluded that it cannot be resolved, but that there is a related response, namely that the Mission of the Artist is to produce work that causes his or her audience to say "this is great stuff, I want more", using any means possible.

I'd considered trying "The Secret", or an Andrea Dworkin book, but I'm forewarned about those, and would only regard them as silly. I'm forced to plead that the book I read some 25 years ago, "The World in 2050", counts as my reading, since it's the only book that ever made me want to, and actually, physically destroy it. As a reminder, it was just a laundry list of flying cars and other vaporware that we were going to have in 2050. One of the Star Trek shows gave me a reduced version of the same feeling when one of the characters announced that they don't use money anymore and that everyone was free from want, without even drawing a theoretical line from here to trektopia.<br><br>As to what point of view I think the author was writing from: I think both he and I had the same problem. We both wanted to believe in the whole caves-to-stars thing, but all we had as a way to convince ourselves that the dream was true was to repeat to ourselves insistently, "IT IS! IT IS! IT IS!" He tried to firm that up by writing and publishing his vaporware list.

And being a religion it requires an Elect, and also a whole host of Infidel Unbelievers upon which scorn can be heaped, and secret smugness, because they are destined for the fires of Hell anyway.. maybe my attitude to religion is a trifle cynical here, but bear with me, I am not talking about faith or belief, but religion as an institution. So, to extend the metaphor, the most important aspect of religion is that the Elect are right, otherwise the whole edifice crumbles. Even if the Elect begins to suspect they have been taken in, they cannot falter for a moment, because then they will turn out to have been wrong, and everything they have lived for becomes null and void. Once you have power and money and career invested in a certain trajectory, well, belief must be sustained, or a whole industry turns to dust. Thus we get giant yellow teddy bears being brained by desk lamps as public art.<br><br>Which is where I find the ending of your Emperor's New Art fable so perfect - of course nobody can possibly admit that they have been taken in. They have so much invested in being right.<br><br><br><a href=#c1840611461612516201 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 4:33 PM</a><br><br>

I agree. <br><br>For me this behavior by the art community gives a couple of "tells".<br><br>Firstly, this is another attempt by humans to form a pyramidal social hierarchy, in the same way that bees form hives. The further up the hierarchy you go, the more status and power and wealth. Much effort is expended by individuals to improve their place in the social hierarchy (a nil sum game), either by putting themselves up or others down, in the same way that horses will kick and bite each other for hours in preference to enjoying the lush grass all around them. <br><br>The same attempts to form and manipulate the pyramidal social hierarchy can be seen in consumerism, politics, religion (but I repeat myself), science, etc. I get some wry amusement to see the same political pyramidal social hierarchy called by different names - capitalism, communism, socialism, monarchy, etc - which are essentially the same human biological community wherein a pampered elite sits on top of a struggling proletariat, the distance between them growing until the hive ruptures. <br><br>Secondly, in the humanities including the arts, it's very much about vanity. The emphasis is always on doing something new and different - hopefully to much personal acclaim and the benefits that consequently flow from the social hierarchy - as distinct from doing something intrinsically worthwhile. We would generally scorn writing more baroque music, or more sonnets in the style of Shakespeare - to do so would not allow us to advertise our own genius. In this way, art has left beauty mostly behind. <br><br>In contrast, a baker bakes bread. He didn't discover bread, he's not trying to put a new "twist" on the bread - the bread is just intrinsically worthwhile. When you need to make a sandwich, you reach for this old kind of bread. <br><br>Seeing the art community behave as it does tells me a lot about where real value lies.<br><br><a href=#c5372028843872964826 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 5:05 PM</a><br><br>

Because we are intelligent and sophisticated and we say it is art. Why are we intelligent and sophisticated? Because we like this art!<br><br>The racket is just another form of gatekeeping. Modern art is very expensive- only the affluent can purchase it and 'enjoy' it. It is bewildering and ugly and stupid because it completely lacks meaning- why else do artist have to have manifestos? If your painting comes with an interpretive manual, something has gone wrong. I am sure that many artists completely believe the complex philosophical circumlocutions that they spout about how the urinal they nailed to wall represents something, but surely this is a great market for a couple of barnums? A little basic aptitude with a brush and a gift for fabricating fancy-sounding malarkey could net someone a tidy profit.

The special exhibit - art from the US during the Depression years - was particularly packed with interested patrons of all sorts.<br><br>We visited the modern wing briefly, and there we saw something unique. Amid a very thin crowd of mostly teenage art-selfie browsers, there was a tight cluster of well-to-do people following around a very pretentious man in a tailored pinstripe suit that was made to look old-fashioned.

The highbrow tribe in the modern wing follows the art hipster who tells them how to criticize people who look at dog vomit and call it dog vomit - after all, it's what separates "us" from "them." Meanwhile, the bourgeois mill around the rest of the museum looking at the art that's at least recognizable at a glance, satisfied to be seen in such a cultural setting.

The criticism you fielded put me in mind of the tempest-in-a-teapot that was stirred up a number of years ago when an artist named David Hockney suggested that a number of Renaissance painters, among them Vermeer, used optical devices to achieve some of the photo-realistic lighting in their paintings. His idea was vigorously contested by art critics, apparently aghast at the suggestion that their beloved painters might actually have used mechanical devices rather than sheer raw talent to produce their works. It didn’t seem to matter that it was an artist who advanced the theory. Apparently stepping over the line from creating to critiquing is verboten in the rarified world of the art critic and clearly the criticism voiced by a fictional character you created is a no-no as well.

I had no idea one of the perks of being a poor Ruinman was being mistaken for a trendy urbanite" I have not laughed that hard in a while. A couple months ago I went to the LL Bean store to buy a pair of their signature boots as they are quite durable made right here in Maine and backed with a great warranty. I am actually going to use these boots for their intention. Many sizes however were unavailable due to a recent trend in hipster circles to wear work boots to cool industrial looking coffee houses that apparently resemble my shed. My wife and children are slightly embarrassed in my attire of tattered cammo pants and what ever tattered shirt happens to be at the top of my dresser if I wear them out. I can now tell them I am trendy. Wonder if the hipsters will eventually get around to putting some faux dirt under their fingernails alongside the attire? In other related stories I had on hand a bunch of reclaimed wood from old barn torn down near me. I have recouped it's cost three times over with various pieces of rough yet sturdy furniture either for our home or for sale to others. While recently while going through the craigslist I came across an ad for someone who was interested in purchasing a couple pieces of "reclaimed" wood to decorate their wedding tables. My initial thought of hey I will just get a hold of them and let them have the 15 board ft of wood for their little project. Though I got to thinking let me look up the price for reclaimed lumber. 5 dollars a board ft. Right or wrong I decided I would make a quick 75 bucks off 3 5 ft pieces of 1x6. Obscene what people will pay for a certain look. How many well built usable hand tools and cast iron pans of the last century perfectly capably of doing great work sit merely on display in someones personal museum.

The film showed which pieces were included and gave the Nazi propaganda sound bites about what was wrong with each piece of degenerate art. It isn't bad enough that they killed people--they hated true art as well!-- seemed to be the lesson of the film. The unsettling part, as you might guess, was that I hated some of the same stuff. OMG I hate the same art Nazis hated, what terrible things does this say about me? If I recall correctly the film went on to show the type of art the Nazis encouraged: buxom blond girls walking chubby blond babies while sturdy young men did manly things, so sickly sweet that Thomas Kinkade looks noir by comparison. Also, ironically, with a remarkable resemblance to Soviet Realism. <br><br>By some round about thought process this leads me to the market in fake collectables--i.e. the limited edition plates, figurines, specially bound editions of classics, spoons for each state, medallions of each president (in a handsome cabinet), etc. which is the very exploitive process of marketing low brow art as though it were going to increase in value like high brow art does. Usually marketed in women's magazines--at least those are the ones I see, there may be some equivalent marketed in hunting magazines, sports magazines or other more typically male markets.

The original was so funny because most of the humor was understated and deadpan, and it wasn't really trying to push any kind of message, aside from poking a little fun at the EPA. I'd be shocked if the original had a science consultant: my bit of Googling has turned up nothing, and I understood the nods to real science when I was in elementary school. Contrast this to the new Ghostbusters. For highbrow warhol, we have the reversal of gender roles so beloved of the chattering classes. We also have the very desirable portrayal of women in STEM. What takes the cake for highbrow kitsch, however, is the portrayal of science: there was a major story on NPR about how the filmmakers' science consultant (a professor of physics) went to great lengths to ground the equations seen on chalkboards and the ghostbusting equipment in the facts of cutting edge particle physics. This kind of of obsessive attention to scientific detail is appropriate for drama (witness Christopher Nolan's Interstellar), but it's a bit much for comedy, and it also seems to be trying to ride the coattails of Big Bang Theory. The lowbrow kitsch is obvious enough: overwrought CGI in contrast to the largely practical effects of the original, crude race humor, and nonstop sexual innuendo.<br><br>Perhaps the merging of warhol and kitsch into one work is a reflection of our current obsession with putting on egalitarian airs.<br><br><a href=#c1465698334258911217 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 7:25 PM</a><br><br>

My own definition has changed over the course of my life. When I was young, I would not have considered any modern abstract painting or sculpture to be art. I would have reserved that title for some of the classics you enumerated. However, over time, I have come to really enjoy some modern art but only when I have learned something about its creator so that I can grasp the concept or idea that they are trying to express. My definition of art is now much more loose. For me, almost anything can be considered art because I have come to understand art as a personal act of expression. My art may not be considered art by others for art is in the eye of the beholder. I make a strong distinction between the words "art" and "craft". An artist may not have mastered the craft of painting very well. However, if they can express something in a way that moves me-even with crude brush strokes, then I will call it art. I think art is exactly the opposite of snobbish-it is something almost anyone can create. Not everyone is a master craftsman. The classic greats were both artists and craftsman. One probably needs both art and craft to become a classic. I'm not sure what role the art markets play but it seems that they may impact how certain works are looked at by the general public.<br><br><a href=#c6008019584915174049 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 7:51 PM</a><br><br>

Apparently, according to a quote on the architects <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Rijavec rel=nofollow>Wikipedia page</a> the "project won (planning) approval at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). This was largely as a result of Rijavec establishing the project’s contextual relevance in an unprecedented appraisal of Fitzroy’s urban character that reinterpreted it as Urban Jazz."<br><br>I must be a fool because I don't even understand what that last sentence means. ;-)!<br><br>Oh yeah, we've had our share of artists laughing at the public, usually at the public’s purse and expense. There was one memorable sculpture which used to be located in the middle of a round-about and honestly both my wife and I could not shake the feeling that the sculptor had fashioned two mirror imaged: <a href=https://melbourneartcritic.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/plsmall1-visit-footscray.jpg rel=nofollow>oversized concrete foetuses</a>.

He is concerned with not just the decline of the "high art" classes, but mostly the more rank and file "creators." Graphic designers, indi-rock musicians, architects, booksellers and record store clerks. <br><br>Your commenter AA mentioned it, but Timberg also explores a maybe, no longer extant class that he calls "middlebrow." He states: "Much of what John Cage and Jean Luc Godard and Robert Venturi and Andy Warhol produced was powerful and thrilling. But the net effect of this revolution was to destroy the middlebrow consensus - the sense that there was a shared body of artistic and intellectual touchstones that educated middle-class people should no about, that "serious" fare was somehow good for you, and that these works were to be passed down through education, journalistic coverage, and family rituals. It was the spirit that put John Cheever or George Balanchine on the cover of Time magazine, that had Leonard Bernstein on television, that made Rachel Carson famous, that provoked Playboy to commission profiles of Duke Ellington or Lester Young. And, like the liberal consensus it largely overlapped with, the middlebrow consensus was attacked from both sides. It became collateral damage of the New Right's anger and the left's postmodern push, respectively." <br><br>There are just so many interesting and thoughtful ideas in this book. On the current state of teaching literature. "What happens when a significant proportion of those who guide students' relationship to books see them merely as "texts" to be interrogated, and tell you that anyone who loves, say, Rainer Maria Rilke or Virginia Woolf for their aesthetic qualities is a dinosaur? "If anything, literary enthusiasm can be a detriment if your job is to prosecute books for their ideological crimes," Laura Miller wrote of the shifting of critical priorities. "When even English professors won't stand up for literature, is it any wonder it's failing?" Lew<br><br><a href=#c184836325195675969 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 9:17 PM</a><br><br>

Back in my school days the literature was usually my worst subject because the way I was typically on a pretty different wavelength regarding how I thought about what I was reading than the teachers. I have gained more appreciation for some of the subtleties that eluded me in those days, but still I often wonder why some classics are so popular, some classice I really enjoy and some I just don't get.<br><br>Would you say that the main factor in what gets counted toward this canon in the skill needed to produce it? I remember an experience I had when I went to a modern art gallery when I was 18 or so. I thought some of the works were interesting, most of them just didn't do anything for me, but the whole thing seemed strange to me in a way that took me a while to realize. Later, I realized that it was because the majority of the works in the gallery were ones that I, someone of very modest artistic talent and experience, could reproduce pretty easily given the materials. It's juat strange to have a whole gallery full of mostly things that don't take much talent to make.<br><br>Another question, I'm interested in your thoughts on Kurt Vonnegut, where he falls on the spectrum you've laid out? There was a time in my life when I has a bunch of people recommending him to me, so Iread "Slaughterhouse Five" the book that I had heard the most. TO me it was practically unreadable, I forced myself to finish it thinking there must be something good in there that made it so popular, but to me the world and the characters he created were completely lacking in anything interesting. I told that to a couple of people who gave me just the attitude you describe with regard to modern art. A year or so later, I was convinced to read another Vonnegut book, this time "The Sirens of Titan", with a friend insisting that I'd like that one. Well, I didn't think it was quite as bad as "Slaughterhouse Five", at least this one had a real plot, but it still was pretty dull to me and to this day I don't understand what people see in his writing that got him so popular. By contrast, I have enjoyed a few Heinlein and Clarke novels even though I don't share their worldview. They make a story compelling enough that gives me some understanding of those who do think that way, but I can't say that at all about Vonnegut. I'm left wondering if there's a genius at work that I'm unable to comprehend or if it could be considered highbrow trash.<br><br><a href=#c6308310088996638199 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 9:26 PM</a><br><br>

I may fall into the cognoscenti’ class you describe. However, my particular art school's painting education was technically rigorous, steeped in classicism and went to great lengths encouraging us to learn from all of the masters who preceded us – although they would have been loath to admit it, they informally implied a canon. I am a lifelong painter and love painting all along its continuum. I have always viewed modern and contemporary art in a non-binary way, within the vastly larger history, and none of it seems that illogical or scheming within that context. More likely, it is a good example of diminishing returns as painting approaches its “notional” limits. Much of the appeal of reading your blogs for the several years is how your discussions of magic resonate with how I believe good art comes into being. Artists practice their own kind of conjuring and are always striving to change the viewer’s consciousness.<br><br>In your post last week, you stated how your preferred paintings were able to enthrall you for a good long time. I was curious, if you looked for or were aware of those artists using sacred geometry implicitly or explicitly. The use of sacred geometry to manipulate the viewer’s experience was commonly known and taught in earlier times. Now, not so much<br><br>Lastly, I encourage those interested to check out Art Prize, http://www.artprize.org/ which started in 2009 as a huge open art show in Grand Rapids, MI, whereby the public voted for their favorite piece of art and the winner received $250,000. The following year, the elites couldn’t handle it and had to set up their own parallel juror system. It is fun to compare the winners of the public vote to the winners selected by the elite jury. Interestingly, Ran Ortner, the first year’s winning artist is also now represented by a very “elite” New York contemporary art gallery.<br><br><a href=#c2952605837290683605 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 9:31 PM</a><br><br>

I have skated along the edges of the antiques and collectibles racket for a number of years. During the past couple of years I've read several books dissecting various collector crazes. Collector plates, Beanie Babies, sports cards, Kinkade paintings, etc. etc. ad nauseam. :-). They're pretty much all classic bubbles. <br><br>Then there was the phenomenon of picking a collector niche, stock pilling loads of the stuff, publishing a book on the particular niche with an inflated price guide. Let the market simmer gently for a few months (and, maybe do an article or two in the collectible press) and then dump you stuff on the market, hopefully making a killing. <br><br>What has happened is that the internet has made a lot of the antiques and collectibles racket, more .... transparent. It turns out that things that were thought to be rare or scarce ... are not. A great example is the board game, Monopoly. The man who originally invented it was a Philadelphia Quaker. The first versions of the game were not actually "board", but a rollable canvas playing surface. When E-Bay was first getting off the ground, one of these early Monopoly games surfaced ... and, sold for an astronomical amount of money. There was media attention. Two more of the games surfaced. The price declined. More early copies of the game appeared and the price again fell. You're also dealing with a small market ... people who are interested in early board games. <br><br>Hope this partially answers your curiosity about collectibles.

Its cover art features an image of a US $100 bill, with the subtitle In God We Trusted.<br><br>This is the first mainstream novel by a well-regarded mainstream author that I have read which has as its subject a believable and imminent decline in the American way of life. And it is not pretty. If anyone has been wondering what life is like back in the Atlantic Republic, this might be your window in. By 2029 the US is already experiencing some climate and resource-overuse difficulties. New York is perpetually chilly due to the collapse of the Gulfstream, and suffers frequent 'dry-outs' when the taps stop running, as the aquifers deplete. The gulf between the haves and have nots has widened. This story follows the family fortunes of several branches of the Mandible clan. Some are just getting by, others are very well-off – one sibling has left to live a prepper lifestyle on an up-state farm.<br><br>Then, the US government makes some very stupid political decisions which leaves it stranded outside the world trade economy. Overnight the banking system collapses, as does the stock exchange. The vast majority of the wealthy US elite lose all their assets which aren't actually nailed down. The US treasury then confiscates all the gold in the country, which strips the wealthy even further. The whole fabric of society begins to fray until the US begins to resemble a third-world country. As we follow the fortunes of the Mandible clan it becomes clear that there are winners and losers in a collapsing economy, and that 'economist in academia' is not a bullet-proof choice of profession.<br><br>About halfway through this book I sank into a profound depression. I think I am fairly clear-eyed about the future, thanks to years of reading ADR, but to see a middleclass family falling apart like this really hits home. Because hey, that could be my family.. mind you, there are some moments where I just want to smack some of these characters up the side of the head for the stupid choices they have made, but then that's the point of the novel. Most of us are just not prepared to live any life outside our middle-class cocoon. To be honest, the life lived by the Mandibles is being lived in many countries and by many families right now. But again, not my family. That is what makes this novel so eerie.<br><br>(cont..)<br><br><a href=#c84411711244396124 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 10:02 PM</a><br><br>

But to readers of Retrotopia, the novel goes in a very interesting direction... actually, it goes in a very disturbing direction first. But hang in there..<br><br>I won't say that there aren't things that grate a little in the novel – Shriver said in an author interview that she had studied up on economics before writing the novel – it shows. Characters are endlessly discussing economic theory, which gets a bit old. And somehow, throughout the entire span of the novel, the internet continues to be available even to quite cash-strapped characters. The novel ends in a way I don't find entirely satisfying.. but overall, I found it a fascinating read, mostly because it explores such a taboo topic. The failure of the Great American Dream. Or, for the rest of us, the failure of the Great Privileged Middle-Class Project (fellow Australians, don't think we are let off the hook. In 2047 we are invaded by Indonesia. To see how that pans out, read the excellent young-adult series Tomorrow When the War Began by John Marsden).<br><br>However, for anyone I know who is interested in where I think the future could be heading, I could do worse than hand them a copy of The Mandibles, then just as they start to slide into deep depression, slip them a copy of Retrotopia:) <br><br>One of the big takeaways though, is the idea which JMG continually hammers away at: collapse now. Anyone who had done that in the future discussed in The Mandibles would have had much better outcomes. Not necessarily in the sense that less bad things would happen to them, but in the sense that anyone who can cook with lentils and beans and grow a potato and knows the trick to living a dignified life with very little water, power or stuff is going to get on so much better no matter what situation they find themselves in.<br><br><br><a href=#c124809796063170526 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 10:09 PM</a><br><br>

A quibble: although I agree with what you've written, I don't think every modern artist purposefully goes out of their way to fool audiences, as you suggest in your parable. There are many who genuinely thought they were headed into new territory that would appeal to audiences, but who went overboard and got lost in their abstract systems. An example is Schoenberg, who thought that people would whistle 12 tone tunes in the street, but of course this hasn't happened. From what I know, I'm pretty sure he was motivated by a genuine love of music, but felt he couldn't otherwise contribute anything new because the best ideas were already done. This connects to the notional space idea you introduced earlier. Anyway, it's a minor point which doesn't contradict your conclusion.<br><br>I compose music in my free time, and I've been studying the canon of the classical music to find a way to make music that is artistically sound (which doesn't fall into either the high brow trash or low brow trash categories) and which communicates to people regardless of whether they have an education in the arts or not. As in politics, in the arts there is a sharp divide between the elites and the rest of the population, and I think it's a pretty urgent task for artists to try to bridge that gap and find a middle way. That's why I've been studying the canon. <br><br>By the way, I went to art school, and a lot of what you wrote and what your readers have commented rings very true to me based on personal experience. I'm following along with great interest!<br><br>@Esn: that definition from Taruskin for formalism seems bang on to me!

If you'll read a little further in the post you'll find that I addressed that specifically at multiple-paragraph length. <br><br>Whomever, on the few occasions I feel a pull to listen to Philip Glass, I listen to PDQ Bach's "Einstein on the Fritz" instead and get the same experience, plus giggles. The whole notion that art has to be ugly and unpleasant in order to be serious is blasphemy against the Muses, who respond by condemning the blasphemer to listen to the same piece of Schoenberg's "music" for all eternity. <br><br>Patricia, I think that overstates it a bit. Opera was the Hollywood of its day, and like Hollywood, it produced some genuine art, some lowbrow trash, and some glorious kitsch in its time. It's a pity nobody performs Meyerbeer operas any more -- they're practically on the poker playing dogs level of kitsch, and hilarious. <br><br>Zerowastemillennial, of course it's challenging to put blobs of paint in a harmonious pattern. It's even more challenging to put representational images in one, but representational painters who are any good do it all the time; it's called "composition." I sometimes think the point of modern art is to cut back sharply on the number of difficulties artists have to contend with. As for the urinal, all I know is that when I was in college, taking art history classes, it was presented as a very serious work of art. <br><br>Unknown Eagle, remember my comments last week about how every upgrade is worse than what it replaces? I rest my case. ;-)<br><br>WB, I've had people accuse me of supporting censorship because I didn't agree that everybody with an MFA ought to be publicly supported, so they can create whatever art they happen to want to create! <br><br>Avery, I don't consider Ehrman highbrow trash, because his books attempt to communicate -- they're polemic, and rather trashy polemic in places, but they don't have the defining feature of highbrow trash, which is that if you aren't an insider you have no idea what they're talking about. I don't follow theology closely enough to be able to suggest some highbrow trash for your consideration; maybe some of my Christian readers can help here. <br><br>Dudley, the best advice I ever got concerning learning to write came from science fiction editor George Scithers, who warned a room full of would-be SF authors that going to a university writing program was the last thing they should do. I've seen way too many people come out of such programs literally incapable of crafting a story that anybody would voluntarily read; I'm glad to hear that you escaped with your talent intact. Keep on writing, and I look forward to seeing your name on the back spine of a lot of good books. <br><br>Dfr2010, Lovecraft loathed the Herbert West stories; he considered them his one dip into lowbrow trash. Some of his other pieces (I'm thinking here of "The Hound" especially) stray very close to warhol territory, but he was genuinely interested in communicating with his readers; uneven as his work is, I see him as a genuine literary artist. <br><br>Esn, formalism is one part of it; of course Soviet socialist-realism artists went to the opposite extreme and made propaganda posters under the delusion that the meaning was all that mattered. <br><br>Leo, the two pieces you liked strike me as the kind of thing you'd want to have in a children's playspace; fun, but art?

Not all great art is easily accessible. Many masterworks are able to communicate on whatever level their audience happens to be at, like the comics of Bill Watterson or the symphonies of Beethoven. But some are more challenging. They demand that the audience rise to their level, and therefore a casual observer might dismiss them as pretentious nonsense. Yet if you come to them with patience and an open mind, they reveal depth and meaning of their own.<br><br> It's interesting to study how socioeconomic status can affect people's artistic tastes - but Sturgeon's Law applies across the board. As noted by other commenters, even kitsch has its classics, and plenty of people do enjoy the music of Miles Davis and Phillip Glass.<br><br>I admit that I've never heard of anyone listening to Schoenberg for fun. Maybe someone does, but his work is mostly remembered for being a failed experiment - an innovative approach to composition that generally doesn't produce results anyone wants to listen to.

Regarding bad practices not only in art, but also in scholarship, you said: <br><br><i>"What defines lowbrow trash is that it rehashes the overfamiliar. It deploys stereotyped effects in stereotyped ways to evoke stereotyped sentiment."</i> <br><br>I follow the curriculum of the Ancient Order of Druids in America, which you and the other Archdruids decided to provide free of charge on the AODA website. (Thank you.) Part of that curriculum calls for reading nine books on my local ecology. I made it through seven, at which point I found it necessary to find other ways to fulfill the spirit of the edict. <br><br>I could have stopped at two, really. My thought at the time was that every single book on the subject, in every local library, read like it was written for the approval of a single college professor. Your definition above cuts to the heart of it very succinctly. <br><br>Yes, the forests and wetlands of northern Indiana were destroyed long ago. Every book goes on and on about that, rehashing the overfamiliar, deploying a stereotyped effect in stereotyped ways to evoke stereotyped sentiment. Little mention is made of the fact that extensive swamps and marshes, and vast tracts of extremely mature hardwood forests, are unfit for human habitation. <br><br>By all means, let's make an effort to coexist wisely with our ecosystems, but these authors are all calling for a restoration of Indiana's original state, either explicitly or implicitly. Do they not understand what "restoration" means? <br><br>I'm happy that Indiana's conservation movement has, like me, survived this long from its birth in the '60s. In practice, good things are being done; former trash dumps are now wildlife sanctuaries (give 'em time), a lot of municipalities have composting programs, and many plots of private land are exempt from taxes provided they're left alone. <br><br>But, man, we could use some new books.<br><br><a href=#c6057695334665683068 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 10:39 PM</a><br><br>

That artist did something socially or visually innovative or provocative enough to become the Big Artist of their time. To show that they were “hipper than thou,” the patrons of that time embraced and promoted this new look. Read Michelangelo’s comments on the Dutch Master landscape painters. Read early reviews of any painting movement and the shrieks of horror are every bit as shrill as what one hears of abstract expressionism. This is how it has always been. <br> <br>Also, keep in mind that you likely see only one or a few pieces of artwork from an artist or period. As someone who pretty much detests all sports, I don’t follow them if I can avoid it. Therefore I believe my commenting on a video of the merit of an athlete’s world breaking performance is a decent analogy. By your standards, I should be able to make really uninformed comments about how I don’t understand what the big deal is with winning 20+ Olympic medals or whatever and expect perfect equanimity from whoever hears me say that. Yet, if I walked into any sports bar in town right now, I would be told to keep my mouth shut because I didn’t know what I was talking about, or worse. How is that example different than people who spend very little time, making, looking at, thinking about or studying art feeling like they have equal insight to those of us who have literally spent our entire remembering lives being artists? Art is a very, very, old human endeavor. It has a context and a continuum, and it is not being elitist or Orwellian to point out that if you are going to criticize something of which you have little or no interest, then once in a while you will run across someone who is interested and they are going to ask you to explain yourself further. If you are thoughtful and not just reflexive in your answer, it likely will be appreciated and better yet, helpful.<br><br><a href=#c213383116246402644 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 10:43 PM</a><br><br>

I won't give the URL and be responsible for the exquisite pain induced, any true masochists can google it. Lowbrow trash is a bit harder; I think the movie scores of John Williams definitely have much lowbrow appeal, but I think they have enough redeeming value to be kept out of the trash category. I'm sure if I went through some soundtracks I could find imitators who deserve that classification. Figuring out what belongs in the canon is significantly harder; Stravinsky's Firebird Suite is one that I expect will hold up with time. One of the best instrumental movie soundtracks in my opinion is Ulysses's Gaze, which is almost an extended viola concerto in the form of a rondo.<br><br><a href=#c3665251132418811933 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 10:46 PM</a><br><br>

You get an Academy when the purveyors of highbrow trash get tired of the fact that nobody likes their stuff, and set out to take over the canon so they can put themselves into it. A canon in a healthy society doesn't require an institution to maintain it, because it's the expression of the society's sense of beauty, however tentative and idiosyncratic that happens to be, and no one person gets to say what is and isn't in it. As I said -- in so many words -- that a canon is always contested and always in flux. <br><br>Cassiodorus, congrats! <br><br>Space Seeder, if you paid attention to the sources of your own dislike of the book, and learned something about the strategy the author was using, you got one of the many possible points of the exercise. <br><br>Jay, good -- you've touched on another crucial issue, which is the self-defeating cult of originality in scholarship. I'll be talking about that down the road in a future post. <br><br>James, Tolkien isn't lowbrow trash, but one of the reasons he's so popular is that his tastes are relatively low of brow. Conan -- I don't think of Robert E. Howard as trash, either, though again, very low of brow. (If authors were whiskeys, Robert E Howard would be one of those old-fashioned bourbons that kicks your teeth out on the way down your throat.) Both authors were very good at what they did. There are many, many, many other fantasy authors who are much trashier. (Have you read the Brak the Barbarian stories of John Jakes? Oog.) As for "grimdark," that just means that modern fantasy has finally gotten around to wallowing in cheap sensationalism, the way literary fiction did in the 1960s. Yawn. <br><br>With regard to the postmodernists, yep. I've seen the tools of postmodernism used constructively a few times, but most of it's highbrow trash on the grand scale, and quite a bit of it is warhol. <br><br>Jo, exactly. Exactly. <br><br>Eric, funny. If you see any of the hipsters who are trying to dress like you, look down your nose at them and say, "You paid way too much for those clothes, and it shows. Tacky, really tacky." Then walk away. The results will be entertaining. <br><br>Angus, of course there are things missing -- this is a blog post, not a book. I'm going to challenge your first point, though. Bureaucratization is only an issue because bureaucrats pay big money for dog barf. Why? I covered that. <br><br>James, I used to think of Tolkien's books as masterpieces. At this point I'd put <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> in the same category as <i>Gone With The Wind</i>, a work that got its reputation because it expresses certain very popular sentiments in a way that harmonizes with certain very popular prejudices. I could be wrong, but it'll probably be for the future to decide on the status of both works. <br><br>Talon, excellent! Exactly; because the bread is good, the baker doesn't need to get a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to pay for it -- he simply sells it to people who like it. <br><br>Ozymandius, only because one of my other readers posted a comment on it.

If mundane things that you don't normally look at / think about are put in a different context (in a gallery labeled "art"), then a you may see them with fresh eyes. "I never looked at it that way," is the aimed-for response. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But the basic idea of prodding people to see familiar things in new ways is definitely one of the accepted traditional functions of art; this is one way to do that.<br><br>The parable of abstract expressionists as con artists: There's a great tradition of cartoonists poking fun at modern art with this basic idea. Traditionally – up until the mid-20th century anyway – cartoonists largely spoke from and to the working class. So, to many of them, it was natural to see “modern art” as a con, and to portray modern artists as pulling wool over the eyes of upper-class rubes. Is it thus in real life? Sure seems like it sometimes! On the other hand, none of the abstract artists I’ve known personally thought of themselves as con artists.<br><br>Sometimes to appreciate art, it helps to know the historical, social, cultural (and sometimes, biographical) context. Even if it seems empty to you, then you can understand why it moved other people.<br><br>In experiencing art, the viewer/reader brings a lot. Whatever forms and ideas are present in the art interact with ideas, feelings, experiences in the viewer's mind. The experience is different for each person; the viewer adds meaning. As a writer, I'm sure you know this: the reader adds background details, scenes that happen off-stage between the written scenes, backstory, etc. So, when you say there's no "there" there in abstract expressionist painting, that's true for you, but someone else may still get a lot out of it. What you get out of art depends partly on what you bring to it. When your readers urge you to stand in front of a Rothko painting and listen for your deep feelings, they're saying that because they did it and it worked for them – they felt something profound. You didn't – but that only means you didn't get anything from the painting; it doesn't mean that it's not possible to get something from it. Humans have an amazing capacity to find patterns, and meaning, where they aren't obvious.<br><br><br><a href=#c2735746527830014523 title="comment permalink">8/10/16, 11:04 PM</a><br><br>

They symbolize group membership. As such, art’s sometimes intended (by its buyers if not its creators) to be offensive, off-putting, or indecipherable to outsiders. This can apply equally to abstract art and to the paintings of dogs on velvet. Music tastes also serve this function, of course.<br><br>What gets included in canons is partly random and arbitrary – a matter of what happens to catch on early with a group. There was an experiment where several separate groups of young people were exposed to the same set of songs and rated them , then re-rated them after seeing how each song was assessed by their peers in the group (each group unaware of the other groups). Different songs became highly-rated in each group, depending on how they happened to do early on in that group. So much of this kind of thing is contingent.<br><br>Not all alleged trash, low or high, is really trash. If it has meaning to you, it’s not trash to you. Don’t be reluctant to value it (and not just as a silly diversion) just because someone else considers it trash; if it's meaningful and rewarding for you, provokes real feelings or interesting thoughts in your mind, has depths you see that others don't, then it's real art for you. Have that opinion, and express it freely! Don't be afraid or ashamed to appreciate and value art just because someone insists it's trash (lowbrow or highbrow). There may be meaning there that others are missing (some, you’re bringing to the table yourself). And conversely, if something looks like silly "emperor's clothes" to you, say so!

Highbrow trash gets the literary awards and lowbrow trash makes the most money, but there are a lot of people who read neither one. I'm watching the new deindustrial-SF magazine <i>Into the Ruins</i>, which is mildly highbrow and not trash at all, attract an enthusiastic and steadily growing audience, for example. The trick is to realize that there are entire publishing worlds out there that don't get into the <i>New York Review of Books</i> or the supermarket book stands, that there are a lot of people who already inhabit those worlds -- and that they're eager for new writers willing to give them good interesting books.

In Weimar Germany, the same sort of schism we've got in American culture was all over the place, with the soi-disant sophisticates looking down their noses in absolute contempt at ordinary Germans and ordinary Germans returning the favor with gusto. The Nazi Party was the political equivalent of a velvet Elvis painting, for that matter, and once it took power lowbrow trash was the order of the day. It's precisely when the middle ground is abandoned and everything is either highbrow or lowbrow trash that the sort of catastrophe that happened in Germany after 1933 is most likely to happen. <br><br>Tidlösa, I think a dog threw up on that poor goat! <br><br>Cherokee, thank you.

All the people who have money are into dog barf, and the people who don't like dog barf don't have money for art.

Folk art, in whatever culture, has tended to be supported by the commoners, not the elites. Around the White Sea, Pomor fishermen used to take along someone who could sing/tell the old historical bylinas (ballads) out on their boats, and he'd get a share of the catch despite doing no other work. The klezmerim made a living by playing at weddings and other public gatherings. Many other examples. All that has historically been required is a society with surplus food to give. In many other cases, people have made art for their own benefit: for example, barge-haulers and sailors singing to keep a steady rhythm going, and make the journeys less tedious. Another example: in many parts of Russia, shepherds who knew how to play a shepherd's horn (which they used to communicate with the cows) were paid more than those who didn't. Besides the work-specific horn calls, they would also learn to play melodies for their own delight. When groups of them gathered together, they would form ensembles, and eventually a steady tradition of ensemble playing was created.

I guess I'm a hopeless Philistine, but when I read the protagonist's distaste for the modern art in the embassy office, while I share his opinion of abstract expressionism, I just assumed it was also bad art. I mean, when have you ever seen good art in a government office? I'm sure embassies can afford a better class of art than the government offices I've had the misfortune to visit, but abstract expressionism sounds like exactly the sort of innocuous, intellectually-lazy artistic cop-out bureaucrats would love. I imagine they would choose the most mediocre exemplars too. <br><br>If I may offer my unsolicited literary review, regardless of one's own artistic preferences--which are irrelevant to Retrotopia anyway (!)--I thought the scene was well-crafted to convey a lot of mood and information in a brief passage. I could perfectly envision that office, with its tacky, banal art and all the beauty and feeling of an iProduct (which is to say, none), and how our hero's view of it had transformed. <br><br>For this month's homework, I am revisiting (in memory and internet) one of my favorite places to go as a child, the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento, CA. It was the site of my first experiences of highbrow trash, and where I realized that most contemporary art is a con job. Anyway my first highbrow trash encounter was a piece titled "Carolyn's Bag" in the contemporary art wing. It was just a small leather handbag with some books in it. My mom, whose name happened to be Carolyn, happened to have an identical bag at home, very possibly with a similar stack of books in it. I think we made some joke about how our money worries were over, now that we knew we had fine art at home. (Sadly I could not find a picture of the piece and I don't know the artist's name.) <br><br>The lowbrow trash: Any of Mel Ramos' really dated nudes lounging on junk food, let's say "Five Flavor Frieda" (http://www.sactownmag.com/June-July-2012/The-Naked-Eye/). I have some doubts here, I admit; Ramos' paintings seem to be masquerading as highbrow--I mean, they're in museums...but then again some were also in Playboy. I could always go for Thomas Kinkade here or Amy Brown, but those are so easy. I'm trying to make this a little more challenging by sticking to one venue. Still I realize that a museum is likely to be a bit light on the lowbrow examples, but lowbrow can get elevated to highbrow and passed off as "irony". Well, if nothing else there are some Norman Rockwells at the Crocker I believe. <br><br>Finally for the classic, I'm going to go out on a limb a bit and rather than suggesting a time-tested artwork from days of yore, I propose the works of David Ligare, e.g., "Penelope" (http://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article22925640.html). They are recognizably modern, but employ classic Impressionist themes and techniques and would make fine company for works by Cezanne or Caillebotte, for example. Yet there's a hint of the Symbolist and even the Expressionist there too. Will we be studying Ligare's paintings 500 years from now as we study Da Vincis today? Probably not. Yet I think "Penelope" can still sit comfortably within the extended family of canonical Western art. <br><br>Now I'm going to be attempting this exercise with other forms of art. It was fun, and trying to reason out why I put a piece in one category or the other is enlightening.<br><br><a href=#c3493257189381723732 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 12:09 AM</a><br><br>

I respect Picasso because he learned the classical techniques and then chose, for his own reasons, to ignore them -- but there are too many well-paid artists these days who make ugly art because they can't do anything else. <br><br>Repent, you know the rules. <br><br>Five8Charlie, I won't argue, but my favorite example of sheer philosophical dog barf remains Hegel's <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i>. Schopenhauer insisted that it was deliberate fraud, a vast string of meaningless sentences marshalled to try to make Hegel look smarter than anyone else because nobody could understand it and everyone assumed he did, and I'm far from sure the old grouch of Frankfurt was wrong. <br><br>Jason, I'm not interested in a definition of art. I'm interested in encouraging individuals to develop a clear personal sense of aesthetic and intellectual taste. <br><br>Bob, good. Count on Kipling to have something relevant to say!<br><br>Tom, I'll take your word for it. I'm far from sure that in a double-blind test, anybody could actually tell the difference between a Jackson Pollock painting and a well-used studio dropcloth. <br><br>Marie, it's a marvelous definition, not least because it shows that Warhol was fully aware of the game he was playing!<br><br>Allan, and the thing is, the chimp paintings really were better than the others: less hackneyed, more original, more energetic and spirited. What that says about the quality of the other art on display -- well, I'll leave that to you to guess. <br><br>Matthew, that's the way the Neoplatonists interpreted him. Given his actual writings, though, I find that a stretch. I think he'd made the understandable but fatal mistake of confusing mental concepts with eternal realities -- a mistake that has been made enthusiastically many times since then. <br><br>Lew, interesting. I may need to read that. <br><br>Ozark, no, mere skill isn't enough to create a classic. There's a lot of technically accomplished kitsch out there. I'd say, though, that technical skill is the unavoidable foundation on which anything worthwhile has to be built. As for Vonnegut, I don't enjoy him at all, thus don't read him, and am therefore not the person to ask. <br><br>Karen, thank you for a thoughtful response. Yes, I'm quite familiar with the use of sacred geometry as a basic compositional principle in medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque art and architecture. A facility with geometry, and a good solid grasp of its philosophical and mystical implications, was an essential part of an artist's training in those days. Are you familiar with Richard Padovan's book <i>Proportion</i>? Though I don't agree with some of his conclusions, it's a very good survey.<br><br><a href=#c9078991795233824052 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 12:28 AM</a><br><br>

Art that was both honest (realistic) and appealed to humanity's better nature - that was supposed to be the goal of socialist realism. Those ideals (not their faulty execution in Stalin's time, but the ideals themselves) seem to have been very broadly popular, and were embraced with renewed enthusiasm by the Soviet public after Stalin's death (and actually, even before, with the end of WW2). For example, here are a few quotes (translated from Russian by myself, for <a href=http://www.academia.edu/14955197/ rel=nofollow>my thesis</a>) from "Sredi nehozhennykh dorog, odna-moya", a collection of post-WW2 Soviet amateur "guitar poetry" songs (a roughly analogous phenomenon to Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, etc.):<br><br>"The aspiration to honesty, truthfulness, attention to the spiritual world of a person, which dominate [Soviet] amateur song, was formed precisely at that stage in the life of our society when the negative consequences of the cult of personality were revealed and started to be overcome - when a period of renewal came about, of quests and hopes, when the whole country became enveloped by an artistic uplift."<br><br> "But what makes a song live, why does it attract or not attract people? Must the music be good? Yes. The text? Yes. The performance? Yes. But then why is it not uncommon for songs that are seemingly straightforward in text and in melody to last for decades and centuries? The answer is that song represents the human soul laid bare (I am talking about <i>real</i> song), and it is with this quality that it attracts people. A person may show himself in a song to be manly, gentle, thoughtful, merry, sad, wrathful and so on, but must never show himself to be fake. Soulful insincerity and psychological falsehood kill a song. And neither an original melody, nor a refined text, nor a developed singing voice can then save it. How irritating are those other songs which are performed on the stage, on radio and television; those, which have not the smallest hint of true soulfulness! <br> During the evening meetings of the abovementioned club "Vostok," [a popular amateur song club] sociological surveys get carried out. For example: "what do you value in a song, what is it that you like in it?" It is characteristic that in the responses (and in the over two and a half decades of the club's existence several thousand of them have been collected) there is not one in which the song was loved "for the music" or "for the text". Those to whom the song is addressed tend to judge it as a synthetic work, primarily on the basis of <i>what</i> it carries, not how. This "how" is merely a means for carrying out the primary task."<br><br>As the author makes clear, more "officially-sanctioned" works could be seen by the public as being too "formalist"; masking their irrelevancy and dishonesty with good technique ("How irritating are those other songs which are performed on the stage, on radio and television"). Those surveys seem to indicate that antipathy to formalism was widespread among the public. So perhaps... it wasn't that Soviet socialist-realism artists went to any "extreme" under any "delusion" as you put it, but that the government adopted some genuinely publicly-popular ideas about art and used them as justification for their own goals whenever possible.<br><br>An analogous phenomenon existed in painting, too - I heartily recommend the book "Soviet Impressionist Painting" by Vern Swanson, which has plenty of examples.<br><br><a href=#c3762550110221240593 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 12:57 AM</a><br><br>

Your kind of attitude is the flipside of the posturing arrogance of the art world, and it's no less harmful. <br><br>Jo, I've heard interesting reviews of <i>The Mandibles</i>. Thank you for the comments on collapsing ahead of the rush -- that really does make a lot of difference!<br><br>Max, I mostly read books by dead people, so no, I haven't gotten to those yet. <br><br>Jbucks, of course! These days, artists in training get taught from day one that dog barf is good art, so it's by no means surprising that a lot of them do their best to come up with innovative, interesting dog barf. The point of the parable is the way that people suppress their own taste and common sense, and go along with the bullying and corrupt taste that dominates so much of the art world. <br><br>Sheila, I've long wondered what the people who provide goods and services to the absurdly rich think of the surroundings they work in. Thanks for confirming a guess. <br><br>Ynnothir Coll, interesting. That may be specific to your region; when I was doing the curriculum, in western Washington state, I had no problem finding a diversity of viewpoints. You might consider writing the book you want to read...<br><br>Karen, you're slipping into one of the bad habits that prevent artists from communicating with anyone outside the narrow confines of the art world: assuming that those who aren't full time artists are as uninterested and ignorant of art as you are of sports. That simply isn't the case, as a closer reading of the comments that irritated you will show. A large number of people in today's industrial nations care a great deal about art; they visit museums regularly, buy art books, and have original works and reproductions on their walls. (As you'll recall from our earlier exchange, my wife and I are two of these people, and we know quite a few others.) Such people resent the bullying they get from the art world when they express an opinion that doesn't involve the blind uncritical acceptance of whatever dog barf happens to be fashionable this week. If you and your fellow artists really do want to communicate with such people -- and in a healthy culture, they make up a significant fraction of the market for art, especially art produced by those who aren't superstars -- you need to remember that communication involves listening as well as talking, and be open to the possibility that what all these aesthetically and culturally literate people are saying might just be something that artists today need to hear. <br><br>John, good. Lowbrow trash instrumental music? My first suggestion would be to check out the more uninspired examples of TV show theme music, but that's just a guess. <br><br>Mike, if defamiliarization is art, then why do we need artists? We can just hire a seven-year-old to hang odd objects on walls, and get the same experience. In the same way, insisting that it's up to the individual viewer to bring to the work of art something that will make it meaningful is a copout. It used to be the job of the artist to evoke meaning, and a vast number of artists did that very, very well. Again, if it's all up to the viewer, we don't need artists; we can hire a chimp to splash paint across canvases, frame it, hang it on the wall, and project our own ideas of meaning onto it. <br><br>Robert, I don't agree that it's the mission of art to reflect our society back at us -- I think we all already know that the modern world is shoddy, overhyped, overpriced, and stunningly ugly. As for the canon, one basic rule is that if the artist is still alive, it's not canon. At least one generation needs to pass, and the immediate pressures of the moment give way to something else, before it becomes possible to judge whether a work of art is enduring or merely temporarily popular. <br><br>Candace, agreed! I have no idea why women put up with fashion.<br><br><a href=#c810154930752655357 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 1:03 AM</a><br><br>

They turn to arts and antiques because they've already acquired some amount of real estate, and have been burnt to some degree with it and they see how rigged the stock market is. One dear friend, now deceased under suspicious circumstances, was an avid collector and thoroughly hated by his ex-wife and son for it. Upon retiring, he bought a sizable warehouse in a rural part of Tokyo to hold his masses of treasure. His final craze was antique teddy bears, but we suspect it was his bragging over his precious stone collection that did him in. He had lots of fun, but his adventures inspired others to aspire to his level of reckless stupidity. His son, as heir, turned the entire collection over to an antique dealer for a small sum, like $1000 or so, and this is not an uncommon phenomenon here. A TV show features people bringing in their priceless antique treasures that they hocked their kids' education fund for, knowing it was a bargain, and most of the time it turns out to be worth less than they thought, frequently less than they paid.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c8777115167032776033 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 1:26 AM</a><br><br>

Also, many of them were things that would not have been painted in the West at that time, particularly scenes of contemporary working lives. The artists tried to go out on in the field (sometimes on long expeditions) and paint the country around them, rather than sit in their studios working on their unique visions and styles, as was the tendency in the Western art departments at the time. They seemed to genuinely like doing it, too. It really was two very separate artistic worlds - and I'm not sure at all that the West picked the better side to support in that particular battle.<br><br><a href=#c7595396437567971289 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 1:29 AM</a><br><br>

I don't have any meaningful examples for all of you because, well, I'm not that of a reader or an art enthousiast. However, some examples come to my mind and are from my trade.<br><br>In the field of software engineering, when it comes to choose whatever programming language that does the trick, there is a lot of fashion and irrational thinking. What would be considered canon are languages like Java or Python or even PHP/Javascript, everybody agrees they are general-purpose, pratical, have relatively sound foundations, are well-spread and, basically, do the job. For the lowbrow thrash end of spectrum, we have Rapid Application Development environments such as Delphi, Windev or Powerbuilder, used by "poor" IT services companies to do routine and menial jobs of implementing cheap basic business software. We can add Excel and its macro-language to the list. Those tools are frown upon many professionals precisely for being used by second grade small companies. On the other end of the spectrum, we have all the "hipster" languages whose practioners consider as "art" like Haskell, Eml and a full load of the same batch. There are mostly functional languages that popped out theoritical computer science labs and made their way to hipster programmers thanks to a few practionners who promote them the worst way possible (think of your climate change scientist from that post of yours).<br><br>Now for a precise focus on three works, let's take Python (canon but used to be HiBT), Excel/VBA (LoBT) and Haskell (the equivalent of abstract expressionism in programming languages, really dog's barf in the form of lines of computer code)<br><br>Creating a business application with Excel and VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) is cheap, easy (don't need 5 years of training and a master in comp sci) and, most of time, does the job. It's kind of eternal. Well, after a career of 20 years in the trade, I still encounter such pieces of software and some new ones are still being written. It's considered a hell to maintain and is thought to increase technical debt which to my own experience may be true because such solutions cannot scale company-wise. What make them real lowbrow trash is that small business owners and IT guy (who should know better anyway) often want and claim them to be kept as tools and methods for new developments.<br><br>The Python language is a multi-purpose language with a clear syntax, a sound mathematical foundation, a long history and a good track record at being an excellent tool for both education in software programming and design of software applications. For all of these reasons, it's considered what you labelled as canon by the community. It has drawbacks and other canon languages may be used instead but still.<br><br>The Haskell language is a functional language you can't fully understand without specific notion of functional programming that are high-end theoretical computer science. Don't get me wrong here, it's not a bad language, as any functional language it can prove very useful in some situations like any better well-spread Lisp dialect (Lisp is considered canon by the way). However, some aspects of the language are really difficult and its proponents (whom I suspect don't often understand all of it) have a great deal of overcomplexifying things just for the sake of it. <br><br>By the way, the Retrotopia story has been a thrill to me for months and it get better and better with each episode. I feel like a reader of a XIXth century newspaper waiting for his weekly dose of Alexandre Dumas (which is btw considered lowbrow trash in classical french literature in France). Would you ever consider expanding the story and publishing a novel as you did with Twilight's Last Gleaming?<br><br>Cheers from the other side.<br><br><a href=#c7902492841026952312 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 3:58 AM</a><br><br>

What would you call an economic system in which excess labor and resources (excess above that which is required by the producers of labor and the extractors of resources for their immediate needs - "needs" as defined by Maslow) are converted into "capital" (which is then used to procure more excess labor and resources)?<br><br>There was a time (long ago) when art was produced by individuals who felt a compulsion to spend their leisure time (time not required for the exercise of labor needed to extract the resources necessary to meet their needs) decorating their cave walls or carving their mastodon tusks with something that felt significant to them.<br><br>Then the "system" came along (call it "excessism" if you don't like "capitalism"). People, not surprisingly, felt they would feel more secure if they could have a bit of excess hidden away to carry them through the hard times. Then, they needed someone to guard their excesses from others who would take them by force instead of producing their own excess. Then the guards started to feel they "deserved" their positions, and insisted that they should not have to labor, along with their fellows, in order to produce the excess. <br><br>Then the guards looked at the pretty things produced by those who had the compulsion to do so, and decided that the pretty things were simply another resource to which they deserved access without putting in any of their own labor. So they started giving some of the excess resources they were guarding to the people who produced the pretty things so that they would use their labor to produce pretty things instead of producing excess resources to meet needs of the hard times.<br><br>And they have been doing it ever since. And the artists (for the most part) have collaborated with them (since it means they can spend their time producing pretty things instead of shovelling...). And the artists, over time, have responded to the "art market" by ever more esoteric definitions of art, in order that their own pretty things would have more "value," and therefore be more deserving of the excess resources produced by the shovellers that were being held by the guards.<br><br>At least, that is the way I see it.<br><br><a href=#c5245536136445872186 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 5:40 AM</a><br><br>

The jurors have always had their own pick, but was only a small 5k prize category compared to the 250k prize chosen by the public. As those in charge started to realize that the winner was only going to be works with the largest common denominator (and thus tended to favor bland, but technically skilled works and would eventually devolve into only lowbrow and middlebrow entries) they began to up the juror's category, until it equaled the grand prize. This change began in earnest after the public overwhelmingly chose a stained glass "Surfer Jesus" that was very skillfully done, but quite kitschy, and the art students that created highbrow trash were given a reason to keep competing. It's no secret here that most of the Juror's selections have very little foot traffic and even fewer votes; the category and its winners are commonly seen as being irrelevant to the actual event (very well attended, with people from all over the country and some international tourists, apparently) and mostly as the Academy's snub to what people actually like. All previous winners can be seen on the website.<br><br><br>To Avery, I would recommend John D Caputo for your highbrow trash, as he follows quite firmly in the postmodern footsteps of Derrida and seems unaware that he speaks only to a small circle of pseudo-religious academics. His smallest and most accessible work is a little book called "On Religion" in which he redefines religion into irrelevancy. One of his students, Peter Rollins, has some similar works, but they tend more to the middlebrow trash as they speak to aspiring-academics (and, IMHO, have more theological merit).<br><br><br><br><a href=#c3412191067248429205 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 6:41 AM</a><br><br>

A whole week's essay on 'What is Art, or what is trash"? I do wish I had more time this week to read and respond to more comments!<br><br>I don't recall anyone last week saying you didn't have a right to your opinions or that you were afraid or intimidated by modern art, modern materials, etc. I must have read those differently. I'm just really surprised at your reaction, JMG!<br><br>Of course there is an "Academy", (as Karen says, there always has been in one form or another since the dawn of complicated societies) telling the population what is good, what is trash, what THEY like is what everyone should like. Almost every piece or movement of visual art that we now canonize were in their own times breaking away from the chains of those Doyens of taste. Modern art, however one defines it, is no different. <br><br>As to Abstract Expressionism - I guess it's worth restating that IMHO, It is a car close to the end of the train, filling up the last of the notional space in visual artists' exploration of the absolute mania over Sigmund Freud's ideas on the human Psyche and subconscious. The whole of the 20th Century was really changed and shaped by these ideas, the Art world no less. It's actually ironic, funny and infuriating that the whole point of Abstract Expressionism is to break away from any proscribed Academy and connect with a viewer in the most basic way. So that ANY human can connect with it without being told how to react. (whether or not it is successful is another story, I personally still think it was a worthwhile endeavor to have tried.) Their is no right or wrong answer - If you like it you like it, if you don't, you don't. So the irony is that like kudzu, the arbiters of taste have grown over and taken over this form as well, and used it's very openness as the velvet rope barring entry to anyone who "doesn't get it". <br><br>Using the barest, simplest tools in the artists box, (just color, shape, texture, line…) blobs of color together - WITHOUT a definite subject. The point of forgoing a subject, (It's not a picture of a house, a sea, a horse…) is that we all have preconceived prejudices over those things and well, pretty much everything else we know. We either like or dislike horses already - so we will 'react' with that prior knowledge and feeling. Again: the experiment of engaging in a reaction without those things, to see if you can connect on some more visceral, primal level - like my little students watching in rapture the colors swirling down the drain as they wash out their paint pallets and buckets. <br><br>As for the challenge: Yes, I find it much more challenging to do than representational art, (and frankly less gratifying) because there is no anchor. Representational art is dead-easy to work with in terms of balance, proportion, etc. because the subjects are like anchors - they tell you what and where things must go in relation to each other on a canvas. The blobs of color - if you try to make the red or blue blob the anchor - the painting looks stiff, forced and contrived. It doesn't have that free floating 'swirling' down the drain' fun feeling. If you just try to rely on a happy accident - it's very unlikely the proportion and balance will end up in a pleasing composition. In class, I would tend to have the kids do an abstract expressionist painting as a background, then the next week they would study and work on architectural draftings of a temple, boat or something very tight and orderly - then the 3rd week - collage them together. The older kids always found, (as did I) the abstract bit the hardest by far. I ended up using those Hubbel telescope photos of star nurseries to help us.<br><br><a href=#c7616434365421366409 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 6:47 AM</a><br><br>

If you or any reader still disregards the whole thing outright. That's perfectly fine. <br><br>Incidentally: I am a bit surprised you didn't use Conceptual Art or even graffiti, (Abstract Expressionism is really old hat, even today!) that fills galleries these days. Conceptual art IMHO really is the caboose of this train. The concept, the meaning ascribed to the piece by Art Theorists is the main point - not the artwork itself. So the Gatekeepers have pretty much discarded the need for the artists altogether. That's where you get the urinal on the wall (and not the Duchamp humorous trolling one), or a sloppy string of shabby Christmas lights drooping in a white room = ART!!<br><br>As for the homework: Yippy!<br><br>But Hey People! Why the hate for Norman Rockwell? I personally love him. He captures the humanity, the internal emotion of every character/figure he paints with gentle understanding.

That painting makes me weep with the soulfulness captured in the figures. Just sublime.<br><br>High-brow trash that I like. Wow. Too many to choose from, so maybe I'll go with the most Warholian - old Andy himself. The Brillo Pad boxes and Campbell soup cans, Marilyn, Liz and Elvis times-6. He was definitely trolling the high brows of the art world, but also the overbearingly ubiquitous commercialism that (again like kudzu) had grown over the art world and the whole society at the time. * A commercialism incidentally that was begat also with the advent of Sigmund Freud's ideas - brought to the world by his nephew, Edward Bernaise.

Which is why today's elites attempt to distinguish themselves by creating artificial scarcity for highbrow trash. The Andy Warhols of the world -- I would include Damien Hirst and Duchamp's readymades in this -- make themselves iconic by creating such obviously ridiculous work that the joke is on the elites who buy it. They are often quite open about doing so. <br><br>There are quite a few good books written on how technology has totally transformed our concepts of art and literature. On the invention of highbrow trash, there's Tom Wolfe's book <i>The Printed Word</i>. On the idea of what is lost through mass reproduction (in defense of the highbrow in general), there's Walter Benjamin's <i>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</i>. On what is <i>gained</i> through mass reproduction, there's Marshall McLuhan's <i>The Gutenberg Galaxy</i>, which is notable for predicting the Internet in 1962. And of course, on the question of who makes art now that everything is available to everyone, there's José Ortega y Gasset's <i>The Revolt of the Masses</i>. I recommend any of these books to anyone who is feeling less confident about their own artistic tastes as a result of this discussion :)<br><br><a href=#c5471664130192943964 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 6:56 AM</a><br><br>

So consider this: <br><br>Start by accepting the classification into lowbrow trash, classics, and highbrow trash. Now consider that it is the ambition of artists to make progress in the world of art. Some may wish to do this through classics, but some may wish to invent new directions. Whether a genuinely new direction will be fruitful -- will develop over time into an "classic" aesthetic -- is not going to be known when it is first invented. This will come out to you as highbrow trash (and some of it really is).<br><br>Or I can make it even shorter, since some of JMG's characters seem to like jazz. There are people to whom *that* is highbrow trash, and others for whom it is lowbrow trash. (respectively, a lot of "ordinary people", and not a few classical musicians).<br><br><a href=#c4523201303320601881 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 7:01 AM</a><br><br>

It seems to me that it's a question of purpose: lowbrow trash is made for comfort/pleasure, highbrow trash for status signalling, and non-trash for communicating understanding. Of course, that means that a lot of intrinsically good art can also be used as one or both sorts of trash, depending on a person's level of understanding and interests. And it means that the classification can equally be extended to religiousness, if not to religions - the temptation to make religion a security blanket or a way of showing off is pretty pervasive.<br><br>For linguistics, three examples that strike me as unproblematic are:<br>Lowbrow trash: Merritt Ruhlen<br>Highbrow trash: Jerry Fodor<br>Canon: Saussure<br><br>But a lot of the big names of the field (Chomsky, for one, along with his most vocal opponents) seem to be engaged in a double game - genuinely trying to advance understanding, but at the same time status-signalling to an extent that leads them to grossly overhype fairly flimsy hypotheses.

That written by sf writers trying to be highbrow, as in the New Wave stiff mentioned previously; and that written by lit-critters reinventing the wheel. For s/f fans, I suggest (re)reading Heinlein's REVOLT IN 2100 and following it with Margaret Atwood's THE HANDMAID'S TALE. If Atwood's novel were a bit less pretentiously written, it would be the perfect prequel to the Heinlein tale, written 40 years later. More amusing in a bitter sort of way was Atwood's earlier reactions to those who wanted to put her up for a Hugo. "It is NOT science fiction! There are no spaceships or robots in it!" <br><br>(2) There is a difference between low-brow trash, and fluff. Georgette Heyer's Regency comedies of manners are fluff. Kerry Greenwood's Phryne Fisher mysteries, set in 1920s Australia, are fluff. You can tell the difference by watching the first two seasons of Miss Fisher's Mysteries on DVD - Phryne Fisher's world made acceptable to the Australian viewing audience. i.e. the overfamiliar, comfortable cliches of lowbrow trash. Hey, it's TV! Later, the writers realized who their following actually was, and went back to her thread of social criticism. But still kitsched up her love life! <br><br>(3) The "girl cooties" factor. Romance novels, especially. Lois Bujold has pointed out at length that the basic romance theme is actually quite important - that of getting the next generation born and raised - but the treatment of that theme has lent itself to a lot of lowbrow trash being written. But it's all lumped together because the theme is "trivial, fluffy grrrl stuff about loooove." Likewise the pejorative "chick lit," into which you can actually toss Jane Austen if you so desire. (Kipling knew better.)<br><br>(4) I never understood the appeal of poetry until I heard some of it set to music. Then it clicked. For Kipling fans, I recommend 2 CDs by Leslie Fish, which turned me onto poetry. Likewise, Shakespeare is marvelous when well staged or filmed, when on the printed page I'd have to dig for the gems. <br><br>Speaking of highbrow trash that isn't - the New York Times (a freebie at my local coffee shop) had a review of a "Troilus and Cressida" staged as a modern "quagmire" war - which the Siege of Troy was! - and Cressida, not as faithless and fickle, but in survival mode behind enemy lines. To me, that makes perfect sense: many of his plots are timeless. If the NYT likes is and it makes sense to the likes of me, is it highbrow trash? Or a really good interpretation?<br><br><a href=#c7680609262052986791 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 7:14 AM</a><br><br>

Most adults knew who Andy Warhol was and made some comment about how his art was trying to say something, but the 10 year old, especially after seeing some artwork with hand-prints said "that's something any five year old could do." This does just go to further what JMG said, that there definitely are ways to measure the quality of art.<br><br><a href=#c860971032806044927 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 7:30 AM</a><br><br>

More typically I’ll get this feeling from nature itself in puddles and debris, but sometimes I find that sort of expression of simple forces beautiful. I don’t think it exists (or it’s creators) on some higher plane than other art though, I’m ok to place it on a very low spot but still find enjoyment in it some times.<br>I should say I am an artist of sorts, I taught myself to draw and went to an art college, but it was much more trade oriented (why I chose there over university – a decision I am still thankful for decades later) and so my teachers would actively discourage you from being impressionistic and I always focused on representation and improving that skill set. I have a lot of respect for proper painting and like you find myself captivated for long periods of time at some of the unbelievable works people painted and valued in the past.<br><br>I also agree with you about Warhol, I remember laughing out loud once watching an interview with him where they asked him why he had moved from painting to film, he said, “because it’s easier,” he liked how you just had to push one button. That feeling became sort of the kernel for a band I formed a few years ago as a joke that is similarly lazy and comedic. People really respond to us, which is strange, but there’s this funny interaction when I try to explain what we are doing (being intentionally awful) compared to what they think we are doing which is usually push music forward in some way. We don’t play often, maybe a couple times a year, but I keep it up because it doesn’t take any work, and performing it puts me in a really strange state that I enjoy, somewhere between being incredibly embarrassed and self aware, and an almost childish giddiness that I don’t really experience at any other time. It’s so overwhelming for me that I find it pushes all other thoughts out of my head and that alone is worth wasting an evening on for me. People keep wanting us to record the music, but we’ve always declined because it doesn’t make any sense to us.<br><br>I really enjoyed this post anyway!<br><br><br><a href=#c3174932085059342040 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 7:42 AM</a><br><br>

Yet if I reply to an art description in a tone similar to how it was written, I’m a spluttering bully? If I raise a geeky art question that comes from being an artist, then I’m elitist, a sequestered insider? I don’t think I’ve implied uncritical acceptance, ever, because I can and have trashed contemporary art with the best of them. I WANT the dialog, but I want something meaningful. It is natural to assume that a more detailed judgment of a work of art implies that the viewer is more interested. If people want better art to look at, they need to be able to describe what they dislike in specifics. I believe you confuse my frustration with the critical writing about the art as a defense of the art. Not so. Binary pronouncements of good/bad, like/dislike aren’t helpful to artists. Tell us what you like, want, etc. I mean the nuts and bolts: colors, subject matter, paint styles, whatever and why.

We may not like it, but I promise we listen. <br> <br>I do think that those who practice a discipline such as art, science, sports, whatever, have a much different relationship and understanding of that endeavor than those who don’t regardless of how interested the non-participants are.

Being a haven for two art forms widely ridiculed as extremes of hipster pretense it should have been insufferable. Instead it was a place of rare joy and discovery and shared humanity. The details of how that happened are too much for a comment on someone else's blog, but I can offer a couple of observations from the experience that are relevant to your discussion here. <br><br>Sometimes (maybe always) avant garde experiments, warhols included, influence the creation of new masterpieces later on, if only by clearing space to allow a suspension of disbelief that was unthinkable before. You alluded to this in the scene at the opera and Carr's musings on notional space. He mentions as an example late-1950s jazz of Monk and Brubeck forming a moment beyond which jazz descended into pretentious doodling. But you see it is not so. Among their other contributions to the music, Monk opened space for small shaggy dissonances that to mainstream listeners of the time sounded like sloppiness but were eventually recognized as a virtuosic kind of playfulness, Brubeck opened space for hearing coherent lyrical almost danceable grooves in devilish odd time signatures. These features, along with further adventures of characters such as Ornette Coleman (whose Harmelodic approach to composition might be compared to Schoenberg's 12 tones in orchestral art music and to most ears is equally unintelligible) straight through to modern extremes such as John Zorn, are now part of the canon. As a result, I saw suburban blue-hairs sit rapt and smiling through performances of frenetic free-form chaos and on more than one occasion saw most of a hundred-seat room reduced to tears by a piano trio way out on the edge of space. Thus the canon moves.<br><br>As for coffee, it's a bean from a mountain bush that becomes an elixir when roasted with care and served with a human touch. We prided ourselves on serving world-class espresso drinks without the icy barista attitude and delighted in coaxing soccer moms away from all the sweet flavorings to get them excited about an honest cup of black coffee. Hipsters may be the poster children for both art forms but delivered in an inclusive open-hearted way the appeal can actually be universal.<br><br>Dug in KC<br><br><a href=#c3563493560469606921 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 8:04 AM</a><br><br>

I would like to add that as an artist (though a mediocre one), this has been a constant struggle for me, especially through college. The ability to praise a Jackson Pollock even though I honestly can't distinguish between his paintings and a well-used apron (or Anselm Keefer, whom I like, although his landscapes seem the equivalent of atmospheric background music, lacking a melody) was trained in me through repeated art-historical essay drills. I now often tell people that a picture is only worth a thousand words because art historians are verbose blatherers, while the artist can get at most a single sentence actually into his work. <br><br>Your mention of Duchamp's toilet reminds me of a few years ago when I emphatically argued with my fellow art students that it was not art, or at a minimum the designer of that particular urinal should be the one given credit for it. The art history majors all disagreed, but the studio artists mostly agreed with me.<br><br>I've been racking my brain for a while but I'm having a hard time coming up with any famous artwork (in the "pictures that go on walls" sense) work that doesn't fall into either 'trash' definitions (though I do unironically like Rockwell and his ilk). The one group I can think of that tends to produce 'good' art consistently are book illustrators - unless my taste is wrong, and artists like John Howe are actually kitsch.<br><br><a href=#c686826678331220198 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 8:31 AM</a><br><br>

All the people who have money are into dog barf, and the people who don't like dog barf don't have money for art. That's one of the many reasons why a large, thriving middle class is good for a society -- it provides a large market for unpretentious art."<br><br>Timberg explores the same thing. In the face of an ever shrinking middle class, how can non elite art be supported? I also began to think about art, in general, in the face of decline. What will it look like? What forms will art take? Looking back, (I'm also an art history geek. Never got my degree, but have a lot of classes, books and exhibits under my belt) I think art will end up on more ... utilitarian items. A bit of decoration on pottery or an ax handle. To identify the owner or the maker. To make something more pleasing to the eye, but for perhaps a very small audience of one ... plus a few family and friends. <br><br>Finally, I was reminded of a comment an art teacher made to a friend of mine who was going for his MFA.

I think, not to defend the snobby elites who gate keep at the edge of societal artistic norms, that, to quote a Norwegian writer who has become quite controversial and celebrated at the same time of late (Karl Ove Knausgaard), "Those…who call for more intellectual depth, more spirituality, have understood nothing, for the problem is that the intellect has taken over everything. Everything has become intellect, even our bodies, they aren’t bodies anymore, but ideas of bodies, something is situated in our own heaven of images and conceptions within us and above us, where an increasingly large part of our lives is lived. The limits of that which cannot speak to us — the unfathomable — no longer exist. We understand everything, and we do so because we have turned everything into ourselves." This seems to me to say a lot about the direction art has taken. Anything goes, and there are no limits placed on that irony.

I started an advanced degree in Theoretical Chemistry and then dropped out to pursue an MFA in painting paid for by the GI Bill. I should mention that I didn't make a living in either the sciences or the arts but survived instead by working most of my life as a programmer. I agree that both fields, the sciences and the arts are riddled with a lot of highbrow trash. I will break my comments up into two parts, one on the sciences and one on the arts. Here goes with art.<br>For me, the measure of good art is that it has to move the viewer emotionally or if you will, spiritually. This is a rather subjective measure of what makes good art, and there is good art that does not move everyone. Good by my criteria is a statistical artifact expressed in percentage of the viewers moved. I like to think that great art has great power since the viewer is helpless in its presence. Conversely, bad art leaves the viewer unmoved or simply bored or even worse, annoyed at the artist's poor attempt to manipulate the viewer's emotions.<br>A good deal of art since the middle of the 20th century has abandoned any attempt to appeal to the great unwashed masses and instead become insider commentary on or a reaction to art history. To talk about this kind of art, you need exposure to art history. You need to know what the artist is reacting to or commenting on. If you are an insider, you get it, if you are not, you don't. One of the aspects of an art education is that you learn how to talk about art, which is difficult if the work of art has little visible content and elicits no emotional response. What you learn is to talk, not about the piece as a standalone work but rather its meaning in an art historical context. To the initiated, an all black canvas is a reaction to the tyranny of representationalism or even to the use of color by abstract expressionism. To the uninitiated, the black canvas is simply stupid because anyone with a bucket of black paint and a roller could have created that work. And so, the ability to understand this sort of art gives the viewer insider status. The person who simply sees black paint becomes an outsider. <br>A few years ago, we went to an art expo, a trade show for art galleries in Los Angeles. My impression overall was that the trend in painting was an intentional effort on the part of the painters to look unschooled. To point out that these paintings looked amateurish, required no skill to produce and could have been done by anyone automatically made you an outsider, someone who did not understand the criteria which had made these paintings worth exhibiting. Painting in effect had become part of the class war in which the galleries provide the wealthy with yet another tool by which to distinguish themselves from the poor or the wannabes. Painters had abandoned any attempt to move their viewers and instead were pandering to the intellectual games of the art marketplace. The reaction I have to this kind of art, who would hang this in their house, is the same I get when looking at fashion magazines, who would wear this? Art and fashion have become barometers of decadence, the ability of the rich to flaunt their ability to buy high priced commodities that are obviously in bad taste, to say to the unrich, look, I have so much money that I can spend thousands of dollars on tasteless trash while you have to settle for cheap kitsch.<br><br><a href=#c8893910281516023402 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 10:14 AM</a><br><br>

As someone who attempts to specifically depict the sacredness of land and water in my artwork, his following quotes have resonated with me for the past couple of years. <br><br>“The history of art was little more than the history of man’s attempts to represent the sacred, from the animals in the first cave paintings to the dolphin frescos at Knossos, from the medieval icons to the hyperrealist angels of the baroque, from Turner’s heavenly light to van Gogh’s rain-swept villages. Art elevates us by intensifying and densifying the world. Of course, this is true only of good art; the least trace of anything awkward or amateurish, and we remain in our unelevated state, our reality of blushing, stumbling, idiotic misunderstandings and blunders. That the artists of the past century have abandoned the search for the sacred does not change what came before; it only tells us that they no longer consider the sacred to be a significant subject of investigation, that the vertical axis has been replaced by the horizontal, so that art no longer lifts us up, but turns us in.”<br><br>And…Once, Knausgaard wrote on suddenly seeing a lake in Michigan, “My eyes teared up, not because the sight was so beautiful, but because the beauty was so sudden.”<br><br><a href=#c5437807531581471422 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 11:11 AM</a><br><br>

At this point I'd put The Lord of the Rings in the same category as Gone With The Wind, a work that got its reputation because it expresses certain very popular sentiments in a way that harmonizes with certain very popular prejudices. I could be wrong, but it'll probably be for the future to decide on the status of both works.</i><br><br>Just curious, what exactly did you mean by this? Gone with the Wind was (aside from telling a wonderful soap-opera story) trying to do a specific thing, namely make the Confederacy and its ideals look good. I really can't find a similar agenda in Tolkien-indeed, Tolkien himself, in his forward, says he dislikes allegory and that his main purpose in writing LOTR was to tell an entertaining story. Sure, Tolkien was a conservative Catholic and it seeps into the story sometimes, but I don't think he was writing LOTR to promote conservative Catholicism or any other ideology. And, to me at least, what ideology is in LOTR is not intrusive-you have to read closely to find it.<br><br>Also, I'd add that having an agenda doesn't make a work not a masterpiece. Despite its message, I'd argue Gone with the Wind is part of any reasonable canon of American cinema, and the book would have the same status in any reasonable canon of Southern literature. I enjoy the story (though this is a matter of personal taste), and its message about the Civil War and the Confederacy is worth engaging with for all its un-PC-ness. Specifically, its a good pop-culture representation of how the South (and to a lesser extent, the rest of the US) viewed the Confederacy from the end of Reconstruction to around WWII. The deficiencies of that viewpoint are real and have been pointed out at length numerous times, but I personally don't think the demonization of the Confederacy that replaced it is necessarily any more helpful or accurate. But that's an arguement for another place.<br><br><a href=#c1127030353165283312 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 1:20 PM</a><br><br>

I just ask, "Was my reaction to it one that I am glad I had." Sometimes those reactions are disturbing and unpleasant, but I might be glad to have experienced them.

I have a half dozen Hakata Urasaki figures. E-Bay has quit a few, if you're unfamiliar with them. According to some things I've read, they were made expressly for GIs, in Japan, after WWII. They're usually occupational, and, often couples. They are most decidedly low brow, but I love them. Hard to find in good shape, as they are fragile. And, impossible to clean. In general, I don't pick up anything over $200. That's about my limit for something I might break. <br><br>Other things I like. Japanese prints. I've always thought Hokusai's "Great Wave" was a great metaphor for the decline of our civilization. I really like travelogues of Japan by Westerners, and have read quit a few of them.

The esoteric philosophy of music has only been an occasional interest of mine, whereas sacred geometry is something I've done pretty intensively, including long sessions with a compass, straightedge, and pen. If any readers do know of books on proportion in music, I'd be delighted to hear of them. <br><br>Esn, fair enough -- I'll have to take the time to look into that as time permits. I admit most of my exposure to Socialist Realism was by way of retro-kitsch posters in Archie McPhee's Seattle store, back when they were still in Ballard. <br><br>Ivan, I therefore state that everything is art. Since everything is art, we no longer need artists. I wonder how the producers of Conceptual Art would like that...<br><br>Bruno, exactly. As one of my commenters sensibly pointed out last week, Rome in its final years saw all kinds of frantic contests to decide which of an assortment of nonentities would become the next Emperor of the West. None of it made a bit of difference. <br><br>Sébastien, as I know precisely nothing about any of the software you've mentioned, I'll smile and nod and pretend to know what you're talking about. Interesting, though, that the same trichotomy applies to software design. As for a book version of Retrotopia, why, yes, I've already got a publisher lined up and done initial edits to the earlier post. It should be out in time for Christmas. <br><br>Eric, that's totally fascinating -- of course it's about longing for an economy in which people actually produce goods and services, rather than manipulating abstractions. Hmm -- that has political implications, about which I will have to do some serious thinking. <br><br>Trippticket, thanks for the link!<br><br>Shane, no doubt I'll do other posts on the subject of the US presidential campaign, but I'll ask everyone to remember what's written above the comment box -- <br>"Courteous, concise comments <i><b>relevant to the topic of the current week's post are welcome</b></i>" -- and leave commentary on the election to those posts, and to other forums. <br><br>DaShui, I have a hard time keeping track of what's where. I do a fair number of podcasts -- they're free publicity -- and if somebody wants to assemble a list and post it somewhere, I'll happily put up a link here. <br><br>RCW, the Chesterton quote is good. I'm less sure about your general claim -- of course the viewer brings something to the experience, but so does the experience...<br><br>WwoofBum, no, capitalism is specifically that form of economic organization in which the ownership of the means of production is mediated by market exchanges of shares of ownership and commoditized debt. It's distinct from mercantilism, feudalism, and other economic forms that are also based on private ownership of the means of production. As for art, there again, you're quite simply wrong; the extent to which art goes to the people you're calling the "guards" varies dramatically from one society to another; in societies as different as late feudal Japan and early modern Holland, for example, a very large amount of art was bought by the middle classes. If you're going to make claims about history, it really would help if you could get past the kind of simplistic generalization you've offered here, and grapple with some actual history!<br><br>Owen, well, it was just a parable, you know. If you want to film a cat barfing and call it art, by all means; get an MFA first, and surround it with a hedge of impenetrable jargon, and you may be able to make it work. <br><br>David, it's exactly because you're not a Fred Halliot that I look forward to attending your gubernatorial inauguration. ;-)<br><br><a href=#c1276427583285440535 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 6:49 PM</a><br><br>

As for abstract expressionism, I get that it was a failed attempt to speak directly to the unconscious et al.; the point I was trying to raise had less to do with the art itself and more with the bullying and snobbery that anybody outside the art world can count on facing if they point out that (a) the attempt failed and (b) a great deal of it really does look like dog barf. As for Norman Rockwell, I admire his technical proficiency and find much of his subject matter stickily sentimental to the point of gagging: the mid-20th century Middle America notion of what Middle America was or at least ought to be, folded back on itself to an almost parodic degree. <br><br>Donald, I ain't arguing -- well, except for Weird Al. Conscious parody is its own thing, and he did it brilliantly. <br><br>Avery, of course new artists and new artistic modes have been funded by elites since the days of Sumer and Old Kingdom Egypt, if not before. The social function of the fine arts has always been the manufacture of collectibles for the well-to-do. I'm not at all sure how that's relevant to any of the points I've tried to make here. <br><br>AAA, I don't know many people who would consider, say, Louis Armstrong to be highbrow trash, though there's unquestionably a fair amount of more recent jazz that would qualify as highbrow trash by my definition. Still, the point I tried to make in my discussion of the evolution and function of a canon is precisely that these categories are specific to a given culture and a given age, and arise out of the collective taste of that culture and age. Put another way, they're part of a collective conversation about the nature of aesthetic experience. When one group of people -- let's say, artists -- stop talking to the rest, or express themselves only in an invented language that's specifically designed to keep anyone else from understanding them, something has gone wrong with the conversation. That's what I'm trying to say, you know. <br><br>Farka, of course! You get highbrow art that isn't trash, but always contains an element of status signalling, and lowbrow art that isn't trash, either, but always contains an appeal to the familiar and comfortable. There's a spectrum with kitsch on one end and warhol on the other, and as with most such spectrums, the ends circle around behind the stage and get up to various activities in the dark. <br><br>William, I'd pretty much agree with you about the dystopian fiction. <br><br>Patricia, good. Yes, there is also fluff. My wife is a fan of Georgette Heyer's novels -- they're an important part of her comfort reading -- and much of it is capable fluff. Fluff has its place and its value. A lot of genre fiction is fluff, and a very good thing to read at the end of a long day when you need something familiar and fun, with just enough of a twist to keep it from getting boring. As for "chick lit" et al., I look forward to the time when people can simply deal with the fact that, by and large, men and women tend to have somewhat different tastes, and one such taste isn't intrinsically better than the other. Full disclosure: I've read some of Georgette Heyer's Regency comedies of manners, and enjoyed them, without any discernible loss of masculinity! <br><br>Martin, funny. I'd have to have been there to decide whether I'd count the machine as first-class warhol -- when your work of art is making an ironic commentary on the framing of art, we're getting into levels of recursiveness that Andy would have adored -- but it must have been something to watch.<br><br><a href=#c1967414576062909111 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 7:21 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, that's a sign. As for ways of determining the validity of art, doesn't that set of rules for evil overlords suggest that running your plan past an average ten year old child, to see if he or she can find any obvious flaws in it, is a necessity? The same may be true for art. If the child says "That looks like dog barf," it may be time to reconsider...<br><br>Johnny, I hope you do decide to record your music someday, in exactly the same spirit as you perform -- making the most intentionally awful album you possibly can, with cover art et al. to match. I'd pay for a copy.<br><br>Karen, seems to me that you're still trying to channel the dialogue into directions that don't deal with the points that I, and quite a number of commenters here, are trying to raise. What you choose to paint isn't the issue -- for all I care, you can make dog barf paintings with certified organic dog barf; it's no skin off my back. The issue is that I had a fictional character make an offhand remark about abstract art, and you and Over The Hill took it upon yourselves to come charging on here to chastise me for daring to criticize something that the art world has sanctified as Art. From there, I went into a discussion of the role of groupthink, class prejudice, and snobbery in raising barriers between the art world and everyone else. That's not a new discussion; people -- countless thousands of people -- have been trying to have it with the art world for a century now, and they've been brushed aside with the kind of language you used toward me in your first comment last week. Until a significant number of people in the art world abandon that attitude, the barriers to communication are going to stay in place...because it's not the rest of us who raised them, you know. <br><br>Dug, I've never been to Kansas City and so haven't had the chance to hear any of the music your venue is playing. If I manage it, I hope you have something other than coffee available; it gives me migraines. In the Seattle scene, back when I lived there, avant-garde jazz was the butt of constant jokes, and earned it. You'd see half a dozen bunches of guys, mostly white proto-hipsters, playing pretentious doodling noises at busking spots during the Folklife Festival, and everyone hurrying past to get to something worth a listen. Do you have something different going on? Obviously, I'm in no position to say. <br><br>Dammerung, looking at naked people of your preferred gender is the oldest tradition in art -- the Venus of Willendorf, anyone? If you want to get highbrow about it, which is a pleasant change of pace, Kenneth Clark's <i>The Nude</i> is well worth reading -- accessible to those outside the art scene, but insightful and intelligent. <br><br>RPC, no, I didn't know that. Hah! <br><br>John, funny. Book illustration is a very demanding art form, and yes, some stunningly good work has been done there. <br><br>Lewis, then I'll definitely have to read Timberg as circumstances permit.<br><br>William, I'll take your word on it.

It seems to me that when people say "I may not know art, but I know what I like," they're actually addressing this. They can't define or defend their aesthetic tastes intellectually, but aesthetic experience is not intellectual in nature. Just as you can enjoy the flavor of a beer without being able to define the chemical constituents responsible, or even identify the strain of hops that was used, the appreciation of art is distinct from its intellectual formulation. <br><br>Paddy, not so. The canon consists precisely of those works that do withstand the test of time, and I spent plenty of time trying to find magic in canvases full of dog barf back when I was still much less confident of my own tastes, and more vulnerable to the head games sketched out in my parable.<br><br><a href=#c8032620317835190836 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 7:54 PM</a><br><br>

The example that comes to mind most immediately is an odd-ball one. I just recently saw "The Devil's Rejects," a Rob Zombie horror film from the mid 20-aughts. The horror slasher is definitely a minor taste of mine; generally I only like the really truly canonical ones (think "the Haunting", "The Exorcist," "Silence of the Lambs") or the really good comedy satires (eg."Dale and Tucker vs. Evil," "The Cabin in the Woods"). I had never seen "Devil's Rejects" though I had been kind of curious about it, so a young friend brought it over the other night to show it to me. I was expecting pure lowbrow trash. But I was entranced. Sure the sadism was extreme (though the gore was actually restrained, considering the context), but the filming style was original and engrossing, the character development of both victims and evil ones was well beyond expectations, and the integration of classic 70s southern rock into the storyline was fascinating. And there were references to many of the classic films of the genra. But it stood alone as a coherent piece, not a collage, in spite of being woven from clearly identifiable canonical elements. And in the final scene, as the antiheroes' denouement is almost certainly approaching, when the opening chords of "Free Bird" appeared I gasped and laughed out loud, just amazed that he was really going to do that, AND get away with it, all while simultaneously quoting Bonnie and Clyde, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and Thelma and Louise. <br><br>So is this another category? Or is this actually what all works do, just sometimes more overtly and sometimes less so?<br><br><a href=#c2654069724949624398 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 8:06 PM</a><br><br>

I read The End of Faith, by Sam Harris. I found it slow going at first, because every sentence I was refuting his logical fallacies. For example, he equated all religion with the Abrahamic faiths, and misunderstood the faiths by fixating on the passages where they supposedly violate reality. Even as a non-believer, I can certainly see where the basis of faith is your belief and relationship to God, Jesus, or Mohammad. Either the faith and its God and prophets speak to you and you "see the light" and believe, or it doesn't, and you don't believe. Jesus turning water into wine, or God parting the Red Sea, is secondary to that. After starting out laughing out loud at the logical fallacies, the misunderstandings of religion, the apocalyptic fear mongering if we don't slay faith in its tracks, I finally just got bored with it and just wanted to be done with it. I guess it was a good exercise in challenging my thinking, because I was constantly questioning the text, "Why is he equating Abrahamic beliefs with all religion? Why is he saying that the basis of Christianity is something other than a connection to Christ? Why is he exaggerating the threat of terrorism? How can we possibly get people to stop believing in their religion?, etc"<br>I'm wondering if this qualifies as highbrow trash. As an undergraduate psych major, I assisted a professor teaching a group theory/group dynamics class. She invited a group of us to this "experiential group weekend" at UCLA. It was very much a group about nothing--a metagroup. The group existed solely to navel gaze and be all about the itself, and the dynamics that arose out of the group. It was broken down into something like Plenaries in the auditorium, large group, and small group breakout sessions. As best I can recall, you were only supposed to focus on each other in the moment, and not bring in anything not related to the group (spouses, the commute, what you had for dinner, your past, etc.) Needless to say, this is the closest I've gotten to Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Study, and it ranks right up there with one of the most bizarre and disturbing things I've ever participated in. Now, me being the (shale)disturber that I am, I'll admit that I certainly lobbed a few grenades and appreciated the effects, but there was way more to it than that. I really think it demonstrated how bad people can get/be in a void without any structure. A nasty fault line appeared based on class between the wealthier UCLA students and us poor Cal State students from the South Bay.<br>(As an aside, putting my gift as a (shale)disturber to productive use is something I hope to get from the practice of magic.)<br><br><a href=#c5866766181825813622 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 8:29 PM</a><br><br>

It was after all, Tolkein’s “life work“ started in 1914 while on hospital leave during WW1, and constantly revised, reworked, (and unfinished) until his death in 1973 at age 81. <br>I am especially moved by the opening Ainulindalë “Creation“ section in which the demi-gods literally sing the world into existence, and Melkor— “whom Ilúvatar had given the "greatest power and knowledge" of all the Ainur — broke from the harmony of the music to develop his own song. I find this creation myth so much more interesting than the one in the Christian Bible.<br>Other themes explored in other stories are Fate, Power, Pride, Loyalty, Vengence, Artiface, Immortality, and much more.<br>By casting these tales in a mythological setting, a whole created world, and being told in a kind of “high” language Tolkien has created a classic which belongs IMHO in the canon of modern English literature. <br>By contrast, The Lord OF The Rings, while a wonderful tale and much more accessible to all ages of readers, doesn’t have the depth and scope (after all its all set in a small time-span in The Third Age of Middle Earth). <br><br>I note also that Frank Herbert‘s “Dune“ gained much of its power as a story because Herbert, like Tolkien, created a whole world that stands “behind“ and informs the story.<br><br><a href=#c7550880301915149157 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 9:19 PM</a><br><br>

No, not even Tolkien. I defend to the death anyone that likes it. Different strokes for different folks. It's just not MY particular cup of tea. When asked WHY I don't particularly like fantasy, about the only thing I can come up with is that there's too many long names with too many consonants in them. :-).<br><br>It's kind of like my experience with sushi. Been there. Done that. It's ok. Same with snails. Had them twice. Once they were VERY bad and once they were VERY good. But in both cases, there are just so many other things I would rather eat. Same with books. So many books, so little time. My taste (if I can call it that) is so all over the place. I suppose I could call it "catholic" (in the worldly sense) or, eclectic. But I don't expect anyone to like, or dislike the same things I do. <br><br>But, to your question. In my very small corner of the book trade, when the Silmarillion came out, we always referred to it as the Silly-marillion. Maybe we were just fatigued by all the Tolkien hoop-la, or, that it was just a little precious. "Lost" manuscript found in Tolkien's garage after he died.

Poor tummy-aching doggie...<br><br>@ Wwoofbum, If, without rancor, you can swing by a nearby art festival and ask a few artists manning their booths about what it's like to be an artist, (or merely ask them what time they set up and break down their booth) I'd recommend it.<br><br>@ Karen, A good question! And one I will answer in perhaps, too much depth. <br><br>First, I want it to be technically proficient. I am not going to care about something that looks like a five year old did it, unless it was done by a five year old that I care about. Good balance, good composition, and whatever materials are used, well used.<br><br>Second, the artist has to actively be trying to communicate something to the audience. This doesn't even have to be deep. A lowbrow velvet painting of horsies might be saying, "hey, there are things in this world that are beautiful and free." On the other hand, one of Alexander Calder's mobiles might be saying, "Hey! This balances! Cool, huh?" <br><br>Third, art is traditionally easy on the eyes. Or at least, surviving art from virtually any time period is easy on the eyes. Maybe this is because the ugly art didn't survive, but there it is. So unless the artist has a very good reason like communicating an ugly concept, or wants to be an unfettered rebel applauded by an elite group of cutting edge trend setters, (wait a minute...) it should be easy on the eyes.<br><br>When all three aspects are combined, you have a skilled artist meeting their audience halfway with things that are pleasurable to run your eyes over. It's a gesture of respect to the audience, and people need very little education to pick up on this. It gives people the opportunity to connect if they're willing.<br><br>However, a lot of art these days fails on all three counts. When you step into a gallery, and see something that looks slapped together by a five-year-old, and the most polite and meaningful message you can charitably imagine the artist saying is, "yeah... I wanted to see what a badly painted blue wall would look like and am astonished that I got paid for it." then people have no reason to give a flying rats rear end.<br><br>Regarding the nuts and bolts of style, color, subject matter, etc, that's really up to the artist, depending on where their skill and desire lies.<br><br>And I'll break this into two posts, focusing on my general reflections to Mr. Greer's original post in my second.<br><br><a href=#c1722573973765652301 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 9:51 PM</a><br><br>

My newest work is called 'Watering Can' which I'm fashioning out of copper sheet, annealed refrigeration pipe, and lead free solder. Given the hours and materials I couldn't sell it and profit for a dime under $200, but it'll look mighty nice sitting on my bathroom toilet tank, and it'll keep my plants hydrated. If my sister asks very nicely, she can have 'Watering Can II' for Christmas. But I do miss the art world a little. So if the SF MOMA wants one too, I'll break my 'no commission' rule, and even drill holes in the bottom for a small surcharge of $9800.<br><br><a href=#c2509195814920731935 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 9:56 PM</a><br><br>

One commenter notes that they've never met an elite or an academic in the arts who actually likes Modern Art (capital M for distinction). I couldn't agree more - it's been 40 years since "dog barf" art was de rigueur. Many art kids still get jazzed by abstract painting, but that's mostly because it's fun to make, not because it's something you can build a career on.<br><br>Your sneer at elitism is welcome, and again, feels true, but that's not why early Modern artists got into abstraction. Quite the opposite. Modern artists from the early part of the twentieth century were more generally working toward creating an art that was universally understandable. The idea that you could put anyone in front of a canvas and have a universally similar gut-level reaction was very seductive and popular. Kandinsky and synesthesia, Motherwell and war, Newman and existential angst. These guys were trying not for something that was elitist and exclusionary, but rather something universal. Andy Warhol's great contribution was to show how completely compromised that vision was because of the way Modern Art got coopted by the elite class - that in fact, commercial art did a much better job of being a universally understood artistic language. <br><br>You kind of land in the same place, but there is something important in not oversimplifying the path. The path is important, because lots and lots of thing suffer this same fate - beginning with something marvelous and true and aspirational. But you know, when you're an artist - it's not like you have much capital outside the world of people and institutions that can afford to support you, so you have gallery shows, hip after-parties at loft studios, you work to curry favor with taste-makers, and essentially, your living becomes dependent on those with money, and so your work becomes part of that exclusiveness. Warhol understood that better than anyone. <br><br>As a small farmer coming from the art world, we are very aware that the food we grow costs more than the commercial products you can find in the grocery, and so our livelihood is in danger of following a similar trajectory. It's very frustrating. Our food is definitely better, and I think worth it, but not getting swooped up in elitist cycles is hard when you want to do anything artisinal.<br><br><a href=#c8573840947135084111 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 10:12 PM</a><br><br>

Tolkien, like Mitchell, marshalled a mass of common Anglo-American cultural tropes, some old, some very new -- consider the vibe that the phrase "the Enemy" had in the immediate wake of the Second World War! -- and used them to construct a morality play favoring a particular set of cultural politics: his were monarchist, reactionary, agrarian, hierarchical, and those pervade the plot, structure, and language of the book. That was hugely popular, especially in the US, where a lot of people have highly idealized notions about monarchy et al. Just as <i>Gone With The Wind</i> has nothing like the immense cultural cachet it had seventy years ago, I'm far from sure that <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> will have even its present clout -- much less what it had in the 1960s and 1970s! -- in another thirty or forty years.

As it happens, I share Peter Carr's dislike of certain kinds of abstract art, but -- to borrow another detail from the plot -- I certainly know who Robert Louis Stevenson is! I should someday do a character who likes the abstract expressionists, and can babble artspeak with the best of them, just to mess with the heads of the overly literal. <br><br>Space Seeder, we'll get there. <br><br>Bill, excellent! Yes, and that's a crucial point: aesthetic experience is not rational. It's not intellectual. It's generally very hard to verbalize, which is one of the reasons that art criticism is an art in itself. Again, when people say "I don't know art, but I know what I like," they're pointing to this reality: "Art" as a theoretical construct currently guarded against hoi polloi behind a fence of jargon is one thing; aesthetic experience is something else again, and you don't need a degree to have it. <br><br>Howard, probably true, but I'm afraid we're stuck with the word for the time being. <br><br>Ed-M, fascinating. Compare that to the fine mosaic work Roman culture achieved at its height, and yes, certain comparisons do come to mind. <br><br>MickGSpot, well, feel free to discuss Frank Frazetta art if you like! <br><br>AAA, the phenomenon's not unique, nor did I say it was. It's simply unusually visible due to certain details of the way art is produced and marketed these days. I'm sure that Baroque painters, say, were just as convinced of the ineffable superiority of their own understanding of art, but they had to produce things that appealed to their patrons, few of whom could be convinced to accept dog barf. In fact, I suspect a general rule can be proposed here: art flourishes when it has to take the tastes of non-artists into account, and it languishes in self-referential isolation when it does not have to do so. <br><br>Avalterra, I look forward to it! <br><br>Tabatha, if it works for you, it works. <br><br>Pygmycory, fair enough.

I've noticed that habit in many monotheists, for what it's worth -- everything has to have one overarching whatsit behind it, even when that model clearly doesn't work well. <br><br>MawKernewek, works for me -- for several years now I've considered string theory a kind of postmodernist physics, which enmacts the abstract role of being a physical theory without doing the thing that physical theories are supposed to do, i.e., produce testable hypotheses. <br><br>Sven, that's funny, in a Conanesque sort of way. Thank you. The trolls, though, seem to be staying under their bridges and grumbling to each other. <br><br>Zach, obviously I disagree. I'd start by pointing out that aesthetic experience is nonrational, and so any set of criteria you come up with is by definition an intellectual model of a nonrational phenomenon -- thus it reflects only at secondhand the phenomenon it claims to express, and focusing on criteria takes you away from focusing on the art itself. I'd point out that formal criteria inevitably lend themselves to rule lawyering -- which of course was an important part of Andy Warhol's wicked stock in trade. I'd also point out that any given proposed set of criteria will be just as contested, just as much in flux, and just as unfair as the canon it's supposed to govern -- after all, it's not being handed down by God on high the way Nestorian would suggest, it's simply the expression of the infinitely fallible taste of a particular group of people, belonging to a particular culture, at a particular era. <br><br>I suggest, rather, that the canon comes first and any intellectualizing concerning it derives from the canon, not vice versa. How does the canon emerge? By an evolutionary process to which countless individual aesthetic judgments contribute. You mention <i>Don Quixote</i>; that's part of the canon, and deservedly so, because millions of readers down through the centuries have delighted in it, learned from it, and treasured it. Like evolution, that process is flawed and unfair; like evolution, it results in any number of oddities -- but it's all we have to go on, because there's no other source; any attempt to legislate a canon or to impose a specific set of criteria ultimately boils down to someone's inevitably partial and flawed aesthetic judgments. <br><br>So by all means come up with whatever set of criteria reflect your own aesthetic judgments, as you've done, but I'd encourage you not to fall into the trap of mistaking the derived criteria for the experience that creates them. <br><br>Onething, er, done what? <br><br>Emmanuel, you might try some of the other buzzwords. "Abraham Lincoln" plus "critical theory" might get you somewhere. <br><br>Patricia, you will not hear a whisper of disagreement from me. Your description of the classic Mexican meal made my mouth water, and I had a very good dinner!<br><br>Hubertus, that's a very simplistic rewriting of what I said, you know. <br><br>Jeanne, that's the kind of awful Wagner staging that I referred to parenthetically a couple of Retrotopia episodes ago. As Carr noted, there's room for one and only one gargantuan ego in a Wagnerian opera production, and it's Wagner's; add a second and it just gets goofy. <br><br>Greg, truly said. It astonishes me that nobody draws the obvious conclusion...<br><br><a href=#c507037785393192093 title="comment permalink">8/11/16, 11:41 PM</a><br><br>

Enjoy the smorgasbord! <br><br>Bill, that's a valid point, and it relates to a different dichotomy, the one between eras of exploration and eras of performance in art. To borrow Carr's terminology, the notional space of the slasher film is pretty much full up; there isn't much you can do with a straight slasher film that hasn't already been done, or close enough. That marks the end of the era of exploration and the beginning of the era of performance. Straight-up remakes are one kind of performance, but so are homages, pastiches, inversions, and the like. The sort of creative homage you've described is a great example of a constructive response to a situation in which everybody in the theater has already seen plenty of slasher films, and that becomes part of the raw material with which the artist works. <br><br>Emmanuel, I've seen serious deconstructive analyses in lit-crit that weren't all that far from what you've just done! <br><br>Shane, excellent. Yes, by the way, that's very nearly the apotheosis of highbrow academic trash, of which there is of course an ample supply. (One of my friends, who's a university professor, tells me that when she was in grad school the running joke was to reference a paper entitled "Derrida on the Body." There was so much warhol on that subject at that time that everyone would crack up.) <br><br>Dug, duly noted. I've literally never been in the middle of the country -- west coast, bits of the east coast, bits of the north coast, that's all -- so I'll keep you in mind; by all means post something here when the coffee shop and jazz venue reopens. <br><br>August, thank you! Now there's a blast from the past...<br><br>Jcummings, I don't doubt that at all. I did meet quite a few academics, when I was first in college, who claimed to adore abstract expressionism -- but maybe that was pure chance. (I suspect that many people who now claim not to like it started saying so the moment it dropped out of fashion, and raved about it fifteen minutes beforehand.) The takeaway point I hope readers will get from this is to trust their own aesthetic experience, and not allow pretentious purveyors of dog barf to talk them into trusting someone else's eyes instead. That plus attention to a canon, it seems to me, will help lay the foundation for the kind of aesthetic culture that will be needed when the current Borborygmist scene winds down, as it will. <br><br>Jbucks, thank you.

Christenson:<br><br> Desmond Morris, a primatologist, wrote a book about apes making art, The Biology of Art, in 1963, at the height of the boom in Abstract Expressionist painting. People who took their sketchbooks to the zoo to draw the animals noticed that the chimps and gorillas seemed extremely interested in getting their hands on the art supplies. Morris looked into this, and ended up observing the artist careers of a number of individual apes. They did indeed make drawings and paintings, which had affinities to the current fashions in the art galleries of the moment. <br><br>Initially, the apes were avid to make their “art;” it was obviously a form of play that engaged them very deeply. They were fascinated by the process of making marks on paper and looking at the result. They had a clear sense of when a work was finished or not; they resented having a work taken out of their hands before they felt it was done; and they also resented being asked to continue working on something after they had decided it was finished. A development in their work could be observed, as they became familiar with the process. <br><br>As soon as the experimenters started rewarding the apes with food, to encourage them to produce artwork [maybe the market for it had become evident!], the apes began to dash off quick and desultory “works” in order to get the banana as quickly as possible. Eventually they all became disgusted, lost their interest in the activity, and refused to do it anymore. <br><br> I think this has a direct relevance to the art world in human civilization!<br><br><br><a href=#c6745633168368138688 title="comment permalink">8/12/16, 6:00 AM</a><br><br>

It is a beautiful book packed with good information (and a great appendix). I will note that of the two parts on music, the first one is more about the fundamental reality, while the second is more about the way music theory is taught in Western academies, and may be less useful (in particular, it sticks to the 12 equally-tempered piano notes). The book doesn't cover everything there is (it leans on the Greek &amp; Western traditions), but it has great diagrams and is a great introduction.<br><br>Next, a website:<br><a href="http://www.sacred-geometry.es/?q=en/content/proportion-musical-scales" rel=nofollow>Sacred Geometry</a>, "Proportion in Musical Scales"<br>It starts simple enough, but gets more complex. This article relies heavily on Maria Renold's book "Intervals, Scales, Tones and the Concert Pitch c = 128 Hz" (a good book, but definitely for the dedicated knowledge-seeker), which itself relies heavily on Kathleen Schlesinger's 1939 book "<a href=https://archive.org/details/KathleenSchlesingerTheGreekAulos rel=nofollow>The Greek Aulos</a>".<br><br>To hear how these different proportions sound, I recommend using the <a href=http://brandlew.com/2016/02/24/introducing-the-harmonic-7th-chord-in-just-intonation/ rel=nofollow>Online Terpstra Keyboard</a>. E.g., here are my settings for the <a href="http://www.brandlew.com/keyboard/keys.htm?fundamental=704&amp;right=-1&amp;upright=-5&amp;size=35&amp;rotation=343.863&amp;instrument=rhodes&amp;enum=false&amp;equivSteps=12&amp;no_labels=false&amp;spectrum_colors=false&amp;fundamental_color=41FF2E&amp;scale=8%2F9%0A8%2F10%0A8%2F11%0A8%2F12%0A8%2F13%0A8%2F14%0A8%2F15%0A8%2F16&amp;names=8%2F8%0A8%2F9%0A8%2F10%0A8%2F11%0A8%2F12%0A8%2F13%0A8%2F14%0A8%2F15%0A8%2F16%0A%C2%ACe_colors=47A2FF%0AFFE496%0AFFC37D%0A47A2FF%0AFFE496%0AFFC37D%0A47A2FF%0A47A2FF%0AFFC37D%0A" rel=nofollow>Ancient Greek Aulos modes</a> found by Schlesinger.<br><br>From a comment I left at the "Online Terpstra" link:<br>---<br>"Apparently, there were two competing tuning systems in Ancient Greece. The one most familiar to us is the “Pythagorean”, used by lyre players, and the basis of medieval European music theory. It was based on perfect fifths [this one is described in "Quadrivium"]. A rather different one was used by aulos players, which was forgotten in Western Europe but apparently survived in many other cultures. It was based on undertones (the Greek aulos had equidistant fingering holes).<br><br>There were 7 possible modes, depending on which low note you start with, moving up. Modes can contain either the 8/14 or 8/15 degree, but not both. If your mode starts on:<br>-8/8 or 8/9, you must skip 8/14 as you move up<br>-8/14, you must skip 8/15 as you move up<br>-any other note, you can choose EITHER 8/14 or 8/15 to skip as you move up<br>-(a scale cannot begin on 8/15)<br><br>The modes are associated with celestial objects, from bottom to top:<br>8/8 = Saturn (Hypodorian)<br>8/9 = Jupiter (Hypophrygian)<br>8/10 = Mars (Hypolydian)<br>8/11 = Sun (Dorian)<br>8/12 = Venus (Phrygian)<br>8/13 = Mercury (Lydian)<br>8/14 = Moon (Mixolydian)<br>(this is the also the order of how fast these celestial objects appear to move in the night sky. See p. 304 in “Quadrivium” by Wooden Books)<br><br>The Sun mode was most common. The link above has the fundamental 8/8 tuned at 176*4=704, which allows the 1st note of the Sun mode (8/11) to be tuned at 128Hz (a common tuning back then).<br><br>Note that the Sun mode (particularly if you use 8/14 instead of 8/15) sounds like the whole tone scale of Debussy, etc. The Saturn mode sounds like the scales used in a lot of Middle Eastern music. The Jupiter mode sounds like the Misheberakh/Hungarian/Ukrainian Dorian scales.<br><br>(cont...)<br><br><a href=#c7172591901213994867 title="comment permalink">8/12/16, 6:43 AM</a><br><br>

Well, from the 10,000 ft. view I'd say it started out lowbrow, as did most of Mark Twain's books, with the characters speaking in a "common" (i.e. lower class) dialect and mostly being about kids acting as ruffians. As it turned out he struck a chord regarding race (likely by accident as opposed to design) and it was subsequently banned which gave it highbrow appeal. Now it has the misfortune of being labeled a "classic", which means kids and adults alike assume it is boring and difficult reading.

For example, see <i>Roots of the Classical: The Popular Origins of Western Music</i> by Peter Van der Merwe. Quoting from the abstract: "From the Middle Ages to the early 20th century, Western ‘art’ music has grown out of, and drawn on, popular models. [...] Again and again simple patterns have been refined and elaborated, eventually to the point of decadence, whereupon the search begins anew for further raw folk-stuff."<br><br>This has also been the prevailing view in Russian musicology (and other fields) from the late 19th century onwards (see footnote 3 on pp. 171-172 of <a href=http://www.academia.edu/14955197/Russian_Folk_Traditions_in_Contemporary_Musical_Literature_for_Winds_Analysis_and_Composition_in_the_Musical_Languages_of_Russian_Vocal_Folk_Polyphony_As_Described_by_Aleksandr_Kastalskiy_Russian_Village_Accordion_Repertoire_and_Soviet_Tourist_Traveller_Bard_Songs rel=nofollow>my thesis</a>)<br><br>I also think that you're overlooking the huge role that <i>technology</i> plays in the development of new art. At least in music. Simply put: when a new musical instrument is invented, new artistic forms follow. Look at the invention of the synthesizer in the last century and what that led to, the sequencer (videogame music), the vocoder (past decade). In an earlier era, the 19th century arrival of the harmonica greatly changed American folk music. The invention of valved brass instruments greatly changed military music. In Russia, the invention of the accordion in the early 1820s-1830s, with its standardized chords and single-line melody, in due time changed the dominant character and style of Russian folk music, replacing many traits of older traditions that used older musical instruments that now found themselves on the sidelines. Kathleen Schlesinger notes in "The Greek Aulos" how the physical characteristics of the double and single reed instruments used by Egyptians and Greeks were responsible for the scales they used in their music. For example, she believes that when double-reeds were used, an octave used two <i>different</i> tetrachords (four-note groups) based on the undertone series, but the switch from double to single reeds allowed any tetrachord to be repeated at the 3:2 interval above the lowest note by biting the reed and making the instrument go higher. This physical characteristic of the instruments led, in due time, to the structure of the Church modes and our major scale. Another example: equal-tempered tuning of pianos allowed jazz progressions through minor thirds (which would have sounded very ugly before), at the same time as older keyboard music (using different tunings) became less attractive.<br><br>I will also note, from personal experience as a composer: when I pick up a new instrument and try to create some new melody on it, the melodies that come naturally to different instruments vary considerably.<br><br>So, if you don't like the dominant music of your era - inventing a new popular instrument that easily plays the type of music you do like would be the quickest way to change things!<br><br><a href=#c2444944389974087246 title="comment permalink">8/12/16, 8:31 AM</a><br><br>

They don't exactly fit into your categories, but one can be both high and low brow.<br><br>The classic is the easiest: a copy of the statue of Marcus Aurelius (http://250.brown.edu/marcus-aurelius-statue). The original was on the Capitoline Hill in Rome, and served as an example of <i>virtu</i> in the ruler, far more honored in the absence through the centuries. When erected in 1908, I imagine a Brown education included reading the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. More importantly, I assume the statue was remind the students that they were being educated as the ruling class of the new Empire. This was also at a time when public sculpture still had a language which was understood by most people, a language which went back nearly three millennia.<br><br>The highbrow is next: the Slavery Memorial, by Martin Puryear (https://www.brown.edu/about/public-art/index.php?q=martin-puryear-slavery-memorial). It was installed after Brown went through a public self flagellation over the source of the wealth which caused the former Rhode Island College to change it's name to honor a major donor. The sculpture is a massive ball and chain, the ball mostly buried, and the chain cut through. The surfaces are rusted steel, except a highly polished surface where the chain is cut through. The message is obvious: “We have faced up to our past sins, and we erect this memorial to ensure we never sin again.” There is an additional message in the severed chain: Brown has freed itself from the sins of the past, and can now go forth unburdened into the future. I don't think Brown wants to recognize that second message.<br><br>The last is definitely in the Warhol canon: the Untitled (Lamp/Bear) by Urs Fischer (http://www.providencejournal.com/storyimage/PJ/20160703/NEWS/160709801/AR/0/AR-160709801.jpg&amp;MaxW=650). It is on loan for 5 years from a hedge fund manager who also was suckered into buying Damien Hirst's shark in formaldehyde. The 20' high blue plush bear (actually bronze) is leaning against a desk lamp which slices through its head. The Brown Committee on Public Art states: 'Untitled (Lamp/Bear) is from a series of works that explore what the artist calls “the inner mechanics of duality.” '. My sense is that in the duality of the artist's intentions and the purchaser's wallet, the artist will find the wallet to plunder. The only message I get from the sculpture is that study will destroy your childhood. <br><br>On a final note, the Brown Committee on Public Art doesn't give any explanation for any sculpture on the campus installed earlier than a Henry Moore sculpture from 1963.<br><br><a href=#c2415094287310789552 title="comment permalink">8/12/16, 8:58 AM</a><br><br>

My days have a strong music element rather than visual arts. Though when we're in DC I do love to go to the natural history museum and see the archaeology exhibits. The ancients knew how to decorate, lol.<br><br>Looking around my office my stuff on the walls runs the gamut from a couple of prints that would fall into the motivational poster category, calendars cut up and the artwork side framed (great way to get prints of stuff you could never afford in real life...), some nicer things we got at the Woodland Arts Fair (Lexington) and the St James Art Fair (Louisville) which are both juried, a few pieces by local artists. The items that I have that are highbrow-ish I only got by accident, so to speak. The wife of one well known local photographer was a colleague of mine on the board of a non-profit. The other, Margorie Guyon (national and international recognition) gave me a large oil on canvas piece and several small prints at ridiculously low prices because I set up her bookkeeping for her and kept it straight for a couple of years. <br><br>I pick things because I like the colors, basically. That's it.<br><br>In the low brow arena: My boys enjoyed a steady diet of Mel Brooks, Monty Python and Weird Al growing up...which I don't think was a disservice at all. I think it gave them a good foundation, believe it or not. Of course, regarding music they also listened to a lot of Vivaldi, Handel et al, Celtic &amp; folk, movie soundtracks, "new age" instrumentals, and ethnic music of all sorts from around tbe globe - especially middle eastern / Sephardic, and yes, klezmer.<br><br>They saw all the classic and popular sci-fi and fantasy movies, and we have an extensive library of classic children's books and adult non-fiction (Economics especially). <br><br>Speaking of soundtracks, go to Pandora online and search for "skyrim elder scrolls" and what you will get is a channel that plays movie soundtracks and video game theme music that is as good if not better than lots of the stuff played by modern composers at the local universities. It pays everything from kitchy Raiders if the Lost Ark and Legend of Zelda to cinematic Lord of the Rings type works. If you like techno music, try the Tron channel or the Daft Punk channel, and you'll hear things like classically trained violinist Lindsay Sterling playing with an electronica band... Nowhere near high brow but great to listen to while cleaning house. When I need something soothing so as not to consider bludgeoning clients who brings me a big mess to fix, Secret Garden or Enya works great. To hear my favorite soundtrack piece at the moment, go to https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJTMeytTWw<br><br>None of this other than the classical music is high brow of course. The Vivaldi channel plays Baroque era music of all sorts, and that is one of my favorite channels. I have numerous CDs as well for when the internet gets too expensive. I do wonder what will happen to music in general - the younger generation won't pay for it or buy CDs anymore. Not even cover charges at local pubs, as a friend of mine in a local band told me. And the bar owners don't want to pay the bands any reasonable fees, either. It does cost money to buy instruments, and time to come music and practice. Local bands are having a hard time here. The one big local venue, Thursday Night Live, only plays bands that do covers of popular music. They can mix in a few original pieces, but they have to be the same style as the covers. There is no venue, really, for non-rock/pop music at all except an Irish pub that sometimes played Celtic. The isn't even a jazz bar anymore! Even the local opera house had succumbed to showing mostly modern productions, not classics or anything in the classical style. It's a wasteland out here.<br><br><a href=#c7299325705595422001 title="comment permalink">8/12/16, 9:17 AM</a><br><br>

One last quote from Timberg's "Culture Crash: The Killing of the Creative Class." And, no, I don't have any connection with the author or own stock in the publishing company :-). It's just one of those chances that the book resonates so much, given this weeks topic.<br><br>"For all the ups and downs of culture and the creative class, an old classical idea, dressed in different vestments each century, persisted: that drama, poetry, music, and art were not just a way to pass the time, or advertise one's might, but a path to truth and enlightenment. At its best, this was what the middlebrow consensus promised. Middlebrow said that culture was accessible to a wide strata of society, that people needed some but not much training to appreciate it, that there was a canon worth knowing, that art was not the same as entertainment, that the study of the liberal arts deepens you, and that those who make, assess, and disseminate the arts were somehow valuable for our society regardless of their impact on the GDP. Today, every one of those statements goes against our post-industrial, technocratic grain." <br><br>Another book worth looking at for anyone in a "creative" position, budding or established, is JoAnneh Nagler's "How to Be an Artist Without Losing Your Mind, Your Shirt, or Your Creative Compass: A Practical Guide." (2016). <br><br>And, off topic, but you're always saying how reasonable the real estate prices are in your town (Cumberland, Maryland?). Well, I finally got around to taking a look. Oh, my gosh. Wonderful older homes for $20,000 or less. Property taxes of $25 or less? How do they do that? If I were younger and not as well established .... It looks like an ideal place to live, especially if you have some kind of independent source of income.

And it has a sequel, which is completely gross.<br><br>Classic: Greek, Roman, Renaissance, baroque, Neoclassical and Victorian sculpture. Examples are: <i>Julius Caesar</i>, 1st C. bce, Michaelangelo's <i>David</i>, Donatello's <i>David</i>, etc.<br><br>Lowbrow: Those cheap plaster or plastic statuary that can only be found in mom-and-pop Italian restaurants (the good kind, not the pizza joints) in working class neighborhoods. Also the god-awful dreck in Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum and the like, and also in Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas. Are we sure it isn't TRUMP Caesar's palace???<br><br>Domestic Architecture:<br><br>Highbrow: Philip Johnston's glass house in Connecticut.<br><br>Classic: Monticello, Mt. Vernon, Beacon Hill town houses.<br><br>Lowbrow: Split-entry or raised ranch homes (what another commenter called split-level ranch houses), US urban row-houses built for the lower classes in the 19th Century and are now falling into ruin.<br><br>Town Planning:<br><br>Highbrow: Le Corbusier's <i>Radiant City</i>, Frank Lloyd Wright's <i>Broadacre City</i>.<br><br>Classic: Welwyn Garden City, colonial Savannah, colonial Philadelphia, Washington DC, some New Urbanist towns that have thrived like Seaside, FL.<br><br>Lowbrow: The endless 19th C.

It was Roy's work that essentially defined Pop Art.<br><br>Lowbrow: Early newspaper comics, comicbooks (before they became graphic novels!)<br><br>Propaganda/Advertising:<br><br>Highbrow: Wang Guangyi (Harbin 1957) <i>Great Criticism - Coca Cola (green)</i>. Combines the iconic logo with Socialist Realism, ex., Soviet icons holding Mao's little book.<br><br>Classic: The Coca-Cola logo itself. 'Nuff said.<br><br>Lowbrow: Early Coca-Cola advertising.

I work just a 10 minute walk from the AGO in Toronto, so I spend a lot of lunch-hours there on my unlimited-access membership. It makes all the difference in the world to be able to spend a whole half-hour gazing at a single cabinet of objects, carefully examining each one, or a single wall of paintings, or even a single painting. And no TV screens. So I've already been doing your homework, as it were. <br>I bathe in the masterworks of the 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, &amp; early 20th Centuries and then, after about 1910, most art degenerates into something visually ugly. Apparently wealth is no immunity from gullibility.<br>I decided when I was very young that modern art was crap and nothing since, not being 'educated', nor being exposed to lots of it, nor yet having it 'explained' to me, has caused me to change my opinion. Stephen Pinker's book "The Blank Slate" explained how this doctrine produced, amongst many other aspects of late 20th Century life, "...art without form or beauty, and architecture without decoration or human scale..."<br>I had some glee a couple of years back when it was revealed that the Tate and most modern galleries that pushed this crap into the world were secretly funded through proxies by the CIA as anti-soviet propaganda to demonstrate how 'free' we were in the west versus the 'controlled' (i.e. tasteful) art behind the iron curtain. That's where the money came from to pay outrageous sums for piles of tires in a public square. I giggled a lot over that.<br>Books and writers like Tom Wolfe's "The Painted Word" helped me conceive of why I appreciate the art and formulated my own, idiosyncratic idea of what qualifies as art.<br>Art requires three things: first, it requires knowledge - knowledge of the materials and medium should be evident in the work, what works, what produces a desired effect. Second, it requires discipline - the discipline to learn the craft, to learn to use the tools, to develop ability evident in the skillful use of the tools. As you say, anyone can throw a sponge of paint at a canvas and produce a splatter, but to apply paint with a brush to produce a particular effect requires the discipline and patience to learn how to do it well. Third, art requires some imagination and this is where the whole art-theory business gets bogged down and sinks into the morass of self-delusion that characterizes modern painting - smears of colour or paint-by-numbers canvases or 'found objects' glued to an old board - as "art." Just because it is imaginative does not make it art, art requires evidence of the other two pieces of the tripod.<br><br><a href=#c6511844276109702381 title="comment permalink">8/12/16, 1:56 PM</a><br><br>

Based on the back cover and forward, I decided that given Rushdie’s background, I probably wouldn’t understand most of the author’s polemics on religion without having much more familiarity with Islam than I do, so I read the Qu’Ran. There were enough moments of slamming it shut and having to go do something else from all the passages about polytheists and how they’re going to hell to fit the bill (although there really wasn’t anything in the entire thing worse than the sort of stuff that you run across in the writings of the average Great Awakening figure). However, there were other aspects of reading that made it quite rewarding. The poetry was beautifully composed, following a gorgeous spiral ring structure, And the richness to the lore and storytelling, as well as some of the laments, prayers, and praises scattered throughout, and I was particularly intrigued by the extra dimensions that the presence of the Djinn led to the cosmology. It also actually (contrary to what one might expect from the way our culture views Islam,) is much more geared towards inter-faith cooperation than modern Christianity is, since the world it’s emerging from is the multi-cultural world of the early byzantine, and treats the other monotheistic religions of the region as equals so long as they follow the teachings of their prophets and treat Muslims with respect, and despite the condemnation of pagans, it still insists on treating them with respect so long as they behave honorably, with the only actual encouragement of violence being within the context of defense and retaliation.<br><br><a href=#c202025283702753664 title="comment permalink">8/12/16, 2:21 PM</a><br><br>

Going back to the discussion on Wagner in Retrotopia a few weeks ago, you had Carr expressing the point of view that one of the great things about Wagner was that he experimented and pushed boundaries while there were still boundaries to push, and it worked. The more notional space gets filled within a cultural form, meanwhile, the more closely the likelihood of achieving success through experimentation resembles the likelihood of winning the lottery, so that you eventually go over the top into the sort of self-referential nonsense that we’re discussing: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG16ZjxJTMw.)<br>However, there’s a lot of grey space in the middle where there’s some room for personal taste (to continue on the opera thread, for instance, I’ve noticed that Phillip Glass is a polarizing figure with some people liking his work and others seeing it as falling well into the pretentious trash category). Meanwhile, I’m under the impression that within the fantasy genre, you’d probably classify Harry Potter as lowbrow trash, while other people see it as solid popular literature, and still others may regard it as a potential future classic that may one day stand alongside the Oz books. My impression is that most modern literature falls into this category, divided between the high art and the popular entertainments of a culture. <br><br>Within that, though, there’s a wide grey area between kitsch and Warhol, a lot of that trash may fall within that realm of on one hand entertainment that might never be high art, and might even be trashy to some people, but that’s still solid entertaining reading, and on the other hand a lot of work that might not be highbrow trash, but might nonetheless be something of an acquired taste that looks an awful lot like highbrow trash who those who aren’t interested. And the classics, and canon of a culture come out of both realms, mostly decided by the process of cultural selection that we call legacy. Perhaps I’m still thinking about the same sort of thing but just having something that is giving me a knee-jerk visceral reaction of calling anything trash unless it’s infamously bad, or falls into the categories of smut or hate speech. Final thought: it seems to me that the low-brow clichés also touch onto the level of consciousness that folklore comes out of, and is very close to the soul of the culture. Which means that it’s really the low-brow trash that sows the seeds of the future.<br><br>Anyway, as for my homework reading (I’m not sure I can bring myself to calling anything trash, but I will go with generic lowbrow pop literature, and high brow experimental literature), I think I’ll go with the sword and sorcery fantasy genre. My three books will be:<br><br>A Terry Brooks Shannara novel as my low brow<br>A Michael Moorcock Elric novel as my high brow<br>And Well at Worlds End, by William Morris as my classic.<br><br>I actually haven’t read any of those, despite one being the classic that kicked off fantasy literature as a genre, one being the series that created the generic pop fantasy genre (read: low brow trash), and one being the series that shook up generic fantasy fiction and kicked it in an experimental direction from the author who helped kick off the New Wave movement (read: high brow trash).<br><br><br><br><a href=#c2752579381033500104 title="comment permalink">8/12/16, 2:26 PM</a><br><br>

I'm interested in encouraging individuals to develop a clear personal sense of aesthetic and intellectual taste." I have thought about your response in the context of a drive through my detroit neighborhood where a lot of defacement has occurred and where signs of decay are everywhere. Then I asked myself, is this ugly? Why do I live here? When I began to think about what I was looking at in a way that separated what I was looking at from adjectives such as "decay" "disorder" "defacement" I began to see it in a different way. By asking us to develop a "clear" personal sense of aesthetic and intellectual taste, are you asking us to freeze our perception? Doesn't aesthetic evolve in response to associations between what we see and what we feel? While admire the technical skill (craft) of the dutch masters, I personally find very little artistic value in the portrait of some dead member of the aristocracy. All that tells me is that the artist was a skilled prostitute working for the wealthy and advantaged. He really didn't have anything of value to say about the living conditions of the time. In contrast, consider the early modernist critique of art and architecture and their association of decorated building facades with aristocracy and facism. They sought to get to the basic truths-the primary colors of the DeStijl movement were a failed antidote to Hitler who hated their work and much preferred the works of the classicists. Obviously, modernism has also developed its own cult followings and has evolved into various styles that are often followed blindly. The true genius of art is usually found in the avante garde who are constantly pushing the limits and trying to tell us something about the world we live in. Isn;t it ironic that the DeStijl movement died when it became a style? This is the destiny of true art. Once it has delivered its message, it is time to move on to a new language yet to be discovered. This will drive a shift in aesthetic. As a soon to be architect (one more test to pass before I obtain my license), I find it interesting to listen to commentary on building styles. What I take away from these discussions is that that style does not have as much impact on how someone feels about a building as what they think. The essence of a good building seems to hinge more upon how it feels-scale, interaction with the street, interaction with light, shadow etc. have far more impact on building perception than applied ornamentation. Perhaps these are the "universal truths" that can help us to develop a mature aesthetic but I would argue that they are only about as influential in aesthetic preference as DNA is to our behavior.<br><br><a href=#c7546759107708869466 title="comment permalink">8/12/16, 2:27 PM</a><br><br>

When isolated cultures that have not had any interaction with western music are subjected to chords that western people find harmonious vs. chores that are viewed as disonant, non-western people have far less preference for the harmonious chords than a member of the western culture. This suggests that aesthetic is completely arbitrary. If I understand correctly, you are suggesting that the natural state of a human is to live within a single culture and that this allows for social cohesion and a unified aesthetic opinion.<br><br><a href=#c8574010395675210930 title="comment permalink">8/12/16, 2:34 PM</a><br><br>

I seem to recall that Lessing did this with her whole Canopus in Argos series. Mind you, she also had one of them turned into a Philip Glass opera, which could be taken as another touchstone! <br><br>Sebastien, you're most welcome. It's in the works. <br><br>Patricia, I'll keep that in mind. I haven't tackled Renauit yet, and I probably should. <br><br>KKalbert, hmm! Yes, that does make sense, doesn't it? <br><br>Phil, the experiences are what it's all about. Opinions, analyses, criticism, categories -- that's all secondary, and should not be allowed to get in the way of the direct experience.<br><br>Mustard, that's what happens when you prop up a society with vast cash inflows from a nonrenewable resource. Saudi Arabia may get to witness similar scenes shortly. <br><br>Esn, thank you! I can second the recommendation of <i>Quadrivium</i> -- the little book on sacred geometry included in it, <i>Sacred Geometry</i> by Miranda Lundy, is the first thing I recommend to anyone interested in that art. I wonder if you've considered writing a good general book for the nonspecialist on proportion and the like in music -- place it with the right small-to-middling publisher, and I think it could do very well indeed. <br><br>Shane, it was a running joke when I was in college that everybody in the psych program desperately needed a shrink, and the professors needed straitjackets and a padded cell.<br><br>Unknown, funny.

As for the art analysis -- nicely done. <br><br>Ahavah, I've heard from a number of young people about paying for music. Some of them have a bad case of entitlement, and think that everything should be free because they want it. On the other hand, I've also had kids talk about how empty today's music is in comparison with that of previous decades -- "Why can't we have music as good as you did when you were growing up?" is something I've heard more than once. Here in Cumberland, the bands that draw the crowds are tribute bands. I see this as one more sign that the notional space is full up and performance, not exploration, is now the order of the day.<br><br><a href=#c4998425652993274522 title="comment permalink">8/12/16, 4:37 PM</a><br><br>

It would have been completely out of character, though, for Peter Carr to have expressed himself in that kind of qualified fashion -- if you'll glance back to other episodes, you'll find that he always speaks in that sort of crisp generalization, sometimes insightfully and sometimes not. One of the requirements of my art, as a writer of fiction, is to make sure that characters speak in their own voices rather than in mine. <br><br>With regard to a Retrotopian canon, you're right that I should develop that further in the direction of arts; I've focused on technology and the habits of everyday life, with a fair amount of attention to architecture and a nod or two to music. As I revise the posts into a book, I can certainly include more hints about the visual arts -- there will no doubt be paintings hanging on a variety of walls in Toledo and elsewhere, and those could unquestionably be used to sharpen the point of the book. Glancing back at the state of art in the Atlantic Republic might also be useful. You doubtless know the current art scene better than I do; can you suggest some soulless, ugly corporate art that would make a good starting point for the sort of thing I did with the Atlantic Republic Capitol? <br><br>Finally, I agree entirely that an election year is the best possible time to pay attention to things other than the political spasms du jour. Perspective is crucial, and art's a good way to get it.<br><br>Hammer, explore your annoyance. You may learn something from it. <br><br>Lynford, the human mind functions by means of simplification, reducing the complex curves of existence to a set of lines simple enough we can understand them. Them's the breaks. (Of course it's also relevant that these weekly posts are essays rather than books...) <br><br>Varun, no argument there. I think a lot of people use it because it allows them to avoid being sneered at. <br><br>Zach, and as long as criteria like yours are meant as a response to aesthetic experience rather than a replacement for it, I have no objection at all. <br><br>Lewis, I'll definitely get that book. As to how Cumberland has real estate prices so low, simple: it's got half the people it did in 1970, and supply and demand took it from there. The one caution I offer people who are thinking of moving here, or anywhere else in the small town regions of the Rust Belt: you have to bring your job with you. There are very, very few jobs here, and if you take one, a lot of locals will resent you for depriving someone local of an income. <br><br>DaShui, that was quite a marathon show! I'm glad you enjoy it. <br><br>UFCMGP, it strikes me as unconvincing. Revolutionary new artistic ventures happen whether or not there's an elite funding them -- if anything, they're more common outside that environment. Think of the birth of jazz: very much the hothouse environment, but it was a hothouse defined not by vast amounts of money, but by a politically and economically marginalized racial community pursuing its own musical idioms in the teeth of the mainstream. For that matter, I'm quite sure Schoenberg would have kept at it in his basement if he hadn't gotten elite funding, and maybe the need to find someone who wanted to listen to his music might have inspired him to put his undeniable talents to use in less sterile directions. <br><br>Pygmycory, in a sense, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is fan fiction based on the <i>Silmarillion</i> -- Tolkien was his own first and biggest fan, and the mythology of the Elder Days was something rather more important to him than a literary creation -- so I think you may be on to something. As for the band pieces, good -- will you consider doing the assignment with a different, and possibly less familiar artistic medium?<br><br><a href=#c115093804025149089 title="comment permalink">8/12/16, 5:27 PM</a><br><br>

Your threefold description works, to my mind. <br><br>Eric, of course there's a lot of variation and wiggle room -- as I noted in an earlier comment, since all we have to go on is the accumulation of individual aesthetic experience, one person's trash is another's masterpiece. I do think <i>Harry Potter</i> is going to end up being quietly forgotten, like so many other once-popular children's books, but time will tell; that's one of the reasons why a canon should consist entirely of the work of dead people. With regard to your fantasy trisection, though, you might want to pick up an Elric novel or two before redefining that end of Moorcock's oeuvre as highbrow trash. It's the pulpiest of pulp fantasy, gloriously trashy stuff -- he really should have been able to go back in time to get it serialized in <i>Weird Tales</i> with gaudy Margaret Brundage covers. I say this, by the way, with immense affection; the Elric saga, and even more so Moorcock's Swords trilogy, are among the books I mentioned in the post, the ones I go back to and read when I want to enjoy a good solid trashy fantasy. No, if you want highbrow trash from Moorcock, you have to go later on to his Jerry Cornelius novels, which are splendid examples of the genre in its florid decadence. <br><br>Jason, no, I'm not asking anyone to freeze their aesthetic perceptions; I'm asking my readers to enlarge their sense of what's already been done and develop richer and more sensitive aesthetic palates. If the only thing you see when you look at a Dutch master is a dead aristocrat, by the way, first of all, you haven't looked at a lot of Dutch masters; the majority of them were painted for a middle class market and include a wealth of really beautiful scenes from daily life. Second of all, if your politics have blinded your aesthetic sense to the point that that's all you see even if the subject of the painting does happen to be a dead aristocrat, then this discussion probably isn't going to make sense to you anyway. <br><br>As for your comments about the "natural state" of human beings, that's a cheap shot, as I think you're well aware. The natural state of human beings, of course, is to grow up in one culture and then to interact with many others; that's as true of hunter-gatherers as it is of today's Europeans, say. It's precisely in the interplay between a thoroughgoing grasp of the achievements of one's own culture and the unexpected insights and creations of others that we get some kind of sense of what it means to be human. <br><br>Candace, it's an exquisite piece. I wish he'd devoted more of his time to such things.<br><br><a href=#c53403943594729333 title="comment permalink">8/12/16, 5:36 PM</a><br><br>

I cannot understand people that love that sort of stuff.<br> And then it hit me. Just as you have people that love slasher films, you also have people that love modern art. Not necessarily the same people of course but here is the difference. In the film world, film critics are not insisting that slasher films are the best that we have and that anybody that doesn't love slasher films is a philistine who 'just doesn't get it". Massive public subsidies are not given to slasher films to take pride of place in our culture with our 'elite' lining up to watch them.

I like it a lot. What I see in it is a stage machine which LOOKS nothing like a formation of flying horses, but which MOVES in a way which I find majestic, like the head and neck of some great flying horse. They have reins to pull and shake. And then it provides a smooth and graceful way for the flying Valkyries to get onto the ground when the script requires that. I was also charmed by the hints that these singers were engaged with each other as actors, not just producing the required music (example: around the 50-second mark, and 2:13).<br><br>But context is always important. Perhaps I was "set up" to enjoy this particular staging, after viewing the Spanish opera in which the sopranos were toted around on the sort of industrial-maintenance platforms used to replace light bulbs in a ceiling, which I found ugly and absurd.

We dutifully wound our way through the serpentine gallery, one black monolith after another. Hmm... My 8-year old son got a turn or two ahead of us.

Some modern painting may indeed be just paint splatters but I think it is highly likely that many renaissance portraits were equally painted solely to record the image of a vain person for posterity. Until we delve into the depths of any work of art and understand who painted it and why they painted it, we need to refrain from passing judgement. I think you agree with me that it would be unfair to characterize all of us who enjoy modern art as being stupid people who are being duped by the tailors / painters in your story.<br><br><a href=#c6993707713963988 title="comment permalink">8/12/16, 7:56 PM</a><br><br>

Missed out on last weeks discussion, or else I would have been fron and centre here, no doubt.<br>anyway, here is my long-winded response. I hope you have the time to read it and reply. I know after the 200+ mark that's rare, but here goes nothin'<br><br>I will first off, acknowledge that what you are touching on here is necessary, as the art world does indeed need a rethink. But before I get on board, I’d like to say that your parable of the two tailors/ would-be painters is a crass oversimplification of things, even if some of the criticism is warranted…<br>Unlike in your fairy tale, Abstract expressionism didn’t just come out of nowhere. Nor did it emerge from a disingenuous desire to pull the wool over the eyes of the public or simply make a quick buck. So I have to call foul: just not fair to dismiss a collective cultural exploration of the emergent, expressive and esthetic possibilities of painting as such. <br>Disclaimer: I am an artist. I am wholly invested in that identity, and make no apologies for it. I am accustomed to both praise and support, as well as scorn and derision. I have come to learn that my art is not for everyone, and that should not wish for it to be otherwise. But I do think that investing in the understanding of art history, and where these ideas (like Brillo boxes or “dog barf”) come from, will potentially expand one’s awareness and perception of things. That is at least my aspiration as an artist.<br>I guess what I’m saying is that there is an important distinction to be made between the pretenders and the genuine, sincere artist’s work – even if it happens to be indistinguishable at first glance.<br>But am getting ahead of myself.<br>I think the real problem in art today, as is the problem in many other spheres of life, is the industrialisation of those things that have a traditional foundation. It’s a real conceptual stretch to connect the dots between a fresco by Giotto of the early Renaissance and a “post-modern” sculpture by Jeff Koons. And yet, the art establishment likes to weave a narrative history that does exactly that. <br>Industrialising art has taken many forms, and started – as one would expect – early on during the industrial revolution. The best known early triumph was probably Impressionism, which emerged from a host of new observations about what painting could do – in part spurred on by the advent of the photograph. But another factor was the new industrial middle class, and the cascading effects of the new socio-economic order. Impressionism was scandalous from the perspective of the old-guard academy. But the artists were well schooled by that very academy, and proceeded, nonetheless, to dismantle the phobias, taboos and neurosis of the establishment. Only the most dogmatic of the old order were unconvinced.<br>And then, as waves upon a shore, the new generations emulated the paradigm established. And they received support from the emergent industrialists who embraced the innovation and the avant-gardism that reflected their own ideological biases. <br>more to come...<br><br><a href=#c5727832554185022585 title="comment permalink">8/12/16, 9:08 PM</a><br><br>

I searched for blocks to find one in good condition so I could take it home with me (it features an alligator playing a saxophone, whose tail is also a a saxophone). My wife is a glass artist, in the paying hobby category, as she has decided that she will only make things that she likes, and if they sell, bonus. As she has travelled to take courses, I have joined her and met a great number of skilled artists. The interesting thing is that even the best have found that the pipe market (bongs and other drug paraphernalia) is where the money and innovation is coming fro, despite being frowned upon by the art critic class.

I guess what I mean is, how does the latter apply more directly to working artists and musicians? It might be a stupid question because you've already given examples of successful artists and musicians in Retropia, but I'm just wondering if you have any other advice.<br><br>Your post about notional space especially struck a chord, because for years I've felt that there seems to be so much art being created at the moment that there's no room for anything new. Even if the new art is good, it gets lost in the flood. It just seems inevitable that things have to go the other way, which is a bit depressing for someone who gets a lot of joy from writing new music. But maybe in every historical period there is a lot of new art, and time just filters out the best from the worst, and anyway I'll continue to write music because I simply like doing it. <br><br>Also, several commenters have recommended The Mandibles by Lionel Shriver - I went out yesterday and got a copy, and although I'm only 60 pages in, it connects very well with the ideas you post about, so consider this another recommendation!<br><br>@Esn: Thanks a lot! I will get a copy of Quadrivium to start with, and keep those other books in mind. Would it be correct to say that Quadrivium is the one most suited to applying the concepts in practice? Because I'm interested in experimenting with proportion while composing my own music. <br><br>One thing I noticed with many of the titles you suggested is that they seem to apply mainly to scales and 'vertical' proportion. I had a look for books that dealt with proportion in rhythm and large scale form (ie, proportion used in composing pieces 'horizontally') and I did find a book which analyzes Debussy's music to see how he followed natural proportion (Debussy in Proportion by Roy Howat). I will look for a copy of that, too.<br><br>@Howard: Thanks! Some of my theory books were written by Schenkerians, and on one hand, the idea seems useful, but I've seen Schenkerian analysis criticized because (say critics) it forces an abstract system on musical pieces that is hard to verify. None of my books however really go into detail about this kind of analysis directly, so I don't know if this is really the case or not?<br><br><a href=#c4586634475843451756 title="comment permalink">8/12/16, 10:42 PM</a><br><br>

(I couldn't find a photo of one, but there is this: http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/american-stars-in-japanese-commercials/ .)<br>Kyoto never allowed its skyline to be spoiled by such trash, and much of the city could be considered classic.

Somebody noticed just how dull this was and in some contest, selected the single dullest of the bunch to highlight (some say "cutest") and chose "Funassy" a nashi pear from Funabashi: http://jpninfo.com/4579 .

Elric is rambling and to my mind rather labored; Moorcock wrote the first version of it when he was quite young, and though he revised it thereafter, it's still an early work. To my taste, the story of Corum Jhaelen Irsei, the Prince in the Scarlet Robe, shows his mature pulp style at his best. Then you can go romp with Jerry Cornelius -- there's a movie more or less based on the Jerry Cornelius novels, btw, <i>The Final Programme</i> aka <i>The Last Days of Man On Earth</i>, which iirc is a fine piece of Seventies kitsch, well worth savoring -- and then go on to his recent fiction, which is something else again. <br><br>Kevin, that works! <br><br>LatheChuck, well, if it worked for you, it worked for you. It made me think of kids on teeter-totters, but maybe that's just me. On the other hand, it's far from the worst set of nonhorses the Valkyries have been forced to ride over the years!<br><br>Jason, thank you. With regard to the aesthetic of vernacular architecture, I hear you -- that's one of the things I was trying to catch in some of the scenes in Retrotopia, where Carr was looking at pleasant unpretentious farmhouses and barns and noticing how much more attractive the countryside was than on his side of the border. <br><br>Martin, it makes perfect sense to me. The ability to appreciate irony requires a certain level of reflective intelligence; lacking that, you just go "yuck!" and walk out of the theater. <br><br>Karen, thank you. I see I have a few hours of excruciating viewing ahead of me, to be followed by a great deal of fun engaging in parody. I suspect that why-bother minimalism is going to be common in Atlantic Republic banks and airports, and it will be amusing to see Carr reacting to a statue with surprise -- it isn't rusting metal, and it looks like something! <br><br>Jason, of course. I wanted, among other things, to counterbalance the assumption that all those who don't appreciate modern art as crass philistine hicks -- and to encourage my readers to make their own aesthetic judgments, rather than being pressured into accepting anyone else's viewpoint on faith. Mine, by the way, very much included!<br><br>Karen, I'm not at all sure what will have happened to those during the Second Civil War. We'll assume, for the sake of art fans everywhere, that they were taken to safety in Canada (along with the contents of the other important museums in the region) and stored there during the fighting, then returned once the fighting was over and the museums were rebuilt and restaffed. <br><br>Hal, fascinating! Yes, I could see that.<br><br>Kyoto, of course it's a crass oversimplification. Every parable is. My point, which I'm delighted to say has succeeded, is to encourage people to redefine the art spectrum in a ternary fashion, with trash on both ends and something worthwhile in the middle -- and since the concept of highbrow trash was not familiar to my readers, a parable was a good way to make the point. I'm also pleased to see that my post has launched a spirited discussion in which dissensus is the order of the day. Finally, your comments have raised a question that I'm going to want to explore in more detail, hopefully with the assistance of artists and the art-literate: to what extent is our old friend the religion of progress involved here? Do artists feel obligated to "progress," that is, to keep on going in the same broad direction that distinguished their predecessors from those even further back?<br><br><a href=#c110725788682766003 title="comment permalink">8/13/16, 12:18 AM</a><br><br>

With regard to industrial arts, that's a real challenge, as it's been part of the definition of art for many centuries now that to be art, something has to have no practical use. The exclusion of traditional women's arts such as quilting and weaving from the status of fine arts, which they eminently deserve, has been justified by the fact that quilts et al. actually serve some purpose other than decoration. The industrial arts fall afoul of that same difficulty, despite which there are objects crafted by industrial designers that are, to my mind, as elegant as good architecture (the one art that does get to be useful). <br><br>Jbucks, that's a massive question. How does an artist collapse now and avoid the rush? Of course one option, if you've got a steady income, is to do the same sort of cost-cutting and skill development as everyone else, but there's also the question of art media -- does your art require high technology to produce or display? What are its raw material requirements? Can you keep doing it as the economy slides? Those are major questions; I'm still contending with some of them in my own art as a writer, and I have no easy answers for other arts. <br><br>Patricia, funny. Japanese culture has a remarkable ability to borrow aesthetic ideas from other societies and take them further than anyone else, and so it doesn't surprise me at all that Japanese kitsch is kitschier than anybody else's kitsch will ever dream of being. <br><br>Synthase, no argument, that's a classic. For highbrow vs. lowbrow trash in research, though, I think a case can be made for the distinction. Lowbrow trash research is the sort of bottom-feeder stuff that proves some meaningless detail of something, purely for the sake of getting an article published. Highbrow trash is the sort of overblown stuff that's so busy being cutting-edge it forgets to engage in actual science -- I don't know if that's gotten into molecular biology yet; you might check out string theory in physics for a world-class example.<br><br><a href=#c8777810233109775294 title="comment permalink">8/13/16, 12:29 AM</a><br><br>

I had a look for books that dealt with proportion in rhythm and large scale form (ie, proportion used in composing pieces 'horizontally') and I did find a book which analyzes Debussy's music to see how he followed natural proportion (Debussy in Proportion by Roy Howat)."<br><br>Well... after all, a musical note is just a rhythm that's too fast for us to hear as individual beats (faster than 16 beats/second or so). I can't think of anything really good about rhythm/musical structure off the top of my head, though the book you found seems interesting. A number of the composers at my university did talk about using the Golden Section as a structural principle.<br><br>I will however highly recommend doing analysis yourself if you can. Find some pieces you like, find their scores (or listen to them, and make your own sketch), and analyze the structure. Analyze the elements that seem important to YOU (these will probably differ depending on the type of music you're studying). Compare different pieces (from the same tradition, or between different traditions) to see what's the same and what's different. I did that in my thesis (linked in my previous post), and have generally found it more productive and liberating than using someone else's analyses. It was also recommended to us by many of the professors, and for good reason. Sure, we were taught a number of "standard forms" used in classical music, but only by actually analyzing things yourself do you notice all the nuances.<br><br>In a lot of instrumental folk traditions, there isn't a structural form for the "whole piece" as such - rather, somebody may start playing something softly in a free rhythm, then get bolder and play a recognizable melody of fixed length in steady rhythm, then other musicians may join in as the same melody (or several) repeats over and over (but sounds a bit different each time, as different musicians vary different things), then the original musician may or may not call out "CHANGE!" and start a different melody, and eventually one of the repetitions will be the final one by some sort of signaled or unsignaled consent of all the musicians. If there are people dancing to the music, that will often determine how long the music goes on, based on the energy in the room (and the "CHANGE!" may start a different sequence of steps). In these cases, maths doesn't enter into it so much, rather the musical structure is organic and intimately tied to the environment (although there's a certain repetitive element at the heart for practical reasons, both for the musicians--some of whom may be learning melodies new to them as they're playing--and the dancers).<br><br><a href=#c8231655628073031653 title="comment permalink">8/13/16, 4:27 AM</a><br><br>

With the advent of purely chromatic harmony at the end of the 19th Century and the rise of serialism with Schoenberg et al., composers on the highbrow side have tried for most of 20th century to divorce themselves from the physicality of the overtone series. This vain attempt to completely intellectualize how we compose and listen to music thankfully seems to have failed, largely I believe to the lowbrow sides insistence that diatonic harmony just sounds better. This is not to say that I completely reject the techniques and aesthetic that can be achieved from "modern" musical compositional frames, as I studied with serialist Charles Wuorinen. My objection is that in most modern classical music composing scenes, nothing is valid unless it makes a break with the past and is obtuse in some way. If the audience doesn't like it, too bad. That's progress. If I had adopted that attitude in my own music for TV or film, I would have been out of a job very quickly. Let's also not forget that many of the greatest composers in our Western musical history worked "for hire" and still managed to create great works of art - sometimes quite challenging for their audiences, and other times instantly beloved. For me, it still comes down to whether it's good or it isn't, whether you like it or you don't, in any time period and area of the trash heap it is on. It's all compost anyway...<br><br><a href=#c3298382716089087802 title="comment permalink">8/13/16, 6:23 AM</a><br><br>

The impression I got from reading the Dada magazines was that they were pretty openly like the con artists from your parable, at least in the early years. They were making fun of the art establishment and it looked like it was a competition to see he could make the stupidest or weirdest thing be considered art.<br><br>Many modernist movements, like surrealism, seemed to be sincerely trying to popularize new ways of engaging the world, it never seemed to me that being recognized by the affluent was in their agenda.<br><br>My own country's modernism interpreted the modernist revolt against tradition as revolt against what was felt as foreign, European tradition that could only be appreciated by the affluent. They were trying to create new forms that were adequate to the sounds, colors, landscapes and peoples of our country. Accordingly they delved deep in folklore, fauna, flora and history of the country. Much of what they have done is still popular today, though Academia's favorites are the ones that better emulated the nonsense coming out of Europe at the time.<br><br>I used to be a modern art enthusiast until I had to read Sophocles's Oedipus Rex for a philosophy course. That little book shook my tastes and worldview for good, I'm now very far from being a friend of modernism.

As for the canon, one basic rule is that if the artist is still alive, it's not canon. At least one generation needs to pass, and the immediate pressures of the moment give way to something else, before it becomes possible to judge whether a work of art is enduring or merely temporarily popular<br><br>&gt;So surely you shouldnt be making comments supporting works in the canon, and criticising modern art that won't have made it yet<br>I think Warhol will.

I agree, as others here have noted, that visual art, like all art is a form of communication. I don't personally think it therefore HAS to be a collective experience. Some art is, some can be experienced alone. Sam Sheppard once described his plays as springing from his own "personal mythology". That description stuck with me because Yes! We do all have our own personal mythology - we bring our our past experiences and feelings to every new thing we encounter including works of art. While some are collective, a whole group of people have personal mythologies close enough to have the same reactions to a piece, and yeah, that's a great experience, Those are the works that will likely endure through time; However, IMHO that does not mean that a work that induces a solitary individuated reaction is totally worthless. <br><br>In terms of the meaning you get from a representational painting vs. the blank you get from abstract art, (I'm talking specifically about those blobs of color works), How do you feel when you see 'abstract-art' in nature? Some weird elaborate texture of lichen, or twisted tree bark, flowing colors of mineral deposits in a rock or white grey and pink clouds? For me, these little gems of beauty induce a similar reaction to a blobs of color-abstract art painting. They're just nature at work, not pretending to be anything, not requiring an explanation, yet they are fascinating, and do sometimes remind me of something else or induce a strong feeling or memory. I am free to take away from them whatever meaning hits me.<br><br>This is totally different, IMHO than a representational artwork of a giant teddy bear cleaved by a lampshade that purposefully evades understanding or meaning. I can certainly appreciate another art-troll or artist doing something playful, weird and whimsical, non-sequiter and random, but IMHO - that is not appropriate for Public Art. Public Art kind of needs to be a collective experience. That's the whole point. An expensively funded and permanent piece in a college square is not the place for just some weird whimsy or internal, navel-gazing experience, (much as I love navel-gazing experiences.) IOW: I don't get it, and I don't think we are meant to 'get' it. AND it is too specific to cop to the 'take-from-it-what-you-will' explanation. So this and your other examples are the finest examples of High-Brow Trash. <br><br>The pile of rusting metal junk in the fountain - The most charitable explanation I can come up with is that the artist was trying to recreate the natural artwork I talked about above - just glorying in the shapes, textures, lines…. Walking around an actual junk yard, I have definitely been utterly captivated by the random accidental sculptures of piles of twisted metal. Maybe that's where the abstract artists fell into a trap- it IS inherently fascinating when you come across natural or accidental weird beauty. It feels contrived and trollish when purposefully recreated.

Not so. Binary pronouncements of good/bad, like/dislike aren’t helpful to artists. Tell us what you like, want, etc. I mean the nuts and bolts: colors, subject matter, paint styles, whatever and why. Gives us some idea of where to start from, very few art schools are teaching that now days. We may not like it, but I promise we listen.</i><br><br>My own view of art that is 100% non-representational is that it doesn't give someone like me who is not educated in the arts anything like a starting point in determining what the meaning is. Sometimes the title helps, but usually I'm lost from there. It's not that I don't like flashy colors in and of themselves - I do. It's just that I think that particular style aspires to a meaning that it doesn't achieve.<br><br>So I guess what I'm trying to say is that there has to be a strong representational element in order to achieve meaning. It doesn't have to be Rockwellian or anything close. I dreamed up a couple of examples this morning, and please forgive me if these already exist and I've unwittingly drawn them from my memory rather than my imagination. Want to say something about the objectification of women? Paint a picture of a frontally nude woman, neck-to-navel, with the breasts replaced by eyeballs and the collarbones shaded to suggest an angrily furrowed brow. Want to say that nature always wins in the end? Paint a picture of frightened robber barons sinking into a shrub-lined fissure in the earth, which on closer inspection appears to resemble a vagina. Want to say the opposite? Paint a picture of the blue-marble Earth on the floor, encircled with contemptuous robber barons ashing their cigars on it. You could call it "Climate Bukkake".<br><br>You might not like my particular examples, but anything in that form at least gives a place to communicate. Maybe the representational elements can be more subtle than that. My examples are pretty in-your-face with the message. Whatever. You're the artist - season to taste.<br><br>BTW, a few years ago I made three dog barf (I'll give that term a rest now) videos of a few minutes each and uploaded them to youtube. They didn't mean anything. I was just playing with the medium. I can't find them now, as I abandoned that account, but if I could have, I would have linked to them on here so I could have shared in the criticism.<br><br><br>Eric S: Anything in that book about how much retaliation is enough?

(*ahem* Hopefully in the right thread this time. *sigh*) Two points:<br><br>1.) As a professional violinist, I perform quite a bit of "new" music as well as the standard war-horses, and I heartily agree with most of the article. I also feel that the "artists" in your Emperor story have done a great deal of damage to culture by discouraging people from having their own opinions. By not allowing people to own their own appreciation or lack thereof for art, in some ways it destroys art's legitimacy and place in society. If everyone feels that they just don't "get" art, why should they go to a concert or art gallery? When it seems their opinion isn't informed enough to matter, they often chuck ALL of it in to the dustbin, and say they just "don't like classical music" or art galleries, or whatever. VERY frustrating for me, when honestly, there's just a lot of badly performed, badly presented (and particularly in the case of modern music, badly written) classical music out there. (I think with shrinking money and opportunities in the arts, especially here in the U.S., there's also something of a circling of the wagons effect -- we're all trying to band together and not disparage each other, since we know how tough it is out there.) There is a huge variety of styles and time periods to choose from, and just because someone hears a smattering of a Mozart symphony in a crowded train station and doesn't like it, doesn't mean they couldn't have a profound spiritual reaction to a vibrant, outstanding live performance of a Mahler Symphony or Brahms Requiem. <br><br>However, there's also the larger educational and contextual problems in our culture, as you've been pointing out in these posts. If people have no experience evaluating ideas, or lack the time and emotional ability to focus in on their own reactions to artwork, would a great performance of Brahms or Bach even make an impression on them? I go back and forth on that quite a bit.<br><br>2.) This also ties in with the issue of the "future" of artistic careers that another person brought up. Maybe the Western classical canon is just playing itself out (sadly) and the art of the next time-period will be something completely different and speak to people in another way. From a descent perspective, my husband and I often talk about folk music and chamber works being the most likely to survive and thrive in the music world. Plus, what makes something great "art" can be so many different things to different people! (The difficulty of your canon definition is that it requires an institution and a specific cultural framework to exist within, of course. My email signature is a quote from a 1967 documentary about Sister Corita Kent, "We have no art. We do everything as well as we can.” I think it's an idea from Balinese culture, but I cannot verify that at all.) I also teach violin privately on the side, and my colleagues and I have all discussed the moral dilemma of working with young people who may be considering making music their career. If I had children, I certainly wouldn't encourage them to consider the standard Symphonic or other "normal" performance career route as their future. They have to be aware of how the world is changing, and understand that it might be an even more challenging path than usual.<br><br><a href=#c174426613655520709 title="comment permalink">8/13/16, 6:15 PM</a><br><br>

Well, we experience everything individually.<br><br>"In terms of the meaning you get from a representational painting vs. the blank you get from abstract art, (I'm talking specifically about those blobs of color works), How do you feel when you see 'abstract-art' in nature? Some weird elaborate texture of lichen, or twisted tree bark, flowing colors of mineral deposits in a rock or white grey and pink clouds? For me, these little gems of beauty induce a similar reaction to a blobs of color-abstract art painting. They're just nature at work, not pretending to be anything, not requiring an explanation, yet they are fascinating, and do sometimes remind me of something else or induce a strong feeling or memory."<br><br>Well now, that is different. Nature at work IS something, the processes are real and are always within their own natural context. Perhaps if you framed a piece of lichen or some splattered raindrops on a rock, it wouldn't hold much interest either. The beauty of it is what it is part of and that one can discern its place within a larger, active reality. <br><br>Thanks for your take on those 4 horrors.

The last time I got fed something like that, I went out afterwards and found a decent burger joint where I could get a good bacon cheeseburger and a good dark beer. So I won't argue with you a bit!<br><br>Scotlyn, interesting. I wonder whether the same distinction -- trash involves dependence on complex outside inputs, while art does not -- might be applicable more generally. <br><br>Synthase, it may vary between different branches of science, then. When I was first at college, I took experimental design and statistics courses through the psych department, and I also knew some of the guys at the computer lab who helped the grad students commit research fraud -- the usual gimmick was to do some kind of more or less pointless experiment, run statistical tests on it until you found something that was statistically significant at the .05 level or better, and then write the paper as though that's what you were trying to prove. Since you can be sure of getting at least one apparently significant factor at that level by pure random chance if you run at least twenty different statistical analyses, a great deal of junk science got accepted that way. I also got to hear, though, of the more common gimmick in that department, which involved finding something sufficiently irrelevant that nobody had bothered to look into it, and making that the center of your career, running endless variations on the same basic experiment, and never quite conclusively proving anything: the claim was that tenure committees et al. paid attention to the number of publications, not their relevance. That's been my touchstone ever since for lowbrow trash science. <br><br>Esn, may I offer the advice of a somewhat experienced author? Nobody ever knows enough to write a book. The only excuse for writing is that you know a little more than the people who want to read it, and can communicate something to them that they want to know. <br><br>Darryl, thank you! The notion that something can't be genuinely good unless people don't like it strikes me as one of the most destructive beliefs in the contemporary arts scene -- and of course that includes all art, from music to architecture and beyond. If artists would start challenging that, I think a lot of the barrier that keeps art from receiving support from the public (and selling artworks to the public, thus enabling artists to support themselves) would go away in a hurry. <br><br>Bill, exactly. The Broadway musical was a very rich art form with a somewhat limited notional space, due to the constraints on what you can do in a Broadway theater with orchestra et al. At this point we're well into the performance era, and as you point out, the only really innovative things being done involve fusing the musical genre with other genres -- and how many times can you do even that before it gets stale? <br><br>Pedro, I certainly don't claim to know enough about the history of art in your country to claim that my narrative applies there. Here in the US, for that matter, there have been very serious and well-intentioned efforts in the modernist end of things -- but there has also been a vast amount of more or less deliberate charlatanism and fraud. I suppose it may simply be that since colonial times, the United States has been the happy hunting ground of the con artist, the snake oil salesman, and the sideshow fake!<br><br><a href=#c3583096485037793138 title="comment permalink">8/13/16, 11:03 PM</a><br><br>

The great critical success of the 1811 literary season, for example, was Mary Brunton's novel <i>Self-Control</i>. Heard of it? I didn't think so. Another book published in 1811 was Jane Austen's <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, which was panned by the highbrow critics as mere popular entertainment. You tell me which one entered the canon! <br><br>Patricia, thank you. I needed a good laugh. <br><br>Wbricex, hmm! Thank you; it hadn't occurred to me that laws could be approached as an art form, but you make a good case. <br><br>Scotlyn, this notion that "art" is something that only the upper classes have, and the lower classes don't dare claim to have, I see as one of the great tragedies to unfold from the current insistence that art must be repellent and useless to be serious. I'd like to see people like you reaffirm their capacities to create beautiful things, and to value those things as art. As for aesthetic pleasure being frozen into a single enduring shape, not at all -- how about music, dance, theater, or the other performing arts? Should cooking and eating a meal be considered a performing art? I'd be in favor of it....<br><br>Kyoto, fair enough -- and I suspect that the financialization has a lot to do with the marketing of dog barf these days. <br><br>Ed-M, very funny, though I don't know what a "Family Guy version" might be -- is this a TV reference by any chance? One correction, btw -- "borborygmus" is the technical medical term for gurgling in your stomach, the sort of thing that you hear from a dog's belly before it throws up. ;-)<br><br>Zach, and your voice also counts. You enjoy things that others consider highbrow trash? Fair enough; that's your right, just as it's their right to loathe it. Full disclosure: I had a college housemate who had to read <i>Shikasta</i> for a class, and hated it so much that when the quarter was over she tore it up and burnt it page by page. This was a woman who normally loved books. My feelings aren't that strong, but honestly, I find them unreadable. Your mileage may vary. <br><br>Onething, I dance on toes. Mine, and occasionally others'. ;-)<br><br>Chris, well, there you are. I wonder if abstraction becomes more prominent as societies isolate themselves from the natural world. <br><br>JoAnna, exactly. I understand the circling the wagons effect, but when it's paired with the insistence that nobody has the right to dislike any artwork that has been endorsed as fine art within the arts world, the result is exactly the effect you describe -- people walk away from all of it and seek refuge in popular culture, however trashy, because there they're allowed to express their opinions freely and avoid things they don't enjoy. <br><br>With regard to the survival of the arts in the Long Descent, that's a huge issue, and one I'm still trying to suss out. Obviously some arts and some styles are much better suited to survive than others; if your violin students can change gears and play fiddle music in a popular style, they're much more likely to be able to put food on the table -- but what happens to the classical repertoire if country-western is the only thing anyone wants to hear? I don't have the answers yet; down the road, I plan on discussing that in much more detail, though.<br><br><a href=#c9210905440906082453 title="comment permalink">8/13/16, 11:25 PM</a><br><br>

This happened before the collapse depicted in the novel, and as the collapse continues to unfold (over a few decades), people are too busy trying to survive to pay much attention to art. <br><br>My guess about art in a future of long decline is that art-making becomes a hobby for most people (folk art), the few professional artists who remain will either make art for a much smaller upper class who still have some time to enjoy art and money to pay for it, or they will make lowbrow trash. As you wrote, if the audience for lowbrow trash are poorer people who desire the 'reassurance of the familiar', then in a world where more people are poor, then the audience for lowbrow trash will grow. On second thought, though, the poor by definition won't have the money to pay for lowbrow trash. <br><br>I wonder if there are historical precedents, I don't know what happened to artists as Rome went through its decline, for example.<br><br>By the way, to answer your questions as regards to my own art, I used to create electronic music until a few years ago. I was actually a pretty good 'synthesist' and user of music software, but I sold it all, and put all the money into piano and composition lessons. It didn't feel right to be making music using energy-intensive electronic music hardware and relying on machines to do the work for me. Now all I need is a piano, a pencil and some blank manuscript paper, although I do still use notation software for convenience.<br><br>@Esn: Thank you very much once again!

They're quite happy to point out all the ways old technology worked better and even complain about Progress in the abstract. The problem is that such insight is usually followed by a sigh and a resignation that we can't go back. I think that these crowds would be quite receptive to Retrotopia as it is, but I worry that they might turn off their brains and start snarling if you make art a more major part of the book. <br><br>Ironically, the crowds I have in mind usually swoon over older aesthetics and would happily nod along with Carr's comments. The thing is, the defense every millennial I know has developed against highbrow art snobs is to insist that, in fact, everything really is art and it's completely a matter of individual preference and if you try to tell them what they can and can't like then obviously you're the one who doesn't understand art. <br><br>Of course, you're not trying to dictate what they can and can't like, but I fear that too much of a focus on art might be interpreted that way. Peter's occasional comment about visual art and the specific genres of older music he likes strike me as just right to engage people who like retro fashion, but too much might make them suspicious of an art snob agenda on the part of the author.<br><br><a href=#c1058194766524904068 title="comment permalink">8/14/16, 12:24 AM</a><br><br>

I happen to be of an age (40) where in order for what anyone with any sense would call pornography would be considered protected "art" if it had what the Supreme Court had termed "Socially Redeeming Value." I remember when my cousin and I got our hands on such a vide as curious thirteen year old boys are apt to do. We watched this film with as much interest and excitement as you would expect from two young teenagers who had never seen such a video. After ninety minutes of three or more couples having wild conjugal relations, the last couple to be featured got dressed and walked outside through the door of the hotel where this was being filmed. The man lit a cigarette and starting puffing. The woman turned to him and said, "You shouldn't smoke; it causes cancer." The man said, "You're right. I'll quit," and snuffed it out on the sidewalk with his foot. That three second exchange made the preceding ninety minutes "protected art" covered under the First Amendment according to the high court and not pornography.<br><br><a href=#c7488104431788614788 title="comment permalink">8/14/16, 3:43 AM</a><br><br>

When the devout undertakes his personal journey of progress, that is supposed to be a linear ascent towards more and more of two easily recogizable features: The first is the movement into increasingly larger quantities of dysfunctional abstractions and the manipulations thereof, and away from doing anything useful, valuable or productive. The justification for this is that the abstract structures one is creating is a kind of ultimate reality of which the real world is but an uneven and flawed reflection, and that this will allow the latter to be more effectively manipulated. Given that the flight to abstraction is really a form of nay-saying in the strictly nietschzean sense, the opposite is actually the case, and thus the abstract must be isolated and protected from the world it is supposed to represent, as that world will gladly clobber it and its creator given half a chance. This is supposed to be accomplished simply by insisting that said world (and the dwellers within) are stupid, really stupid, which is what the sneering directed towards those on the outside is about.<br><br>The second feature is that the flight away from doing things that are useful, valuable or productive must be rewarded with a steadily increasing ability to disproportionatly consume the fruits of the labours of those who are not engaging in that flight themselves. The justification for feature two is extrapolated from the last part of the justification for feature one and ends up circling back to mean that the dysfunctional abstractions and their manipulators are what enables anything useful, valuable etc. to occur in the first place. For a first rate example listen to economists try to explain why it is the existence of economists that enables the economy to function...<br><br>Officially appointed artists peddling dog puke for absurd amounts of money is just one more form of acting this pattern out, though in a perhaps slightly less obvious (and arguably less harmful) way.<br><br>Glad you liked the video.

Even in the bathroom, we have a delightful painting of a young lady in a free standing bathtub drinking a glass of red wine (or maybe a fortified wine?) and consuming chocolates, blowing bubbles, and generally looking as if she is having a good time. It is such a fun painting and it was titled: "Having a ball". Both my wife and I loved it when we first saw it and so we purchased it on the spot. The curator of the exhibition confided to me in a condescending tone: "I guess you could hang it in your bathroom". And I was quite taken aback by his tone and the unstated implication, so I simply replied: "Yeah". Art critics... I suspect they may one day receive a similar fate to that of the marketing department of the Cyrius Cybernetics Corporation! Hehe!!! :-)!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c2871357964944374626 title="comment permalink">8/14/16, 4:55 AM</a><br><br>

I'm definitely looking forward to hearing your thoughts on it. For myself, I see it as (potentially) a return to a situation similar to times before the Industrial revolution -- namely, patronage. Before the rise of the middle class through the Enlightenment/Industrial revolution etc., high art was created pretty much exclusively for the upper classes who had the leisure and resources to enjoy it. (Either via the Church or the imperial courts.) It was only in the 19th century that "classical" European music began to be available to more people, leading to the rise of performer-stars like Liszt and Paganini, and the ability of composers to write for larger ensembles in the increased capacity of the larger concert halls, built to accommodate new middle-class audiences. <br><br>All this is to say that as the middle class and the "leisure" time afforded by cheap energy goes away in western civilization, it makes sense to me that classical art (whatever it is by that time) will shrink back to serving smaller audiences again... For my students, that means far fewer opportunities (though I'm hoping not a complete lack of them!) and perhaps training more in the apprenticeship style of the old days, rather than the mass-produced musicianship of conservatories. Being in my 30's and happily supporting myself as a classical musician, it sadly feels I just "slipped in" before the bell as it were, as I've seen the freelance scene in the NY area dry up considerably in the last few years. From what I hear from my older friends, it's a completely different world from the heady days of gigging in the 70's, 80's, or even the 90's.<br><br><a href=#c4015329957109357520 title="comment permalink">8/14/16, 9:52 AM</a><br><br>

How do you pluralize that?)" Both the singular and plural are spelled "corps," but the s is silent in the singular but pronounced in the plural; the word is French and the original rules sort of followed along. Coincidentally enough, a corps played on that very confusion by calling their show "The Drum Corpse Bride." The program could have been very pretentious, but it ended up being a great crowd pleaser.<br><br>As for the same patterns playing out in drum and bugle corps, that's definitely been the case since the 1970s, when the corps themselves wrested control of the activity from the veterans' organizations, who did their best to keep it lowbrow trash for wage-class youth. As soon as the directors, instructors, and judges got control of the activity, they did their best to make it more artistic, which meant that pretentious trash was the eventual result. They also converted into an activity for salary-class youth, which the wage-class alumni have resented.

I have been reading for eight years, but it took me a long time to figure out how to comment. (I discovered accidentally that one can comment if one has a gmail address—hope this may help someone else.) I very much appreciate the weekly dose of sanity and provocation and the tight control of the comments that make this an endlessly fascinating read.<br>On to art: I agree that art needs to communicate and would go further and say that it needs to communicate from spirit to spirit. Of course there are techniques of composition and materials usage that assist this process greatly, but I don’t think that they are the sole enabler of this type of communication. Paintings can be technically accomplished without saying much (Watteau, anyone?) I think that one of the main problems with modern, and especially contemporary art, is the emphasis on the intellect, on making a “statement”, which leads to the problem of the art being solely self-referential. I have been very fortunate to see a fair number of the west’s great art works as well as a fair amount of dreck. Here are a couple of examples of what I mean. <br>In an exhibit of contemporary works by new artists, there were two rather poorly made pottery plates mounted on a wall where they looked random and out of proportion. The card enthused that the plates could be hung in different positions for an infinite number of works of art. Oh, wow (not). The lack of proportion did not make me see the space in a new way; the plates did not communicate anything other than ugly plate-ness. In contrast, an exhibit at the Clark Institute showed contemporary works by an African artist made out of bottle caps wired together. These large, colorful, shimmering pieces were breath-taking. They said something about beauty from waste and ugliness, but they were also just plain beautiful, speaking to my spirit about nobility and resilience (and something beyond words). They were dimensional pieces, and a DVD playing in a side gallery showed the artist talking about his works, and especially about how he enjoys collaborating with curators about how the works are to be hung and shaped. He can see new things in his works through the curator’s eyes. Yet the pieces come out of his inner vision, his feelings about the society in which he lives, its heritage and current problems.<br>At another contemporary exhibition, an enormous pile of hard candy was heaped on the floor in a corner. I cautioned my (then) small child not to touch it. However, on reading the card it turned out that we were supposed to help ourselves to the candy. The artist would weigh what was left at the end of each day and top it up to the precise weight at which his partner had died of AIDS. I think this may have been 89 lbs. Now this is a horrifying weight for a grown man, but it is not a small weight of candy. The candy was just a large pile of candy. It communicated nothing to us about love or loss or the horror of an epidemic even after we had read the label. It obviously meant something to the artist, but something so private that he could not share it in any way that would touch another person. We could intellectualize at length about the symbolism of candy or of eating, but in the end, nothing of the artist’s experience or emotions was shared. Was it art? I’d say that it wasn’t.<br><br><a href=#c6604307936613792053 title="comment permalink">8/14/16, 2:01 PM</a><br><br>

I could have cared less about Van Gogh’s work until I saw it in person. Amazing! Absorbing! I consider prints of his “Sunflowers” to be ugly. The painting itself seems alive. A modern work at the art gallery at Princeton University is a canvas painted black. (Sorry I can’t remember the artist or find him on line.) Look across the gallery at it and it appears to be a high-priced scam. Up close, one can practically fall into the painting. It induces a kind of peaceful, meditative trance state. It more than passes the “could I have done it?” test. I most definitely could not have. Anything I painted black would look like the side of a (black) barn. The same museum is loaded with warhol, including several actual Warhols.<br>As for low-brow stuff, it usually communicates something—that’s why people like it. Take the much-maligned Norman Rockwell. He was clear that he did not consider himself an artist, but an illustrator. Nevertheless, his works are technically accomplished and cause folks to chuckle or heave a sentimental sigh, and what’s wrong with that? In the case of Elvis on velvet, it is probably the reminder of a favorite song sung in his gorgeous voice that makes people want him on their walls (post-ironic hipsters of course want the kitsch of it all).<br>To follow up on the comments on Picasso, I think he is over-rated. “Guernica” is a work of breath-taking power. The rest of what I have seen—not so much. My father used to say that Picasso was just “having us on”, and IMHO at least some of it seems to be sly warhol.<br><br><a href=#c7251078859905115182 title="comment permalink">8/14/16, 2:03 PM</a><br><br>

The dadaists and surrealists captivated me with their secret symbolic language. later, I found that learning human languages is way more satisfying.<br><br>As I've aged I've thought less and less about art; most books I read are non-fiction, and while I'm clearly informed by aesthetics I've let that part of myself atrophy somewhat. I don't commonly listen to music or look at visual art either. This is in large part from being turned off by the aesthetic extremes of art that you anatomize. I began reflecting a bit on this more after reading Dostoyevsky's <i>the brothers karamazov</i> and being deeply moved on a deeper, symbolic level, that most art doesn't reach in me.<br><br>I have, however, put a great deal of time recently into studying herbalism, talking with folks about the herbs they use and feel that I can characterize different uses in the framework you describe. <br><br>Vernacular Herbalism (low-brow): the use of culinary herbs for healing minor ailments. Eating a clove of garlic for a cold, taking ginger tea with honey or drinking warm milk before bed are all time honored rituals that have important chemical effects. They are accesible and comforting. I do not consider them "trashy" but they are vernacular.<br><br>Kitsch: buying bagged tea which tells you how to use it. The yogi tea that says "smooth move" for constipation, "cough formula" "sleepy time" or what have you. The important part of this classification in the comfort that the tea provides (I say this with compassion and understanding - I drank endless cups of these teas microwaved as a child) and the minimal level of thinking that is needed on the part of the consumer.<br><br>Elite Herbalism (high-brow): the use of adaptogens that come in the form of capsules. People buy ashwagandha or holy basil or eluethero in capsules in combination with other herbs. The people who buy them are, in my experience come from class backgrounds which dispose them towards being high brow. The elements of cognoscenti are present here as well. So while the use of adaptogens is totally valid and I use them with gusto in my practice, I find that their use can often be correlated with elitism, and the sort of obfuscation that you mention as an important aspect of high brow trash.<br><br>Warhol: gemstone essences. I have great respect for homeopathy and flower essences. This includes the more spiritual aspects of healing with herbs as well. There is however, it appears to me, a level of warhol in the making of essences of gemstones, or tincturing coyote blood, or capturing the full moon in a bowl of water. While I want to acknowledge the spiritual power that using these sorts of preparations can have, there is a certain high brow absurdity that starts to come in, especially if this is the mainstay of someone's practice. Again, I see many good parts to herbal warhol and it works a lot, but as when perceived as an aesthetic statement, it starts to look silly to me.<br><br>Canon: Traditional herbal systems, especially with the practitioner crafting their own preparations. The sort of beauty of giving someone a tincture I made of reishi or a nettles vinegar is hard for me to convey. Gifting a little bottle of lemon balm tinctured in brandy likewise in an aesthetic experience of the highest degree. The materials, preparation and presentation are always taken into account, and especially with formulas, there is the dance of traditional forms giving rise to distinct and personalized meanings. Also, I agree with David Hoffman who writes that when you have a variety of herbs that are appropriate and indicated, why not choose the best tasting one?<br><br><a href=#c8899824275839593698 title="comment permalink">8/15/16, 7:45 AM</a><br><br>

That is a good bit of common sense that doesn't get written down too often. When reviewing scientific papers, I often use these categories although not in those words...the lowbrow and highbrow trash as well as the soon to be classics. I haven't yet run into much kitsch or warhol that claims to be science, but the Ig Nobel prizes and many commentaries on scientific sociology often make for good entertainment. There is a way that science is somewhat different than art, in that there is a utilitarian aspect to good scientific measurements and theories. One of the challenges is always that in addition to the obvious lowbrow and highbrow trash, there is a large amount of useful but somewhat lowbrow work by people who did some interesting work but don't have the training, talent, or didn't invest the time to do it really well. And there is an even larger amount of useful but somewhat highbrow work by people who did some interesting work and are trying to pass it off as more important than it is. It feels to me that one of the most useful contributions these days is critical synthesis that extracts from the vast scientific literature the enduring insights. Traditionally that is done in review papers, but increasingly the review papers avoid saying anything negative and simply summarize the mind twistingly complex array of partially contradictory results that have been published. How do you characterize the professional caution that causes many to avoid conflicts of ideas because it is the most effective career development strategy? (It also happens to require the least thinking, so it allows publishing of many papers per year.)<br><br><a href=#c1099146441244585843 title="comment permalink">8/15/16, 9:04 AM</a><br><br>

Most people I know aren't especially concerned with older works and so I feel like even a Marx Brothers comedy I'd hold up as a classic might come across as "highbrow trash" among people who think all black &amp; white movies are inherently boring.<br>In terms of visual arts, I can understand the concept easily. I visited MoMA in New York City a while back for a Paul Gauguin exhibit (which I loved) and found 90% of the other works in the museum to be pure trash.<br>I suppose for literature, James Joyce would be an example of highbrow trash. Ulysses is a book that' I didn’t enjoy reading but has stayed with me. A lot of what might count as highbrow trash really resonates with me. I assume William S. Burroughs would be an easy example but when I've read (and re-read) his books, they always inspire me to gleefully cackle with a certain indescribable mania. I suppose Harlan Ellison (who famously walked out of an interview when they called him a science fiction author) is an example of highbrow trash in sci-fi... but the RAW EXPRESSION and SHEER MADNESS in his work is just something I find wonderful.<br><br>Thinking about movies... well, Last Year at Marienbad is a critical darling that I'd be hard pressed to imagine a normal human being actually *enjoying* or understanding, but it is a beautiful and evocative film nonetheless. I’m not sure I want to rewatch it for this homework though. <br>Looking at genres first, horror is one of my favorite but horror movies tend to be absolutely hated by critics; to the point when a horror movie that turns into a critical delight (Psycho, Jaws, Silence of the Lambs) gets labeled as "psychological thriller" so it doesn't have to come across as anything as trashy as a horror movie. But Psycho, Jaws, and Silence of the Lambs are also crowd-pleasing movies with mainstream-appeal. It’s tough to find a horror work that’s also a darling of critics.<br>Maybe I should look at comedies... are Woody Allen movies classic or highbrow trash? Even at his worst and most self-indulgent, I normally find his movies to be entertaining.<br><br>So I'll turn to comics because I read a lot of those: and I doubt there's a better example of highbrow trash than Neil Gaiman's run on The Sandman. Among comic fans, it's routinely held up as one of the greatest works of comic-dom (critics have argued that it's REALLY a "serialized graphic novel"). The story concerns a group of immortal "don't-call-them-gods" godlike-beings and draws upon mythology, dream-narratives, Shakespeare, G.K. Chesterton, and other highbrow literary influences. I personally consider it a meandering mess with nothing really original to say. But it has enough fans who would argue that it's really a classic, so maybe I'm just missing something about its supposed brilliance.<br>I'll declare it part of the fantasy/superhero genre, because it has a lot of those elements within it. Lowbrow trash in that genre is pretty much the default. Picking a genuine CLASSIC is something that would be controversial because creators have only been taking the medium seriously for a few decades and that's arguably not enough time to really separate the wheat from the chaff yet; I don't want to just project my own tastes onto these labels. So I'll avoid comics for this homework...<br><br>IN THE END, I'm still hemming and hawing over what's what. But it has my gears turning and I consider that to be a good thing!<br>(And I hope this long, meandering comment isn't too meaningless. Just want to share some of my thought-process.)<br><br><a href=#c7417832544147874183 title="comment permalink">8/15/16, 2:09 PM</a><br><br>

(Or was that supposed to be a battle-ax?) <br><br>Alvin, you've got me -- I went looking for such a post on Galabes and couldn't find it, while here, there are currently 513 posts to search through and that's a bit much even for my recollections! <br><br>Cherokee, actually, there was -- the Dark Ages in particular saw a lot of abstract and semiabstract forms. Its excesses were somewhat constrained by the fact that barbarian warlords had definite tastes in such things. ;-) I'm glad to hear you have art on your walls -- and that it reflects your taste and your wife's, not what curators think you ought to enjoy!<br><br>Patricia, yes, and in a couple of generations the only classical music that survives is the stuff that can be played simply and unpretentiously to delight a casual audience. That's my point. <br><br>David, funny. A nice bit of worldbuilding byplay. <br><br>Paulcito, nah, you don't get credit for the assignment unless you also have trash of the same genre to compare it to. <br><br>Juhana, as far as I know, it's only available directly from the publisher as yet. Once the trade paper edition comes out, that may change.<br><br>Alex, thanks for the link!<br><br>JoAnna, don't forget the other side of the picture. The highbrow music was being composed and performed for rich patrons, but there were also dances being played at peasant weddings and wandering bards going from household to household, playing and singing old songs in exchange for a place to sleep and a couple of square meals. Here in the US, Appalachian folk used to have their own musical repertoire, played on cheap fiddles and mountain dulcimers, and those weren't nohow played for rich folks, no sirree. That's likely to come back as cheap electronic music fades into memory.<br><br><a href=#c2672671272227975008 title="comment permalink">8/16/16, 1:08 AM</a><br><br>

It's certainly not about telling you what you should or should not like; it's about encouraging you to like what you like and dislike what you dislike, without letting some self-proclaimed expert tell you that you have to like dog barf or you don't understand art. Does that upset you, and if so, why? <br><br>Shane, is that the collapse of Christianity, or the collapse of a particular kind of Puritan cultural hangover that's been mistaken for Christianity for too long? <br><br>AT, thank you. I agree that communication is an essential part of art; if art does not communicate it fails, and if it deliberately avoids communication -- why, then it's dog barf of the Borborygmist school, no question.<br><br>LatheChuck, in fact, you're exactly the kind of patron who got art through the last set of dark ages. It was churches, supported by the tithes of their parishioners, who provided very nearly the sole venue for most arts (everything but fabric arts, jewelry, poetry, and a few kinds of music) from the fall of Rome to the dawning of the High Middle Ages. <br><br>Zach, so noted. As I pointed out above, it was meant in large part as a counterweight to the very common caricature within the art world that portrays everybody outside that world as a flatulent philistine who hates art. It is also, I think, justified in just enough cases to make it useful as a challenge; in the case of this artwork, how do I know that it's not just dog barf with a pretentious title tacked onto it? <br><br>Monica, good! But you're missing the absolutely classic lowbrow trash in the field of astrology, the newspaper sun sign astrology column -- the Thomas Kincade of the science of the stars. (Though I grant Linda Goodman honorable mention.) In terms of classic writers, I'm personally partial to Llewellyn George and Alan Leo -- possibly worth a glance if you have the opportunity. <br><br>Forever Becoming, that's a completely different world, and yes, it follows very different patterns. One of the things Oswald Spengler points out is that tribal societies don't go through the great cycles that affect and afflict civilizations, and so they can keep on working with the same motifs and ideas for thousands of years and never run out of notional space. I suppose one way to think of it is that they reached the stage of performance early on, and never saw any reason to leave it. <br><br>Violet, excellent. Yes, that works. <br><br>Ganv, not everything lowbrow is trash, nor is everything highbrow necessarily trash; the trash label belongs to the extremes, with kitsch and warhol at the ultimate ends of the curve. Again, if you want scientific warhol, I really think the latest rounds of string theory are the place to look. <br><br>Pinku-Sensei, we were all waiting for you to do it. ;-)<br><br>Unknown, thank you!

As for philosophy, though, I won't argue at all, though I'd have a few other names to put in the classics category, of course. <br><br>Lisa, no, it's not pushing the metaphor too far. The secret to the metaphor is that it's based on social class, and the US is a profoundly caste-ridden society, where the greatest fear most people have is that of being mistaken for a different class. In such a society, "highbrow trash" (that is to say, trash marketed to the affluent) and "lowbrow trash" (that is to say, trash marketed to the masses) are going to be found everywhere. <br><br>Charles, if it gets your gears turning, then it's doing its job. For what it's worth, I didn't think much of Neil Gaiman's <i>Sandman</i> comics either. That said, I'm not really into the genre any more; I read a lot of Batman and even more Green Arrow when I was a kid, and among my vices when I went off to college was Wendi Pini's <i>Elfquest</i> -- I still have a set of the original black and white editions around here somewhere -- but a lot of what I've seen of late, when I've dipped into the field, seems pretentious, glossy, and rather dull.

It had tremendous “feel-good” appeal to the working class being a classic “rags to riches” story set against the backdrop of the American Dream: perseverance, hard work, following your dream, a good woman who believes in you, and a bit of luck will get you success no matter what your class or ethnic background. An utterly predictable plot, and even the profession of the main character, boxing, is at the low-brow end of the world of Sport.<br><br>For high-brow trash I nominate the 1973‘s “The Holy Mountain” by Alejandro Jodorowsky. One possible description of the plot is: “A Christlike figure wanders through bizarre, grotesque scenarios filled with religious and sacrilegious imagery. He meets a mystical guide who introduces him to seven wealthy and powerful people, each representing a planet in the Solar system. These seven, along with the protagonist, the guide and the guide's assistant, divest themselves of their worldly goods and form a group of nine who will seek the Holy Mountain, in order to displace the gods who live there and become immortal“. I saw it at UC Berkeley when it first came out, and it was a real hit with the arty crowd who would project all sorts of personal meaning into it (a bit like abstract art!). <br><br>For classic I nominate 1957’s “12 Angry Men“ by Sidney Lumet staring Henry Fonda. This is a straightforward B&amp;W film set in a single room on a hot day with a jury trying to decide the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murdering his father. Its all about how the phrase “presumed innocent before proven guilty“ actually works out among 12 average men, each of whom brings their own prejudices and preconceptions to the deliberation. Its about Justice, fair play, the trial by jury system, and about how one man who acknowledges his own doubts can influence the other 11 to explore what starts out to be an “open and shut” case. Fantastic naturalistic acting, no gimmicks, and a solid logical tight script. Not preachy and not obvious how its going to end. To me its a classic both as a well crafted movie and as a brilliant piece of social commentary.<br><br><a href=#c8981391926274384235 title="comment permalink">8/16/16, 5:14 AM</a><br><br>

I tried to read several of Doris Lessing's Canopus works as a teenager, simply because I read all fantasy/SF I could get my hands on, and my feeling was that she consciously strove to make her prose disagreeable. I liked to read about the happenings, but hated the way they were transmitted. Now this was in a German translation, so some of the fault may be the translator's.<br><br>Many other works of art I found very hard going, but glimpsed a little bit of beauty here and there, and that encouraged me to go on and struggle till I saw more and more of the beauty. The Divina Commedia, the Aeneid, Moby Dick... I can say it was sincere appreciation of bits of beauty, I was not simply brainwashed into liking the classics, because I did not like book V of the Aeneid at all and in the end skipped it, and I never appreciated Homer enough to read more than a few hundred lines, in spite of trying hard to like him.<br><br>The same thing in music. I loved the first madrigal by Monteverdi I heard in a music store (Sestina, from book VI), bought the CD and heard it dozens of times until I liked 13 of the 14 tracks, and then some more until I appreciated the 14th track, and then other Monteverdi CDs.<br><br>All I mean to say is, I think one needs a small opening into the work of art, otherwise there is no way to judge if it is worth it to spend the effort to go on. Some things will inevitably require effort, but it seems preposterous on the part of the artist to consciously block every sensuous entry and make everything grating on purpose. Your only reason to dedicate yourself to understanding a work of art would then be vanity - "getting it", "being part of the in crowd".<br><br><a href=#c7766263662996335711 title="comment permalink">8/16/16, 10:26 AM</a><br><br>

I have tried different search terms involving "descartes, cartesian, dualism" but with no luck so far.<br><br>I also tried Googling this topic, and it seems to me that almost all post-Cartesian Western philosophy follows the lines of this dichotomy -- either with a bias towards one of idealism or materialism, or just shrugging and taking its assumptions for granted. None of them actually posit a third aspect of existence distinct from mind and body.<br><br>In the Christian world, the tripartite division of body, soul and spirit is a clear version of the idea but even then I can't seem to find sources which discuss how Descartes dropped the idea of spirit completely. The sources which do discuss the Christian tripartite division don't seem interested in comparing it with Descartes or discussing its role in magic. I found a book titled "Magic, Body and the Self in Eighteenth-Century Sweden" on Google Books which seems to deal with non-Cartesian ideas of the self in Swedish folk magic but that's it.<br><br>For a Buddhist perspective, there is an interesting book called "Secret Map of the Body" by Gyalwa Yangonpa, translated by Elio Guarisco, which deals with this.<br><br><br><a href=#c6415645932465364016 title="comment permalink">8/16/16, 12:04 PM</a><br><br>

Errinys, gods of wrath, similar to harry potter dementors. So she stole lots of old stuff. <br><br>Women's rights get short shrift compared to modern but compared to forced marriage it looks pretty good. Helena could have gotten a divorce nowadays then war would have been superfluous and if hagen were tried for murder the bloodletting in niebelungenlied would have been avoided. Of course these were just romantic excuses for real lfe wars based on long built up tensions over political and trade interests but the hate shows through all the same. At any rate, deeper human suffering remains same over time. Human nature is universal, timeless. Antiheroes like hagen, flawed agamemnon are very interesting as opposed to perfect Siegfried for example. The European border being between greece and persia, egypt is shown in plays.

I've even got the T-shirt!"<br><br>That got me thinking about the T-shirt as wearable, self-identifying art, and my attempt at the assignment took a very different direction than I had planned. So...<br><br>Highbrow trash: A shirt I have to admit I owned back in the 80s. Solid black, high quality cotton, slim-fit T with a single very small line over the left breast in a very plain, white text, "Life is hard, then you die." Bought in a trendy New Wave boutique in SF during the latter days of the punk scene there. Definitely trash, it's a T-shirt, after all, but with just enough pretentiousness to appeal to someone straddling the line between wanting social progress and a nihilist desire to burn it all down.<br><br>Lowbrow trash: A big, white, baggy shirt I saw some years later on someone I knew to be working class with garishly colored huge words splashed across the front, "Life's a BI*CH then you DIE!" Never mind the crudity of the language, which to be honest, never bothered me when it suited my purposes, but the actual message was not too subtly changed. The fact that something is hard does not mean that it is... unpleasant..., just something one must get through, and in the end, well, you're still going to die.<br><br>For classic, I'm going to have to go with the skin-tight black T's seen on European badguys and henchmen in James Bond films back in the 60s that first opened a lot of people's eyes to the idea that a T-shirt could be something beside underwear.<br><br>Now, can a T-shirt be something beside trash?

Trump's proposal to defuse hostilities with the Russians and refocus on solving our domestic problems makes a lot of sense to me, of course, whereas Clinton's confrontationalism strikes me as a very good way to drag my <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> scenario out of the realm of fiction and onto the headlines. But we'll see. <br><br>Robert, funny. Yes, that's about right. <br><br>WB, there were equivalent parallels between the Athenian and (early) Macedonian empires. Notice the very large differences: the British Empire was a matter of direct ownership of overseas real estate, the US empire a matter of client states subject mostly to economic control by private industry; the British Empire focused above all else on the control of sea lanes, the US is uninterested in those (even though they remain a paramount strategic factor); "the third world" is a big label, and the areas in which Britain had its most important holdings (south and east Africa, India, Malaya, Australasia) are not the areas where the US has historically exercised the most control (the Middle East, Latin America, western Africa), and so on.

To the extent that I can, I'm going to deconstruct my own personality and rebuild a more effective one. The main reason for that is that when they're diagnosing you, among other things they're checking to see if you have any delusional beliefs. Well, I've been reading the peak oil blogosphere and related material for years now, I've accepted a lot of what I've read as likely to be true, and I think the whole society I'm part of is nuts anyway, so there's lots for them to find!
