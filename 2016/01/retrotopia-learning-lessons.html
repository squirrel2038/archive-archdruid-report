This is the thirteennth installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator finishes up his trip to a tier one county, and starts to notice ways in which the Lakeland Republic has gone neither forwards nor backwards, but off on an angle all its own...</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It must have been midnight, or close to it, when Pappas and I got back to the New Shaker gathering. The shooting went on until four in the afternoon; during a lull in the gunfire, a little after noon, we got into line outside a big olive-green tent in the middle of things, filed in, and left with glasses of beer and sausages and sauerkraut on big fresh-baked rolls. After the last drone was blown out of the air, people milled around while the judges conferred, and then it was time for trophies to be handed out—Maude Duesenberg, who I’d seen shooting earlier, squeaked out another win by a couple of points over a scruffy-looking kid from the mountain country off east. They shook hands, and he grinned; you could tell he was already thinking about getting ready for next year’s shoot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
From there it turned into a big party, with plenty of food—somebody spent most of the day roasting a couple of pigs, just for starters—and no shortage of alcohol, either. Pappas and I ended up sipping moonshine around a fire with the guys from the 34th Infantry, who were already talking about what kind of stunt they were going to pull the following year. The ‘shine was pure enough that I’m honestly surprised that the whole lot of us weren’t lifted into the treetops by a sudden explosion, just from the vapors. As it was, I was tipsier than I usually let myself get by the time Pappas and I headed back to the jeep, and he was worse off than I was. Did you know a wheelchair can stagger? Trust me, I’ve seen it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The next morning came too early, announced by the same overenthusiastic rooster as before. I got myself washed and dressed, and stumbled downstairs, to find Pappas looking as though he’d slept the clock around and was ready for anything. “I’m going to have to get the early train back,” he told me, “but Melanie says you want to see first tier up close, so she found someone to show you around Hicksville—a city councilwoman, I think.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“If she can show me the nearest barber shop first,” I said, “I’d be happy.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Pappas pulled out a pocket watch, glanced at it. “There’s one on Main Street,” he told me. “If we go now you’ll have time to take care of that before she shows up.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That sounded like a good idea to me, so we said our goodbyes to the New Shakers and piled into the jeep for the ride back into town. This time there weren’t more than three or four wagons on the road that had been so crowded two days back; I gathered that most of the attendees were either sleeping off the consequences of the previous night or enjoying a leisurely morning. Fields and pastures eventually gave way to the outlying houses of the town, and then to the main street, which was paved—I hadn’t expected that—and lined on both sides with the sort of shops and city buildings you’d expected to see in an Old West history vid. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“City Hall’s there,” Pappas said as the jeep pulled up in front of the promised barber shop. He pointed to a three-story building of what looked like local stone half a block up the street. “Right next to the library. Ask for Ruth Mellencamp. All set? Hey, it was a pleasure.” We shook hands, I hauled my suitcase out of the jeep, and away it went. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I shook my head and went into the barbershop, and found a half dozen guys ahead of me in line. I’d expected that; what I didn’t expect is that four of them were singing. They had books open in their laps—copies of the same songbook, I gathered after a fast glance—and were belting out some song I didn’t know, and doing it in pretty fair harmony. I sat down in the nearest available chair, tucked my suitcase back under the seat, and all of a sudden had to fight down an impulse to laugh. You can run into a phrase hundreds of times and never think about what it actually means; I must have read at least that many references to “barbershop quartets” without realizing that that’s what guys did in barbershops while waiting for a shave, back in the days when there weren’t loudspeakers in the ceiling blaring pop music everywhere and veepads sitting in everyone’s lap to make up for any lack of distraction. In the Lakeland Republic, obviously, those days were back.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m pretty sure that if I’d picked up a copy of the songbook from the table in front and joined in, nobody would have blinked, and in fact that’s what happened with two of the next three guys to come into the barber shop. The odd thing was that the songs weren’t the sort of thing I dimly associated with barbershop quartets. I didn’t know most of them, but then I’ve got pretty specific musical tastes—jazz on the one hand, and opera on the other. Still, they were pretty good. One that stuck in my memory had a rock beat, and something in the chorus about a star man waiting in the sky. I made a note in my notebook to look it up once I got back home and could chase down the lyrics on the metanet. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was a half hour or so later when I left the barbershop, feeling a lot less scruffy, and with another song’s chorus—“Turn and face the strange ch-ch-changes”—ringing in my head. It wasn’t a bad bit of advice for the day I was about to have, for that matter. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There were sidewalks, too, and I walked up the one that led to City Hall, went in, and asked for Ruth Mellencamp. She turned out to be short, plump, gray-haired, and businesslike, the kind of woman that looks like somebody’s slightly batty granny until she starts talking and you realize there’s a mind like a steel trap behind the cozy facade. “Pleased to meet you,” she said, shaking my hand. “Yes, Ms. Berger called down from Toledo two days ago. It’s not often we get visitors from outside here in Hicksville, and I admit I’m curious to see what you’ll think of our little town.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“So far,” I said, “I know that it has decent train service and you can get an excellent shave here.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She chuckled. “Well, that’s certainly a good start! Why don’t you stash your suitcase here and we can have a look at the town.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I was a little surprised to see paved streets and sidewalks here,” I said as we left the building. “I thought you didn’t have those in a first tier county.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“They weren’t paid for with tax money,” she said. “About ten years ago, some of the business people in town got together, organized a corporation, got a charter from the legislature for it, and used that to raise money to pave six streets downtown. A lot of people contributed, and not just people who live in town. So the streets got built, a fund was set aside to repair them, and the corporation wound up its affairs and closed down.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I imagine you know,” I said, “just how odd that sounds to someone from outside.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Of course.” She gestured down the street, and we turned. “The thing is, that’s what corporations were originally:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>schemes for public betterment that were chartered by one of the old state governments for a fixed term, and allowed to raise money by stock sales for that reason alone. It wasn’t until clever lawyers twisted the laws out of shape that corporations got turned into imaginary persons with more rights and fewer responsibilities than the rest of us.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I remembered what Vinny Patzek told me about corporations at the Toledo stock market. “So you went back to the older way of doing things.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Exactly. We do that a lot here.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ve gotten that impression,” I said dryly, and she chuckled again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Hicksville was a farm town’s farm town, and you could tell. The biggest store in town was a feed-and-seed with big silos out back, next to a rail siding where freight cars could pull up to take on loads of grain, and the next biggest business was a whiskey distillery—“you won’t find a better bourbon in the Republic,” Mellencamp told me—which also had its own rail siding, and a loading dock stacked with cases of bottles ready to ship. Thinking about the tier system when I was in Toledo, I’d conjured up a picture of log cabins, dirt roads, and the kind of squalor you get in the poorer rural districts of the Atlantic Republic these days, but that’s not what I saw all around me in Hicksville. What I saw instead was a bustling, tolerably prosperous community that somehow got by without the technologies everyone outside took for granted. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We stopped in front of another big building of local stone, with HICKSVILLE SCHOOL carved over the door. “I don’t know whether you’re interested at all in our education system,” Mellencamp said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Actually, I am,” I told her. “Ours has problems; maybe I can pick up some useful ideas.” It was half a joke and half the understatement of the year—the public schools all over the Atlantic Republic are a disaster area, and the private schools charge more and more each year for an education that isn’t all that much better.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She beamed. “Maybe you can. We’re very proud of our school here.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We went inside. I probably shouldn’t have been surprised that there were no armed guards in flak jackets standing in the halls—I’d seen none of those elsewhere in the Republic—but it still rattled me. The place was clean and pleasant, without the prison look schools have back home. We went to the office, a little cubbyhole in front with a desk for the secretary and a bunch of filing cabinets, and Ellencamp introduced me; the secretary had me sign in, said something pleasant, and away we went. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“People come here all the time,” Mellencamp explained. “People moving to the area who want to check out our schools, parents and grandparents who have free time and want to volunteer, that sort of thing. It’s very much part of the community.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There were eight classrooms, one for each of the eight grades taught there. We slipped into the back of the second grade classroom, nodded a greeting to the teacher, and sat in wooden chairs up against the back wall. The room was about as plain as could be, a simple square space with a blackboard and a teacher’s chair and desk up in front, a round clock over the door, four big windows letting in light on the left, a teacher’s desk and chair up front, and rows of seats for the students, each with its little half-desk curving forward from one arm. The teacher was maybe thirty, brown-skinned, with her hair in a flurry of braids tied back loosely behind her neck. A blonde girl of sixteen or so was standing next to the desk, reading a simple story aloud, and the students were following along in their textbooks. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I leaned over to Mellencamp. “Who’s she?” I whispered, meaning the girl who was reading. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“An apprentice,” she whispered back, and motioned to a boy around the same age, brown-haired and red-cheeked, who was going from student to student, and now and then squatting down and murmuring something or pointing to some bit in the book. “So’s that one.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave her a startled look, but decided not to risk interrupting. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The story wound to an end, and then the teacher started asking questions about it to one student after another—not the kind of simple you’d expect to see in a test back home, either. It sank in after a moment that she was actually asking the kids for their thoughts about this or that part of the story. I put my hand on my chin. It struck me as a very odd way to run a lesson—wasn’t the point of schooling to make sure that everyone in the class came up with the right answer when it was called for? Not in the Lakeland Republic, I gathered. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The reading lesson ended at ten-thirty sharp—it took me a while to remember how to read a clock with hands, but I managed it—and once it was over, the students and both apprentices got up and trooped out the door in a ragged but tolerably well behaved line. Ruth Mellencamp got to her feet once the last of them were gone, gestured for me to follow, and went to the front of the room. “Angie,” she said, “this is Peter Carr, who’s visiting from outside. Mr. Carr, Angela McClintock.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We shook hands, said the usual polite things. “How long do you have before the next class?” I asked. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The teacher gave me a blank look, then smiled the you-don’t-get-it smile I’d seen too often for my liking already. “They’ll be back in fifteen minutes, after morning recess.” It was my turn to wear a blank look, and her eyebrows went up. “Good heavens, you can’t expect second graders to sit still for an entire school day. Don’t the early grades have recesses where you’re from?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We probably should,” I allowed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You certainly should. If I kept them in much longer they’d be so restless wouldn’t absorb a thing I taught them. This way, fifteen minutes from now they’ll be ready to sit back down and pay attention to the next set of lessons.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded. “I was curious about the two young people who were helping you—apprentices?.” She nodded, beaming, and I went on: “They look a little young to have gotten a teaching degree already—will they go to college and get that after their apprenticeship?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That got me the blank look again, and this time it wasn’t followed by the too-familiar smile. Ruth Mellencamp came to the rescue. “They used to send teachers to college before the war,” she said. “I gather they still do that outside.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And I gather you don’t do that here,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Good heavens, no,” said the teacher. “Why would we? You don’t need a college degree to teach second graders how to read—just patience and a little bit of practice.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“But I’m sure you teach them more than reading,” I objected.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yes, but the same thing’s true of all the three C’s,” she said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s what we call the curriculum,” Mellencamp added, seeing the blank look start to appear on my face. “Literacy, numeracy, naturacy—we call those the three C’s.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I took that in. “So you teach them to read, and then—mathematics?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Literacy’s more than just reading,” McClintock said. “It’s the whole set of language skills—reading, grammar, spelling, logical reasoning, composition and speaking, so they can learn whatever interests them, think intelligently about it, and share what they find with other people. Numeracy’s the whole set of number skills—mathematics, sure, but also the trick of putting things in numerical terms and using math in the real world, so probability, statistics, everything you need to keep from being fooled or flummoxed by numbers.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Okay,” I said. “And—naturacy? I don’t even know the word.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The same principle,” said the teacher. “The whole set of natural science skills: learning how to observe, how to compare your observations to what’s already known or thought to be known, how to come up with hypotheses and figure out ways to test them—and also natural history, what living things you found here, how they interact with us, with their habitats, with other living things.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I suppose you don’t teach that in the schools back home,” said Mellencamp. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“There are college classes,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Most of these kids will grow up to be farmers,” McClintock told me. “Most of those that don’t will be dealing with farmers and the farm economy here every day of their lives. How on Earth will they know how to do that if they don’t understand soil and weather and how plants grow?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Back before the war,” Mellencamp reminded her, “corporate farmers tried to do without that .” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yes, and look what happened.” She shook her head. “I’m not sure we’ve learned everything we should have from the mistakes that were made back then, but that’s one I think we got.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I thought about that on the train that afternoon all the way back to Toledo. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

<div class="avt a_b6373a" id=c5180577373676635369></div><b><a href=http://andrewbwatt.com/ rel=nofollow>andrewbwatt.com</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>A nice look into a school. This has been my chosen profession for about twenty years, and it's interesting to see the return of the "eight room" school house, so to speak. <br><br>I've been thinking about the Millennials generation in the US, lately. There have been a spate of stories in the news about them, blaming them for laziness and ruining the economy and suchlike. The stories made made me consider whether changes in the culture in the last two or three decades of the 20th century might have something to do with the current, alleged "generational divide." And yes, there are five major changes in cultural landscape and education that would have an effect, and I haven't seen these deeply discussed in mainstream news: 1) starting in the 1980s we gutted the home economics and shop curriculums, which taught American young people a range of practical hands-on skills and to put their fancy abstract math into practice. 2) That was the same time that cable television took off, and reading fell from the most common leisure activity to the second. 3) Video games came next, pushing reading from second to fifth. 4) Testing culture (usually for profit-minded reasons by textbook companies) arose in schools at about the same time. 5) The internet's rise gradually brought more forms of entertainment forward, pushing reading from fifth to seventh. <br><br>The return to books in the Lakeland Republic is an important insight. It was already difficult to be a sophisticated reader when young people committed 4-8 hours a week to reading; now most student-aged kids read for less than a half-hour a week. That three-and-a-half hours a week minimum — nearly 200 hours less reading a year than a generation or two before them — is a possible source of some of the complications experienced in my profession these days.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c5180577373676635369 title="comment permalink">1/13/16, 9:25 PM</a><br><br>

I'd planned to have the barbershop quartet singing some ditty Carr didn't know, about a yellow submarine, but a nod to one of the great musical presences of my teen and college years seemed more appropriate, all things considered. (When the news broke, "Changes" was the first Bowie song my wife and I played in his memory.) <br><br>Robert, I don't see a return to prehistory as a likely thing any time in the next few hundred millennia or so; that being the case, picking and choosing useful things from history seems like a good idea. <br><br>9anda1f, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Shane, so noted!<br><br>Frank, I'll see what I can fit in -- there's a lot more to come, and I want to keep the final book below 80,000 words or so. <br><br>Roberta, I hadn't heard; that's really too bad, though not at all surprising. I've come to think that it may be necessary to learn the fine art of founding new fraternal orders -- an art that Americans of both sexes and all ethnicities used to be very, very good at -- to do an end run around institutional fossilization and corruption from the top. <br><br>Hal, I'm sure people are riding them; I'm less sure that anyone's singing that song -- well, other than computers over in the Atlantic Republic. ;-)<br><br>James, I find that funny indeed, as I do many of those things, and some of the ones I don't do, I don't do because they use technology more advanced than I have (e.g., pagers and VHS recorders). <br><br>Max, I haven't read either of those, but I'll have a look as time permits. It's not just a home flipping scam, btw -- it's that, plus fifteen or twenty equally egregious scams, all heaped up on top of one another!<br><br>Sweaterman, you're welcome. I certainly hope people are still listening to, and singing, Bowie's songs in 2065!<br><br>Andrew, getting back to print media is a core element of the Lakeland approach. As Carr noticed earlier, print media is much more information-dense than visual media -- the entire information content of a half hour news program on TV or podcast is about the same as the front page of an average newspaper -- and so a society that relies on visual media will quite simply be more ignorant than one that relies on print media. Because visual imagery is unfiltered by the linguistic/analytic parts of the brain, a society that relies on visual media will also tend to think less and react unthinkingly more often than one that relies on print media. Those aren't things a society can afford over the long term, which is why I expect print media to stage a forceful comeback over the decades and centuries to come.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c7028828871019778215 title="comment permalink">1/13/16, 9:46 PM</a><br><br>

The intrusion in personal rights can hardly be surpassed: A student (beyond the first years) has during class no right to talk or to move on his own initiative, but only when approved by the authority. He can't even go to the window to breath some fresh air. He is not allowed to communicate with his neighbour, but only along a central axis to the teacher and only about topics specified by the latter. The Situation is totally grotesque. Even prisoners in jail have more rights. But instead of fighting for the liberation from these undeserving circumstances, teacher and other authorities complain about missing willingness of students to cooperate, about lazynass, about violence in the classroom. [...]"<br><br>The Essay was written by Fabian Schindler, who also wrote the book "Das Ende der Megamaschine" (The End of the Megamaschine) that talks about the rise and fall of modern western industrial civilization, which may be a book worth to read for german speaking archdruid readers.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c2998248935841753522 title="comment permalink">1/13/16, 9:55 PM</a><br><br>

There's been a good bit of research on the effects this has on early education. You can look up "Foundational Literacy Acquisition in European Orthographies" by Seymour, Aro, and Ershine (2003) for one example. I haven't seen any that look at conceptual reasoning, but all of the studies I've seen have concluded that there's a disadvantage to English speaking children in terms of having to spend something like an extra year gaining basic reading ability while speakers of more recently reformed languages are already on to more advanced studies. I've also seen some that conclude that some students with learning disabilities who are never able to achieve full literacy could actually become fully literate in a language with reformed spelling.<br><br>That being said, I wouldn't support a spelling reform in English. I think it's likely that English will be replaced as a colloquial language by something like Alengo not long after television stops blaring a standard accent into most people's houses day and night, maybe sooner if social pressures are right. When that happens, people still understanding present day spelling will be important in retaining knowledge through decline, and the history preserved in the current spelling system will someday be precious to scholars who study dead languages.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c4255447421800399996 title="comment permalink">1/14/16, 12:09 AM</a><br><br>

There are also words from English roots that are spelled similarly but pronounced differently (e.g, through, dough, rough, cough) and I suppose that has something to do with vowel shifts.<br><br>If you regularize the spelling to make it more perfectly phonetic like Spanish, it will be at the expense of erasing the etymological information. Does that matter to anybody but intellectuals? Yeah, it does. English is full of double, triple, even quadruple homonyms like rain, rein and reign; do, due, dew; there, their and they're. In spoken English, one must rely on context to figure out which word is meant. The meaning of the written sentence is clear if both the writer and the reader can spell.<br><br>It's really hard for an American to make out the meaning of a text written in sixteenth century Scots; the vocabulary is somewhat different from modern English but most of the difficulty comes from words that are cognate to both tongues but spelt differently.

Please excuse if anything I post here has already been discussed before.<br><br>Your basic scheme of a long descent over 100-300 years seems quite plausible by historical and sociological arguments. The one doubt I have with regard to your use of Spengler is that Spengler compared his own moment, around 1900 CE, with the Roman Empire at ~100 BCE, i.e. he expected intra-European wars to end up producing a “Caesar” uniting all of Europe (and North America ?) during the 20th century under his personal rule. Caesarism was supposed to last until ~2200 CE. <br><br>Now, I am certainly convinced that we will all have to reduce our energy consumption way below where it is today, and our mobility even further. In my childhood in the 1980s, we lived in Sierra Leone on 2-3h of locally generated electricity per day, just enough to keep the fridges cool and to listen to an LP once in a while, so I think I can imagine part of the energy-starved future. In fact, I would appreciate living in your Lakeland Republic utopia (I don’t own a car as it is).<br><br>I wonder why you have decided to write a utopia that seems much more attractive than your earlier visions of Christmas 2050, and of Adam in Cascadia (I haven’t read Star’s Reach). Is it to draw readers to a positive destination instead of scaring them? By your own arguments, the Lakeland Republic could not stand the way it is in 2062 for a long time, since I doubt that it could reproduce its books, university curricula (advanced quantum mechanics!) or even steel and concrete at the needed rate if the rest of the world collapsed around it. That means it would be a temporary reprieve on the long descent, certainly a much more pleasant one for those of us alive today than your other visions. I have thought of Aquitania ~700 CE as compared to Britannia or Noricum. Please correct me if you think otherwise (Shandong in 580 CE, and Syria in 650 CE, had suffered much less and were already on the upward part of the cycle).<br><br>(part 1)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c6317554495501390692 title="comment permalink">1/14/16, 2:58 AM</a><br><br>

Would you exclude the possibility that you actually prefer for PV etc. to be an insufficient replacement for fossil fuels because you personally don’t like living in places like Manhattan, San Francisco, don’t appreciate art galleries, fashionable restaurants, high-octane nightlife etc. ? I don’t either - I live in a city of 12 million people and would much prefer a smaller community. However, there are people who love all of that and who would therefore not feel the instinctive preference for a more idyllic, Lakeland Republic-style future. Of course, all of this is irrelevant if the data are unequivocal on the maximum societal EROEI of renewable energy, but I would be grateful if you could post a link to recent calculations on that.

I'd be interested in how the Lakeland Republic evaluates students for suitability for higher/college education. If most are going to be farmers, understandably, how do they filter out those who are strong enough academically to be more advanced college students. These days, it's pretty much assumed that all kids "should" go to college, even if it isn't a suitable path for their skillset. When I was a kid in England in the 60s and early 70s they still had the "11 Plus" system, where you took an academic aptitude test when you were 11 and if you passed (maybe 20% of students did) you went to a high school more likely to get you into college; if you didn't you went to a more technically-oriented high school to prepare you for work on farms or industry. That was considered horribly elitist and was mostly wound down in favor of a less selective system. I agreed with that at the time (it did seem unfair to decide a person's future when they were 11, with a simple school test). But, in retrospect, there is clearly a need to re-think our current college-level education mill: what is it for, who is suitable for it and how is that determined. <br><br>I'm just now in the process of helping my son get out of the college system: after a couple of years studying aquaculture he wants to spend more time doing something practical and hands-on. He loves aquatic life and is into aquaponics and other promising things. But, he says, he hasn't actually touched a fish since he was in high school - all he does in college is write about marine life and study it conceptually. Of course, re-balancing an economy to one in which a college degree is not particularly necessary is a big part of the challenge.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c2412764851618157568 title="comment permalink">1/14/16, 5:28 AM</a><br><br>

For amputations, bloodlettings, or pulling teeth, the barbers were who most people would go to. But these were days before anesthesia and it's bad for business to have horrible screams of pains coming out of your shop all day. So one enterprising barber got the idea to hire a few random people to sing loudly in front of the shop to mask the screams. The music had to be fairly simple so that untrained musicians could pick it up quickly, and repetitive enough to be stretched on for a good chunk of time as the patient is wailing inside.

"hippie" schools). The younger classes were open classroom, rather similar to what you describe, even to the point of two teachers in every class. In high school it shifted to subjects and classes, but the classes were small interactive discussion format. They were more like 800-level doctoral seminars in structure than like conventional high school. It was far and away the best educational environment I have ever encountered directly or indirectly. The schools are still in existence and they retain most of their structure, but they have grown and become a bit more like prep schools in atmosphere. But that may just be the difference between the 1970s and the 2010s; some of the same teachers I had 40 years ago are still there. Tuition was MUCH cheaper in the 1970s than it is now, of course!<br><br>The economy you are envisioning for Lakeland has a pretty high level of self-containment and sustainability, and appears reasonably healthy (though clearly still somewhat experimental). But within your larger historical arc of the long decline, obviously you also envision it as ultimately contracting and simplifying further. So clearly it is still dependent significantly on energy subsidies, either from imports or from the embodied energy of salvageable resources. It is still industrialized, and I guess most of its metals would still have to come from salvage or trade. Just pondering what the other limiting resources are that will eventually compell further contraction.<br><br>Also interesting to me that so far we have seen secularists and christians. 500 years later in Stars Reach the religion seems to have grown out of something resembling deep ecology with a foundation in gaia worship. Do you imagine this as an actual progression, or are these just two different fictional scenarios you are playing with, no historical connection necessarily intended?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c7361047668644711702 title="comment permalink">1/14/16, 6:12 AM</a><br><br>

You went out for fifteen minutes to run around, climb, and roughhouse, got a drink of water and went back to the classroom. At the time, I never appreciated how important recess was to the learning process. Now the solution seems to be to medicate the kids into compliance so that they will sit still and learn to take the standardized tests.

I wish Mr. Carr could have spent more time there. I would have loved to have seen how art and music are handled, how the study of natural philosophy would be enhanced by time outdoors, how literacy, numeracy and naturacy would perhaps incorporate working on "fuzzy problems," related, of course to real-world situations. Even in second grade this can be done. <br><br>Of course I concur with the emphasis on print. In my own house we took this approach--including severely restricting screen time of any sort--and my children did grow up to be pretty good thinkers and self-directed problem solvers. (Ok, I'm boasting; <i>pace</i> any gods listening!) Not only are there in Hicksville similarities with Waldorf, as a commenter noted above, but also with suggestions for the education of children suggested by William Penn in the 17th century and John Dewey in the early 20th century--and others.<br><br>When I was a college instructor, it was a source of aggravation to me that many of my students arrived in my classes able to discuss the problems of the rainforest yet unable to recognize and name the birds, trees and plants of our own region, not to mention having any understanding of the broader ecological functioning of their home ecosystem. <br><br>In the decidedly non-utopian present landscape there are, happily, counter-trends. I have acquaintances involved with three radically differently situated private schools that are offering participatory, holistic education: one in a very poor Illinois community where parents pay on a sliding scale; one in a fairly affluent suburban Indiana community full of well-educated professionals; and one in the city of Chicago run by Quakers. All three are very small; children go there because their parents want a better education than is offered at either the miserable public schools (in the poor community and urban neighborhood) or, alternatively, the overly academically regimented approach of the affluent school district.<br><br>One can only imagine, in a good way, high school, college and the range of schooling combined with apprenticeships that might go into creating a well-functioning society of the sort described in Retrotopia. It would also be enlightening to know how Hicksville schools are funded and administrated.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c9018025019150341396 title="comment permalink">1/14/16, 8:09 AM</a><br><br>

At its core isn't rationality simply a matter of understanding facts and constructing a world view that organizes those facts in a consistent manor? Facts are not truth, but facts and truth are closely related. So why should rationality be incompatible with mental and spiritual health? Indeed, if rationality can be described as handling facts with a bit of wisdom, and mental and spiritual health described as handling truth with a bit of wisdom, are the two not only compatible, but mutually supportive?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c8590460583450326417 title="comment permalink">1/14/16, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

America prints paper - in the form of Treasury debt and US assets such as stocks - to buy energy from abroad.<br> <br>&gt;Because America runs an energy deficit, and must import it, and we cannot export other goods to others to pay for it, we run a trade deficit. It is a problem because there is one scarce commodity which all others are denominated in: oil. Oil is scarce, not because there is not enough energy in the world, but because it is so much cheaper to extract energy from oil than from other sources, and oil can be used to transport goods and people.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c1674269861314898081 title="comment permalink">1/14/16, 9:06 AM</a><br><br>

Perhaps you will have more to say later, with reference to the final post-secondary years? Some of us will be curious to know what level of proficiency is achieved in the last secondary-school year in two key languages, Latin and German, and by what percentage of that graduating cohort. <br><br>On Latin, I hope I will be forgiven for expressing a bit of unease regarding two mottoes which have appeared on ADR this week, in the comments higher up on this Web page. <br><br>(1) Vot meenz "In servitium libertas"? Could Shane W give us the intended meaning? Unless I am missing something, this is not grammatical. If the intention is to say "Liberty in service", "Liberty in the act of serving", "It is in the act of serving that we achieve liberty" (a laudable idea), then we need "In servitio libertas." (The problem is here with "in": "in" requires the ablative if it expresses thing-within-which, and can only take the accusative if it expresses thing-into-which - as when we say "Vado in aquam", with accusative "aquam", for "I am making my way forward INTO the water"; "Vado in aqua", with the noun in the ablative, is, rather, "I am making my forward IN the water.") <br><br>(2) Vot meenz "Splendorem lucis viridis"? Could Eric Backos give us the intended meaning? Unless I am missing something here, this, too, is ungrammatical. If the intention is to say "The splendor of a green light" (a laudable idea), then we need "Splendor lucis viridis." Since "splendorem" is in the accusative, we look in vain in the offered motto for a verb for which that accusative noun is the object. - Admittedly, we could go on to supply a verb: "Demonstremus splendorem lucis viridis" is probably correct for "Let us show forth, let us exhibit, let us make-manifest, the splendor of green light." - The motto could, alternatively, be changed a bit, putting "splendor" into the nominative, and making it the subject (not the object) of an explicit verb: "Splendor lucis viridis luceat" would mean "Let the splendor of a green light shine forth," "May the splendor of a green light shine forth." <br><br><br><br>A little anxiously,<br><br><br>Tom (near Toronto)<br><br>Toomas(dot)Karmo(at)gmail(dot)com<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c953144345394653091 title="comment permalink">1/14/16, 9:19 AM</a><br><br>

At least that's the case in every country I've had the chance to encounter them, and that's quite a few countries now.

For example, the students are all involved in a larger project to study the waterm ecology, etc of the Bosque -- our riverside woodlands running through the middle of the city. I found out by accident recently that she is studying Latin. <br><br>I, being made keenly aware of the need to downsize because her mother is in the process of moving her granddad (my ex) to an assisted living home close to where they live, and realizing that the days of getting any added value out of many of my cherished books was past, offered my granddaughter my old Latin textbooks and reference books, hoping she might have some use for them. She was delighted and told me the school could always use them! Then I asked if they could also use others, and set aside my two ecology textbooks and my book on reason and the scientific method, which again she was delighted to have. <br><br>There comes a time when the best use one can make of such books is to pass them on to the younger generation. The next one out the door is Aesop's Fables, to my youngest grandnieces. Alas that you can NOT get a copy of those without the canned moral tacked neatly onto the end, rather than letting the kids figure out and debate the points of the story. What a thought-stopper those canned morals are! And not always true for all times and places.

It was a 'non-coercive education', which meant you picked what you learned and there were no grades. It worked better for some students than for others. Some who'd spent all their energy at regular school fighting the teachers actually came to class and started learning, while others chose not to learn much. <br><br>I liked it because there was a much wider acceptance of difference and that meant I stopped getting bullied. It worked better for elementary school than highschool, as it was quite difficult to find someone willing and able to teach math and science at that level, and a lot of the other students weren't that interested. <br><br>Elementary schools in BC still have recess.

Tasmania is an island state to the south of the state of Victoria and is separated by a 300km (about 190 mile) stretch of very rough shallow water. It used to be a land bridge which the roaring forties now rise over and across.<br><br>Anyway, that island state gets most of its electricity from hydro-electricity. In a sensible move a few years back now a large DC electric cable was laid across Bass Strait to connect the island up to the national electric grid. Electricity can be sold in both directions. It is very clever really.<br><br>However, just before Christmas the cable was damaged somewhere along its length in the rough seas. And apparently the contractors reckon it may take two months to repair.<br><br>This long repair time wouldn't usually be a problem, except with the heat and lack of rainfall down here, the dams are running low. 21.2% to be correct. Farmers are screaming for the water to be released to them. People still expect to have electricity. It is quite the circular problem and no one seems to have any answers because perhaps there are no answers. Most water in dams below about 12% - I believe - is not particularly useful as it is very low in oxygen and probably contains a lot of particles to boot. Anyway, it is an interesting look into how contradictory outcomes can't be achieved in an era of declining resources.<br><br>The article can be found here: <a href=http://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/minister-dismisses-opposition-claims-of-power-rationing-with-hydro-tasmania-dam-levels-set-to-fall-to-16pc/434389 rel=nofollow>Minister dismisses Opposition claims of power rationing with Hydro Tasmania dam levels set to fall to 16pc</a>.<br><br>It is weird isn't it?<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c8432472184696266117 title="comment permalink">1/14/16, 2:24 PM</a><br><br>

I do it on a shoe-string. If you use the public library system wisely and shop smartly you can do it for very, very little. Who would be open to you will depend on what you want to do and what your personal philosophy is. Some of my friends would require you to agree with their beliefs. I wouldn't go that far--I'd simply want you to not engage against our beliefs. Each state has different laws about how home school can work. While HSLDA tends to be a bit extreme for my tastes (if they'd stick to legal defense and stay out of lobbying not-home-school issues I'd be happy to pay up and join) they have an excellent overview of the relevant laws.<br>If you seriously want to help home schoolers, ask your local public librarian (every home schooler I know makes use of the library's books) if they can put you in touch with anyone who home schools.

But of more interest to you, JMG, is that my husband Mike and I (more Mike than me though I actively supported him in the effort) advocated successfully for the use of Robert's Rules of Order to govern our board meetings, persuading the rest of the board members to use it rather than consensus process.

After they opened, members of our community association were invited to tour the one nearby. One of the three principals (there is one for each grade) conducted the tour. It was creepy. The principal extolled the security system. There is one floor per grade level, with student IDs color-coordinated to the color scheme of each grade so the staff can tell at a glance if a student isn't where he or she "belongs." The administration office is in the center of the school and has glass walls so the administrators can watch students at all times. Students have 90 seconds (!) to get from one class to another and have to ask the teacher for a pass to use a bathroom. Of course there are security cameras everywhere. The principal took us to a science classroom, which had an exposed ceiling. The acoustics were horrid even for our group of quiet adults. The library had low bookshelves so, as we were told, no students could hide out there without being seen. And so on. Mike and I were aghast.

As John Michael suggested, that kind of "truth" has to be brutally mutilated to fit inside the constricting box of rationality.

Intangible, constantly adapting moral stories, models, and myths are probably the best tools our species has for attaining the dynamic balance we call mental health. Alas, those fluid stories and beliefs go through a natural cycle of petrification into dogma, both at a personal and cultural level, rendering them also into the best tools we have for destabilizing the dynamic balance we call mental health.<br><br>Hence why our own and our culture's death is finally such a gift for each of us, and more so for our offspring. It is not only our physical health that eventually becomes too brittle to be able to adapt to the constant change life requires. The fracturing of the dogma of the modern worldview occurring all around us is another example of a destabilized rigidity returning to dynamic balance, i.e. a crazy world returning to mental health. It's a very traumatic process akin to death.<br><br>Once one set of beliefs comes to define us, "truth" no longer describes the output of the models we use to filter our minds -- "truth" becomes the models themselves.

As far as my supposed dislike of big cities, etc., that's actually not true at all; I'm basically a city boy, and enjoy urban life a great deal. If there were good reason to think that a modern society could be supported on renewable resources, I'd be pleased; in the real world, though, hard realities rooted in the laws of thermodynamics mean that that's not going to happen, and pretending otherwise does nobody any good. <br><br>Sunny, I don't have any plans along those lines, no. As for education, one of the things a good teacher can do is show you why something is worth learning!<br><br>Tony, thank you. <br><br>Mikep, both of those things are based on actual practice in 19th century America, so yes, they can work. <br><br>Dan, thank you for buying a copy of any kind! The unnamed beast really doesn't mind, though -- I think it sheds its skin annually, when it gets too rugose...<br><br>Mark, college admissions in the Lakeland Republic are by competitive examination. Schools aren't designed to funnel children into any particular occupational category -- they're there to provide an education in literacy, numeracy, and naturacy, as well as such other topics as civics, history, and languages, that will make it possible for graduates to function well in society. Those who want to go to college and are willing to work hard to make that happen generally succeed, but most have no interest -- many of the professions that now require college degrees (teachers, general-practice physicians, engineers, lawyers, accountants, etc.) are filled by apprenticeships in the Lakeland Republic, so the notion that you have to go to college to get a good job has dropped completely out of circulation. You go to college because you want to pursue one of the learned professions that really do require that kind of education, and not otherwise. <br><br>As for Bowie songs, it would probably be possible to make an entire Lakeland album out of his work! ("TVC-15" as the Atlantic Republic theme, for example...) <br><br>Charles, funny. Nah, barbershop quartets got started because men used to gather in barbershops before work to get a good shave, singing was a common entertainment, and so it became customary for the guys to do a capella songs while they waited for their turn under the razor. <br><br>Dave, I get that. If I hadn't somehow picked the bulletproof conviction that things were going to be better once I got out on my own -- as in fact they were -- I'd probably have thrown myself under a truck at some point during the utter misery of the wasted years I spent in public schools. <br><br>Donalfagan, the street is paved in cut stone, and yes, they sing that song, too, but with the original words. <br><br>Bill, good -- you're paying attention. As I noted in response to an earlier comment, we'll be talking about the broader trajectory later on. As for <i>Star's Reach</i>, nah, this is a different future -- in the Star's Reach future, the United States of America continues to exist in name, while in the Retrotopia future, the Second Civil War came much earlier and the Union ceased to exist when it was over. <br><br>Chris, when you say it's maddening that you can't have schools that work, have you considered the alternatives, which include helping to create schools (outside the current education industry, granted) that do work?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c3095463042046250808 title="comment permalink">1/14/16, 9:09 PM</a><br><br>

If your book is partly based on your experiences as an Odd Fellow, that gives it additional interest for me. <br><br> Compared to the way fraternal organizations have declined in numbers and influence, service organizations like the Lions and the Rotary seem to be doing well. Their activities are covered by local newspapers, and one sees highway signs with symbols of multiple service clubs when driving into towns of any size. Can you explain what the differences are between service organizations of this kind and fraternal organizations, and why the former seem to have coped with social and economic changes better than the latter?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c7965709472384321224 title="comment permalink">1/14/16, 9:53 PM</a><br><br>

I've read, by the way, that the Mexican public school system is considerably better than ours -- is that true? If so, once things fall apart here, we might be able to import some competent teachers and administrators from your side of the Rio Grande to do what our current public schools don't do -- that is, provide an education to children. <br><br>Glenn, you're welcome. <br><br>Adrian, good -- my hope is exactly that, to get people imagining something different than the failed mess we've got. As for Lakeland Republic schools, they're entirely funded and managed by local school districts governed by elected school boards, subject only to a very modest degree of oversight by government -- the system that gave the US some of the best public schools in the world in the first half of the 20th century. <br><br>Hapibeli, delighted to hear it. Have you joined the Lions? If not, why not?<br><br>TJ, the rational mind is a very recent evolutionary construct perched on top of a superbly adapted primate nervous system and brain. Like most new releases, the rational mind is riddled with bugs, and though it can do some very impressive things, it also tends to run off the rails catastrophically on a routine basis, producing models of the world that are perfectly self-consistent and logical but fail to model the experienced universe in a galaxy of disastrous ways. The conscious rational mind is also unstable, working in fits and starts at the best of times. Most human mental activity isn't governed by rational schemes, but by genetic programming absorbed by the species over evolutionary time and cultural programming absorbed by the individual in childhood. Far more often than not, that irrational programming is better adapted to life in the real world than the abstract models the rational mind uses, because it's been debugged by selective pressures over time. This is why, for example, "book learning" is so useless in most practical contexts, and why attempts to make the world behave according to some rational scheme so consistently end in disaster. More on this in a future post. <br><br>BoysMom, home schooling and little one room schoolhouses are standard throughout the rural areas of Tier One counties -- the eight room schoolhouse in Hicksville is a very common small town design, while bigger Tier One towns such as Defiance have several small primary schools feeding into one larger secondary school.

You can get an electric organ for a good deal less. By one of those improbable accidents you can't get away with in fiction -- there was one here in the house when we moved in, and all the local Masonic lodges have them for lodge music -- I've been learning how to play the electric spinet organ; I hope at some point to graduate to the parlor organ or melodian, which is the same thing with a foot pump substituting for the electricity. <br><br>Revere, that's a good point, which I haven't explored yet. <br><br>Max, but there again, you're paying attention to only one part of the problem -- even if it's the foundation, you don't understand a building if all you examine is the foundation. <br><br>Chris, the railroads are privately owned and built, by way of limited liability partnerships of the kind already discussed. As noted in one of the early episodes, the only things local governments own are natural monopolies, such as electricity grids, sewage systems, trolley systems, and consumer banking. The national government stays out of business altogether, so it can exercise its proper economic function of maintaining such basic regulation as is needed to keep abuses from happening. Everything else is up to entrepreneurs and the private investors, small and large, who fund them via stock and bond purchases. <br><br>Toomas, the most common second language in the Lakeland Republic is Spanish, which is rapidly becoming the lingua franca of trade and culture throughout the western hemisphere in 2065. Chinese, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, and Quebecois French have become common subjects of study since the embargo ended, largely for the sake of trade, tourism, and international relations. German? A European language no more relevant to the middle of North America than Polish or Italian. Latin? A dead language no more relevant here than Sanskrit or classical Chinese. (I quite understand that things are different in Estonia, and also in the Estonian diaspora.) Mind you, you can study German, Polish, Italian, Latin, Sanskrit, and classical Chinese at Lakeland universities, should you be minded to do so, and I'm sure that the Goethe-Institut has a nice facility in Toledo somewhere close to the German embassy; it's just that the focus of education in the Lakeland Republic is not based on Central European models. <br><br>Mgalimba, you might want to go back and reread the post before yelling. I didn't say a thing about conventional farmers; the comment was about <i>corporate</i> farmers -- specifically the absentee-ownership model, very common these days, that buys up large acreages at low prices, uses them as a cash cow, puts nothing back into the soil, runs crop after crop until nothing will grow, and then simply walks away. There'll be more about that as we proceed. <br><br>Grandmom, er, you may want to go back and reread the post, because two apprentices made a rather visible appearance in there, and that might be thought to answer your question. <br><br>Hhawhee, true enough. When the corporation laws were twisted out of shape for the benefit of the railroad interests, they somehow forgot to ban the older kind of public-benefit corporation, so it's still an option. <br><br>Grandmom, and yet a century ago those same public schools provided an objectively better education -- measured in dramatically higher rates of effective literacy and every other measure -- than the public schools have today. Of course public schools of all kinds have problems; the two points that get lost in such discussions is that, first, so do all the other options, and second, the problems of public schools have gotten much, much, much worse over the last half century or so.

That's the thing about the old rules of order: ***They work.*** A well run meeting using rules of order is fast, well organized, and effective, and if it's done right, informal consensus backed up by the option of majority rule yields decisions everyone can live with.

A lot depends on what happens when the whole thing's finished and I can go through it again as a single connected story; that's when I decide what needs editing, expansion, deletion, rewriting, etc. Since this is a utopian narrative rather than a novel, it's going to have more talking heads in it and less drama -- that's a matter of the conventions of the genre -- but we'll see how it turns out. <br><br>Chris, thank you!

The ice age kerfuffle in the 1970's was largely confined to a few edge cases in the scientific community, most of whom changed their minds as new calculations of the efficacy of CO2 as a greenhouse gas came along, as well as improved calcs of the Milankovitch effect, and some widely publicised works such as Nigel Calders' "The Weather Machine and the Threat of Ice", and the linked BBC program. The popular works had an effect grossly disproportionate to their actual scientific content, unfortunately. I should know: I was an enthusiast for the book and the program... I later learned otherwise.<br><br>The current best understanding is that as of the end of the last major stadial, or Ice Age, we are now heading into an Interstadial, or between major ice ages. This interstadial will last about 50,000 years, and would have contained periods of cooling and warming, but NOT on the scale seen during a stadial. Over the last 3000 years before the industrial revolution we have generally seen a slight slow cooling consistent with the current Milankovitch cycle. This would have lasted for a few thousand more years before a slow slight warming; repeat half a dozen times. HOWEVER... humanity has dumped enough CO2 into the atmosphere over the last 100, or 50, or 25 years to disrupt these slow changes to the extent that the coming interstadial will be, probably, about 2 degree C to 4C warmer than otherwise. This is not good news. Furthermore the longterm persistence, of the order of 100,000 to 200,000 years, of the bulk of that CO2 will be enough to boost the average temperature of the NEXT stadial (50,000 to 100,000 years ahead) clear of widespread icy conditions, and even modify the stadial after that by 1-2C, which will be enough to warm an otherwise cold world significantly. <br>The wikipedia article on Milankovitch cycles is a reasonable starting point, and has references to websites that allow calculations of the Milankovitch effect for a million years or so either side of now. I would also recommend the realclimate.org website - the "Start Here" button for a lead into accurate climate change info.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c1272115382232005515 title="comment permalink">1/15/16, 4:30 AM</a><br><br>

It brought home to me again how much primary education has changed for the worse since I was a boy. My elementary schooling (K-6) was in smallish schools very like the school that Peter Carr visits, and I got a lot out of it. The next three years (7-9) included woodshop, metal shop, print shop (yes, with movable type!), and mechanical drawing alongside of more academic subjects (including Latin). I did not mind going to school at all, and I positively looked forward to some parts of each day there. <br><br>Fast-forward 25 years, and both our children were basically imprisoned and burdened in by the school system, though there were a few shining exceptions among their teachers who actively subverted the regimentation, and were also savvy enough to cultivate independent bases of personal power among the families that let them oppose the school administration. But they were both intelligent and motivated enough to educate themselves outside of school. We had taught them both to read before they ever set foot in Kindergarten, which did give them a leg up. <br><br>Another 25 years down the road, and not one of our friends who teach in the public schools has had the strength to stick it out for a full 40-odd years until reachign retirement age. The public schools have become prisons for the teachers as well as for the students. And all this is driven not (as some politicians would have it) by teachers' unions, but by lawyers and risk-managers, who seem to be a huge part of every school administration these days. Even the other administrators seem to be trapped by these considerations.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c2034107456546103849 title="comment permalink">1/15/16, 7:12 AM</a><br><br>

If it were to be massively changed, most young people would soon be unable to read and understand any of the billions of books that had been published before the change. As it is, even without any change in spelling, older books already pose something of a challenge to young readers in so many ways: spoken English seems to me (as a historical linguist) currently to be undergoing changes in grammar and syntax on the order of the phonetic changes several centuries ago that scholars now call "the Great Vowel Shift." If so, then we are in the middle of "the Great Grammar shift," which will eventually make Melville and Irving as hard to read without special training as Chaucer is now.<br><br>Also, English spelling is very far from the "chaotic mess" that would-be reformers like to claim. There is an underlying system for the "English" component of the vocabulary, and quite another system for the "Latinate" component, but each has its own rules. Knowing these rules, I found it almost effortless to teach my own children to read English aloud when they were about 4 years old, and they picked up the skill rather quickly. Of course, reading a written text aloud in your native language is by no means all that a child must eventually learn to do, but it is the basis for everything else in literacy and nearly everything else in education generally. We started our children reading with the "Peanuts" comics, which at that time were collected in thin booklets, wider than they were tall.<br><br>If one is curious about the spelling rules for English, a rather good source is Axel Wijk's _Rules of Pronunciation for the English Language_ (Oxford University Press, 1966). Another is Robert A. Hall Jr.'s _Sound and Spelling in English_ (Chilton Books, 1961). Each presupposes that you are fairly intelligent yourself, and can understand in fine detail how pronunciation and spelling differ in principle. And each uses a form pf phonetic transcription to make its points, so the reader will have to calibrate that transcription aghainst his or her own pronunciaion to understand what it means. (These are the books I studied before starting to teach my own children.) <br><br>Less technical, but almost as useful, is the "Guide to Pronunciation" published as one of the introductory articles in Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language, 2nd edition (and only in the 2nd edition). A briefer, and even simpler, account of the same things is on the introductory pages of that ancient chestnut, Noah Wenster's Spelling Book.

Just as there is an old and strong tradition of anti-intellectualism in the United States, so there is an equally old and strong tradition of anti-Europeanism here. The elites in the 13 colonies, of course, remained hugely European in their culture, even when they openly rejected or challenged aspects of that heritage. But the masses ... ah, well, they tended to reject everything European uncritically, and forge their own home-grown replacements for it. <br><br>And there was also a sort of sifting process, at least in New England and the Mid-Atlantic States, during the period from about 1770 until after the War of 1812, when anyone who seemed too loyal to European (and especially British) institutions was forced northward, into what now is Canada. Often enough, the sifting was extremely violent, and some of the ones who made it to Canada were lucky to get there alive, with only what they could wear or carry in their clothes.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c4131439265335929590 title="comment permalink">1/15/16, 7:53 AM</a><br><br>

(Myer's, with its immense "face" or Bourke Street facade, has to some degree tried to be the Melbourne equivalent of Harrod's in London - hence Cherokee's cited put-down for an excessively tall poppy, "More face than Myer's." Upscale Myer's, perhaps in the 1940s or 1930s, had to advertise a sale, and Myer's consulted an appropriate Melbourne classicist, and the classicist advised Nyer's to put onto their huge storefront banner the inscription <i>Caveat emptor</i>, and people around town kept asking the Myer's management in their blunt Australian manner "What's it mean?" or even "Don't you think you had better find out what it means?", and Myer's rang up the classics prof, and the prof reassured Myer's by saying "Oh that, <i>Caveat emptor</i> - yes, of course, that means, ah, 'For the discerning purchaser'.") <br><br>The Melbourne Latinist from whom I have this story is the late Gavin Betts, of Monash Uni (in the Melbourne suburbs, on the rail line from Flinders Street toward Dandenong). Betts's Latin intro book is in all the bigger general-trade bookstores here in Toronto, and I suspect across the Anglo world. <br><br>(3) Betts also told us, when I took his class, another quite good, although I regret smutty, story about Latin. He was one find day minding his own business, boarding a bus, when he suddenly noticed on the uniform or briefcase of a boy from some private school a school motto gone wrong. The school had meant to write <i>Age viriliter</i> ("Act like a man"; I think this is Saint Paul, as translated from the Greek in the Biblia Vulgata), and instead wrote <i>Virile agitur</i>. This amazing, completely porno, thing must have gone (as Prof. Betts stressed to us) everywhere: if it was printed on a briefcase or a uniform, it must also have gone onto such things as the school letterhead, the school ashtrays, the school souvenir letter-openers, the entire bleeding lot - ultimately requiring repairs mounting into the tens of thousands of dollars. <br><br>Cherokee might be able to comment further, but I for my part want to underscore here that Melbourne, or at any rate a vocal sector in the society of Melbourne, is noted for a prim, English propriety, in contrast with the matey tones of Sydney. <br><br>This Melbourne ethos, closely attached to the Old School Tie, is successfully lampooned by a Melbourne bloke-in-drag comic, Dame Edna Everage, these days visible on YouTube. Prof. Betts is briefly noted in the Latin Vicipaedia at <a href=http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Betts rel=nofollow>http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Betts</a>. "Caveat emptor" is of course discussed in many places on the Web - Wikipedia, notably, has articles in 16 languages. <br><br><br><br>Currendo, <br><br><br>Tom <br><br><br>(in Estonian diaspora, near Toronto; <br>in Australia some years ago) <br><br>Toomas(dot)Karmo(at)gmail(dot)com<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c5288818962900491157 title="comment permalink">1/15/16, 7:53 AM</a><br><br>

Your summary is off.<br><br>@JMG Of course the literacy rates were higher in 1880 than now; the scientific management of children didn't begin until closer to 1920. The more studies and experts we apply to education, the worse it gets. The only people who had a decent public school education were those at the outer reaches of the system - like the commenter here who had latrines and one room school house basically. Schools have become massively centralized prisons with kids bussed in for an hour ride or more because it is deemed more efficient with better cost-savings. Kids are tagged, tested, tracked and sorted.<br><br>The public school system will be the last thing to fall, like the US military. It is the biggest employment project in the country, taking incredibly average people and paying them salaries usually twice what they could get being employed anywhere else in their community today. It is the biggest food buyer, book buyer, computer buyer and cleaning supplies buyer. The sports teams are a central part of rural community social life. <br><br>The more the schools fail, the more money we pay them to try to succeed. Teachers hardly get evaluated, all get raises no matter what, and they can retire after 25 years of employment. It is quite the racket. It is so good that USAID has worked to install this system in other countries.

It takes usually two forms, either the troubled delinquent(s)/gang banger type(s) who gets turned around through persistent efforts, or the kid(s) with learning disabilities or other reasons to be labeled "stupid" that gets turned around by similar persistent efforts. I think it's telling that the law was labeled "No Kid Left Behind", as an idea where our goals are. But if resources in the future are short, and needs and demands are long, we may have to reassess this myth. With finite resources, it may not be prudent to spend so many of them turning around the most needy, especially if its at the expense of those ready and able to learn. The onus may be back on the "delinquent" to conform to society's expectations and not to "be reformed" by the system. The kid with learning difficulties presents another challenge, but it may be like diseases and medicine, that we've discussed here before, that hard choices will have to be made.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c1672258316616318058 title="comment permalink">1/15/16, 8:42 AM</a><br><br>

He asked me to start a design program — basically, an umbrella term for just about anything I felt like teaching. It's now a bit of a grab-bag of skills during the academic day: graphic design, book design and bookbinding, some simple carpentry, some simple sewing, some computer programming, some tool-repair and sharpening work (of stuff I buy from yard sales). Kids as young as kindergarten are building toys out of recycled or up cycled materials; third graders learn to knit and make jewelry (beadwork and wire-wrapped stones mostly) and spin wool; fifth graders learn some sewing skills - making a pencil case, a sort of jacket/tunic thing to learn how to read a clothing sewing pattern, and to use a sewing machine, and a lunch-bag. Sixth through eighth graders build some basic furniture pieces out of wood like peg boards and game boards. and design projects for kids in lower grades than them. The program is five years old at this point, and it's spun off some additional work in board- and card-game design, in model-making, and in architectural models built of paper and chopsticks bought in bulk. We've also done some hand-building of electronics - an AM radio or two, learning how to build batteries and make lights light up and motors move and how to build electromagnets; and some chemistry like soap-making, and so on. A girl in one of my classes built a proportional model of a Greek temple this week using nothing but the Golden Ratio and the Pythagorean theorem to cut her parts from plywood and wooden doweling. It's extraordinary.<br><br>A large measure of the success of this kind of program is that a teacher must put their own standing on the line, and decide that hands-on skills are important (because what the hands do, the mind understands). And then you have to be prepared to argue for that work, day in and day out, for years. After five years, I've won this particular battle — it's had an extraordinary effect on our students, and everyone from the board to the parents to the children knows it. But it's very much a personal mission for me — without the person do lead the program, me, I have very little confidence that the program could continue.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c6893063769032405456 title="comment permalink">1/15/16, 11:21 AM</a><br><br>

When I was in school in the mid-90s, I thought nothing about keeping a carton of smokes in my locker. Even kids without smoking permits would light up in their cars before they even left school grounds. I can't imagine what happens to kids today if they get caught with a pack of smokes or a can of dip. Kids on the yearbook staff were able to leave school to sell ads. Even though it's gotten worse, I felt like middle &amp; high school was a prison sentence.<br>To those who homeschool out there, is there anything to help the less fortunate from being trapped in the System?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c5964359872457621476 title="comment permalink">1/15/16, 1:38 PM</a><br><br>

I was so busy going: blah, blah, blah, that I completely forgot the following:<br><br>Congratulations on completion of your new book. The leather bound editions sound beautiful and it was a thoughtful touch. You've been alluding to that style of fiction for a while now, and I was personally wondering whether you had that idea in the back of your mind for a few years now, or did it arise at the time that you wrote the blog entry? Either way, you are a prolific author. Respect.<br><br>Given your natural gifts with languages, you'll probably pick up the piano quite easily (maybe). Music is really just another language. <br><br>Alas, I must sit back and wonder at such things from afar as they are a bit outside my reach. To be honest my head is stuffed full of the details of plants, animals and all the systems here...<br><br>Speaking of music I was cutting up the summer fruits for my breakfast when a silly interlude to your story popped up into my imagination: I do understand the David Bowie reference, but the customers could also have been signing an ode to the Atlantic Republic in the form of Billy Joel's song: "<a href=http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billyjoel/allentown.html rel=nofollow>Allentown</a>". If you were unaware it is a prophetic song about the developing rust belt written more or less at the time! It may surprise some of the readers here that Billy Joel was considered a punk way back in the 70's. A very talented musician that guy.<br><br>I probably would have sung a bit of Pink Floyd, or maybe even the Smashing Pumpkins: Yes, despite all my rage, I'm still but a rat in a cage! :-)! But then I enjoy today's Indie releases too when few my age seem to.<br><br>Oh, sorry also forgot. My gut feeling is that down here in the southern hemisphere, the climate has shifted south, so Tasmania may be getting my more usual sort of summer... Certainly things are weird. As an interesting comparison too, I keep adequate reserves of everything when storing energy from nature because there is no other way to do it.<br><br>Hi Helix,<br><br>Thanks for your experience with roosters. I've met some pretty nasty customers in my time with that lot, but also some quite gentlemanly roosters - and I can't pick which will be which. Also if they free range, they will be eaten - no doubt about it. The powerful owls will get them at night, if the foxes don't climb the trees first!<br><br>Hi eagle eye,<br><br>Best wishes for your safety. I've been wondering about the climate shifting south as the tropics seem to have expanded this year. What is your view on the ground about that? Certainly I seem to be getting southern NSW weather, which is very weird...<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c1350630412199476879 title="comment permalink">1/15/16, 2:44 PM</a><br><br>

I truly hated most of my classes, but had a couple of wonderful teachers in my Electronics and other Shop classes. My Electronics teacher was very smart and realized that some of his students were different, we were pretty much allowed free reign to work on whatever we wanted, what I learned from my father and in this class did more for me than anything else. About 5-6 of us were always waiting at the classroom door when Mr. Hall arrived in the morning and we were in his classroom after school until he left.<br><br>Same kind of teacher, Mr. Hazzard, in Welding (Gas &amp; Electric), Machine shop (Lathe, Milling machine) and Metalworking (Sheet Metal, Forging, etc.) If it hadn't been for these classes in my high school years, I don't know how I could have survived!<br><br>One other great teacher in my Algebra and Trig class was Mr. Battle. He really knew how to get things across. He'd spend about the first half of the period introducing a subject, then the second half he'd lead a class group discussion on how this was used in the real world and how to do it. You left the class with a real appreciation of the subject.<br><br>As far as the Mexican education system, I can't speak for today, but back in the 1960's when I was in 4th grade, I spent a few months in an English-speaking school in Puebla, Mexico. It was an eye opener then to see that the same grade Math in Mexico was at least a grade ahead of what was being taught in the USA. <br><br>I also remember when the "New Math" came out in 5th grade, my father going into the Principal and giving him hell over the BS that was being taught for Math, my father's minor in college was Mathematics.<br><br>About 10 years ago I had a friend that was a 3rd/4th grade teacher. For math, I was astounded to see how badly math was now taught. Each week was a different section, one week they'd be doing the 6x table, the next week division of fractions, then the 4x table multiplication of fractions might be 4 weeks later. Amazing to take the multiplication table apart and present it as separate, un-related parts. There was NO showing how anything tied together, related things would be taught months apart. Nothing to show how one thing built on another. I couldn't believe anybody came out of that class knowing anything! She had no choice in this, each week was planned out ahead of time.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c1548165442506306522 title="comment permalink">1/15/16, 3:10 PM</a><br><br>

Happy to be back with our Mr. Carr on his 'look-see' through the LLR. As a primary school Art teacher, I, like Patricia, (Thank You, Patricia, well said!) would have loved to linger in the classroom a bit longer to see how art and music are integrated into the coursework. If I may be so bold, I would respectfully suggest, in any rewrite - you may adorn that simple, clean, bare 2nd grade classroom with the children's artwork as related to the current subject unit. Displaying the children's artwork is very powerful in instilling a strong sense of belonging and accomplishment. <br><br>Our schools, (The British international school I work at and my own kids' American international school) have a more complex array of subjects, even for younger grades, including once a week: art, music, Chinese, PE, religion and computer tech. Cookery and gardening are integrated in the science and math curricula as they are hands-on applications to these disciplines. Apart from the size of the schools and array of subjects integrated, the Hicksville School seems very familiar and fairly similar to our schools. I have come to learn that both of our schools' administrations have both had to fight to maintain the old fashioned, slower, age-appropriate "whole-child" approach against the great tide of getting ahead earlier and earlier!, manic test-prep, 24/7 study and exclusive emphasis on STEM, STEM, STEM! (Science and maths above all else). As you can imagine, here in Asia, that great tide is supremely strong among many Tiger-Mom/Dad parents as well as governmental educational oversight boards. Ironically, both of our schools consistently rank academically, amongst the highest in the world. <br><br>I also wanted to let you know that my youngest son, a HS Sophomore, is currently learning peak oil theory in his humanities course, (his favourite course!) From our nightly dinner conversations, I'd be shocked if his teacher is not very familiar with your work. I will ask him, next time I see him. This is fantastic. My son is really reformulating his ideas about his own future; what he will do, how he will function and thrive in a 'lesser' economy. The best aspect is that he doesn't see this as a bad thing, just a different thing. It's not doom and gloom, just different options and expectations for him to aspire to.<br><br>Thanks again!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c559085155407282772 title="comment permalink">1/15/16, 4:03 PM</a><br><br>

The kid with learning difficulties presents another challenge, but it may be like diseases and medicine, that we've discussed here before, that hard choices will have to be made."<br><br>I may be off on this, but I don't think a lot of 'extra' financial resources are actually needed or useful in turning a troubled kid around or helping along one with specific learning difficulties. I suppose that would depend on how severe the difficulties. IF the initial resources are spent, as illustrated in this story and as predominantly practiced in the school I work in; max. class size 24 kids, 2 teachers, or 1 teacher one full time in class TA, 1 parent volunteer per day or 1 teaching apprentice. IOW: 3 adults for 24 kids. A sane schedule, including recess, lunch break, sitting on the carpet/story time, as well as the smaller regular breaks from desk time: check on the garden/butterfly or meal-worm farm time. <br><br>With 3 adults, (and JMG is totally on target - they don't have to have very much training, they just have to have a modicum of intelligence and to care) per 24 kids it's actually pretty easy to get to know each kid and their strengths and weaknesses and specific issues very well. <br><br>Both of my kids (haha probably like 99% of all kids!) were 'diagnosed' with one learning difficulty or another and after a battery of expert tests and consultations, at enormous expense we clueless, over-anxious parents dutifully doled out… the result was, "Yes, he has difficulty in this area" (yeah, I knew that) the SOLUTION however was simply the same as it would have been in my grandparent's era or any era: "He's going to have to find coping strategies to get around it and work harder than the other kids in this area." ( DUH!!!) <br>Over 1/2 of my students are also "on the spectrum",( list of kids with one difficulty or other.) The solution we as teachers have been advised is the same. I guess it's nice to know the experts agree, we are on the right track, but a bit underwhelming as to their usefulness in that case.<br><br>Incidentally, in my personal opinion, as a teacher, a 'delinquent' (I'm not quibbling with your descriptor as an understandable short-hand), or I guess in the States they are called 'at-risk-kids', is most likely a kid with emotional issues - putting them also 'on the spectrum'. They are often, incidentally the brightest and bored.<br><br>But, so yeah: In conclusion - I think if the resources were spent wisely in the first place on smaller classes/child to adult ratio and a sane schedule - far less resources would be needed for 'Special-Ed', where I gather, in the US, a lot of resources are now being spent. <br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c5087844126230066592 title="comment permalink">1/15/16, 4:53 PM</a><br><br>

Sort of like aisles in a grocery store or cubicles in an office pool, but larger classroom sized divides. It was meant to feel more inviting and homey to children as well as share common resources like a kitchenette or art and craft tables, (and thereby save money.)<br><br>My kids' school used to have this design. Now they've changed it. It is a terrible design because it is inescapably loud and noisy and distracting. A lot of younger kids have not yet developed a filtering system to tune out ambient noise. They can't focus on their own class teacher if they hear ambient noise from neighboring classes. They just stare into space with the sensory input overload. They lose the whole day, (or months, or year.) This is now also considered a specific 'learning difficulty', but it's a physical and mental developmental stage. Some kids just grow out of it sooner than others. <br>Also if a teacher wants to do something a bit more rowdy with their class, like a hands-on science experiment or game or anything that will get the kids excited and jumping, they can't because it will completely overwhelm the neighboring classes. Teachers have to curb their students' enthusiasm, which is counter productive and a total drag for all of them.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c47356705359208860 title="comment permalink">1/15/16, 9:12 PM</a><br><br>

Go to wikipedia, search for Milankovitch cycles. Look at the chart/graph on the top RHS that plots orbital parameters, solar insolation at 65 degrees north, isotope core measurements and ice core measurements. Look at the solar insolation graph. Observe that there are periods of large amplitude in insolation, and periods of small amplitude in insolation. The large amplitude periods coincide with ice age conditions - Stadials. The intervening periods of lower amplitude swings are the Interstadials. To hand waving accuracy the current interstadial is circa 50,000 yrs long although this is mildly arguable. The idea of the last 2.5Myr as an ice age is an overarching generalisation - conditions in the Pleistocene were such that periods of colder, icier climate with large icesheets were possible, with swings up and down in temperature. Whereas before the possibilities of large icesheets extending to low latitudes were much reduced. There is a great deal of nuance and subtlety in what causes ice ages, as the underlying Milankovitch cycles are modified by the distribution of land and ocean in both hemispheres and by details in the ocean circulation. As I noted, look at the "Start Here" top left hand side of the Realclimate website for a good list of topics. The Spencer Weart link on the history of the science of climate change is especially recommendable. I would also say the the IPCC AR5 reports, especially the Vol1 on the science, huge though they are, are readable, and form a pretty definitive guide to our current state of knowledge.

This brought up a lot of memories. My parents sent me to Catholic schools for twelve years. They had a strong emphasis on rote learning, and obedience. Faculty liked to use corporal punishment and public humiliation. An early memory, from first grade: the teacher handed out a mimeographed (there's a lost technology!) worksheet. As she explained it to the class, I read it and completed the work. The sheet had pictures of various vehicles, cars, trucks, planes. I colored in the tires black with my pencil.<br><br>Then the teacher said we needed to do the sheet together. No one should jump ahead. Uh oh! I tried to erase my work (and play) but couldn't. Even though I did all the work correctly, she punished me for jumping ahead.

I first encountered the concept during some of the holidays my family took in the 1970's at "Monteverde" - a Quaker community in Costa Rica that used consensus methods to manage both a nationally successful dairy/cheese coop and an internationally renowned rainforest biological reserve. The methods and tools they used were ones the Quakers have developed and used among themselves for at least 300 years in response to the working out of certain strong values of that sect. (See http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1524&amp;context=jssw).<br><br>In some ways these methods are not so dissimilar to Roberts Rules of Order, that is to say, there is a level of formality in them that people don't associate with consensus decision-making (but then, few people know much about consensus decision-making at all), but a key value explained to me at Monteverde was to avoid at all costs the creation of a disgruntled or unhappy minority rump, as results from rushing to a majority vote. <br><br>The old hand who explained its workings to me told me that in 30 years of managing the Co-op (at the time of speaking) the members had only once had to resort to two "silences" to reach a consensus, and often didn't need one. A consensus that every member would then feel committed to implementing.<br><br>Naturally, success in using consensus requires shared values, trust in each other, commitment to the process and its outcomes, and (tellingly) a lot of practice, but I reckon these are necessary for succeeding in any human group dynamic. <br><br>In any case, I don't think it is entirely fair to leave the implication hanging that consensus decision-making never works.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c4594170274391708062 title="comment permalink">1/16/16, 12:49 PM</a><br><br>

A sterile environment always puts you in danger of a stunted imagination. This obsession with testing and measuring in the schools along with squeezing out everything that is not readily measured, corresponds to workplaces where everyone is monitored through their computer or scanning device, measuring output while disregarding everything that is difficult to measure. In both scenarios, it is a system that encourages running up your numbers and avoiding what is new, challenging, or interesting. It seems like both our education and economic systems are geared to rooting out human judgement and replacing it with a matrix of data. The schools it seems, do not foster a love of learning any more than the workplaces make for satisfying work. <br>The students are continually threatened with standardized tests, while employees have credit scores determining their worthiness, along with worrying about how every aspect of their lives will look on a resume. <br>In both the schools and the workplace it seems that being miserable, bored, and adhering to a cultural homogeneity with a particular vocabulary and political correctness is the norm. <br>It didn't seem quite this hostile when I was in school. At least it was not this bad.<br>Even the process of applying for a job has become an ordeal designed to waste tremendous amounts of time. This is true even for a lot of low paying jobs. In the early 70s, when I was hired on my first jobs, it was a simple, direct process. No resume was required, that was only for certain professional jobs. You would simply fill out an application and then meet someone face to face, somebody who you knew was getting an impression of your intelligence, willingness to learn, and demeanor.<br>In contrast, an acquaintance of mine applied for a job at FedEx. It took all day, requiring him to watch a propaganda video, an application, resume, a four hour test, and finally an interview. All this for a part time job that paid something like $9 an hour. <br>There is no common sense and little reality to all this, whether it is the school testing or workplace monitoring, it is more of a racket for the administrators and industries who implement it. <br>My contention is that an intelligent interviewer, if she or he is paying attention, can glean more useful insight into someone's qualities in five minutes of conversation than from a whole day of formalized tests. They could rely more on their bs detector than on the data.<br>I imagine that all this distraction from reality will be eliminated in the LLR or any country that has to effectively use its resources. <br>In the meantime, most of us have to deal with this nonsense cluttering up our lives.

I hadn't planned on being on the board of the new center but when no one else volunteered, I sighed and agreed to be president for a little less than a year. Over that time I started moving us to RR's standard meeting format and Mike and I began to argue for adopting RR officially. We ran into considerable resistance since people seemed to associate RR with the US Congress' inability to get anything constructive done (cold prickliness) and associated consensus process with warm fuzziness, although at least one or two people did find and read one of the "dummy guides" to RR as a result of Mike's and my pestering. I made a motion to adopt RR at our annual meeting a year ago, the last one at which I was president, but it failed. However, the new president was one of those who'd read a bit on RR and over the next few board meetings, she asked Mike, who is secretary, to make a brief report on a relevant section of RR at the beginning of each meeting. These got her interested enough to start using RR to run the meetings. We could all then experience for ourselves how much easier it was to get through a meeting and, more importantly, have designated committees do most of the work outside of the board meetings.

Simply put, over the last two million years or so, the Earth has gone through a couple of dozen cycles that have ice ages at one end and very warm periods (such as the one we were in in the 19th century) at the other end. The first several cycles were modest, but the most recent have been extreme, with the cold periods involving the growth of major continental glaciers big enough, for example, to cover most of Canada and a chunk of the US. The current warm period, enhanced by anthropogenic global warming, is probably already warmer than the previous really warm periods, and over the next couple of decades will certainly be what has been called a “super-interglacial” with temperatures consistently being above anything during this entire glacial-interglacial cycle."<br><br>http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2016/01/14/yes-we-are-avoiding-an-ice-age-but-this-has-been-obvious-for-years/<br><br>Also I agree with Caryn's observations on Open Concept schools. Open plan offices started in the late 1800s, but really took off in the 1950s. Open plan schools followed in the 1970s, but children didn't adapt as well as adults. Currently open plans with play spaces are trendy and cool in fields where everyone wears ear buds and stares at monitors.

In the late 60s he went emeritus and discovered teaching to mastery. It had far better results-classroom teaching to mastery placed student achievement at 85% and tutoring to mastery, 98% (!) . He then went on to study high performers in both academic and athletic fields and concluded that such performance required practice of basic skills to automaticity.<br><br>So the next question is, how much practice does it take, where on the line between "just introduced" and "drilled and killed" is the sweet spot? Ogden Lindsley found the answer for basic skills- <i>you have it when you have it fast</i>. This requires no tech higher than flash cards and a chess timer. He named the technique "Precision Teaching", a typical terrible academic name, no? But someone else did worse, renamed it "Curriculum Based Measurement", in a quarrel over...what kind of graph paper to use.<br> <br>But what about using those skills to answer more complex problems? Stephen Rubin of the Center School, a public Elementary School in New Canaan CT, found an answer. He went through hundred and then thousands of student math test results, and culled all except the questions that A and B students tended to answer correctly, and the rest did not. He and his staff then refined and tested the questions to give--<i>a quick and compact test of mastery</i>. Read <b>Public Schools should learn to Ski</b> for their amazing achievements.<br><br>And then weep, since when the old school building was replaced, the whole system was swept away. Remember Francis Turnley and Sonsils, a way of teaching reading and writing using the 70 or so utterances you can hear babies babble? Gone beyond recovery. This result, the automatic return to the sorting machine model, is so common there must be a reason. My guess? <i>Schools Must Not distort property values</i>.<br><br>This brings me to Arthur Whimbey, who disproved <b>The Bell Curve</b> before it was written-- read his <b>Intelligence can be Taught</b>. But that's not what I want to talk about. His early work disappeared in the normal way, so he started over. He built small sharp instruments to penetrate the armor of public schools. He took the observation that "writing is rewriting", wrote and tested a 70 page <i>supplement</i> that taught rewriting first. Supplements evade the textbook committees and give administrators with a few unspent bucks a place to spend it. Next, he knew that Sentence Diagramming fails to teach the parts of speech, absent a talented teacher and careful introduction. So he broke down the problem, found a solution (build a toy grammar and extend that), then tested and sold another supplement. He found the skills students lacked to succeed on the old SAT, and with his regular coauthor, wrote a book to sell their anxious parents. It taught those skills -in the guise of exam preparation. As a bonus, he used the educational fad of <i>team learning</i> to sneak in a tested technique for naive peer tutoring, <i>Think Aloud Paired Problem Solving</i>.<br><br>Traditionally, teachers were told to pace lessons for the slowest student willing to learn. John Saxon failed to teach his CC students with the methods he learned from his long Air Force career. So he ended up writing and testing worksheets to fill a whole class period and found he could introduce about 15% new material in each one. Similarly, Zig Engelmann found beginner students could handle about 10% new material in each lesson and about 30% new material after just a few lessons in his format.<br><br> So there are a few things newer than John Milton Gregory that are worth keeping.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c4928362708650638181 title="comment permalink">1/16/16, 5:59 PM</a><br><br>

I did all of my primary, intermediate and high schooling in New Zealand, where they still know how to teach (somewhat). I can honestly admit that half the reason I managed to get a scholarship to university was because of the high level of commitment of my school teachers and their willingness to go outside the curriculum to teach us what was required.<br>I thought that the US was only slightly worse than our parts, until I saw the John Oliver comedy segment on US education and was horrified at what passes for education in this country - how could you possibly test ability with multi-choice exams? Yet that's what they do in that sham of 'SAT's. <br><br>Another problem I see though in western culture is the chronic glamourisation of mediocrity. Being conscientious in study got me shunned and bullied through a good amount of school, and by the looks of your TV shows, seems to be at a permanent life-scarring intensity in the United States. Not only is the education system bad, but youth culture actively encourages not having any curiousity and idling your mind in fake relationships, alcohol, video games and the like. I say this as a youth myself. This isn't the case in Asia, and granted that Asian education has a huge lot of its own problems - kids thinking that having interest in something outside of the latest lewd rap video is a crime isn't one of them.<br><br>Hopefully by 2065, the young people in Lakeland have been taught some basic values and are encouraged to pay attention to some important things.<br><br>YCS<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c3914007929963410267 title="comment permalink">1/16/16, 6:34 PM</a><br><br>

Still, most of our problems do not come from having a cohesive disfunctional system, but by the chaos that results when everyone understand the system is disfunctional and go merrily to work around it or take advantage of it in their own style with no central coordination. Still, I think this approach allows the best teachers to be effective without much external interference, even it there are lots of negative side effects.<br><br>I do not doubt you have plenty of capable teachers at the other side of the river, too. The problem is that you insist in tying the hands good and proper. Maybe it would be better for the education of your country if instead of exporting the teachers themselves we could seed your syndicates with some delegates of our own. The Mexican Syndacate of School Workers is a mighty political force to be reckoned with and they have fought education reforms tooth and nail. And I am not talking about just sitting in meetings and doing heated speeches; some school districts are famous for having kids loose weeks or months at a time, because their teachers thing nothing of rioting or traveling to Mexico City and doing peaceful though disrupting demonstrations there.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c6554812811131442369 title="comment permalink">1/16/16, 10:13 PM</a><br><br>

So seeing this glimpse of the Lakeland Republic is very interesting. I was recently asked what I was most grateful for, and answered that I have been fortunate to have had several exceptional teachers in my life.<br><br>I tolerated public school up until 8th grade because I believe that the small k-12 school I went to up in a small mountain town was comparatively functional,the teachers were not, as a general rule, over qualified, but went into teaching because that was their calling, many had even grown up in the same community they taught. By 9th grade however I reach a peak of frustration with the system, especially a terrible math class. Some fancy pants idea to mix geometry and algebra into two classes that were each half each. After a week of reviewing what a triangle was (which Mrs. Hill had covered adequately when I was in first grade) I refused to return and with my Mom's support found a charter school 50 miles a way; arranging to live with my grand parents during that time.<br><br>I think that the most fortunate thing that happened in my life so far was that charter school, to escape the toxic social and mental conditions of public high school. The charter school itself was a decent school, "self directed" they called the model. There was a filing cabinet filled with pamphlets which listed the skills and knowledge areas that were expected to be mastered to complete each possible class the school offered, which included all the standard classes of Colorado public education, and a diverse set of electives. A student could work through as many as 5 pamphlets at a time, and if you wanted another you had to finish one of the ones you were started on. Each pamphlet would have any where from 8 to 30 some requirements. To check off a requirement one simply had to learn the skill or material, and then do something that proved your mastery beyond a reasonable doubt. A library and teachers were available as resources, and there were recommended means of demonstration. Each thing had to be presented to a teacher and at least two students, who would all grade you, the teacher basing your grade on how well you taught the other students. Some teachers would do presentations of interesting material in their field of expertise, but often had trouble getting good attendance, I wish the teachers had offered more of these presentations, but too often just chased students to do their own demonstrations.<br><br>There were some real problems with the system, especially that many students would not direct themselves very much, and there was little recourse in the system to motivate students. On the other hand, if one cannot self direct at a high school age, it might be better to GED and go in to the real world.<br><br>The system ended soon after getting its charter, which empowered the parents board to over rule the principle. They quickly choose a more prestigious program and the school shut down a year later.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c8639805247746784184 title="comment permalink">1/17/16, 11:15 AM</a><br><br>

My experience has been the opposite of JMG as I was in a service club ( Rotary) for several years in the mid to late 2000's but have never been in a fraternal lodge. My opinion, is as currently run, modern service clubs ( Rotary at least) are not usefull organizations to meet the challanges of what lies ahead. They meet at lunchtime to minimize the time commitement and mostly seem to be about collecting money. They collect a large annual membership fee of which the majority is immediatly sent off to the national organization in Chicago. There it is used to pay for the salaries, expenses and pensions of a bueracracy of 600 people. A classic imperial set-up that sucks money out of the hinterlands for the benefit of the masters at the center. Then the rest of the year is spent in fund raisers ( or nagging members to donate more money) to be used for an annual "service project". This is always something bland and unthreatening like a picnic roof in the park or a heating system for the orphans home. The high point of my membership was when I got on the speakers committe and managed to sneak in a good speaker on peak oil. I soon after realized it was time for me to leave when the "Leadership" of the club told me not to pursue any more speakers like that as it "scared" the members.The second sign was that the club went on a huge fund drive to raise a big "fund" they could invest with a local money manager and then use the investment income to fund it's projects with so they would not have to bother with any more fundraisers. This was back in 2009 and their planned goal would give them all they money they needed if they got a return of 8%. I asked what would happen if they got less than that and the reply was that the money manager they chose was very good and they would hold his feet to the fire and insist on the 8%. I realized at that point that Rotary represented everything that was wrong with the thinking in middle class America and I needed to get out. <br> Instead I moved to a new city ( for other reasons) and joined two organizations. One that grows food in peoples unused front and back yards, and another that has big work parties to tear up parking lots and impervious surfaces and return them to vegitation. Much more usefull and neither group seems to have much need for money.<br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c2196639944500362202 title="comment permalink">1/17/16, 11:35 AM</a><br><br>

In 1st - 3rd grade, the students are "exposed" to 4th grade material, but allowed to ignore it. In 4th grade, they're expected to learn it, but since they've never had to learn it before, they just watch it boringly go by once again. In 5-6th grade, the teacher struggles to understand why no one understands the 4th-grade "review" material, and the students are feeling cheated and defeated. After 6th grade, we found different (private) schools. The comments above are not to be taken too literally, by the way. <br><br>Another issue that we faced was that many of the families in our local area include "undocumented" (illegal) immigrants. They want their children to succeed in school, but they're apparently afraid to participate in extra-curricular activities (yes, I mean the parents are afraid). Come to a PTA meeting? Meet the friendly community police officers? Not gonna happen. Then again, some of them may still be working, or resting from a hard day's work. But for whatever the reason, there was no way to get most of the parents involved.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c5582437606399703785 title="comment permalink">1/17/16, 6:02 PM</a><br><br>

Consequently, the educational level of students graduating is nowhere near what was promised or even comparable with past graduates and yet there is too much money at stake to consider changing course.<br> It is at this point that another old quote comes rising up from the mists in which one Antoine de Saint-Exupery says; "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye." and I realize that he is right. How can you produce a metric for justice, compassion or even love. How do you measure students for resilience, initiative and curiosity? At best you can only really measure for the production of learning efforts and rote learning but that does not make education.

It certainly is interesting. <br><br>However, what I had thought of writing was not a full-scale spelling text (such as Potter's or Webster's) that, say, a home-schooling parent might use, but simply a short and easy guide to a simple way for parents to start their children reading simple things on their own before handing them over to whatever school sysstem one might choose. It does presuppose that the parents are alrwady talking to their children without talking down to them, are themselves already avid readers, and have the time and inclination to read to their children. Given that, all intelligent and observant children really need is the main lines of the rules for turning what they see in writing into something they can hear with their own ears, and then understanding it by comparison with their own spoken English. That could be taught to parents in a pamphlet of well under 50 pages, I think. <br><br>Of course, with the relatively few common exceptions to these "rules of reading aloud" that English has, any child's first efforts will include some mispronunciations (and thus also some misunderstandings). So children also have to learn (1) how they can "measure" their tentative reading aloud against what they already knows when they speaks their own native English, (2) how to correct his initial errors on his own, without having to constantly get input from some literate adult, and (3) that it is OK to do this on their own without adult input. Sure, they will get some details wrong at first, but as they keep on reading and talking, further experience will correct these initial mistakes that they will inevitably make. <br><br>So I'm aiming at a method the child can use for himself or herself, once a parent has demonstrated the simplest basics of it, to increase his or her own literacy under his or her own power. "Under his or her own power" is the really important point here. <br><br>If you can give children agency over the whole process of learning to read, so that they can start to use it in their own interests apart from adult supervision, and if you can also give children books that interest them keenly, then they can (and will!) probably do most of the remaining work on their own. <br><br>And if children can master something (from adult life) on their own, especially something that other adults regard as formidably difficult, then they are primed and prepped and psyched to take charge of their own further education. <br><br>So this is fundamentally a subversive thing, too, emancipating to some degree the child's own future book-learning and self-education from constant adult supervision and control. Children always apppreciate that sort of freedom from adult authority.)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c3185725205796024741 title="comment permalink">1/18/16, 2:24 PM</a><br><br>

Period. That's one of those places where education blends all too readily into indoctrination. <br><br>Dave, I was talking about foreign languages, of course. Pennsylvania Dutch isn't foreign in the Lakeland Republic; there are local schools in which that's the language in which teaching is conducted from first grade on (based on similar schools that some other at-risk languages now use), half a dozen daily newspapers, and a range of other periodicals. Keep in mind, though, that Pennsylvania Dutch is about as far from any of the standard German dialects these days as, say, Yiddish; you can be perfectly fluent in it and be unable to communicate with somebody from Berlin or Munich. <br><br>James, do you really think repeating the current party line about the 1970s debate over ice ages will make it true? I discussed that whole business <a href=../../2014/11/dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html rel=nofollow>in an earlier post</a>, in the process of pointing out that the current scientific habit of rewriting history to erase last year's mistakes is one of the things that's causing a vast number of people to lose whatever respect they might still have for the scientific community. I was alive at the time; I recall the debates, and it wasn't just a handful of people on the fringes who thought a new ice age might well be imminent. Were they wrong? Of course -- and that's the point; the scientific consensus of one decade is very often the embarrassing mistake of the next...which is one of the reasons I'm less than confident about the current theory of how soon the next ice age will arrive. <br><br>Crow Hill, indeed it has; the one difference is that the older system could be set up so that people who paid into the project got their money back out of the proceeds of the project. That might be worth bringing back into the equation as things proceed. <br><br>Matthias, you must have missed the first dozen or so posts from the Retrotopia series, which are set in a moderately large city (Toledo, OH) and make much of the urban amenities found there. Are you possibly projecting your own assumptions onto what I'm saying here? As for a good source on EROEI, I wish I had one; since the Oil Drum shut down, I've been having to gather such details as I can from sources here and there, and factor in such things as monetary cost as a proxy measure.<br><br>Phil, of course -- human beings have both rational and irrational sides, and trying to amputate either one results in disaster. <br><br>Eric, heh heh heh. Stay tuned!<br><br>Robert, understood. I never got to experience competent schooling -- the public schools I attended, in an assortment of south Seattle suburbs, were early adopters of most of the bad ideas that have come to pervade US education, from obsessive dependence on multiple choice tests on down. It's a measure of how bad things were that I graduated from high school without ever being required to read a single important work of English or American literature or a single unedited historical document of any importance. (I read quite a few of both on my own time.) Between the misguided Sixties-era obsession with "relevance" and the first few cycles of watering down the curriculum, it was thirteen years of misery and wasted time. Thus my hearkening back to American education in the days when it actually educated children, as a basis for this post. <br><br>Toomas, thank you! I'd heard the <i>caveat emptor</i> story but not the other, which may just be the funniest bit of Latin bawdy I've heard yet. <br><br>Robert, I favor the branding irons. Put it down to a recent reread of Schopenhauer, who makes a very strong case for reason as a kind of querulous passenger and occasional back seat driver in a vehicle driven entirely by the irrational will.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c478450683296281531 title="comment permalink">1/18/16, 2:27 PM</a><br><br>

We agree that the public schools are a disaster and have gotten steadily worse for decades, to the point that sending your child to one arguably counts as unintentional child abuse. My point is that there have been times and places in this country where public schooling has been a great deal better than it is today, and the things that made it better could be identified and put back into use. Are you disagreeing with that? <br><br>Mountain Mama, you're welcome and thank you. We also have an encyclopedia here at home, a 1950s-era Encyclopedia Americana; for most subjects, it's considerably more accurate and detailed, not to mention less subject to ideological bias, than Wikipropaganda. <br><br>Shane, I tend to think of the "troubled kid turned around by a caring teacher" narrative as a bit of propaganda meant to shift blame from the system to individual teachers -- "if we had more teachers like (insert made up character here), kids wouldn't get into trouble" and suchlike rot. There are plenty of caring teachers, but they're in the bowels of a corrupt and dysfunctional system that lost track of the welfare of its inmates (aka "pupils") decades ago. <br><br>Mgalimba, sure, and I've also seen plenty of social-media memes generated by corporations, Monsanto among them, that consist of outright lies meant to boost quarterly profits at the expense of human and environmental health. If that didn't happen as often as it does, the social-media memes to which you object wouldn't have a fraction of the audience they do. <br><br>Varun, I trust you've taught yourself disciplined habits of study since that time!<br><br>Shane, nope. The Republic of California probably would have, but it's been too busy fighting civil wars to get around to it. <br><br>Steve, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP2SS8ggLtU" rel=nofollow>he was indeed</a>. <br><br>Genevieve, exactly. The stunning levels of practical and intellectual ignorance that are standard in the US these days aren't going to be viable much longer -- a case could be made that they aren't viable now. <br><br>Shane, by all means use whichever term you like; I find "Gringostan" funnier. <br><br>Andrew, I'm impressed that you managed to get that put into place, and even more impressed that it hasn't gotten "reformed" out of existence. Good for you. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, yes, I've been watching it. We'll see what happens, but right now, it looks as though we may just be in the opening stages of a really impressive global economic crisis.

The Alberta tar-sands bubble turned into a pyramid scheme that sucked most of the Canadian economy into it, and as that comes apart, it's going to get very ugly on your side of the border. I hope you can hold things together. <br><br>Mick, I've had the same experience. Politicians reflect their culture; all those senators mumbing "I'm sure they'll think of something" are part of the same society that's been mumbling the same thing for decades. <br><br>Roberta, put through a comment marked "not for posting" with your email on it, and I'll forward that to Deborah. <br><br>Mustard, yes, I saw that! It's raw material for a future post on technological regression as a winning strategy and tactic in tomorrow's wars. <br><br>Cherokee, thank you! I'd been mulling over for years ideas for a novel that would stand Lovecraft's mythos on its head, with the tentacled horrors as the good guys, but it was one of those back burner things that can simmer away for years. Last fall, all of a sudden, the entire narrative came crashing down into my mind and I wrote a 70,000-word novel in seven weeks. The next volume in the series, <i>The Weird of Hali: Kingsport</i>, is about 50,000 words along, and will top out around the same length as <i>Innsmouth</i>; Lovecraft fans will know from the title that "The Festival" is a major influence, though I've also woven in quite a bit of Chambers' <i>The King in Yellow</i> and Machen's <i>The White People</i>, with a nod to "The Terrible Old Man." Volume three, which is in outline form at this point? <i>The Weird of Hali: Chorazin</i>. Wish me luck!<br><br>August, you were lucky to have good teachers, and also lucky in your choice of a year to be born in. I also had some gifted teachers, but there really wasn't much they could do, given the way the system had frozen up around them. <br><br>Hapibeli, once your granddaughter's old enough, get her interested in ham radio and you can stay in touch indefinitely!<br><br>Auriel, good question. The environment won't be free of persistent toxins for quite some time, of course. <br><br>Glenn, if you found a program that was right for your daughter, good.

The noise was constant and made it impossible to concentrate or think; the teachers (four to a complex) had even less time to devote to individual students than if they'd been in classrooms of their own; and what was at the "learning stations" was the latest, avant-garde, content-free cerebral flatulence from an assortment of prestigious universities, and thus inevitably as boring as it was uneducative. Oh, and the school had a big library, which was locked before and after school and during recesses. You could only go there when your group of kids was frog-marched there for some kind of project, and even then you couldn't check things out if they weren't for the officially sanctioned project. When we moved and I ended up at a standard elementary school in a different district, I was as surprised as I was overjoyed to find that the school library was open for an hour after school and you could actually, like, browse through the shelves and take home half a dozen books to read on subjects that didn't have to be preapproved by a teacher. <br><br>Warrior, you're most welcome. <br><br>Crow, hmm. I wonder whether the men have a different interpretation of the fact that they get to use a recreational drug and the women don't...<br><br>Donalfagan, school should change lives, and in exactly that way -- by introducing young people to things that interest and excite them. Memorizing canned answers to multiple choice questions does not cut it. <br><br>Moshe, because it makes zero economic sense to have competing trolley systems in a single city, but railroads running different routes are quite another matter. Yes, I know that the current behavior of today's crop of corporate fat cats has done a lot to make a competitive market look bad, but government bureaucrats aren't necessarily any better; one of the points of the Retrotopia story is to remind readers that we used to balance government and the market against each other, and though it had its problems, by and large it worked better than letting either one take over and run things unchecked. <br><br>Leo, they probably would have. My wife went to Catholic schools for three years, and they played a large role in driving her permanently out of the Catholic church. <br><br>Shane, exactly. Hicksville is based on close reading of accounts of hundreds of similar farm towns all across rural America. It's not an imaginary ideal; it's something we had once and could have again. As for rationality, I really do need to do a post on that, don't I? <br><br>Scotlyn, the Friends have been using a very specific form of consensus effectively for hundreds of years, which includes some very useful features for keeping a minority with an agenda from hijacking the proceedings and preventing similar abuses. Those protections have been systematically removed from the forms of consensus that have been marketed so enthusiastically all over the leftward end of the political landscape for decades now, with the predictable result that consensus politics as now practiced -- outside of the Friends and a few other places -- generally amounts to a system of manipulation and exploitation on the part of a minority that knows how to play the game, and can't be removed or even opposed because there's no mechanism to rein them in. If a group wants to use Quaker-style consensus, complete with all its bells and whistles and a willingness to disfellowship those who try to abuse it, I'm good with that -- but democratic process is generally easier to learn and use, and much less prone to the current set of abuses.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c2566679217425715479 title="comment permalink">1/18/16, 3:36 PM</a><br><br>

That said, you're right about the schools; they manufacture feedstock for human resource departments. <br><br>Shane, recreational drugs also go in and out of fashion as a function of shifts in culture. I suspect it's because a drug that encourages popular states of mind will be favored, and one that conflicts with them will be tabooed. Until the 1960s, the US encouraged the states of mind that are produced by alcohol and tobacco, and discouraged those that are produced by marijuana; now that's changing, and so are attitudes toward the drugs in question. <br><br>Pantagruel, thank you! Yes, it's going to become a novel -- I've already got a publisher lined up -- and I'll see if I can fit Annie Oakley in there somewhere.<br><br>Jon, a less centralized and centrally controlled education system would permit room for that sort of thing. That said, there's much in favor of systems that have been tested over several generations and worked very well back in the day. <br><br>YCS, yes, it really is that bad here. The flight to mediocrity is another thing that's driven by educational policy, by the way -- in the US, if you do well on a test you make everyone else look bad, and they understandably resent that. <br><br>Raymond, the US equivalent is the National Education Association. Like most US labor unions, it's a sprawling bureaucracy that concentrates on getting its members as much money as possible -- not always effectively -- at the expense of all other concerns. <br><br>Ed, see my previous comment on deliberate technological regression as a winning military strategy. That's going to get a post down the road a bit. <br><br>Ray, one of the things that makes the education mess so disastrous is that so many parents have been sucked into a set of beliefs that makes failure look like success. I'm sorry to hear your school was a victim of that effect. <br><br>Clay, I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks for the data point!<br><br>LatheChuck, and thanks also for those data points!<br><br>Kevin, exactly. That's the chasm that's opening up beneath the feet of so many of industrial society's endeavors; having become convinced that everything real must be quantifiable, people went on to convince themselves that what the numbers show is reality even when everything else contradicts that claim. Thus we get an economy that's "recovering" even though poverty and permanent unemployment are soaring, schools that are "getting better" when more and more high school graduates each year can't read a restaurant menu, and so on. <br><br>Brian, yes, I saw that.

I'm really not sure what to do in my position, as a young technical professional who isn't in debt - housing prices are out of my reach in the city I live in anyway - but no real assets or postindustrial skills. I don't own much in the way of energy-wasting toys except for a decade old car that isn't worth much and have a few months pay in the bank, but no useful hard assets either.<br><br>Lots of people that I work with have bought cars in the last two years, generally ones that are worth about half a year's pay. Its pretty weird.<br><br>Regarding school, I had the dubious pleasure of attending a school arranged into 'pods' - 4 classrooms surrounding a common area with computers, separated by moveable walls (which never moved). It was an utterly awful experience, and I can only imagine how much worse it has gotten. Here was the issue as I saw it: School, was a miserable, degrading experience for many people, especially but not exclusively boys. Disengaged students are bad students, so the curriculum becomes degraded to the point where even someone who doesn't care and isn't trying can be certified as having a 12th grade education.

One question: Some of the ruinmen in Star's Reach have solar-powered flashlights, how do they work? I assume that means that you think some sort of PV manufacturing will exist in the future?

I'm glad to learn that you favor branding irons for those golden words of yours. <br><br>Back in the days when I was an active college teacher, I used to present a similar idea by using an extended metaphor. Suppose, I told my students, that each of you is playing a very old-fashioned video game with a steering wheel, trying to keep your car on the road (on the screen) as it traveled ever faster toward the game's prize destination. You are so lost in your game that the car and the road seems real to you, as does the reward once you reach your destination.<br><br>But in reality, to a dispassionate outside observer, that old-style video game machine has been mounted on the back of a creaky farm wagon, pulled by a team of horses, with a half-insane deaf-mute driver seated on the box holding the reins. Because the game is so demanding, you have lost sight of all these things. Yet your real task is not to keep the car on the road that you see on the game screen. It is somehow to find a way to get through to the half-insane deaf-mute driver, so he can take you to a destination that really matters. And you have to do that without spooking the horses in the process. For if the horses are spooked, they will run away and probably carry the whole shebang over one of the nearby cliffs.<br><br>The metaphor actually made sense to the students back then, when they still remembered the first primitive video game machines that you could only find in an arcade, and you had to put real money into a slot if you wanted to play them. I'm not sure it would make any sense at all to a college student now.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c3165271215774364595 title="comment permalink">1/18/16, 5:54 PM</a><br><br>

Let that sink in for a minute...)<br>However, I've heard many tales of teachers who were willing to slide through their days. Without tests of SOME kind, how does anyone know that a teacher is doing anything other than babysitting and crowd control? K-12 education is a peculiar product which no one will buy twice, no matter how much they like it, and everybody buys once, no matter how much they hate it. <br>Are teachers to be evaluated only by principals sitting in once in a while? Then the complaints are all about subjectivity and favoritism. Are students to be evaluated on written work?

Communities at the time built their own schools (one or two room) and hired their own teachers, much like the Mennonites and Amish near me do now. Public schools were different than community schools or schools run by churches in that every taxpayer was expected to fund these schools and there was a bureaucracy instituted to hire teachers, supervise them and create curricula. Public schools didn't really take off until they became mandatory for all children, with forced attendance and that was closer to the 1920's by the time it was the law in every state. <br><br>Every couple of decades it seems the public school system gets "reformed". The first one was around the 1920's when curriculum was standardized into subjects and grade levels based on what the bottom 20% of a class could accomplish in a school year. There was another reform in the 1960's because we had to keep up with the Soviets and we needed more math and science courses. I think we know how well that focus on math and science worked out. There was whole language and the removal of grammar and phonics in the 1980's. Then the full implementation of standardized testing in the 2000's. Our local school district elementary school has 43 days of testing in a 180 day school year, so 25% of the year. All the testing is completed by beginning of March (!) which begs the question "what do they do the rest of the year?" Why pajama day and movie day and fun day and field day and blah blah blah. Just call it a daycare and get it over with.<br><br>After homeschooling for the past 8 years it is shocking how fast children learn and any curriculum we pick for a subject doesn't even last a full school year. The parameters of "subjects" and "credits" make everything dull however so they've pursed many other interests. They've mastered sewing, oil painting, string instruments (violin and cello), knife throwing, basic cooking and gardening. One child earned 6 college credit by borrowing college text books and taking 2 CLEP exams. School is such a waste of time. Unless you are one of those families whose child plays sports, because that is the real focus these days - sports teams and competitions.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c2533362830323169987 title="comment permalink">1/18/16, 6:28 PM</a><br><br>

You are a truly prolific and talented author. And I will pre-order a copy of the book in the next few days once I get my head around the shipment details and costs.<br><br>I have an answer of sorts for you regarding the lack of implosion in the financial aspects of the fracking bubble. Sorry, I had to interrupt my reply because Poopy the Pomeranian thought that it would be a nice idea to say hello by rushing in and belching at me! Nice. Where were we? That’s right. The lack of financial fallout from the fracking bubble has left me scratching my head recently and I by sheer chance came across an article in last weekend’s newspaper on the subject of Bear markets and the low Oil price and I noted one interesting black swan which has had a short term effect on cushioning the blow from what clearly should be a spectacular collapse. I'll recount the quote here:<br><br>"A lot of distressed debt fund managers blew themselves up last year buying distressed debt of US shale funds, which continued to go down," Radzyminski (a local fund manager was quoted as saying).<br><br>If you stand back a long way from the details of all of those arrangements and the realities of the industrial fracking process and take in the big picture, you can see that "distressed debt fund managers" have appeared to have bought up big in that industry and then lost by spending what I call OPM (Other People’s Money) on what appears to be a losing gamble. In doing so, they have cushioned the financial impacts of the lack of financial basics in the fracking business at this current low oil price in the short term, but instead have spread the risk far wider than it ever previously was so that the fall out will be even bigger in the long term.<br><br>And the mess in the currency markets, mate I get a Déjà vu feeling of Winston Churchill standing in the NY stock exchange as the UK exchequer contemplating moving the UK to the gold standard, back in the 1920's.<br><br>Oh, this is not going to end well at all.<br><br>It is still hot here too.

I didn’t have the nightmarish issues Leo and your wife did, though I do remember the nuns being very strict.

I am constantly reminded of this when I see some of the letters customers send in to the mail order business I work for. A good quarter of the letters (from adults!) are written at what I would consider a second grade level with spelling and grammar errors that make many of them nearly incoherent reading.

None of us were ever frog-marched anywhere and there was always a teacher nearby. Bullying was rigorously supressed. There were also collective class projects where kids would divide up into various related sub-projects depending on their interests, centered on a central topic or theme, and occasionally get together in the group to share the results. Plus we had very liberal access to supervised woodshop, pottery shop, and library. Most of we alums remember it as the best educational experience of our lives, and my brother went to great lengths to make sure his kids could go there too. <br><br>Like so many things, the same concept can be implemented successfully or disastrously, depending on who is implementing it and why.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c8044798440149525158 title="comment permalink">1/19/16, 10:51 AM</a><br><br>

Although unlike an urban trolley system there is almost always going to be no problem finding space for two railroads instead of one, there would be tremendous first-mover advantage to building a railroad. The first railroad, once long-distance trucking is no longer an option, provides a huge savings per ton-mile compared to all the other overland options and is therefore likely to attract investment. If the owner of that railroad decides to take advantage of their monopoly, and charge what the market will bear, rather than a price that's enough to cover costs, a competing railroad would have to justify its existence based on the price differential between a railroad running at thin profit margins and one running at inflated ones. So the second railroad will never get built, and the first-mover will make a large profit. So it seems to me like train tracks and the associated infrastructure should be owned by the public, but the actual trains and rolling stock could just as easily be private.<br><br>I'm not sure what the answer is, but it seems to me like the capitalist model of ownership works well for things like steam engines or tractors that last a decade or two and then need to be replaced, but for something like land (which can produce wealth for many lifetimes either as a place people live or as a place that is farmed sustainably), or infrastructure like railroads that can exist as long as the maintenance keeps happening.<br><br>I think as long as it's possible to pass economic advantage onto our children, inequality necessarily rises. It doesn't seem to necessarily even get stirred up, many owners of Japanese corporations, for example, can trace their lineage back to feudal elites centuries ago. IIRC Korea also maintained a stable ruling class for centuries.<br><br>Although the coming changes are likely going to stir things up quite a bit more than past crises, it is interesting to think that my patrilineal ancestors 3 generations back on both sides had, allowing for changing times, similar socioeconomic status as modestly wealthy people with a respected, useful profession (landholding dairy farmers, then engineers, businesspeople and university professors). A big question of mine is, if I do end up having kids, will I be able to maintain and pass on my present socioeconomic status, and how should I do it? Maybe dairy farming.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c6686384741811103931 title="comment permalink">1/19/16, 2:52 PM</a><br><br>

The ethics curriculum I quoted would teach kids that compassion and tolerance are sort of the highest, eternal, universal values that everyone shares. My point was that learning that would leave them unprepared for a world in which some people value, say, power, greed, sense of superiority, reputation, themselves, far above compassion or tolerance. <br><br>When it comes to teaching kids about hard realities though, I think you could only define that by what kids themselves often find emotionally hard to handle. That varies of course but I don’t think most of them get traumatized by abstract concepts like wealth inequality, peak oil or corruption in public office. The sexual abuse and murder of a 3 year old by her father on the other hand? Or the kidnap, rape and torture of Yazidi children? Kids being forced to execute their own parents? Starving to death? <br><br>When it comes to stuff like the latter, I think there’s a difference between your parents explaining it to you and school teaching you. Parents, at least in theory, know what their kids can handle at different ages and how to tell them things. Some 3 year olds love Finding Nemo, some will have nightmares for weeks thereafter about the possibility of their mother dying and them getting lost! I know because my daughter had a crisis at the age of 2 about the possibility of her and all of us dying. Cried her eyes out. She still gets sad about it but is doing much better with it now. <br><br>Point is I know that at 7 she’ll still be, basically, a drama queen!! For good and bad she doesn’t react in half measures and that’s how she was from the day she was born. I don’t shelter her from bad stuff but I also know how much she can take and how to help her with it. There’s a world of difference to me between hearing hard truths from a parent you, hopefully, love and trust and who can put them into the context of their beliefs about life, meaning, religion and stuff vs. a teacher just providing them with facts. <br><br>I notice history isn’t on the curriculum in the Lakeland republic. I wonder why that is. <br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c5845852410721419781 title="comment permalink">1/20/16, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

By the time I was out, I was no longer interested. I homeschool my kids now. <br><br>While in school I heard - so often - the phrases "it's all about the numbers", "it's all about the data". Teaching is attracting a different sort of person today. It's become a field like accounting. <br><br>All of my education textbooks - heavily used in every class - contained hundreds of summaries of studies that had been done which purportedly showed what educational techniques were effective in teaching children various things. (This was due to NCLB, which mandated that teacher education programs should focus on 'evidence-backed practices' or some such thing.) By the end, I had literally dozens of pages of different 'techniques', all 'evidence-based' to use in the classroom. What I didn't have was a sense of what to choose when, and I was so overwhelmed with the amount I had listed that I never used it. And my blood froze in my veins when I thought of having to focus solely on children as potential numbers. <br><br>I feel for the teachers who went into teaching because they loved helping children learn.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c9150422486598737415 title="comment permalink">1/20/16, 11:51 AM</a><br><br>

It is not often I experience that rare cognitive pleasure of scales falling from my eyes, and this week’s blog on Trump had that delightful effect. Thank you!<br><br>A sub-theme I see recurring on your blog and comments thereon is how the ‘collapse’ isn’t happening as fast as folks expect. I’ve had that same thought, and I wonder if we underestimate the Mojo of the Master of the Universe. That is, with regards to the governments of the West, and Russia, and China, and the Uber-Banking/Financial system, and all the rest, there is almost nothing they all agree on except that the collapse of civilization would be a Really Bad Thing. Thus one can expect them all to pull together (a rare collaboration) and do everything they can to avert (postpone) it when that reality particularly rears its ugly head. All those forces pulling together probably exert more influence than we can imagine. If so, that would be a Good Thing as it buys us time to prepare for the inevitable. But everything has a price – postponing the inevitable usually means that the inevitable is even worse.<br><br>On a personal note, I note that you now describe yourself as “Past Grand Archdruid” when I wonder if “Grand Archdruid Emeritus” might be both more dignified and more fun at the same time. Just a friendly thot from a grateful reader.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-learning-lessons.html#c5810172139045722628 title="comment permalink">1/21/16, 2:55 PM</a><br><br>

I discovered your blog less than a week ago and I've already devoured every installment of Retropia. What a trip! As someone who is recently coming through a time of extreme fear and grief over NTE (I never thought of it as a myth before reading your work) and basically the mess we've made of pretty much the whole world, I find your point of view both rational and refreshing. It is also nice to be able to imagine the possibilities that await us through this rough period in our history. I'm not as fearful for my young children, though still plenty concerned! If I may just give you a little background on my journey, I promise to keep it brief. I grew up a typical American suburbanite in the Silicon Valley in the 90's. Saw the BS that is contemporary consumer culture in my late teens and wanted out. Fast forward 13 years and I now live in a rural area in the Sierra foothills where I home school my kids, wildcraft my own herbal medicine, can fruit, bake bread, raise chickens, and chop firewood to heat our small, comfy home. Basically the exact opposite of the San Jose mallrat I was in my teens. Now if I can just ditch the car! (It's hard in a rural area) Your blog speaks truth to me and I look forward to both exploring more of your other writing and reading the next installment of Retropia.
