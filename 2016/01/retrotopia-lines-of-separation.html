<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the fourteenth installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator returns from his trip to a tier one county full of doubts about the Lakeland Republic’s prospects, and has those at once challenged and sharpened by a conversation at the local Atheist Assembly... </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d had lunch with Ruth Mellencamp at a pleasant little diner a block from the station before I caught the train, so I had nothing to do until I got to Defiance but watch farmland roll by and think about what I’d seen since I’d crossed the border less than a week before. My reactions were an odd mix of reluctant admiration and unwilling regret. The people of the Lakeland Republic had taken a situation that would have crushed most countries—an international embargo backed up with repeated attempts at regime change—and turned it into their advantage, using isolation from the capital flows and market pressures of the global economy to give them space to return to older ways of doing things that actually produced better results than the modern equivalents.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The problem with that, I told myself, was that it couldn’t last. That was the thing that had bothered me, the night after I’d toured the New Shaker settlement, though it had taken another day to come into focus. The whole Lakeland Republic was like the New Shakers, the sort of fragile artificial construct that only worked because it isolated itself from the rest of the world. Now that the embargo was over and the borders with the other North American republics were open, the isolation was gone, and I didn’t see any reason to think the Republic’s back-to-the-past ideology would be strong enough by itself in the face of the overwhelming pressures the global economy could bring to bear. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That wasn’t even the biggest challenge they faced, though. The real challenge was progress—the sheer onward momentum of science and technology in the rest of the world. Sure, I admitted, the Lakeland Republic had done some very clever things with old technology—the Frankens blowing drones out of the sky with a basement-workshop maser kept coming to mind—but sooner or later the habit of trying to push technology into reverse gear was going to collide catastrophically with the latest round of scientific or technical breakthroughs, with or without military involvement, and leave the Lakelanders with the hard choice between collapse and a return to the modern world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A week earlier, I probably would have considered that a good thing. As the train rolled into Defiance, I wasn’t so sure. The thing was, the Lakeland Republic really had managed some impressive things with<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>their great leap backward, and in a certain sense, it was a shame that progress was going to steamroller them in due time. Most of the time, people say “progress” and they mean that things get better, but it was sinking in that this wasn’t always true. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I picked up a copy of that day’s Toledo <i>Blade</i> from a newsboy in the Defiance station, and used that as an excuse to think about something else once I boarded the train back to Toledo. The previous day’s drone shoot was right there on page one, with a nice black and white picture of Maude Duesenberg getting her sixth best-of-shoot trophy, and a big feature back in the sports section with tables listing how all the competitors had done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I didn’t pay attention to anything else on the front page at first, though, because another satellite had been hit. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The <i>Progresso IV</i> and the the Russian telecom satellite were bad enough, but this one was a good deal worse, because it was parked in a graveyard orbit—one of the orbital zones where everybody’s been sticking their defunct satellites since it sank in that leaving them in working orbits wasn’t a good plan. There’s a lot of hardware in most of the graveyard-orbit zones, and though they’re well away from the working orbits that doesn’t really matter once you get a Kessler syndrome started and scrap metal starts spalling in all directions at twenty thousand miles an hour. That was basically what was happening; a defunct weather satellite had taken a stray chunk of the <i>Progresso IV</i> right in the belly, and it had just enough fuel for its maneuvering thrusters left in the tanks to blow up. A couple of amateur astronomers spotted the flash, and the astronomy people at the University of Toledo announced that they’d given up trying to calculate where all the shrapnel was going; at this point, a professor said, it was just a matter of time before the whole midrange was shut down as completely as low earth orbit.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was big news, not least because the assault drones I’d watched people potshotting out of the air depend on satellite links.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Oh, there are other ways to go about controlling them, but they’re clumsy compared to satellite, and you’ve also got the risk that somebody will take out your drones by blocking your signals—that’s happened more than once in the last couple of decades, and I’ll let you imagine what the results were for the side that suddenly lost its drones. Of course that wasn’t the only thing that was in trouble: telecommunications, weather forecasting, military reconnaissance, you name it, with the low orbits gone and the geosynchronous going, the midrange orbits were the only thing left, and now that door was slamming shut one collision at a time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It occurred to me that the Lakeland Republic was one of the few countries in the world that wasn’t going to be inconvenienced by the worsening of the satellite crisis. Still, I told myself, that’s a special case, and paged further back. The rest of the first section was ordinary news: the Chinese were trying to broker a ceasefire between the warring factions in California; the prime minister of Québec had left on a state visit to Europe; the melting season in Antarctica had gotten off to a very bad start, with a big new iceflow from Marie Byrd Land dumping bergs way too fast. I shook my head, read on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Further in was the arts and entertainment section. I flipped through that, and in there among the plays and music gigs and schedules for the local radio programs was something that caught my eye and then made me mutter something impolite under my breath. The Lakeland National Opera was about to premier its new production of <i>Parsifal</i> the following week, and every performance was sold out. Sure, I mostly listen to classic jazz, but I have a soft spot for opera from way back—my grandmother was a fan and used to play CDs of her favorite operas all the time, and it would have been worth an evening to check it out. No such luck, though: from the article, I gathered that even the scalpers had run out of tickets. I turned the page. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I finished the paper maybe fifteen minutes before the train pulled into the Toledo station. A horsedrawn taxi took me back to my hotel; I spent a while reviewing my notes, got dinner, and made an early night of it, since I had plans the next morning. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At nine-thirty sharp—I’d checked the streetcar schedule with the concierge—I left the hotel and caught the same streetcar line I’d taken to the Mikkelson plant. This time I wasn’t going anything like so far: a dozen blocks, just far enough to get out of the retail district. I hit the bell just before the streetcar got to the Capitol Atheist Assembly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Half a dozen other people got off the streetcar with me, and as soon as we figured out that we were all going the same place, the usual friendly noises followed. We filed in through a pleasant lobby that had the usual pictures of famous Atheists on the walls, and then into the main hall, where someone up front was doing a better than usual job with a Bach fugue on the piano, while members and guests of the Assembly milled around, greeted friends, and settled into their seats. Michael Finch, who’d told me about the Assembly, was there already—he excused himself from a conversation, came over and greeted me effusively—and when I finally got someplace where I could see the pianist, it turned out to be Sam Capoferro, the kid I’d seen playing at the hotel restaurant my first day in town. He gave me a grin, kept on playing Bach.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We all got seated eventually. What followed was the same sort of Sunday service you’d get in any other Atheist Assembly in North America: the Litany, the lighting of the symbolic Lamp of Reason, and a couple of songs from the choir, backed by Capoferro’s lively piano playing. There was a reading from one of Mark Twain’s pieces on religion, followed by an entertaining talk on Twain himself—his birthday was coming up soon, I thought I remembered. Then we all stood and sang “Imagine,” and headed for coffee and cookies in the social hall downstairs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Anything like what you get at the Philadelphia Assembly?” Finch asked me as we sat at one of the big tables in the social hall. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The music’s a bit livelier,” I said, “and the talk was frankly more interesting than we usually get in Philly. Other than that, pretty familiar.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s good to hear,” said a brown-skinned guy about my age, who was just then settling into a chair on the other side of the table. “Even with the borders open, we don’t have anything like the sort of contacts with Assemblies elsewhere that I’d like.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Mr. Carr,” Finch said, “this is Rajiv Mohandas—he’s on the administrative council here. Rajiv, this is Peter Carr, who I told you about.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We shook hands, and Mohandas gave me a broad smile. “Michael tells me that you were out at the annual drone shoot Friday. That must have been quite an experience.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“In several senses of the word,” I said, and he laughed.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We got to talking, about Assembly doings there in Toledo and back home in Philadelphia, and a couple of other people joined in. None of it was anything out of the ordinary until somebody, I forget who, mentioned in passing the Assembly’s annual property tax bill.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Hold it,” I said. “You have to pay property taxes?” They nodded, and I went on:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Do you have trouble getting Assemblies recognized as churches, or something?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No, not at all,”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Mohandas said. “Are churches still tax-exempt in the Atlantic Republic? Here, they’re not.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That startled me. “Seriously?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mohandas nodded, and an old woman with white hair and gold-rimmed glasses, a little further down the table, said, “Mr. Carr, are you familiar with the controversy over the separation of church and state back in the old Union?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“More or less,” I said. “It’s still a live issue back home.”
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She nodded. “The way we see it, it simply didn’t work out, because the churches weren’t willing to stay on their side of the line. They were perfectly willing to take the tax exemption and all, and then turned around and tried to tell the government what to do.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“True enough,” Mohandas said. “Didn’t matter whether they were on the left or the right, politically speaking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Every religious organization in the old United States seemed to think that the separation of church and state meant it had the right to use the political system to push its own agendas—” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“—but skies above help you if you asked any of them to help cover the costs of the system they were so eager to use,” said the old woman. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“So the Lakeland Republic doesn’t have the separation of church and state?” I asked. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Depends on what you mean by that,” the old woman said. “The constitution grants absolute freedom of belief to every citizen, forbids the enactment of any law that privileges any form of religious belief or unbelief over any other, and bars the national government from spending tax money for religious purposes. There’s plenty of legislation and case law backing that up, too. But we treat creedal associations—” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I must have given her quite the blank look over that phrase, because she laughed. “I know, it sounds silly. We must have spent six months in committee arguing back and forth over what phrase we could use that would include churches, synagogues, temples, mosques, assemblies, and every other kind of religious and quasireligious body you care to think of. That was the best we could do.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Mr. Carr,” Finch said, “I should probably introduce you. This is Senator Mary Chenkin.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The old woman snorted. “‘Mary’ is quite good enough,” she said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d gotten most of the way around to recognizing her before Finch spoke. I’d read about Mary Chenkin in briefing papers I’d been given before this trip. She’d been a major player in Lakeland Republic politics since Partition, a delegate to their constitutional convention, a presence in both houses of the legislature, and then the third President of the Republic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As for “Senator,” I recalled that all their ex-presidents became at-large members of the upper house and kept the position until they died. “Very pleased to meet you,” I said. “You were saying about creedal associations.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Just that for legal purposes, they’re like any other association. They pay taxes, they’re subject to all the usual health and safety regulations, their spokespeople are legally accountable if they incite others to commit crimes—” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Is that an issue?” I asked.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not for a good many years,” Chenkin said. “There were a few cases early on—you probably know that some religious groups before the Second Civil War used to preach violence against people they didn’t like, and then hide behind freedom-of-religion arguments to duck responsibility when their followers took them at their word and did something appalling. They couldn’t have gotten away with it if they hadn’t been behind a pulpit—advocating the commission of a crime isn’t protected free speech by anyone’s definition—and they can’t get away with it here at all. Once that sank in, things got a good deal more civil.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That made sense. “How’s the Assembly doing financially, though, with taxes to pay?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Oh, not badly at all,” said Mohandas. “We rent out the hall and the smaller meeting rooms quite a bit, of course, and this room—” He gestured around us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“—is a school lunchroom six days a week.” In response to my questioning look:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Yes, we have a school—a lot of,” he grinned, “creedal associations do. Our curriculum’s very strong on science and math, as you can imagine, strong enough that we get students from five and six counties away.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s impressive,” I said. “I visited a school out in Defiance County yesterday; it was—well, interesting is probably the right word.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Well, then, you’ve got to come tour ours,” Chenkin said. “I promise you, there’s no spectator sport in the world that matches watching a class full of fourth-graders tearing into an essay that’s been deliberately packed full of logical fallacies.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That got a general laugh, which I joined. “I bet,” I said. “Okay, you’ve sold me. I’ll have to see what my schedule has lined up over the next few days, but I’ll certainly put a tour here on the list.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Delighted to hear it,” Mohandas said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I wrote a note to myself in my pocket notebook. All the while, though, I was thinking about the future of the Lakeland Republic. Unless the science and math they taught was as antique as everything else in the Republic, how would the kids who graduated from the Assembly school—and equivalent schools in other cities, I guessed—handle being deprived of the kinds of technology bright, science-minded kids everywhere else took for granted? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

While we’re on the subject of narrative fiction, Conan the Cimmerian, Robert E. Howard’s archetypal barbarian hero, has made more than one previous appearance on this blog. With that in mind I’d like to point interested readers in the direction of one of Conan’s more wryly amusing modern manifestations. <i>By Crom!</i> by cartoonist Rachel Kahn features the guy from Cimmeria offering helpful advice for modern urban life. Those who find that thought appealing might consider visiting the publisher’s website <a href="http://www.wealdcomics.com/?page_id=690">here</a> to read the online version or buy PDF copies of the two <i>By Crom!</i> books; those who want printed copies can find the Kickstarter for that project <a href=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/899751906/printing-by-crom-the-autobio-comic-with-a-barbaria>here</a>. </div>

Seems to be important for forming species (known as reproductive isolation) for reasons not fully appreciated by most evolutionary biologists, having to do with genetic drift from the old species and the selective advantage for the genes that have changed in the new species (but not the old!) . For the same reasons, it is useful for starting a new culture when the old one has not collapsed. Unfortunately part of the ROP agenda is a "global village", which works to propagate the memes of the ROP and the global economy.

Most of his novels are set on discworld, which is carried by a giant turtle with four elephants on it´s back (you probably know the myth). He has been called ´the Douglas Adams of fantasy´, and his writings got the label ´fantasy comedy ´, although they´re much more than that. Apart from being funny and sometimes silly, they´re witty, occasionally even wise and full of shrewd observation of human (and dwarf, troll, goblin etc.) character.<br>The reason I was reminded of him when reading your blog this week is that he created a ´Conan´ character as well: he is called Cohen the Barbarian, is over 80 years old and he suffers from a bad back (which sometimes has to be reset in the middle of a fight) and all the other ailments of old age – hilarous!<br>Terry has also invented a communication system for his world (on which electricity doesn´t work) that he called the ´clacks´, which basically is semaphore taken an order of magnitude further: it consist of tower lines, which are just in sight of each other. Every tower is equipped with a squareshaped array of black and white shutters for daytime and the same system with lanterns for nighttime. Given enough able workers to man the towers and a relatively stable political climate, one can send messages and even pictures over vast distances with this system; I thought you might like the concept (if you haven´t heard of it already).<br>I can highly recommend the discworld novels to anyone who likes fantasy and the sort of humor Douglas Adams displays in his Hitchhiker´s Guide To The Galaxy.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c839004251533779910 title="comment permalink">1/28/16, 1:57 AM</a><br><br>

I have a friend that is struggling to live plastic free and actively trying to convince others to do the same. Her efforts are valiant and I have tried many of the strategies she has suggested, but even she acknowledges that Omelas won't let her go due to a lack of alternatives or time to make up the difference with her own efforts.<br><br>It strikes me that learning the skills and technology of a simpler time is one very desirable thing, but changing your mental frame of mind and not fooling yourself is quite another.

That thought in turn, came from an essay that you, JMG, had published in 2008 or 2009 where you commented, 'the Romans had a rich musical tradition, but virtually all of it is lost, except for one haunting, tantalizing snippet about 20 seconds long.' (I paraphrase.)<br><br>We have two huge advantages the Romans didn't-- we know how to make paper, and how to use printing presses. This is in fact how China was able to hang onto its culture through multiple empires, often warring with one another, and the crashes thereof. Now we know these arts too; let's take advantage of them.<br><br>So how to decide which songs should be kept? To me, the test is, 1) do you like it, and 2) can you sing it in the shower and it still sounds decent?<br>Can you play it with handcrafted instruments and have it still sound good?<br>If you have a band with banjos, acoustic guitars, some animal-skin drums with a cymbal, a couple fiddles and a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu rel=nofollow>Chinese Violin</a>, can they still belt out a listenable version of "Where the Streets Have No Name" or "A Momentary Lapse of Reason"?<br><br>Yes, I cite songs from the rock era, but thanks to the joys of Sirius XM, I am learning to love a number of '40's songs too. They really did have some good ones in those days-- the lyrics are often miles more witty and poetic than we get in songs today. The old names we've all heard our grandparents sighing about-- Doris Day, Artie Shaw, "Old Blue Eyes" Frank Sinatra-- they were GOOD! So their music is also worth rescuing and preserving for the future. "No Moon At All" -- that's a classic for any era.<br><br>.....<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c3091367555606530840 title="comment permalink">1/28/16, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

You’ve portrayed a well-attended wedding between two men that had its procession go by without being accosted, ethnic minorities and women in high places of government, and in this week’s post, a stricter set of laws enforcing separation of church and state that has allowed temples, mosques, synagogues, churches, Shaker communes, and Atheist Assemblies to exist alongside each other in harmony more or less. One thing I’ve been mulling over lately, especially as I’ve been reading through comments on some of the more recent essays on the upcoming year, the tensions abroad, and the Trump phenomenon is that… that might not be the direction our society is flowing right now. I read several comments on posts from these last few weeks (especially the New Years post, and the Trump post), in which multiple regular readers here expressed their beliefs that the ideals of multiculturalism, religious pluralism, gender and racial equality, gay rights, and so on are scourges on society that have to be thrown out… and espousing the idea that the people who value these things, are in and of themselves threats to our society. I’ve begun to fear, reading some of these comments that what has in my mind been one of the few real achievements of our civilization… the concepts of human civil rights, equality, religious freedom, and so on may be something that is viewed with as much distaste and derision as the wastefulness and environmental degradation that also features. Do you think it’s possible that a society like Retrotopia could exist? Or are you expressing a hopeful optimism on what is possible, rather than what is likely? Or is it possible that even if there are ways to maintain things like separation of church and state and freedom of religion through times of contraction, people won’t want to find ways because they won’t want to preserve them? And… if those values truly are in danger of becoming seen as harmful values that people view as not worthy of being preserved in the uncomfortably near future, can anything be done to preserve them in the face of those changes? Did anything like the backlash against those values that’s beginning to unfold now happen in the world of Retrotopia and still leave room for at least a few countries to emerge that didn’t completely reject them in the near future? It feels sometimes lately, like there are some possible futures where buckling down, muddling through, and surviving to see what emerges looks like a more attractive option than others.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c3000157084920526576 title="comment permalink">1/28/16, 8:53 AM</a><br><br>

I know you haven't gone very far into the topic yet, and I suspect you'll have some interesting ideas. If you'll allow me to predict:<br>1-it will have to have more than just anti-religious ideas to survive long term as a community. Meetings or classes that work as such in our world are fine for the purpose of education or reinforcement, but they do not build community or change behavior in the same way as a religion can. You've mentioned this multiple times, that no one is going to "go green" in the spirit of self denial and self-punishment, rather, they find something more meaningful and turn to that. People gather around an idea, not around a negative of an idea. So I find it hard to believe that a group of people would enjoy getting together regularly to discuss how we don't need God. <br>2-so if an assembly is to be interesting/useful long term, it will end up focusing on something besides a lack of God (or god or gods if you prefer). This could be set up in the form of debates, lectures, analysis etc. A group could get a great deal of satisfaction in running a book club type of arrangement, consuming stories and deciding what it tells us about the world, about relationships, behavior, thoughts, and so on. If they can come to a general agreement and this affects their behavior and culture, it has taken the place of a religion without having to have "God" involved.<br>3-rules on how to behave within context of the meetings will probably be established early on. In any group, order is necessary for progress.<br>4-at some point certain stories will rise to the top. There are certain texts that people go back to again and again because they offer the most interesting ideas and can be revised often. Other texts may come and go, but they don't become cannon or classic in the same way. These could well become bound together as a sort of Lakeland Classics, which most everyone would want to have read if they were to participate/interact in the atheist conversations. <br>5-they'll probably start developing a special terminology to help describe ideas and topics that continually come up. "Sin" is a popular one in our current world. Through multiple translations, it has acted as an umbrella for many types of negative behaviors and thoughts. It has mostly been rejected by the secular community, but as the concept is explored, people will come up with some sort of terminology to capture similar ideas. Perhaps more specific, perhaps too much jargon will get in the way of the big ideas and they'll boil it down, it's hard to say how it will evolve.<br>Eventually a term similar to god may come back into the conversation as a placeholder for what is right/powerful/orderly/good/connective or whatever. Again, to be clear it not be one term for all of those things together, it may be given personality, but if a concept is going to be discussed at length it will get a word. <br><br>I guess the point is that a lot of what religion has/does seems like it could evolve from any group that is going to try to bring about betterment and introspection. Community, rules and dogma, holy texts, specialized terminology, concern for things bigger than oneself. Not every individual has to follow this path, but I think groups do if they survive long term. They may go down different paths, at different rates, and may lead to different destinations, but there are similarities to be found.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c190526634119995169 title="comment permalink">1/28/16, 10:27 AM</a><br><br>

We have a winner...<br><br>Fifty-Niner, since the decommissioning of the space shuttles, nobody on Earth has the capacity to retrieve and repair satellites in any orbit. The best that can be done is to put in a little extra fuel so that satellites can be boosted into a "graveyard orbit" out of the way of other satellites. So you're quite right about the first point. As for the second, no, satellites in geosynchronous orbits are just as vulnerable to a Kessler syndrome as those in any other orbit -- all it takes is a few collisions that send spalled debris spraying at angles to the main geosynchronous band, and it becomes crunch time very soon. What this implies is that we have a choice between seeing the space age end because we stop launching things, or seeing it end because everything we launch gets smashed to bits by orbiting debris within a few days or weeks of launch. Take your pick!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c5558060127345101267 title="comment permalink">1/28/16, 4:21 PM</a><br><br>

He pulls no punches in that one. <br><br>When we, as a society, can no longer launch weather observation satellites, that's when there will be no doubt that our goose is cooked. All the other uses of space seem pretty marginal economically at this point, but if we can't justify the cost of accurate weather prediction, either because we can't afford the production and launch cost, or the lifetime of a satellite is so short it has no value, then it's over for this version of civilization. Weather prediction is so valuable that it will be the last thing to go.

Notice the word "outdated" -- that's one of the standard bits of jargon that lets you know that somebody's real religion is faith in progress. <br><br>Etienne, of course! Another lesson that could be taken from that is that people are no brighter now than they were in the 6th century BCE, and just as good at pretending that they could always evade the logical consequences of their own actions. <br><br>Kayr, exactly. The thing is, any serious effort in the direction of simplifying your life and decreasing your impact on the biosphere is better than doing nothing at all -- perfection is neither required nor possible. <br><br>Spanish Fly, the problem is that music by Schonberg, Cage, and Stockhausen is what symphonies play when they don't want to have to put up with an audience -- and for good reason: their "music" is ugly and, once you get past the "shock of the new," boring. Bach has long been fashionable among computer geeks here in the US, because -- whatever his personal religious beliefs were -- his music is a delight for the ear and also has a strong underlying mathematical structure. As for beliefs coming from nonrational sources -- of course they do, and that applies to atheism as much as anything else. <br><br>Eric, heck of a good question. By 2100 the Atheist Assemblies might be a fading memory, it might be a small remnant like Theosophy or Spiritualism today, it might have morphed into something else, it might be going strong -- I don't know. I simply see it as a likely outcome of the ongoing collapse of American Protestantism in our time. <br><br>Mikep, I'd be delighted to learn that Putin reads my blog, but so far he hasn't posted a comment. ;-) (I had more than 1700 readers from Russia last week, though, so it's at least possible.)

Nearly all the pushback in North America is coming from the middle-aged and older -- look at the near-universal acceptance of gay marriage by the under-30 cohort in North America as one measure of that, and the collapse of traditional religious beliefs in the same cohort. The current yelling reminds me of nothing so much as the frantic denunciation of race-mixing in the wake of the Civil Rights movement. The thing that traditionalists tend to miss is that North America is not Europe, and what they like to call capital-T tradition -- religious orthodoxy, ethnic nationalism, gender paranoia, and the like -- has very, very shallow roots on this continent. More on this in an upcoming post. <br><br>Mark, I always thought of "Imagine" as a serious piece of atheist hymnody: "Imagine there's no heaven..." No doubt the Assemblies have plenty of other songs to sing, though. <br><br>Ed, it's only in a very small number of religious traditions that doctrinal uniformity is valued and worship of other gods is a problem. Those handful of faiths happen to have been dominant for the last fifteen hundred years or so, but I see no reason to suppose that their dominance will continue. <br><br>Iuval, obviously I disagree. I think that what the "global village" concept is meant to convey -- note here the use of "village" rather than some other concept of community with different connotations -- is not open-minded and respectful communication, but the erasure of differences, the manufacture of a faux-consensus in which the privileged never risk being confronted with the implications of their own privilege. It's very comforting for people in the salary class to talk about being members of the global village, because this allows them to dodge the fact that it's actually a global plantation and their comforts are being paid for by other people's privations and sufferings. <br><br>Bob, let me pose a broader question in response to your question. Is it still "progress" when we're clearly going the wrong direction? <br><br>Anton, of course! Again, just because the Atheist Assemblies look viable in 2065 doesn't mean they'll still be doing the same thing, or existing at all, in 2100. I do think they're a likely future stage in the ongoing self-immolation of American Protestantism, but whether they'll be an enduring form or not is anybody's guess. <br><br>Varun, if you want to give authors the biggest cut, order books direct from the publishers. That's why I put links to publishers on the sidebars of my blogs -- royalties are usually based on the sum received by the publisher, so when they're their own distributors and retail houses, the author benefits.

Terry Pratchett- I didn't care for his early works either, but my preteen daughter wanted to read his "Wee Free Men", the first of a series (the Tiffany Aching books) nominally for younger readers about a young witch coming of age, so I read it to assess its suitability and found myself impressed. It was indeed funny (to my sensibility) but also sensitively written and full of reflection about the responsibilities of growing up and becoming a contributing member of one's community, yet never preachy. It also described the existence of magic in terms that struck me as somewhat closer to the Druid Magic Handbook than to Harry Potter. I gave my daughter the thumbs-up and in fact read the rest of the series myself, save for its last book, which is in fact the final book Prachett published before he died. I'm saving it for the right mood and moment. Though I haven't read all of Pratchett's works, I would venture to say that his style evolved somewhat over the decades and dozens of books in his career, and those who didn't care for "The Color of Magic" might still find some enjoyable, intelligent fantasy in his later works. <br>--Heather in CA<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c891225170172282763 title="comment permalink">1/28/16, 9:42 PM</a><br><br>

It waa with a very interesting fellow whom I often ran into at the local gym. He was 40s, mostly blind, former school teacher, intellectual, and very devoutly christian. When he first moved to this area he, his wife, and 10 kids had attempted to be Amish. He joined in with some of the radical Amish families I was also friends with, who then got excommunicated for, ironically, objeceting to the practice of excommunication. <br><br>He and I would often have fairly serious religious discussions while working out (although as is often the case he never seemed to notice that he was tellign me everything about his religious beliefs amd learning nothing about mine...) These were not debates or arguments, but bona fide discussions about basic concepts in christianity. At this time he was trying to be a Methodist, and not succeeding very well. On this occasion he had been especially upset two nights before at Wednesday bible study when they discussed Job. Some of the people there just could not reconcile that book with their belief in the all loving all benevolent deity - the old question of "how could a loving god treat his most loyal follower that way??" I'm not going to get into that theological question here, but we discussed it at great length. He said that he felt these people were practicing "Christianity without Christ." I didn't fully grasp what he mean then, but just tonight reading these comments I understood. They want the positive, loving, egalitarian ethical system as summarized in the Sermon on the Mount. But they don't want to deal with the rest of the story, the sacrifice, obedience, suffering, and torment that are the foundation of millenia of Christianity and that we are not supposed to "understand," as they are of the mind of a deity that is ultimately an inscrutable mystery to our human minds. <br><br>Indeed it is very easy to see that once you just boil it down to an ethical system that "makes sense" and "works," why do you even need a god anymore?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c1076315189782214827 title="comment permalink">1/28/16, 10:31 PM</a><br><br>

But I would like to substantiate my criticism.<br><br>First, the characters do too much explaining. I understand the story is supposed to make a lower-tech world understandable to rich-world internet users, but it is not believable that random characters know or understand so much about how society came to work in particular way - not outside a university setting, and even there.<br><br>It just does not work that way. The real world is not full of annoying know-it-alls. People just take for granted the world they live in, and if other people disagree, what they give is not an explanation, but blank stares and misunderstanding in the best cases, all the way to lynching and violence in the worst ones. You need to be born into a worldview, no amount of explanation will do.<br><br>Second, whatever we think we know about the world is usually wrong. So when people try to explain the world around them to an outsider, what they usually spout is a mixture of prejudice, opinion, lies and convenient untruths. Instead, the characters in the story are always spot-on in their remarks, always seem to know Mr. Carr's opinion and are always read to counter it elegantly. It is just not believable. <br><br>Third, the story settings feel remarkably white and western. Even if characters in the story have exotic-sounding names, things seem to work either like an exaggerated version of today's America, or an exaggerated version of America in the 1800s. <br><br>I do not think current demographic trends allow for predominantly anglo-saxon political entities in North America within a century or two. And demographic change does not only bring people of different color, but also societal change. However society will work in the future, it will not be a repetition of the past, or of the present.<br><br>Fourthly, the Lakeland Republic seems to get everything right with its "great leap backward". But that is just utopian. A simpler society has less complex problems, but more simple problems: food, healthcare, security. Collapse is not a pleasant path, otherwise civilisations would have chosen it more often, and migration flows would be reverted. <br><br>Finally, there is as good as no plotting, at least until know. And that probably was JMG's intention from the onset: More's Utopia has little plotting too. Unfortunately, a good story is the reason why I read fiction in the first place, otherwise I might just as well read non-fiction. And that is indeed my recommendation: more analyses, less stories please.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c4653619102922278754 title="comment permalink">1/29/16, 1:31 AM</a><br><br>

I apologise if this is delicate or offensive but don’t all religions function at least to some degree as marks of identity in that they serve to distinguish US from THEM. These are topics which polite people don’t discuss in public at least not when sober, but most of us inherit our faith from our parents and many go to marry within the faith community and raise their children in it. In fact I suspect that the degree to which this happens is a better predictor of a particular communion’s long term survival prospects than any analysis of their actual doctrines and beliefs.

Very dull place, and not especially spiritually satisfying; tastes may vary. The funniest memory is a large plastic gas pump in the lobby about 'fueling your faith'. It was to collect funds for the Church, like most of the Churches activities. If they were less contemptuous about the rural past of Fort Collins before it became the hub of America's 'central coast' I have little doubt they would celebrate the area's ranching history with a golden calf. Which I would find much more charming than the gas pump.

The opposite of sanctions and embargo can also be a means of regime change. Presumably the Republic isn't relying solely on the senescence of the globalized system and the exceptional moral fiber of it's citizens to keep sweatshop sneakers and fast food franchises out. I recall that Jerry Pournelle long advocated this approach to Iran, i.e. dropping sanctions and exposing them to what he termed "our cultural weapons of mass destruction." Conceptually, I imagine Lakeland would first need to establish and actively maintain a kind of business and political ecosystem where global corporate interests are unable to thrive, and also devise a thoroughly innocuous seeming but effective offense.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c709081221023777459 title="comment permalink">1/29/16, 8:26 AM</a><br><br>

It's just begun to feel lately like there's been a rising tide of some of these attitudes among younger people, and secular people, and even in the pagan and polytheist world where I've spent most of my adult life. I’ve been feeling an uncomfortable shift in the Peak Oil community, which when I first became aware of it in college was still very tied to the environmental and social justice movements, in which those types are running off for some other movement and the people who are left behind are increasingly involved in anti-feminist, white nationalist, or fascist organizations (by fascist here, I mean organizations whose logos take some sort of ancient Indo-European religious symbol, wrap it in laurel leaves, slap it on a red or black background and put an eagle on top). Perhaps I'm being disoriented by the geographical flattening the internet can cause and tapping into trends that are rising in Europe but are less likely to take hold in America. But at the same time, I can't help but notice that a decent part of Trump's appeal aside from his appeals to the defunct labor movement, is also tapping into racial and religious paranoia, and the fear of the Other.<br><br>As I’ve watched these trends I keep thinking back to the essay "the god with three heads." In which you pointed out that our culture's " focus on the virtues of equality, social justice, and kindness, all understood and pursued primarily on a collective rather than an individual level" was no more inevitable than any other form of progress. Back when I read that essay, it opened my eyes in big ways, made me think about Martin Luther King’s insistence that social progress never “rolles in on the wheels of inevitability, and that without hard work, time itself can become an ally of the forces of social stagnation.” That stagnation is the very thing that the social justice movement’s marriage to the Myth of Progress has caused, and as I look at some of this backlash, I still haven’t figured out yet if it’s a last gasp of a dying culture like you suggest, or evidence that that stagnation caused by the assumption of progress is actually causing one of (in my mind) the greatest achievements of Western Civilization to lose ground. Perhaps by your 2060s, there’s been enough of an upset to decouple the movement from the assumption of progress and allow it to make enough headway to open the way for the world you’re presenting. Or perhaps I’m seeing trends that aren’t there when I see the movement losing ground.<br><br>@Shane: I agree with you that the shrill, self-righteous downsides of our cultural values of social justice, equality, and kindness have risen of late to a self-defeating crescendo that's causing massive frustration, especially when it's tied into identity politics, "call-out culture" online bullying, and so on. What I was more disturbing to me was the way that some of the comments suggested that the entire enlightenment project, from religious freedom and feminism to democracy itself was a lie that could not and should not be preserved for posterity. Those seemed to mostly come from European readers, and some of my friends in Europe have mentioned with unease that in some areas the ghost of the early 20th century is steadily rising from the grave. I only hope those ideas don't become the wave of the future everywhere.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c1167293019467760740 title="comment permalink">1/29/16, 9:17 AM</a><br><br>

In contrast to DiSc, I think the name is a give-away - it is an utopia - in retro. Although I do echo Mr. Carr's concerns of how LLR is going to stave off the Golden Arches and Coca-Cola invasion and all of the exploitative one-sided business shenanigans coming their way with open borders and more open trade. If our own real-life cultural and economic hegemony is anything to go by, it is extremely, (even murderously) aggressive and can be made to look extremely appealing to a populace - until it's claws are fully sunk in. "How you gonna keep 'em down of the farm, after they've seen gay Pay-ree?" Maybe not now for Lakelanders as the pain and suffering of the 2nd civil war is still in their living memories - but what of the next generation who grow up in security with no such memories?<br><br>The one source that to me has explained how our own hegemony works is John Perkins' "Confessions Of An Economic Hit Man". Ultimately the hegemony, (well like old Imperialism), is irresistible at the point of a gun, (or tanks, bombs, drone strikes, assassinations, etc.) That is the bottom line. However sophisticated we think we are - the world still turns on 'Might Makes Right'. So maybe in this retro-Utpoia the resolve is that it can't happen as the Atlantic Republic, Mountain regions, China, Brazil, et al. are currently so screwed up themselves they can't get a proper offensive together. (?) They are in 2065, only paper tigers with no real 'Might'. (?)<br><br>In something of the same vein: I'd like to chime in with Eric S. - I also hold the ideals of genuine 'social justice', equality of opportunity, social safety-nets, blind justice, democracy to be among our highest achievements, (or I should say 'almost achievements', as for many they have not been achieved.) They are far from inevitable. They have been hard won by massive, often violent struggle in the Civil Rights era, the deadly struggles of the Wobblies and early union organizers, etc. Currently we are moving backwards from those goals, I think largely because the bulk of the populace has grown up with the benefits of (relative) equality and justice, but no memory of how hard the battles were. <br><br>So, JMG: I totally understand, it's your utopia, if you decide that racial, gender, religious, sexual-preference equality and harmony are there in LLR because they don't HAVE to be linked to technological progress - fair enough. But linked or not, I don't think they can exists for long without continued struggle. I think that's just human nature. "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants" (Thomas Jefferson), and all that.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c185200932052186077 title="comment permalink">1/29/16, 5:28 PM</a><br><br>

About 15 years ago, when we were trying to establish a US greens party, I read that people of our persuasion (with views rooted in liberalism, but recognizing the importance of a spiritual connection to our planet) constituted about 25% of the population, and growing, while the reactionary conservatives were about 25% and falling, and the remaining 50% believed in technological "progress." The key, it was said, was to open up to the conservatives as our natural allies, while not going as far as to agree with them on social issues. It was clear then to us that Gore's position (he was the Democratic candidate) was not the answer. Even before then, but especially since then "green" has been associated with the privileged classes, and my impression (and it may just be me) is that as people get bumped from the middle classes, they are more likely to turn to the conservatives, who have vocally opposed the hypocrisy of the more visible grifters among the greens. When I was young, I thought, like so many concerned people, that we have to control the population somehow. This was the rational, humane solution to severe and growing problems, but I knew it had to be voluntary and start with oneself only. But when people who have been on the receiving end of austerity hear the words "population control," and see rich greens pontificating and zooming around in their special cars, I don't blame them for getting a different impression. Thus, I think we are going to see the reactionaries make a resurgence, perhaps even at our quartile's expense. We will have to work with them in certain ways, but how to deal with them without compromising our own ideals will be a difficult question. Some people will distance themselves; others will be...tolerant.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c6210875457536188416 title="comment permalink">1/29/16, 8:53 PM</a><br><br>

Are you volunteering to set that project in motion? <br><br>Christopher, good for you for catching that! The Lakeland Republic constitution gives a lot of wiggle room to county governments -- the way the US constitution once did to state governments. Civil rights and the no-religious-establishment clause are guaranteed at all levels, but if a county wants to put up Christmas decorations in its public buildings, and the voters approve, it can do so. Some do, some don't, and it's fairly common for those that do to provide equivalents for the whole range of local religious holidays, but yes, that's an option. <br><br>Ezra, as late as 2065, rich, well-connected businesspeople and politicians in the Atlantic Republic are still desperately trying not to notice what's in front of their faces. Care to guess what the guy who was moving with his family to the Lakeland Republic would say if somebody insisted to him that the Atlantic Republic was still progressing? <br><br>Tony, I've talked to a lot of atheists over the years, and most of them do seem to put being "not religious" very close to the core of their identity. Sad? Granted, but it's a reality in many cases. <br><br>Justin, no, I actually do very well on ebook purchases -- between 25% and 50% of the cover price. Nor do I control the prices for which my books, e- and otherwise, are sold -- the publisher makes that call. As for children not growing up to be mindless consumers, exactly; did you know that "consumer" was an insult in the 19th century, implying that you didn't contribute anything, you just ate up the fruits of other people's labor? <br><br>Patricia, I'm sure there are, but they're probably not a lot bigger in terms of the total population than they are in today's US. <br><br>Five8Charlie, with regard to weather satellites, no argument there -- when those stop being viable, the Space Age is <i>really</i> over. As for readership, though, I don't judge by the number of comments; Blogger gives me current, daily, weekly, monthly, and all time figures for who's reading the blog at all and who's reading what page, and readership totals for Retrotopia posts are noticeably below average. That doesn't bother me at all -- I write what I want to write, for the benefit of those who want to read it, and since I don't make money from advertising, the rise and fall of my site stats is a matter of mild interest to me at best. <br><br>Patricia, yeah, I'm not happy that I didn't think of it at the time.

It's when you bring in the icky bits, the blood and death and so on, that the <i>mysterium tremendum et fascinans</i> begins to peek in -- and to judge by my experience, that's actually more offensive to a lot of people who think of themselves as Christian than the blood, death, etc. <br><br>DiSc, so?

Christianity found its foothold in Roman times, remember, because people no longer simply followed the Pagan religion they grew up with -- they had a choice in the matter, and a lot of them decided that this new faith about the guy on the cross resonated more with them than Zeus and Hera did. New Us/Them dynamics will certainly emerge, just as they did in Roman times -- "Pagan! Heretic! Blasphemer" and so on -- but the discourse you've heard here is a reflection of a common historical fact. <br><br>Spanish Fly, I figure they just use the number: "Opus no. 846" and so on. <br><br>Damaris, somehow I managed to miss that. Many thanks! <br><br>Patricia, why indeed? I confess to a lack of enthusiasm for the Santacentric carols -- we have enough renditions of "gimme-gimme-gimme" in American pop culture without them -- but the more religious carols are lovely to listen to and lovely to sing. <br><br>Shane, nah, you've misunderstood what I was saying. Of course there has been a vast amount of intense, even fanatic religiosity in the US. My point is that Christianity is an import here, and a fairly recent one; it doesn't have the deep historic roots that it does, for example, in Europe. Carl Jung used to say that the thing he noticed about all his American patients and students is the overwhelming presence of a suppressed Native American layer in the depths of their psyches, which isn't there in Europeans; he came to the conclusion that each of the large regions of the planet has its own inherent spirituality that continued irrespective of the migrations of human beings from continent to continent. For a variety of reasons -- and those will need to wait for a future post -- I think he's right, and the consequences of that on the future history of North America are likely to be profound.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c3170607233971028147 title="comment permalink">1/30/16, 12:27 AM</a><br><br>

Wicca and the other brands of popular Neopaganism were the standard flavor of shock-your-mom spirituality from 1980 to more or less now. My guess is that here in the US, African diaspora religions such as Vodoun, Santeria, and Candomble are next in line, but we'll see. As things wind down, one or more of the shock-your-mom traditions will morph into the main religious forms of the next cycle of civilization, but that's probably still a ways off yet. <br><br>Caryn, well, we'll see. One of the things that hasn't been factored into a lot of analyses is the extent to which North America these days is already post-Christian; that's why, for example, the opposition to gay marriage has collapsed so completely, so fast.

He often gets on a soap box on how given all the tax breaks they receive (property taxes and income taxes), there should be no hungry or homeless in any community. <br><br>We went to a large Methodist church for several years, attending the traditional service with traditional hymns and the organ. Fellow congregants, mostly retired folks, could not stop commenting each week on our children being at the service - shouldn't they be in Sunday School playing or at the Contemporary Service which was more for young people? The children sat quietly and participated fully, so no, I'm not excluding them. Ah, yes, church is all about the club benefits, forgot about that.<br><br>The budget for that church was as follows - tithes and donations (income) $1 million. Expenses: salaries &amp; benefits for pastors and staff $500,000. Building upkeep $100,000. Programs for congregation $200,000. Advertising $100,000. And finally, amount given to feed hungry and help homeless, the actual work Jesus called them to do, $100,000. So 10% of what was taken in was used to help people. We stopped attending and just give money to actual people in need, no intermediary needed. We don't get the public recognition of attending and giving, but oh well.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c5758099049844339117 title="comment permalink">1/30/16, 5:35 AM</a><br><br>

Which is so odd, because I've found that in talking with non-greens, particularly down-on-their luck wage &amp; welfare class people, if you come to them with a Limits to Growth, this is where where heading whether we want to or not, this might cushion the blow approach, the wage &amp; welfare class folk are way more receptive to the argument you're trying to make.

Even that which uses the symbols of the White settlers seems to point beyond then to the peoples they displaced. In whites I notice that the progressive have much more sympathy for the Natives than the Americans, and even among conservative or deeply Christian individuals there is a very commonly held and deep sitting respect for the Native populations. A neighbor I know, who is as good an example of a 'True Christian' as I can think of laments the destruction of the Utes, lamenting how much the Utes and the settlers could have shared and learned from each other had animosity been less. She dreams, and many of the rural folks I know and talk with, of a life more a kin to the Native ways. <br><br>Some, especially among the young, is fueled by a general additude of sympathy for the underdog or the oppressed; some is fueled by a nostalgia for a different world era; some by the fact that any one in the arid west can see clearly enough that the American way of life is an awkward and clumsy fit for this eco region, admiring the practicality of Native practices. These factors and others are all significant, but they are not sufficient to the depth of connection to a people that many know only through caricature.<br><br>Another point that is significant to me is the time I have spent with the Dine, or Navajo. They are more 'Western Redneck' that any white could aspire to be, and the Lakota I have known are similar in some ways. I have a hunch that much of the flavor of rural American culture is at heart of a Native character, redressed in American symbolism.<br><br>There is another factor I think of, the overlay of the Industrial technological system. Both the extant Native populations and the current White populations seem to have a mixed relationship to it. Young men in my community are as enthralled with their big pickups as the Utes were with horses, up until Meeker plowed their race track, which was a catastrophe worthy of remorse and study. Today the Deni have pickups much like the Americans. For both peoples the industrial feels alien, invasive, and disjunct from the natural setting. I would cite the religion of the UFO as evidence of how much the West FEELS like it is under alien occupation when technology is looked upon with eyes that feel.<br><br>Also interesting is how many Native groups took quickly to Christianity, and yet also profoundly transformed its meaning in the context of their lives.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c2099102166962043689 title="comment permalink">1/30/16, 8:02 AM</a><br><br>

I understand the benefits to having a religious sensibility, a practice - but am a total misfit when it comes to the organized forces I've come in contact with, longing instead to figure out who I am connected to in my locale. But I'm also untrained and, well, bumble about. That my *sense* to look for something HERE indicates an actual possibility is… quite satisfying. It's been a source of consternation that I can't seem to get on board the variety of religious imports that have come my way and the sense of loss that has come not only through being an uprooted product of modernity, but through not having the tools to figure out with whom/what to connect in the places I've ended up (genius loci, kami, mountain gods, heck, even household deities). This is probably a discussion for Galabes more than ADR, but I just wanted to say that if you decide to write about this, I'm attentively waiting!<br><br>Speaking of what you decide to write about, sorry to DiSc, but by all means, the writer should write what he wants! The reader can read what he wants as well!<br><br>Also, I know Amazon is seen as the paragon of evil in these parts, but I know several writers personally (and through them I know of some a few steps removed) who are able to make a small but consistent income through self-publishing ebooks (probably combining platforms like nook and ibooks, but still) and print-on-demand paper books. It's no longer the days of self-pubbed=vanity press. Some folks make very decent money and a lot of writers are recognizing that they can be paid a fair price for their work.<br><br> Granted, the fiction market is a different creature than the non-fiction, BUT - it would be easy enough to experiment with it. If you have a piece of writing that you've shopped around without takers but that you still love, or a slow seller to which you can reclaim the rights - consider publishing it yourself.

Witness MI5 flying the flag for Pride this year, and Tories using attitudes to homosexuality as a stick to beat traditional Muslims. <br><br>The UK's official educational inspectors are, apparently, to quiz primary school children on their attitudes to homosexuality and gender equality, in attempt to identify embryonic 'radicalisation'. Yet the government that is introducing this were, for the most part, staunch 'reactionaries' in the late '80s, happily voting for Section 28 which forbade the representation of homosexuality in schools as a "pretended family relationship".<br><br>I think this has some kind of bearing on the SJW conversation that sprung up heatedly last week.<br><br>It will, I think, be obvious from the above that I am from the leftward end of things, in my case part of the left that sought to combine a focus on class with broader social issues. We knew, of course, that there was nothing left-wing about <i>being</i> gay, but taking up the cause of equality and openness, or anti-racism and sexual equality for that matter, brought you up against the same 'enemy' (the Right, the government, the state, the establishment, the Man or whatever) that exploited and oppressed the workers.<br><br>All of which leads me to wonder whether some of the most shrill expressions of the SJW mindset are a way of generating the same charge of conflict, the same sense of 'fighting' and rebellion, that seem to be part of package for many involved in politics. Many of the old establishment targets are gone (due to the ground shifting so far) so the conflict has to focus on those 'backward' individuals who are not yet on board, or the fighting terrain has to become even more marginal (whatever its merits) in order to generate the required heat.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c7335613823052045119 title="comment permalink">1/30/16, 10:14 AM</a><br><br>

This reminds me of a passage from John Henry Cardinal Newman, commenting on Victorian press reports from the deathbed of some eminent Victorian equivalent of Prof. Carl Sagan. That grey eminence (the contemporary press was reporting with approbation) had been consoling himself in his final hours by reflecting on the dignity and sublimity of science - on (I paraphrase loosely here, from memory) some details of chemistry; on acids and alkalis and oxidation-reduction reactions, or on something similar. <br><br>Newman's comment was that in the face of the desolation and majesty of Death, this scientistic-atheist attitude is bizarre, is nuts, is significantly and majorly Ding-a-Ling-Ding-Dong. <br><br>We all have to make up our own minds about this. For my part, I side with Cardinal Newman. There seems to me, speaking subjectively and privately, something like colour-blindness in a scientistic response to deathbed suffering. Or one could say, varying the metaphor, it is a bit like tone-deafness. <br><br>I make this remark as a Catholic mainly anchored in science, not in humanities. <br><br><br>Hastily, respectfully,<br><br><br>Tom<br> <br>PS: On science itself, I would like to add (I hope that nobody greatly minds this; perhaps some maths-or-phys student in JMG's readership will indeed be helped) that I keep working on a programme of writing up elementary physics without the obfuscatory Leibniz derivatives-and-integrals-and-differentials "d". This week, I found to my joy that the same programme is pursued, at the exalted level of advanced classical mechanics ("calculus of variations", with "Hamiltonians" or "Lagrangeans"), by Wisdom and Sussman. I got put onto this work through a brief correspondence with Dr John S. Denker (at Bell Labs?; Dr Denker has multiple deep essays at <a href=http://www.av8n.com/physics/ rel=nofollow>http://www.av8n.com/physics/</a>). I additionally find Dr Denker's judgement affirmed by an Ivy League authority, Prof. P. Hut at Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies: simply Google on ((STRING))sussman wisdom review piet hut((/STRING)). <br> <br>PPS: Thanks, Shane et al, for pointer to new Facebook page for Wizards.

Could it perhaps be that the general house-buying public is regarding the destruction of 32 out of the 77 (largely forested) hectares as morally objectionable, and is therefore reluctant to purchase? <br><br>I will remark here what I have in essence remarked here before: an overview of the case can be had by googling on ((STRING))Glen Strom ugly battle over David Dunlap Observatory((/STRING)). One thereupon retrieves a rather gappy piece of 2015-04-26 blog journalism from space-exploration enthusiast Glen Strom, with two clarifying 2015-12-30 blog comments from my desk. The gappy journalism, together with my gap-filling comments, and together also with Mr Strom's own graphics and Mr Strom's well chosen video links, makes much of the case clear. <br><br>As I remark in one of my two comments on Mr Strom's blog, the general public can help by subscribing, politely and truthfully, to the developer's own newsletter, offered at <a href=http://www.observatoryhill.ca/ rel=nofollow>http://www.observatoryhill.ca/</a>. This little action takes all of 40 or 60 or 120 seconds. <br><br>If lots of people, especially from outside Ontario, subscribe, it will slowly sink in to the developer that many of the people reading the newsletter promo are not interesting in flipping the projected offensive houses, or even in buying them honestly as permanent homes.<br><br>That dawning realization may make the developer family (publicly and visibly Catholic) more amenable to meeting with me, as another publicly visible Catholic. What we need - I have already pointed this out twice by e-mail to the Archdiocese in Toronto and to the Papal Nuncio in Ottawa, and of course to the wealthy developer family - is a kind of low-key meeting, in which the ethics of this thing get probed, and in which both I (defending conservation on all 77 hectares) and the developer family (opposing conservation on 32 of the 77 hectares) are represented by our respective spiritual directors. If we are Catholics, we must make some effort, however limping, however clumsy, to live our faith. <br><br>Thinking of the sad case of this wealthy, Catholic, and from one perspective faux-Catholic, family makes me ponder a question which IS connected with JMG's ADR blog this week - the question, namely, "What is it to leave a faith tradition?" One is tempted to deem leaving some varieties of Christianity easy enough - one puts the stress on Jesus, not equally on Jesus and the Christ; and one stresses ethics, not the liturgy of sacrifice; and one neglects the actual lived practice of previous generations, in their architecture, music, and other physical forms of expression; and soon it becomes easy to migrate to some approximation of JMG's Atheist Assembly. <br><br>I think that the case of Catholicism is different, and that the cases of Catholicism and Judaism are similar. <br><br>Does anyone ever just <i>stop</i> being Jewish? People fall away from the synagogue, they know less and less of the Law, they claim more or less mellifluously to be agnostic: but at some level they remain Jewish. At any rate, this is my guess. Maybe some Jewish ADR readers are able to comment? <br><br><br>Tom Karmo<br><br>Toomas(dot)Karmo(at)gmail(dot)com<br><br>www(dot)metascientia(dot)com<br><br>647-267-9566 <br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c2604770211945526455 title="comment permalink">1/30/16, 12:14 PM</a><br><br>

Languages are being recovered, along with ancient skills. And while I realize some of the prophecies are hoaxes, there are quite an astounding number that mention the return of peoples to their ancestral ways. <br><br>Recently I had an opportunity to join a workshop concerning Waldorf education. In the workshop the Anthroposophical approach to life stages was being taught. While it was all very interesting to me, what I was really stunned by was the similarity between the life stages and how they were recognized by Anthroposophical studies, and how MANY Native cultures had already discovered similar things.

It depends on how recently there has been fresh emigration/settlement and how prevalent anti-Semitism is in the surrounding culture. <br><br>In the absence of pervasive cultural anti-Semitism, I'd say that Jews stop being Jews two generations after an intermarriage in which the children are not raised as Jews with a Jewish identity (cultural or religious). In the presence of anti-Semitism, hostile outsiders are keeping track of your ancestry and treating you differently even if you don't feel Jewish. That will motivate some to try harder to "pass", but most will react to discrimination by feeling more identification with the group.<br><br>The United States presents a set of test cases because Jews have never suffered any legal disability and because Jews in the Northeast, the South and the West have different histories of origin, settlement, and experience of prejudice.

Only sluts, bohemians, and low class girls who didn't care about their reputations did it. If a baby was born less than nine months after the marriage ceremony, it was an embarrassment though not a scandal.<br><br>As I recall it, by 1970 middle class parents were resigned to their daughters not being virgins when they married but weren't pleased if they advertised the fact by moving in with their fiances. By 1980 it was not just accepted but expected that couples of all classes would live together for months or years before they marry. Not living together before marriage became regarded as odd and perhaps unhealthy.<br><br>At present, it appears to me that the norm for the middle and upper classes is that couples do not set a marriage date until a baby is on the way. This was once the standard practice for parts of the working class. Today the working class does not get married at all, because the prospects for working class men are so poor that young women do not see any economic benefit in marrying them.<br><br>The speed at which this reversal of social attitudes has spread through all classes, in the teeth of Christian morality, seems like an indication that organized Christianity has a weak hold on Americans.

Not for what it says but for the way that some could twist this idea to reinforce the myth of "American exceptionalism" that even Obama has proudly boasted off. Certainly a land can and does have an effect on the spirituality of a people living there, whether they were raised there or are recent blow-ins, but not always in the same way. The traditional aborigines in Australia are spiritually bound to their land in ways that I cannot even begin to imagine but the people that have come to live her in the past two centuries show no sign of adopting similar spiritual feelings. Remember too that three of the world's great religions all had their origins in the same neighbourhood but they too have evolved differently in their own way.<br><br> Thing is, people are to a large extent a product of their place and time. As an example, using my flux-capacitor, I could go back in time to a medieval bog-peasant village rife with disease and superstition, kidnap all the babies and toddlers in that same god-forsaken village, bring them back here and have them raised to be accountants, fire-fighters, engineers, nurses, pilots and whatever else they were capable of. The difference here is the scope and opportunity that they were offered in growing up. I suspect that their spirituality would be likewise radically different. I didn't say necessarily better, I just said different.<br><br> The description of the Assembly is quite enjoyable but there is another way that things could play out in terms of religion. In this, I am reminded of the story of the bloke who went to join the army back in 1939 as the country went to war. He answered all the interviewer's questions on name, age, address, education and the like but when it came to the question of religion, he replied:<br>"Aww, just put me down for whatever you're short off!"<br> He may have been an atheist, a deeply religious person, or something in between but I have always admired this individual's attitude.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c485181547101696442 title="comment permalink">1/30/16, 10:00 PM</a><br><br>

I think the idea that the dominant white culture could be fragile &amp; subject to collapse over time was what drew the blank looks. As to peoples comments about admiration of Native culture, I think the old saying "familiarity breeds contempt" is apt here, same as with African-Americans or even Latinos. Just as the whitest areas of the US were the most pro-abolition, pro-desegregation, the same is true with animosity towards Natives. In Canada, there's a lot of animosity/bad blood between First Nations and white people, but First Nations make up a larger percentage of the population, and the Canadians did not evacuate and resettle (and kill) First Nations peoples the way the US did, so there is more interaction.

Does it still count as miscegenation when gay people do it, or does a baby have to potentially result, I've never been sure on that point? Considering how exotic gingers are regarded in most cultures, and how much they value translucent pale skin, you'd be a fool to be a ginger and NOT miscegenate, IMHO And I have 30 and under evangelical friends that I'm totally open with and feel totally accepted by, so there's that, too.<br>It seems that our Mr. Carr comes from a very senile elite, indeed...<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c1468998624961236019 title="comment permalink">1/31/16, 7:27 AM</a><br><br>

Of course, each congregation has its own particular culture, and it may be that the one you participated in <b>did</b> keep service to the needy at arms length (or out-sourced completely). But the little Lutheran church which I attend uses its building and paid staff to <b>provide</b> service to the needy. The poor, elderly, and those suffering illness are among the worshipers; those giving care this year may be those receiving care next year (and <i>vice versa</i>). We celebrate the Sacrament of Communion, as Christ told us to, and that can be every bit as much of a mystic ritual as you allow yourself to experience. <br><br>On the other hand, a church that defines itself as community choir, civic association, and vehicle for redistribution of a bit of its members' wealth to its strange and distant inferiors does not represent the Christ that we see in the Gospels.

Of course these two categories overlap, and it's no surprise that they would come to share one building by 2065 (particularly in the LR, where the 1st category's devotion to Progress will have been abandoned), but it seems strange that the dominant tone is that of the first group, which has a much less spiritually fertile attitude than the second and little experience running a church.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c2203556920055225488 title="comment permalink">1/31/16, 7:35 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks for the update on the coastal flooding -- as the news media becomes more and more propagandized, that kind of on-the-spot update is going to become more necessary. <br><br>Shane, the difficulty here is that, for reasons <a href=../../2014/11/dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html rel=nofollow>already discussed here</a>, most kinds of economic activity are so massively parasitized by government, banks, and other intermediaries that they're no longer viable. My guess is that very few new stores will go in, and those towns that survive will revert to subsistence economics and non-market modes of exchange. As for the shallow roots of European civilization here: exactly. I don't think, though, that we'll retrieve what was lost; I think that what was lost will retrieve <i>us</i>...<br><br>Patricia, good! I don't have children to shock, but would probably have done so if I did. <br><br>Ray, exactly. It takes a few centuries for people to be drawn into the kinds of relationships with the land that the land wants, but sooner or later it happens.

I have no complaint if people who use self-publishing find Amazon useful -- but if your favorite authors aren't self-publishing, buying their things from Amazon takes a big bite out of their income. <br><br>Lynnet, I wish -- it's not one of the options Blogger provides, as far as I know. <br><br>Matthew, exactly!

Still, running away from the stark reality of death is among the most popular habits of people in industrial society, and has been for a very, very long time. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, thanks for the update from Ecnarf!<br><br>Buddha, I'm rather fond of John Rogers' famous quote about that book: “There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old’s life: <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs."<br><br>Toomas, I wonder to what extent you might be confusing Catholicism as a religion with Catholicism as a cultural phenomenon. I've long noted that most people in the US are cultural Protestants even if they long ago rejected everything that the Protestant churches stand for -- but that's not visible, because Protestant culture is so pervasive in the US that it's invisible. Catholic and Jewish culture, by contrast, stand out because they differ from the norm. <br><br>Hubertus, the Atheist Assembly was pretty dry for my taste, too, but there are people who like that kind of thing. <br><br>William, now there's a blast from the past! Yes, I think it's very likely that both will make a comeback. <br><br>.Mallow, of course. Just as Pagan gods were redefined as Christian saints, Christian saints will be redefined as Sufi shaykhs or the like, and European Islam will morph to fit the soil the way it's done in Indonesia and elsewhere. It'll take a few centuries, though. <br><br>Moshe, and a very extensive discussion it will have to be, too. <br><br>Justin, it's in an essay in Jung's <i>Collected Works</i>, which I know is no help at all. If I had to guess, I'd reach first for <i>Civilization in Transition</i>, but that's only a guess. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, the implosion of the cultural consensus backing traditional Christian sexual morality is a really dramatic shift, and you're quite right that the latest round of culture wars are simply part of that larger change. As for the decline of belief in evolution, I'd associate that with collapse of faith in science, rather than any enthusiasm for fundamentalist Protestantism.<br><br>Other Tom, Vine Deloria Jr. in <i>God is Red</i> argued that the sacrality of place is of huge importance, and largely neglected in the mainstream religions of the US. I tend to think that he's right. <br><br>Kevin, the religions of the desert Middle East all have much more in common with each other than they have with most other faiths -- enough so that I think it's fair to consider Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism, and the like as variations on a common desert theme. As for America and Australia -- if Jung's to be believed, the orientation toward the land happens at the very bottom of the unconscious and slowly works its way up. It'll be centuries before the white people of Australia consciously relate to the land the way the native peoples do, and the same could be said about white people here -- but it would have been interesting, if Jung had visited Australia or had a bunch of Australian patients, to hear what he had to say about the crawlspaces of their psyches.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c692549264462730223 title="comment permalink">2/1/16, 11:51 PM</a><br><br>

Stay tuned...<br><br>Desir, as I noted in response to an earlier comment, it's entirely possible that in the longer run, the Atheist Assemblies will turn out to be no more durable than the Ethical Culture movement or Auguste Comte's "Religion of Humanity." I find it likely that something like that will emerge out of the current atheist scene over the next fifty years or so; beyond that I don't care to speculate. <br><br>Aias, good! You caught that. Most churches are awkward hybrids of a variety of different viewpoints and trends who manage to work out ways of spending Sundays together, and I saw no reason to make the Atheist Assembly any different. <br><br>Team10tim, yes, I heard! Talk about fine metaphors...<br><br>James, oh bright gods. That is such a perfect example of what passes for economic thinking these days!<br><br>Pictures and Daelach, many thanks! Eagles versus drones...I like it. <br><br>Whomever, yep. And there isn't a thing that can be done at this point except to move to higher ground. <br><br>David, ah, but look at the bright side -- the fusion physicists will be able to keep clamoring for more billions in grant money for years to come, in order to find out whether it's possible to come up with a solution to this problem, and then figure out what the solution is, and then spend decades trying to make it work, before they have to get back to the far more daunting challenge of making ITER look like it's going to do anything but waste money. Whole generations of young physicists will retire before the gravy train runs dry! <br><br>Grandmom, good. Exempting religious organizations from taxation is a covert subsidy for religion, at every other organization's expense. Real religious liberty would be an even playing field, with nobody getting a subsidy except from their own congregations. <br><br>Donalfagan, of course!

Schooling is more mandated and forced on us than any religion in the US. Our faith is public schooling is high. In fact public schools are probably part of the religion of progress given its conveyor belt approach: add subjects and testing onto the child until they are deemed "graduated". <br><br>We all pay taxes to support public schools for K-12 grades and we have no freedom or choice in what our children study, who their teachers are, and what school they attend. Experts and bureaucrats make all those decisions for parents and society. Homeschooling and private/parochial schools are tolerated because the families still pay the taxes to support the public schools and follow the public school guidelines (subjects and scope by grade, and the school year schedule).<br><br>If there were freedom in education for children and parents picked schools, opponents retort that the educationally disadvantaged and those in poverty would suffer because those families can't afford a good education. The assumption there being that the public school education is good. But public schools are the complete opposite of good in every way - academics, social development, physical exercise, nutrition and just plain old relevance. Does anything one learns in public school matter? <br><br>I don't have an answer to fix public schools and I think they are so entwined in our culture that we can't fix them, just hope to eliminate them completely at some point. Too many adult salary class jobs rely on the system, and in many communities at least here in the rural north east, a teacher is the highest paying (salary + benefits), most stable job to be had.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c4477574391199335442 title="comment permalink">2/2/16, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

Maybe it's just me, but, to a fault, everyone I've ever encountered who goes apoplectic regarding the dissolution of the US, who refuses to consider the possibility of a post-American world, or thinks that American dissolution will bring on Armageddon, belongs to the 50+ cohort, regardless of political belief. These people seem unable to rationally, calmly entertain notions of dissolution, secession, disunion. I'm thinking it's a true generational divide, that is, growing up during the Cold War, when postwar America was at its peak imperial power, fundamentally determines their view of the US and American power. For them, the US is The Most Powerful Superpower in the World whose foundation must not be challenged without risking apocalypse. Of course, for the under 40, particularly under 30, crowd, who have grown up in a decidedly different America, this Power That Must Not be Challenged is an ironic joke, at best an emperor with no clothes--the US that they grew up in does not inspire the same faith in the civil religion of Americanism that it does in their elders, therefore, they're much more willing to entertain ideas of dissolution, disunion, and a post-American world. Again, like most things, Gen X (40 somethings) form the cusp between the divides.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c5116630209402988661 title="comment permalink">2/3/16, 8:36 AM</a><br><br>

Half the reason the future surprises us is that the political consensus of a generation always reaches its greatest influence over society a decade or so before that generation ages out. <br><br>FLWolverine and Toomas, thanks for the links!<br><br>Patricia, oh for heaven's sake. Let me restate it again, in the hopes that you and others will actually pay attention this time: THE TIER SYSTEM ONLY DETERMINES WHAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS PAID FOR BY TAX MONEY. I haven't shown a single person in the Lakeland Republic wearing homespun or mucking out a stable by hand, and there are good reasons for that. People living in tier one counties are not 1830s reenactors; they're people living in a county that provides a much simpler infrastructure and charges much lower tax rates, and that's all. Most of them wear clothes made in factories in the Lakeland Republic's cities, just as Carr does -- his clothing wasn't hand-tailored; he walked into a shop and walked out with a complete wardrobe, after all. The shops in Hicksville are full of manufactured products, including a fair number of electrical devices -- it's just that they run either on batteries or on 12-volt DC, produced by those wind turbines Carr noticed.<br><br>It's fascinating to watch the extraordinary power of the mental fixation that leads so many otherwise intelligent people to assume blindly that you can't choose among technologies: if you have one 1830s technology, you've got to have them all, and you can't have anything that came along later. That's not a rational claim, but it's astonishingly deeply rooted in many people's minds these days.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c5630214935042578681 title="comment permalink">2/3/16, 12:14 PM</a><br><br>

However, most scholars feel that Congress only needs to pay attention to the Article V calls that are related to a single topic or movement.

It's not my usual habit to comment haphazardly on posts in this way. I read The Flutter of Space Bat Wings just a few minutes ago, and for some reason I can't comment on that post. But there was something about it that I would really like to share. Feel free to delete this comment, because it doesn't fit with this post! It's very much in the Alien Space Bats vein. <br><br><br>If you liked H.P. Lovecraft's work, I believe that you'll may enjoy Olaf Stapledon (whose philosophy Lovecraft admired quite a bit). Stapledon's Last and First Men tells the story of humanity as it plays out over 200 million years, with 18 different human species on three different planets in the solar system (don't worry, though. When it becomes clear that the moon is going to crash into the Earth it takes the Fourth Men over one million years of preparation to manage to make the leap from Earth to Venus, and they traumatically collapse into non-sentience immediately afterwards. That seems like a more realistic view of colonization than we have got), and ending with humanity's complete extinction. There are dozens of cycles of societal rise and collapse within a single human species and several periods where humanity loses sentience altogether.<br>Two interesting things stand out for me. First of all, we, the first human species, end up utterly collapsing after using up all of our coal and petroleum. Prescient, right? The second thing, and what is for me the most interesting thing about the book by far, is that Stapledon claims in the introduction that even though he himself believes that he is writing a work of fiction the actual author of the book is one of the Last Men, who is subtly directing Stapledon's thoughts from the far future (it is explained that as our acquaintance with time is very imperfect, our understanding of how it works is completely defeated). This device adds an almost mythic quality to the whole work that I can't really describe. For a book that was written in the 1930s it got a startling amount of stuff right and remains quite amazingly powerful. He's like Lovecraft in the way that he emphasizes our insignificance, but he somehow does it in a way that is almost triumphant rather than with Lovecraft's cosmic pessimism. <br><br>"Great are the stars, and man is of no account to them...Throughout all his existence man has been striving to hear the music of<br>the spheres, and has seemed to himself once and again to catch some<br>phrase of it, or even a hint of the whole form of it. Yet he can never<br>be sure that he has truly heard it, nor even that there is any such<br>perfect music at all to be heard. Inevitably so, for if it exists, it is<br>not for him in his littleness. But one thing is certain. Man himself,<br>at the very least, is music, a brave theme that makes music also of its<br>vast accompaniment, its matrix of storms and stars. Man himself in his<br>degree is eternally a beauty in the eternal form of things. It is very<br>good to have been man. And so we may go forward together with laughter<br>in our hearts, and peace, thankful for the past, and for our own<br>courage. For we shall make after all a fair conclusion to this brief<br>music that is man.”<br><br><a href=retrotopia-lines-of-separation.html#c2373151074390010129 title="comment permalink">4/12/16, 9:43 PM</a><br><br>
