One of the many advantages of being a Druid is that you get to open your holiday presents four days early. The winter solstice—Alban Arthuan, to use one term for it in the old-fashioned Druid Revival traditions I practice—is one of the four main holy days of the Druid year. Though the actual moment of solstice wobbles across a narrow wedge of the calendar, the celebration traditionally takes place on December 21.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yes, Druids give each other presents, hang up decorations, and enjoy as sumptuous a meal as resources permit, to celebrate the rekindling of light and hope in the season of darkness.</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Come to think of it, I’m far from sure why more people who don’t practice the Christian faith still celebrate Christmas, rather than the solstice. It’s by no means necessary to believe in the Druid gods and goddesses to find the solstice relevant; a simple faith in orbital inclination is sufficient reason for the season, after all—and since a good many Christians in America these days are less than happy about what’s been done to their holy day, it seems to me that it would be polite to leave Christmas to them, have our celebrations four days earlier, and cover their shifts at work on December 25th in exchange for their covering ours on the 21st. (Back before my writing career got going, when I worked in nursing homes to pay the bills, my Christian coworkers and I did this as a matter of course; we also swapped shifts around Easter and the spring equinox. Religious pluralism has its benefits.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who don’t happen to be Druids, but who are tempted by the prospect just sketched out, will want to be aware of a couple of details. For one thing, you won’t catch Druids killing a tree in order to stick it in their living room for a few weeks as a portable ornament stand and fire hazard. Druids think there should be more trees in the world, not fewer! A live tree or, if you must, an artificial one, would be a workable option, but a lot of Druids simply skip the tree altogether and hang ornaments on the mantel, or what have you. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Oh, and most of us don’t do Santa Claus. I’m not sure why Santa Claus is popular among Christians, for that matter, or among anyone else who isn’t a devout believer in the ersatz religion of Consumerism—which admittedly has no shortage of devotees just now. There was a time when Santa hadn’t yet been turned into a poorly paid marketing consultant to the toy industry; go back several centuries, and he was the Christian figure of St. Nicholas; and before then he may have been something considerably stranger. To those who know their way around the traditions of Siberian shamanism, certainly, the conjunction of flying reindeer and an outfit colored like the famous and perilous hallucinogenic mushroom <i>Amanita muscaria</i> is at least suggestive. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, whether he takes the form of salesman, saint, or magic mushroom, Druids tend to give the guy in the red outfit a pass. Solstice symbolism varies from one tradition of Druidry to another—like almost everything else among Druids—but in the end of the tradition I practice, each of the Alban Gates (the solstices and equinoxes) has its own sacred animal, and the animal that corresponds to Alban Arthuan is the bear. If by some bizarre concatenation of circumstances Druidry ever became a large enough faith in America to attract the attention of the crazed marketing minions of consumerdom, you’d doubtless see Hallmark solstice cards for sale with sappy looking cartoon bears on them, bear-themed decorations in windows, bear ornaments to hang from the mantel, and the like. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
While I could do without the sappy looking cartoons, I definitely see the point of bears as an emblem of the winter solstice, because there’s something about them that too often gets left out of the symbolism of Christmas and the like—though it used to be there, and relatively important, too. Bears are cute, no question; they’re warm and furry and cuddlesome, too; but they’re also, ahem, carnivores, and every so often, when people get sufficiently stupid in the vicinity of bears, the bears kill and eat them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That is to say, bears remind us that actions have consequences. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m old enough that I still remember the days when the folk mythology surrounding Santa Claus had not quite shed the last traces of a similar reminder. According to the accounts of Santa I learned as a child, naughty little children ran a serious risk of waking up Christmas morning to find no presents at all, and a sorry little lump of coal in their stockings in place of the goodies they expected. I don’t recall any of my playmates having that happen to them, and it never happened to me—though I arguably deserved it rather more than once—but every child I knew took it seriously, and tried to moderate their misbehavior at least a little during the period after Thanksgiving. That detail of the legend may still survive here and there, for all I know, but you wouldn’t know it from the way the big guy in red is retailed by the media these days. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, the version I learned was a pale shadow of a far more unnerving original. In many parts of Europe, when St. Nicholas does the rounds, he’s accompanied by a frightening figure with various names and forms. In parts of Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, it’s Krampus—a hairy devil with goat’s horns and a long lolling tongue, who prances around with a birch switch in his hand and a wicker basket on his back. While the saint hands out presents to good children, Krampus is there for the benefit of the others; small-time junior malefactors can expect a thrashing with the birch switch, while the legend has it that the shrieking, spoiled little horrors at the far end of the naughty-child spectrum get popped into the wicker basket and taken away, and nobody ever hears from them again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yes, I know, that sort of thing’s unthinkable in today’s America, and I have no idea whether anyone still takes it with any degree of seriousness over in Europe. Those of my readers who find the entire concept intolerable, though, may want to stop for a moment and think about the context in which that bit of folk tradition emerged. Before fossil fuels gave the world’s industrial nations the temporary spate of abundance that they now enjoy, the coming of winter in the northern temperate zone was a serious matter. The other three seasons had to be full of hard work and careful husbandry, if you were going to have any particular likelihood of seeing spring before you starved or froze to death. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By the time the solstice came around, you had a tolerably good idea just how tight things were going to be by the time spring arrived and the first wild edibles showed up to pad out the larder a bit. The first pale gleam of dawn after the long solstice night was a welcome reminder that spring was indeed on its way, and so you took whatever stored food you could spare, if you could spare any at all, and turned it into a high-calorie, high-nutrient feast, to provide warm memories and a little additional nourishment for the bleak months immediately ahead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In those days, remember, children who refused to carry their share of the household economy might indeed expect to be taken away and never be heard from again, though the taking away would normally be done by some combination of hunger, cold, and sickness, rather than a horned and hairy devil with a lolling tongue. Of course a great many children died anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A failed harvest, a longer than usual winter, an epidemic, or the ordinary hazards of life in a nonindustrial society quite regularly put a burst of small graves in the nearest churchyard. It was nonetheless true that good children, meaning here those who paid attention, learned fast, worked hard, and did their best to help keep the household running smoothly, really did have a better shot at survival. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the most destructive consequences of the age of temporary abundance that fossil fuels gave to the world’s industrial nations, in turn, is the widespread conviction that consequences don’t matter—that it’s unreasonable, even unfair, to expect anyone to have to deal with the blowback from their own choices. That’s a pervasive notion these days, and its effects show up in an astonishing array of contexts throughout contemporary culture, but yes, it’s particularly apparent when it comes to the way children get raised in the United States these days.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The interesting thing here is that the children aren’t necessarily happy about that. If you’ve ever watched a child systematically misbehave in an attempt to get a parent to react, you already know that kids by and large want to know where the limits are. It’s the adults who want to give tests and then demand that nobody be allowed to fail them, who insist that everybody has to get an equal share of the goodies no matter how much or little they’ve done to earn them, and so on through the whole litany of attempts to erase the reality that actions have consequences. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That erasure goes very deep. Have you noticed, for example, that year after year, at least here in the United States, the Halloween monsters on public display get less and less frightening? These days, far more often than not, the ghosts and witches, vampires and Frankenstein’s monsters splashed over Hallmark cards and window displays in the late October monster ghetto have big goofy grins and big soft eyes. The wholesome primal terrors that made each of these things iconic in the first place—the presence of the unquiet dead, the threat of wicked magic, the ghastly vision of walking corpses, whether risen from the grave to drink your blood or reassembled and reanimated by science run amok—are denied to children, and saccharine simulacra are propped up in their places. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here again, children aren’t necessarily happy about that. The bizarre modern recrudescence of the Victorian notion that children are innocent little angels tells me, if nothing else, that most adults must go very far out of their way to forget their own childhoods. Children aren’t innocent little angels; they’re fierce little animals, which is of course exactly what they should be, and they need roughly the same blend of gentleness and discipline that wolves use on their pups to teach them to moderate their fierceness and live in relative amity with the other members of the pack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Being fierce, they like to be scared a little from time to time; that’s why they like to tell each other ghost stories, the more ghoulish the better, and why they run with lolling tongues toward anything that promises them a little vicarious blood and gore. The early twentieth century humorist Ogden Nash nailed it when he titled one of his poems “Don’t Cry, Darling, It’s Blood All Right.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Traditional fairy tales delighted countless generations of children for three good and sufficient reasons. First of all, they’re packed full of wonderful events. Second, they’re positively dripping with gore, which as already noted is an instant attraction to any self-respecting child. Third, they’ve got a moral—which means, again, that they are about consequences. The selfish, cruel, and stupid characters don’t get patted on the head, given the same prize as everyone else, and shielded from the results of their selfishness, cruelty, and stupidity; instead, they get gobbled up by monsters, turned to stone by witches’ curses, or subjected to some other suitably grisly doom. It’s the characters who are honest, brave, and kind who go on to become King or Queen of Everywhere. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Such things are utterly unacceptable, according to the approved child-rearing notions of our day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Ask why this should be the case and you can count on being told that expecting a child to have to deal with the consequences of its actions decreases it’s self-esteem. No doubt that’s true, but this is another of those many cases where people in our society manage not to notice that the opposite of one bad thing is usually another bad thing. Is there such a thing as too little self-esteem? Of course—but there is also such a thing as too much self-esteem. In fact, we have a common and convenient English word for somebody who has too much self-esteem. That word is “jerk.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The cult of self-esteem in contemporary pop psychology has thus produced a bumper crop of jerks in today’s America. I’m thinking here, among many other examples, of the woman who made the news a little while back by strolling right past the boarding desk at an airport, going down the ramp, and taking her seat on the airplane ahead of all the other passengers, just because she felt she was entitled to do so. When the cabin crew asked her to leave and wait her turn like everyone else, she ignored them; security was called, and she ignored them, too. They finally had to drag her down the aisle and up the ramp like a sack of potatoes, and hand her over to the police. I’m pleased to say she’s up on charges now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That woman had tremendous self-esteem. She esteemed herself so highly that she was convinced that the rules that applied to everyone else surely couldn’t apply to her—and that’s normally the kind of attitude you can count on from someone whose self-esteem has gone up into the toxic-overdose range. Yet the touchstone of excessive self-esteem, the gold standard of jerkdom, is the complete unwillingness to acknowledge the possibility that actions have consequences and you might have to deal with those, whether you want to or not. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That sort of thing is stunningly common in today’s society. It was that kind of overinflated self-esteem that convinced affluent liberals in the United States and Europe that they could spend thirty years backing policies that pandered to their interests while slamming working people face first into the gravel, without ever having to deal with the kind of blowback that arrived so dramatically in the year just past. Now Britain is on its way out of the European Union, Donald Trump is mailing invitations to his inaugural ball, and the blowback’s not finished yet. Try to point this out to the people whose choices made that blowback inevitable, though, and if my experience is anything to go by, you’ll be ignored if you’re not shouted down. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On an even greater scale, of course, there’s the conviction on the part of an astonishing number of people that we can keep on treating this planet as a combination cookie jar to raid and garbage bin to dump wastes in, and never have to deal with the consequences of that appallingly shortsighted set of policies. That’s as true in large swathes of the allegedly green end of things, by the way, as it is among the loudest proponents of smokestacks and strip mines. I’ve long since lost track of the number of people I’ve met who insist loudly on how much they love the Earth and how urgent it is that “we” protect the environment, but who aren’t willing to make a single meaningful change in their own personal consumption of resources and production of pollutants to help that happen. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Consequences don’t go away just because we don’t want to deal with them. That lesson is being taught right now on low-lying seacoasts around the world, where streets that used to be well above the high tide line reliably flood with seawater when a high tide meets an onshore wind; it’s being taught on the ice sheets of Greenland and West Antarctica, which are moving with a decidedly un-glacial rapidity through a trajectory of collapse that hasn’t been seen since the end of the last ice age; it’s being taught in a hundred half-noticed corners of an increasingly dysfunctional global economy, as the externalized costs of technological progress <a href=../../2015/02/the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html>pile up unnoticed and drag economic activity to a halt</a>; and of course it’s being taught, as already noted, in the capitals of the industrial world, where the neoliberal orthodoxy of the last thirty years is reeling under the blows of a furious populist backlash. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It didn’t have to be learned that way. We could have learned it from Krampus or the old Santa Claus, the one who was entirely willing to leave a badly behaved child’s stocking empty on Christmas morning except for that single eloquent lump of coal; we could have learned it from the fairy tales that taught generations of children that consequences matter; we could have learned it from any number of other sources, given a little less single-minded a fixation on maximizing self-esteem right past the red line on the meter—but enough of us didn’t learn it that way, and so here we are. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d therefore like to encourage those of my readers who have young children in their lives to consider going out and picking up a good old-fashioned collection of fairy tales, by Charles Perrault or the Brothers Grimm, and use those in place of the latest mass-marketed consequence-free pap when it comes to storytelling time. The children will thank you for it, and so will everyone who has to deal with them in their adult lives. Come to think of it, those of my readers who don’t happen to have young children in their lives might consider doing the same thing for their own benefit, restocking their imaginations with cannibal giants and the other distinctly unmodern conveniences thereof, and benefiting accordingly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And if, dear reader, you are ever tempted to climb into the lap of the universe and demand that it fork over a long list of goodies, and you glance up expecting to see the jolly and long-suffering face of Santa Claus beaming down at you, don’t be too surprised if you end up staring in horror at the leering yellow eyes and lolling tongue of Krampus instead, as he ponders whether you’ve earned a thrashing with the birch switch or a ride in the wicker basket—or perhaps the great furry face of the Solstice bear, the beast of Alban Arthuan, as she blinks myopically at you for a moment before she either shoves you from her lap with one powerful paw, or tears your arm off and gnaws on it meditatively while you bleed to death on the cold, cold ground. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Because the universe doesn’t care what you think you deserve. It really doesn’t—and, by the way, the willingness of your fellow human beings to take your wants and needs into account will by and large be precisely measured by your willingness to do the same for them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
And on that utterly seasonal note, I wish all my fellow Druids a wonderful solstice; all my Christian friends and readers, a very merry Christmas; and all my readers, whatever their faith or lack thereof, a rekindling of light, hope, and sanity in a dark and troubled time.</div>

Black or white, they have huge toothy jaws and carry long saws and other threatening tools. Days before their arrival children are warned: boys must catch mice—as many as they can; girls must grind corn—as fine as they can. If not the ogres will take then away. The day comes and a gathering of Kachinas appear: Ogres and others, some with baskets on their backs. No matter how many mice the boys have caught, it is never enough. No matter how fine the corn meal, it is never fine enough. The ogres also seem to have a detailed knowledge of all the many misbehaviors each child has committed. Screaming in fear, the children are dragged toward the baskets. Then, at the last moment, a parent or family member interferes. "The children have really tried; their behavior has improved … Would the kachinas please accept a gift of mutton, fresh-baked bread, corn meal bread instead? The Kachinas reluctantly agree and load the baskets with the alternative offerings. <br>Later the adults will "trick" the ogres out of their prizes and the goods will come back.

Really your past three posts have all been knocking it out of the park even more so than usual!<br><br>Part of my pre-winter reading has been <i>The Krampus and The Old, Dark Christmas</i> by Al Ridenour, which is a great book with krampus folklore. Krampus is pretty popular with young people these days: there are Krampuses all over the internet, they make krampus sweaters, krampus Christmas ornaments, and a major Hollywood movie called <i>Krampus</i>. Similarly, there's been a trend with movies towards making "gritty reboots" of fairy tales (e.g. <i>Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters</i> or <i>Snow White and the Huntsman</i>). Those movies might actually be more "safe" and sanitized than the original stories and certainly most of them are terrible, but I think it reflects a certain cultural awareness. On an unconscious level, people are still aware that the old, dark stories have a weight and significance that can rise up through the years to have an impact.<br><br>I've been studying astrology in 2016 and I'm thinking about how today marks the entrance of the Sun into Capricorn and so the season of Saturn will be here until February. Saturn as a god of consequences would certainly approve of Krampus, the Yule Cat, or any of the other "dark" figures of Christmas.<br><br>Now to read the other blog's update!

Iran, where islam was added to the country (it doesn't owe its existence to islam as Pakistan, nor is it an Arabic-Islamic melange like Egypt) celebrates these turnings of the year - at this time of the year, Iranians prepare to celebrate Yalda, the longest night, which marks the birth of Mithra, God of Sun and Fidelity. A sleepless night of joy. An when spring equinox comes, there'll be Nowrouz ('new light' - new year, as spring arrives) with all its festivities. The Quran doesn't mention anything about these rites at all, but they are celebrated in a republic with islam as state religion (Ayatollah Khomeini didn't like it and it is rumored he wanted to abolish the tradition when he returned to Iran, but had to bow to pressure from mullahs who basically said the people would never bow to do without those traditions ).<br><br><br>Of course, Islam is a religion, not a culture nor a civilisation. People with different cultures &amp; civilizations could be Muslims (Turks, Indians, etc), just as Icelanders and Brazilians are Christians without sharing many customs. In the case of Iran the Iranians kept their culture and language, islam is part of national identity along with other ingredients and not all of it. Thus even older traditions are celebrated - and the fact they kept on to celebrate the turnings of the year says something about its importance and power.

My partner and I observed the solstice yesterday by doubling down on our usual evening habits of silliness and laughter. The family will get together to feast this Sunday, probably to be accompanied by a glass of white wine and the odd call of 'Merry Christmas'.<br><br>I've commented here before about the absurdity of holding to Northern traditions down here in Aotearoa, and won't revisit that except to say that behind the glitzy veneer of commercialism, the traditions are gradually evolving into more appropriate forms. The tree of the season is rapidly becoming not the felled spruce, but the twisted, hairy, stunningly beautiful pohutekawa tree in its full gorgeous red bloom. I imagine once the imported commercial detritus necessarily washes away, we'll find ourselves left with a tradition much more appropriate to the season.<br><br>Like so many abroad, I've been looking on recent events with a certain degree of interest. I'm the sort of person that, since a very early age, has loved to soak up ideas and information like a sponge. I take a certain degree of pride in my ability to sift through the noise, listen to a variety of viewpoints, think deeply and change my mind several times before coming to some degree of principled perspective on an issue. However, in the lead up to the election, I had only succeeded in confusing myself totally. Even with the benefit of hindsight, I still have no idea how I might have voted in your election. To go further, I'm unsure about what my wider course of action might be where I living under similar circumstances in the US. In the face of (true) chaos, I've come to appreciate the limits of my analytical and predictive abilities. Counter-intuitively, this has been extremely freeing. No longer do I waste my time as Maud'dib, attempting in my arrogance to thread the needle of unfolding events. Instead, I focus my attention on the world around me - the wind speaks, the ground is firm, the trees are of such wonderous and largely undiscovered beauty, and there are signs that the Pākehā, largely dormant since their translocation from Europe, are beginning to sprout new growth. There's a serenity there, and it's much more useful information in any case.<br><br>We're aided of course: by our isolation, by the language and culture of our indigenous people, by our productive land, and the excellent insulation of mid latitude ocean - but after long years of being quite depressed by the whole thing, I'm beginning to get the sense that after the rubble stops bouncing, someone coming down from your way might just find a relatively healthy and thriving people who've quietly shelved the Northern ways, and are steadily plotting their own. Maybe not. But who knows?<br><br>Tehei Mauri Ora!<br><br><a href=#c8086138710317376657 title="comment permalink">12/21/16, 3:02 PM</a><br><br>

With 500 ewes this was a considerable undertaking and took at least one person on duty around the clock. This fellow, I will call him Jim, was not at all thankful about forcing me at a young age to confront the reality of the natural world. It would horrify most modern folk to make a young kid cut a lamb from the womb of a doomed mother sheep , or bury the dead sheep that had expired the night before . I was not happy about such things, nor did I get used to them but it grounded me in the reality of the world.

Living here in Fairbanks Alaska we tend to celebrate the solstice with more gusto than most and some of us do 108 sun salutations at a local yoga studio, very happy to welcome the sun back for more than 4 hours a day.<br><br>The mention of a bear as a solstice symbol surprised me, since at least in my neck of the woods they are all hibernating this time of year. Maybe where this tradition arose had bears that were active throughout the winter? Or perhaps it extolls the virtues of hibernation? <br><br>I found your post this week so wonderful because I'm not quite sure what to do with what Christmas has become. We usually fly out of state to visit family, partly because tickets are often cheaper on Dec. 24, but partly because Christmas Eve services are overwhelmed with people you see once or perhaps twice each year. Considering that it's mostly become a consumer celebration, just giving it up, or having it turn into something radically different, like going back to its solstice roots, might not be such a bad thing.<br><br><a href=#c8808905344571233963 title="comment permalink">12/21/16, 4:00 PM</a><br><br>

Those Grimm's stories terrified me, and it wasn't witches or poisoned apples or talking wolves in gingham dresses - I knew those things didn't exist. It was the existence of a parent who would tell the other parent to take the children into the woods and leave them to die, and have that command carried out. I had no reason to believe those didn't exist, and not just in the hell that was medieval Europe either. Several news stories a week prove me right.<br><br>Where to start with the self-esteem? That woman on the plane had way too much self-esteem and no self-respect. Self-esteem says, "I am special just 'cause I'm ME! I can do no wrong, just 'cause I'm ME! I deserve what I want, just 'cause I'm ME!" Self-respect says, "I know the difference between right and wrong, and I love myself, my life, and those around me so much that I choose right."<br><br><br>It's hard to pick my favorite idea from among all those presented in this very re-readable post, but it might be: "the willingness of your fellow human beings to take your wants and needs into account will by and large be precisely measured by your willingness to do the same for them." I just got a visit from an entitled young man who thinks I should still give him gifts, money and a restaurant dinner like I did for years when he was a boy, even though he's 19 now and has chosen to hang with thugs, has brought trouble to my door, and does nothing to intervene when trouble inevitably demands money from me and retaliates when turned down. No adoration this time: this dumb saltine kept on doing my chores in my dirty housekeeping clothes though I did talk to him civilly, then drove him home without so much as a Value Meal. I'm still angry that I was taken by surprise by his visit and didn't tell him briefly and clearly why he is no longer allowed on my property either, just like his thug friends. I don't even care to try to set him straight. He already knows it all.<br><br>It's not just ThePoor. Why should a suburban "single mom" have to stress her selfish self out by setting boundaries and imposing punishments when she can just claim ADHD and drug the kid senseless? Who cares what happens to so many of them when they get to be about 20-22 years old and snap violently and irrevocably? He was cramping her "Me! Time" with her latest "fiancé".<br><br><br><a href=#c5817707309368448364 title="comment permalink">12/21/16, 4:38 PM</a><br><br>

Here in the southern hemisphere, these things look even more peculiar since its summer at this time of year. I guess Christmas will eventually be replaced here by something more seasonally appropriate, or even a change in our calendar. (having spring at the start of the year makes wayyy more sense than having the height of summer and autum at the start of the year). There are calls to make the Maori new year (Matariki) a Public holiday (roughly May June here). this link will explain Matariki.<br><br>http://www.mch.govt.nz/nz-identity-heritage/matariki<br><br>I guess for me since my family are still fairly recently migrated to this part of the world, Christmas still feels like an important gesture to our norther hemisphere ancestry. And Christmas still wouldn't be the same for some reason without trees (live trees, that fresh smell of pine needles!) and Santa. In my defense though I have Ancestry in Lapland, the home of Father Christmas!<br><br>As for your points about fairy tales, well I'd say you don't even look in fairy tales to know your actions have consequences. Plenty of Hollywood films (and TV shows) these days are constant rehashes of old fairy tale plots. We watch the film, we're like "oh yes its so terrible what happened, those people got what they deserved" and then forget and go back to our environment destroying, soul destroying jobs and ways of life. If you try and point this out, you'll just get a response of 'oh but fairy tales are silly stories for kids, that doesn't apply to me' or something like that.<br><br>Anyway Merry Christmas, or Happy solstice.

Thanks for sharing it with us.<br><br>The analogy of our consequences of our choices resulting in, in modern times, no discipline is exactly the same thing I see, and have felt. People are completely disconnected from reality. Unfortunately, while the desire to know our limits may be in born, it really doesn't take long for people build up their esteem and think they can and should get away with anything. Upon reaching adulthood, it often requires quite a few reality checks to get reconnected with reality. The coming decades will probably bare many tokens reality checks that have been given with less of the privileges we are afforded today. If I could make one solstice request of everyone, despite the fact that many will be ignored or even shouted down, I'd like to ask the brave to become messengers of reality in hopes that there are less tokens of privilege dotting the hills in the coming decades.<br><br><a href=#c1148860576449731539 title="comment permalink">12/21/16, 5:12 PM</a><br><br>

After reading your post we’ll go outside under clear skies and zillions of stars, light the fire and spend time being grateful for nudging this property and ourselves; to act in concert with Nature and the Universe – not against it. Our presents to one another run the altruistic line, and we stand our ground in our position; starve the Monster, it’s going down anyway, so again, we might as well work with the energies at hand. <br>I’ve had the experience (strangely enough)to find myself on a side road, next to an old cemetery in upstate NY, and have found the occasion to walk around in them while waiting for a timely appointment at some nearby organic farm, and they are filled with the graves of children.<br> Just before I started reading tonight’s post we got into a conversation about how Newt Gingrich asked the Donald ‘when was he intending to drain the swamp?’. The response was ‘that was just a silly slogan; we’re not doing that anymore’. Huh. I wondered out loud how some of his voters were going to take that news, and especially after four years of what will probably be the latest grifter to occupy the white house, which will end up looking like more hope and change. The fact of the matter is, there’s nowhere else to go, no enemy to vanquish, no dragons to slay – the only enemy has been and still is - our own Entropy - and god knows anyone who has tasted the fruits of full blown Entropic living and all its trappings won’t give that up if their lives depended upon it – oh wait. <br>Krampus already gave me my switching after 2008, around 2012 when I had to file bankruptcy, and then I woke up and haven’t stopped reading since. As a last ditch effort we’re reducing our Entropy in every way we can, kind of a present of sorts for a whole lot of sleeping children that probably don’t deserve it.<br>Reducing our Entropy does matter, it matters to me and matters to Will and every being on this property.

Like St. Nicolas’s second, the “Krampus” threatening or even beating the little ruffians. So ritual does mirror the habit of daily life. While the rough tradition reflects a past, where times were as rough too, contemporarily its softened quite to an extend. In life and in ritual. True so!<br><br>But I may bring to memory, that here justice is not the ruling party. Contradictory, in reality the dutiful and gentle do not inherit the earth! Instead there is an ever going battle ensured between the mild-mannered and the ruffians. So the “though guys” get their good share in that jealous struggle. I remember lots of stories of crying injustice due to the favouritism of the sassy ones in favour of the shy ones. Not to speak of what I myself, considering my as an adaptor, being neglected for queue-jumpers.<br><br>Connected here with are the pedagogic reformists. They tried to avoid such favouritism system, treating grownups equally positive in order to bring up the best in each one of them. A well meant intention.<br><br>Yet I cannot, but agree to the overall picture. We all enter into a level of the feast, where we are confronted with the consequences of our wasteful party. After the hangover we shall enter the purgatory of our afterlife. The hangover now is just the beginning of a worldwide frugal existence. We are already full speed in compulsory catabolic collapse and simplification of life. We are headed to a non-fossil future whether we’re ready or not.<br><br>Still there will be no justice, as people, classes and regions will be favourably privileged before others.<br><br>Things will be as they ever were.

The YA genre that gained a lot of steam when I was in its target group always felt like pandering and I always gravitated to more classic literature. I also come from a generation that people associate with getting trophies for participation. I never got one of those, but it seemed like they handed out a lot of medals for 6th place and beyond and yes kids see through that.<br><br>This year I'm giving a copy of D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths to my nephew for Christmas, not exactly Grimm, but not the sugary stuff either.

I was a bit worried it might be too gory for a 3 year old (Medea tricking Jason's father was rather gruesome), but he loved it. I will need to purchase Grimm soon.

I celebrate Christmas and Scrooge has always been my favorite Christmas character to face consequences. And I feel like him in thinking giving children a lot of toys when they're young gives them that much more insulation from the real world and consequences. Video games seem to be a form of putting a no consequence mentality into overdrive because these sorts of games continue well into adult hood. You've described our society's notion of progress as being linear; maybe the closer we think we're getting to the Star Trek style future the more we think consequences don't matter. This would be so because we think we're approaching the level of gods, pie in the sky, and nobody today bothers reading about Greek or Roman mythology. Consequences apply even to celestial beings. Christmas/the solstice has become the ultimate insulation - Would people still feel the magic of Christmas if there was a monster troll running around? If they did then it would mean that much more because it would be a magic feeling in the face of adversity. This could also be a reason why magic is discredited these days because with dangerously high levels of self esteem maybe delusion is to often mistaken for magic. Magic and delusion by definition are two separate words and should be two separate experiences. I don't know much about magic - I just know there are some personal experiences I've had that tell me it's out there.<br><br><a href=#c3287620968750580882 title="comment permalink">12/21/16, 6:39 PM</a><br><br>

I am in my last year, while she's going to keep going. She made a point about how it is a constant tinkering that does some of most potent damage to education. Thinking about your piece, I said that this tinkering was almost invariably driven (in practice) by trying to prevent students from having a consequence from not focusing on the material (ie studying). <br><br>So we invest in technology, aps, and new ways of teaching, including "latices" presuming students will never loan a times table, so here is a neato way around that (do I need to point out it doesn't work). The only coherent narrative in all of the changes is that students are not to have consequences. The real dream is learning as pure entertainment and student whim.<br><br>This "reform" has only accelerated in pace in my 9 years of teaching. It makes it so teachers are ill-trained (for the current party-line), the students expectations are confused, and parents don't know how to help their students with work. These last three factors then feed into each other . . . <br><br>Meanwhile, it has gotten to the point that you can't assign 10 vocabulary words a week and expect the average high school student to study them. I even do a lessons on the brain and on space repetition to show why studying works, and how there is really no substitute for looking back over the material at some point. It doesn't matter. I'm one of the only adults telling them this.<br><br>I know you're no fan of American schooling, and, now, neither am I, but what good I could accomplish is thwarted when parents are left feeling their only job is to shield their students from consequences.<br><br><a href=#c4606912326284209051 title="comment permalink">12/21/16, 7:12 PM</a><br><br>

One of the ones that I've pondered for most of the last two decades is the problem of literacy in young people. <i>Harry Potter and the ever-more-mysterious titles</i>, and some other recent Young Adult dystopias aside, most children today don't read easily or well. And over the course of my teaching career, it got worse.<br><br>I finally realized that children simply weren't reading any more. When I was a child (and I think that I'm somewhat younger than the Archdruid, but not by much), "Reading" was the single most important leisure activity in the US, with most adults and children racking up an average of 10-15 hours a week of reading time: around two hours a day. Television was second, at about an hour and a half to two hours; movies third, with most people watching only a matinee a week. Internet? Non-existent. Radio? The age of the radio drama had passed, and often it provided a background to other activities rather than being the main event.<br><br>Today... Reading is the seventh or eighth most common leisure activity, and rarely fills more than 45 minutes of a young person's week other than as school work. I admit that video does have its uses, as does audio — I listen to podcasts on long drives, and I learned how to knit and sew and a number of other crafts from watching videos on YouTube. But that's not what young people are viewing, for the most part; and reading is still the easiest way to acquire in-depth knowledge about some topics, as well as develop the critical capacities to distinguish fact from fiction from opinion. <br><br>To put that in perspective, most children are in school in the US for 1260 hours a year, or about 15,000 hours from grades 1-12. They'll spend 3 of those daily hours in subjects closely dependent on reading: English, history, science (maybe...), or about 6,400 hours total in learning reading-related skills . But 7-8 hours of reading a week used to add another 4,680-ish hours on top of that in-school training, and usually in subjects of interest to the student/child... And that's all gone.<br><br>What replaced it? First, more television channels. Then more cable channels as wires into our homes replaced antennas on the roofs. Then Internet, and the combination of social media, on-demand video, video chat, video games... screen time now eats 8-15 hours a week, and cuts into time that used to be about reading even in school. <br><br>We have literally been letting young people self-educate using training materials and methods that bear no resemblance to anything that's existed before... and they'e in the process of launching a completely different kind of society that's fossil fuel-dependent in very strange ways, and that by and large doesn't know how to use the old information technologies of reference books or the non-fiction section of the library, or encyclopedias without the word 'wiki' in their name.<br><br>I feel like I've done enough of this "I'm old and the young are weird" rant, so let me end with this — young people didn't do this. It's not millennials' fault that they're like this: they used the tools that were put in front of them by their parents and teachers. And we, the 30-somehtings and the 40- and 50-somethings did it because it looked like it would be profitable. It's our fault, not theirs.... and it's also probably too late to fix it.<br><br><a href=#c4189343995812665491 title="comment permalink">12/21/16, 8:14 PM</a><br><br>

You've made several points that I've been preaching myself for a few years now!<br><br>I see 2 massive personal and societal consequences of trying to make the world a padded playground for children. <br><br>For one thing, when you raise children this way, you make little monsters, inflicting your oafish progeny on a world that is already stressed beyond belief, what with all the sharing of resources and space we have to do. You made your point on this very well.<br><br>For another, you don't do your children any good. Parents who protect their little darlings from the darker truths of the world send their kids out into the cold, dark night that inevitably comes without knowledge of how to strike a match and light a candle. Everyone needs to fail a little, be scared a little, and learn to deal with disappointment a LOT in order to be fully functional human adults. (I worked in a staffing agency for several years, and parents were calling in for their 'kids' in their late 20s! Guess how successful they were as employees?)<br><br>I mean, as parents, if your agenda is to have a child who finds a good and happy life as an adult, the worst thing you could do is abuse them. The second worse thing you could do is spoil them.<br><br>By the way, I introduced Krampus to some children of friends of mine, and they fell in LOVE! The idea of a Big Bad to balance out the Glorious Good seemed to resonate instinctively for them, and they declared it was the best Christmas they ever had, much to the shocked delight of their parents, who were afraid it would be 'too much' for them. And, by the way, I've notice Krampus has been getting much more popular across the board in the last 5 years. I think we need our symbolic devils, because endless angels is endlessly boring!<br><br><a href=#c758191905649423526 title="comment permalink">12/21/16, 8:15 PM</a><br><br>

Tell Riley here that if he doesn't start behaving immediately, then Santa's going to change his mind and bring him coal for Christmas.<br><br>I said that Santa changed his policy and no longer traffics in coal. Instead, if you're bad, he comes to your house and steals things. I told Riley that if he didn't behave himself, Santa was going to take away his TV and all his electrical appliances and leave him in the dark."<br><br>I also enjoy the story of the Dutch version of Santa Claus in "Six to Eight Black Men"<br><br>I was told growing up that Christmas is celebrated on the 25th that 2000 years ago the winter solstice was four days earlier. Something about the dates of the calendar shifting back 1 day every five hundred years. Presumably that means that in the year 2500 of this calendar the solstice will more often coincide with the 20th of December. Again vaugely remembered story that we have Christmas basically because the church couldn't get people to expunge their local festivals of mid-winter. So the church pasted the birth on to the competing holiday and made it part of the liturgical year. Basically the same way that some of the gods/goddesses were turned into saints in the Catholic Church so that there generation could be moved under the authority of the church. One of the St. Bridget's and the Virgin of Guadalupe come to mind.

I recommend reading this edition--even though it only came out a couple years ago, this collection is the first translation of the original 1812-1815 edition into English. There is more of a sense of oral tradition in the language of these tales than the later editions with more embellished tales.

First of all, A very happy and blessed Solstice toy you and yours, and a Happy Christmas, Happy Chanukah, Kwanzaa or whatever is celebrated to all of my fellow commenters;<br><br>I am now teaching preschool, (3 and 4-year-olds). I have just finished my mandatory state certification classes, one of which was entitled, "Positive Guidance and Discipline" - basically how NOT to ever discipline, punish or even raise one's voice to the children for bad behaviour, but instead 'redirect, distract' with treats and special treatment. (I'm not making this up!) Again - a false sense of esteem being the #1 consideration.<br>Now, I'm not a seasoned pre-school teacher, but I'm very invested emotionally &amp; professionally so I'm really open to any advice and helpful hints on how to deal with my little darlings, and I do indeed have some kids with troubled family lives and discipline problems. This certification course was however, as you can imagine, to say the least - less than helpful, utter hogwash. Your essay this week, OTOH, is actually very helpful and thought provoking. <br><br>A few years ago, I read a popular book called "Battle Hymn Of A Tiger Mother". It was hyped as author Amy Chua bragging about how superior traditional Chinese parenting was to American, (or Western) parenting; which got a lot of negative attention and resulting mad-sales from outraged Western mothers who couldn't wait to read it and be outraged. It was of great interest to me and fellow Western moms raising our kids in China, at the time it came out as we were actually raising our kids with a foot in both worlds. Well, the hype was not really that founded, Chua turned out not be such a snobbish self-congratulating horror. I really liked the book. One thing she wrote really struck me and is relevant here. <br><br>(Paraphrasing, I don't have the book with me), 'Real self-esteem comes from having actual skills and knowledge and accomplishments. This has to be achieved by the child themselves through hard work, failure and overcoming failure. A child cannot have real self-esteem by being given a trophy they know they don't deserve, trust me - they know it! They get it from seeing their hard work pay off, from overcoming obstacles. A parent would only give undeserved trophies and bolster self-esteem to a child they themselves had no real faith in. This also undermines the true self-confidence of the child/young adult - which explains why so many cannot cope in college or in their first years of young adulthood.

You're quite correct that given sufficiently toxic levels of self-esteem, delusion gets mistaken for magic; a glance back at the 2012 apocalyptic frenzy will give you some first rate examples there. Magic is hard work, and it requires self-discipline and self-mastery; where you don't see those three things, you're not seeing magic, you're seeing wishful thinking in the service of an overblown sense of entitlement. <br><br>Samurai, glad to hear it.

Yes, I could see that.<br><br>M Smith, okay, we've definitely got a Krampus Carol songfest under way. Good! Anyone else care to contribute? <br><br>Keith, I get that. My father and stepmother are retired schoolteachers, and have similar things to say. <br><br>Justin, nah, it's quite true, but there's also a mental equivalent of it, as you've pointed out. I don't know that I'd call the latter "satanic," though; "masturbatory" seems a bit more like it from my perspective, not least because it tends to result in a cold sticky mess...<br><br>Andrew, all we can do is try to pass on a love for reading to our own children, if we have any; encourage others to do the same, and to bail out on the mass media; and support alternatives to the current public school system. Come to think of it, that's a pretty good list of action points. <br><br>Lucretia, you're welcome you're welcome you're welcome. ;-) Delighted to hear that you're spreading the Bad News, so to speak, about Krampus! The old goat needs more missionaries. <br><br>Candace, nah, the solstice was corrected back to the 21st when the Gregorian calendar replaced the Julian one, which did the slippage; the 25th of December is the first day you can actually see a slight shift northward in where the sun rises, which is why it was a common date for the celebration in the Mediterranean world. That said, you're right about the rest of it, of course. <br><br>Ien, given the history between Spain and the Netherlands, that must have been quite the threat back in the day!

Until you learn that, you are still a child no matter how old you are. It is surprising how many adults and even leaders, especially leaders, have not learnt this lesson. Examples? You finance, arm, train and transport jihadists to attack another country and are surprised when these same jihadists turn and attack your own people. You ignore, denigrate, mock and make clear your contempt for a large section of the people that you are running for office for and wonder what the hell happened when they do not vote for you. Need I go on?<br> Still, it is Christmas and whatever the origins of its customs or however that it could be made better, I will say this. I am in favour of any holiday in which we can listen to the better side of our angels. A season where it is socially acceptable to be nicer to each other and be more of the people that we hoped to grow up to be.<br> Just as a final passing mention, may I recommend a modified film clip called the "Dance of the Druids" from the series "Outlander" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsZbe8hESzU as something to watch? Is it made up? Absolutely. Is there any historical evidence for any such ceremony from the ancient Druids? Who knows - there is no such surviving evidence.

I admit I will have difficulty keeping this short, but I'll do my best. In my family, we were never threatened with coal. Santa's gift for naughty children was a stocking full of reindeer poop. When my little brother was 3, he had a pretty naughty year, and he got reindeer poop as his one gift on Christmas Eve (though he got normal gifts Christmas day, like everyone else). All us kids were shocked!! As far as I know, he was the only one to ever get it. (I'm still a little irked by this, haha, protective big sister and all... It must be some kind of sibling protective instinct for it to still bug me after 30 years). Well he grew up to be an inspiring young man and I am very proud of all he accomplished in his life. <br><br>If I ever have children, I will never raise them to believe in Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, or any other fake holiday or childhood being. It's not because of the commercialism (which I also hate), it's the way they are used, in our culture, to ridicule children into disbelieving in magick, in that awkward transition from childhood to adolescence. I think that teaching a child to believe something is real solely based on their gullible innocence is wrong, and it kills the part of the child that would grow up to be a powerful mythmaker and magician. If you talk to kids who just learned Santa isn't real, they feel hurt, humiliated, and lied-to. I think as a society this has led to our ridiculous worship of rationalism and technology to the detriment of our spiritual sides, mainstream religions included ("Santa's not real. But it's OK, Jesus is still real."). <br><br>On Christians and fear of Hell: my Dad's Christian but not devout. He's not afraid of going to Hell, but he shouldn't, he had a near death experience and went to heaven. He says it rained peace, all the time, peace just raining down from the sky. He IS afraid of his children going to Hell, and it doesn't help that I'm Pagan and my brother and I used to listen to a lot of heavy metal (which uses Satanic imagery all over the place). Most of the time Dad's OK with everything, but every now and then I can see that deep-seated fear, and I wish he didn't have it, because there's no reason for it. It's also weird because he's a 100% counterculture hippie, so you wouldn't expect it, you would expect him to have a better understanding of the more modern countercultures and a broader religious viewpoint (which he kind of does, because he likes a lot of Eastern religion... anyway I'm rambling). <br><br>My Yule gift to the community in general, though I warn you it's a slightly darker aesthetic... a comic about the Pagan history of Santa Claus. It's one of my favorites. While not all of it is entirely historically accurate, I still find the argument compelling. <br><br>http://infolocata.com/mirovia/irrefutable-proof-that-santa-is-odin/<br><br>Sincerely<br><br>Jessi Thompson<br>anotheramethyst<br><br><br><br><a href=#c8017158104881928612 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 12:05 AM</a><br><br>

Also, it only takes one helicopter parent to turn your whole school into one of those places, where you can't actually punish a child for fear of a lawsuit. This leads to an entire generation of children being raised by strangers who can't punish them for the bulk of their waking lives. I believe that particularly the elites, who are spared the School of Hard Knocks, grow to live in a bubble world where bad things can't happen and there are no surprises. As a waitress I see it all the time. Some people just can't fathom that a restaurant might not carry the particular ingredient they want, and they fly off the handle, and I walk away wondering how they made it this far in life without ever encountering a real problem, so that not having provolone cheese on their sandwich is a crisis. When I see for example, the president, start a war he can't possibly win, and a pundit describe the actions of another country as if all they ever did was either to help or spite us Americans, I see those people, spoiled as children, incapable of understanding another person's point of view, completely unaware that bad things can happen, or that their actions will have negative consequences (which are obvious to those of us that are used to seeing the consequences of our own actions, and often quickly). I think the problem is middle and lower class kids are getting that shoddy elite style of "education" without the actual study of challenging and empowering subjects to go with it (as the elites do have access to a lot better bookish learning than the rest of us).

In early December they parade through the streets of some towns and hit people (hard!) with their sticks, especially those that come close to them. At the end, St. Nicholas comes and they bow to him, simbolising I guess the victory of Christianity over paganism. I never liked that bit, but I can confirm that this tradition is still alive and quite a powerful thing to watch, with haunting music, fog, cow bells, big beasts and snow. They are actually scary - the hit you, trap you, frighten you every way they can.<br>As for the coal, we have another tradition here, the Befana (from Epiphany, now associated with the Magi, overlapping with many Celtic and old traditions of fire, symbolic burning of old women, female symbolism, etc, that it would be to long to get into now). She is a witchy-looking old woman who supposedly gives coals to naughty children, though the coals tend to be made of sugar now, sort of missing the point.<br><br><a href=#c2753538626467098283 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 1:04 AM</a><br><br>

They not only use the left turn lanes, but downtown they will often ride in the middle of the lane, especially on the downhill slope on which they can more or less match the speed of motorized traffic. Sometimes they leisurely pedal in the middle of 2 lane avenues and compel traffic to pass in the opposing lane or crawl at bicycle speed. A couple I’ve honked at, and you would not believe the enraged glances turned my way. One fellow even dismounted his bike, stared at me, arms akimbo, and challenged me get out my my car and confront him. I’ve seen similar behavior in some pedestrians who step out in front of traffic without so much as a glance to the left or right, evidently certain that no harm may befall them.<br><br> A recent experience really got me thinking about this phenomenon. I was driving home in the dark, and was in enough of a hurry that I did not want to be delayed by downtown rush-hour traffic. So I detoured through a semi-rural zone. I approached a stop sign at an unlit intersection, made a full stop and confirmed there was zero traffic in all directions as far as the eye could see. So I proceeded, but a torrent angry obscenities from my right prompted me to slam my brakes. It turned out a fellow in dark clothing stepped into the crosswalk just as I stopped, and expected me to see him and yield right of way. Indeed he explicitly told me (when he wasn’t swearing) that “PEDESTRIANS HAVE THE RIGHT OF WAY IN A CROSSWALK YOU DUMB###T.” No kidding. I considered shouting out my window that I did not see him in the dark, but thought the better of it and drove on.<br><br> I think I know what is going on: These cyclists and pedestrians now regard safety as a human right, as in people other than yourself are primarily responsible for providing it. This is new. Indeed the very idea of “right of way” is exactly that: You, the driver, are in fact accountable for the safety of, say, a pedestrian in a sidewalk. But the new mindset extrapolates this concept to the moon; so all those cyclists who blend themselves with motorized traffic have the mindset that they have a “right” to use the roads just as car drivers do, can cite the law chapter and verse in support of their position, and they accordingly claim their rights. But this way of thinking does not come to terms with what it really means to be safe: To be safe means you have minimal exposure to risk, and the first rule of risk mitigation is not to subject yourself to avoidable risk. So in the dark, you let the lone car to pass before crossing the street. A cyclist does not plant him/herself in the midst of motorized traffic. You wear a helmet. But no, since safety is a right, then it is incumbent upon motorists to be vigilant for pedestrians and cyclists who no longer shoulder primary responsibility for their own risk reduction. I don’t consider these people merely “jerks”; they are fools. I regularly remind my daughters, 6 and 13, that a wrong idea, even if “everybody does it ” can still turn them into roadkill. (Indeed one of these very fools tried to exercise his road rights on the highway here. He suffered multiple orthopedic injuries that ended his cycling days for good. I made sure my daughters heard about this guy.)<br><br> This is a small issue I know, and over the course of the de-industrial future will become moot. Safety as human right does not generalize across other domains either, and I don’t think it is compatible with survival in a world less and less subject to orderly, let alone civilized, function. Yet I still find this mind-set disturbing in other ways that I can’t quite put my finger on.<br><br><a href=#c3516976771483320076 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 1:06 AM</a><br><br>

Cold will kill you faster than hunger, so a lump of coal is not a total slap in the face, to be thrown away in disgust, but a little nugget of hope if you can learn how to behave.

And may the dawn light and days shine slightly brighter in your part of the world, what with the traditional winter you are having this year.<br><br>I must say that this was an excellent essay. I particularly liked the way you wove tradition and history into a story dotted with all sorts of useful bits of knowledge and ended with the certainty of the future and what an image to leave us all with!<br><br>I was always rather curious as to the symbolism of the lump of coal? It must have been a recent innovation to the story?<br><br>People treat their children like pets which I find to be a rather strange thing. Poopy the Pomeranian who is one of the farm dogs here works harder on this farm than most kids do in the household economy. Other people in our societies are also treated like pets in that they are provided with an existence and shelter and yet are not allowed and/or discouraged from finding a place in that society. The interesting thing though is that we are starting to see a backlash from those people down here... <br><br>The other thing I don't get is why parents often have expectations that their children exceed their own accomplishments - that is just strange to see and it is breeding prolonged anxiety and stress in kids and I doubt they will recover from that. There is a reason why it used to be said that the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree but people forget that.<br><br>It is funny that you mention boundaries, but I once worked with a young lady who told me in confidence that she just wanted to be told: "No". Her boundaries were clearly too large for her. <br><br>I used to manage staff for about two decades before I'd had enough, and I used to do a funny trick with them to slowly introduce the concept of boundaries to them. Some of them had no idea about that concept - and you will note that I avoid managing staff nowadays for good reason. I used to wait until someone started humming, singing or whistling - and it always happened sooner rather than later. And I would glare at the person menacingly and tell them loudly to stop it now! And thus make an example of that person. There'd be a bit of quiet giggling and then they'd slowly fall into line. It worked every time. I take my hat off to teachers as they do it tougher again.<br><br>The lady on the (or off as the case ended up) aircraft went through an initiation of sorts, don't you think so? I'm glad to read that she is up on charges too. Queue jumping is a bad sign. A really bad sign.<br><br>Oh don't forget the East Antarctic ice sheet. Apparently a scientific report was released recently that this floating ice sheet - which is holding back the much larger glacier on the land mass, is succumbing to warmer waters. Apparently this ocean mechanism was unknown until this report. The funny thing about the report was that the numpty's who wrote it appeared not to have understood the irony that they were able to approach the glacier closer than ever before - and that their actions contributed to the warmer waters. I didn't finish reading the report, but I'm using my fluffy mind powers here and can predict that they asked for further funds to study this most important matter as if that will make a difference. Just sayin...<br><br>And I heard on the radio today that a music festival which is held at an idyllic location had a lifesaver ring in to the radio station and said that people should be careful because the beach had been half washed away recently. I'd like to say I'm making that stuff up, but not so.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c7490151339230357853 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 3:06 AM</a><br><br>

Its funny that people can possible think that's not normal, since its not like most kids hide this. And its not like more adult themes can't be hidden, thinking of a viking tale where the hero &amp; heroine speak in the sacred grove your not allowed to speak in for 3 days while the rest of the tale deals with a lot of explicit violence, oaths and revenge. <br><br>And it's not like there's any proof that violence in storytelling (modern days video games, used to be D&amp;D) makes kids any more violent than they already would be.<br>http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2016/11/children-and-war-toys-and-viol.html<br><br>Heck, if done well could even lower their propensity for violence by making them realize the consequences and it changing from an exotic thing that looks cool and unique (like how drugs look cool when banned to teenagers) into just a regular thing with risks, rewards and consequences. <br><br>Also; got this book from my library, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Comstock:_A_Story_of_22nd-Century_America.

I don’t believe that a person can have too much self-esteem and the efforts to give children self-esteem these days are actually resulting in children who feel entitled but have low self-esteem.<br>The best definition of self-esteem that I’ve come across is that self-esteem has two components, a sense of competence and a sense of self-worth. So a person’s self-esteem will vary depending on the situation they are in. Someone like myself will have a higher self-esteem when in a math class (since my sense of competence is high) than in an English class (lower level of competence).<br><br>A person develops healthy self-esteem through dealing with success and failure. These days society seems desperate to prevent children from experiencing failure without realizing that they are also preventing the children from experiencing success. You can’t have success at anything without taking the risk that you might fail. So kids these days pile up unearned trophies that inside they known they didn’t earn and don’t learn that success is earned or that they can fail and bounce back, they simply learn that they should get stuff. I think that is low self-esteem.<br><br>A person with healthy self-esteem deals with life’s ups and downs without feeling the world revolves around them. They are resilient, where-as people who try to make up for a lack of self-esteem through feeling entitled tend to fall apart when presented with any kind of challenge or are denied anything.<br><br>Hope that adds to the conversation.<br><br>Thanks and happy solstice!<br><br>Bob<br>http://www.InvestingWithNature.com<br> <br><br><br><a href=#c8995531295938202890 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 6:20 AM</a><br><br>

We have become overwhelmingly fearful of litigation and calls of child abuse that could close us down.

Some of the books I recommend might also be welcome gifts for the young parents in your life, even if you don't have children.<br><br>Author Kim John Payne has written two books, "Simplicity Parenting" and "The Soul of Discipline." He is also a family therapist who specifically tries to correct the worst of our cultural excesses and the children who behave worst from them. His primary recommendation in the first book is to remove half of your children's toys - then remove another half from what remains. Also zero media and a way slower schedule. Many childhood pathologies are directly related to massive overstimulation. In his second book he teaches a method for being quite firm and having lots of clear limits and boundaries without being violent or reactive.<br><br>My other big recommendation is Waldorf education. The entire first grade curriculum is fairy tales, and Waldorf philosophy strictly opposes modern media interpretations - it's all the originals all the time. There are some really amazing resources for Waldorf homeschooling too - that is what I am doing with my son. Even those with children in public schools can add in the kinds of stories that nourish a child's soul though. There's a nice age-based list of stories to introduce in early childhood here: http://www.waldorflibrary.org/articles/977-choosing-fairy-tales-for-different-ages. The Waldorf Library site in general has a great deal of good information as well as lots of out-of-copyright books.<br><br><a href=#c5183507978571005664 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 6:56 AM</a><br><br>

I grew up in a household that exemplified many of the things that you discuss. my sister and I got presents every year regardless of how bad we were, our parents rarely disciplined us regardless of how bad we were, my parents would give and give without good energy exchanges, we watched those films about care bears, etc. I, of course, rebelled from a very early age and lived in a semi-feral state in the woods, eating berries, dandelions and acorns and smoking moss in computer paper joints on the sly. I killed frogs and brought home their legs to grill and shared double boiled milkweed pods with the extended family. I didn't brush my teeth, my hair was long and matted, and I'm sure I smelled bad. the flipside of my parent's attitude was their acceptance of my wild behavior, of which I am now extremely grateful. of course I was a loner for many, many years and had next to no friends between the ages of 7-14. Sometimes that's how things go. <br><br>Between ages of 15-20 I began gathering and chopping all my family's winter firewood. It seemed totally uncool to me that we didn't have a good energy exchange. Like everyone else I didn't want things so much as meaning and participation.<br><br>Now that I'm an adult I've mellowed out and the same things I did as a kid now can even make me money ie leading plant walks. Foraged wild food and roadkill round out my diet so i don't feel my youth was misspent, although it was very unhappy. I see now that my parent's had somewhat poor boundaries with me. This in turn has led me to unconsciously have poor boundaries with others and habitually be in relationships with poor energy exchanges (I give and the other takes) I tend to even cultivate this one sided type of relationship, viewing it as normal and natural. I guess I imitate what my parent's did rather than what they said. it is somewhat of a struggle for me to create healthy relationships. of course my parents did the best they could and the work of personal development in my adulthood is mine.<br><br><br><a href=#c7756876481861266883 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 7:23 AM</a><br><br>

I find following this line of thinking to be somewhat unpleasant. At the root of "consequences happen" is the reality that we exist as a consequence of a long process of evolution. A piece of the agenda of any "civilization" is to tame some of the nasty pieces of the evolutionary struggle. Sometimes it is in restraining warfare. Sometimes it is in providing an economic safety net. Sometimes it is in caring for those who ordinary evolutionary processes would leave to die. One way of reframing "consequences happen" is that you can't take this to its logical conclusion and remove competition and losers from social reality. The attempt in our current era to isolate children from threats to their self-esteem is just one branch of a massive attempt to create harmony without economic and evolutionary competition that create losers. Like you, I suspect these attempts will fail, but it will be complicated to develop post-'no consequences' society. Other processes will take over for us if social systems don't apply consequences. But there are a cacophony of differing ideas about how consequences should be assigned. And without some degree of consensus, we will proceed along the historical routes toward warfare and starvation. Assigning losers is an unpleasant business, but it happens either by social or natural means.<br><br><a href=#c6450690737700513300 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 7:28 AM</a><br><br>

Other Druid solstice symbols that tend to feature in decorations of cards: holly and mistletoe, wrens, the Holly King (or more specific incarnations of the archetype), and the Mabon. And though it’s thankfully not hallmarked out, there are plenty of Druids who make and sell solstice cards with these sorts of images on them. Meanwhile there are also plenty of Druids out there who also celebrate a good old fashioned Yule in the Northern tradition alongside and mixed in with their Alban Arthan festivities, which brings in much of what Bill described in his comment above. However, I’d always thought of the bear imagery of Alban Arthan as having more in common with the star of Bethlehem in more traditional Christian Midwinter traditions, as the guiding light of the pole star in the dark of the year, than as a Druidic Krampus, which is a role much better occupied by the Wild Hunt that features heavily into the Winter lore of most Indo-European traditions (though Krampus himself has been fairly enthusiastically embraced by a lot of the Druids I know.) That was a lovely essay, though. Maybe stories for children that don’t coddle them, or spare the gory details about the harshness of life, the reality of limits, and the roughness of the sort of world that they will likely be growing up in would make a good writing contest someday ;-) .<br><br><a href=#c4502094187671497276 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 8:05 AM</a><br><br>

The one I was thinking of is, the now ubiquitous world of insurance. Such things as fire, car, life and house insurance ( I will leave out sick care insurance from this as it is not really insurance) have been hearalded as unblemished goods. But in reality they have dulled peoples realization of consequences, poor planning and uninformed choices. In addition they have helped lead to the over financialization of the economy and advanted the big over the small. When one does not have fire insurance, it forces you to band together with your neighbors to create rebuilding pools and such. The nuances of things like professional liability insurance, gap insurance and other special kinds are even more damaging and allow stupid rackets to continue that would have been taken down years ago.<br><br><a href=#c6450335772549323139 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 8:37 AM</a><br><br>

There are tradeoffs though and sometimes what might be good for the individual (dominance and selfish behavior) might not be good for the group, and therefore indirectly for the individual. There is a whole theory emerging now of selection happening at higher levels than the individual, both in biology and sociology. It is called Multi level Selection (MLS) theory, or sometimes just group selection. It is controversial still in the inner circles of evolutionary biology. It explains how groups are able to modulate selfish or dominant behavior of individuals through such mechanisms as gossip, punishment (either by the group or transcendent entities, e.g. God), rewards for altruism and fables/mythology. Groups who do this can sometimes outcompete groups that don't do it as effectively. I also think that groups/individuals who evolve better foresight can gain a selective advantage over groups/individuals who are not as skilled at it. Both these mechanisms can be thought of as bigger picture thinking and doing. Perhaps if they are strong enough, they can help avoid the historical cycles that you have been focusing on, or at least prepare for them better.<br><br><a href=#c6067630881030513027 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 8:43 AM</a><br><br>

Think about the child who tells one lie to cover up misbehavior, then another to cover for the lie, and keeps lying till a small mistake becomes a huge one.

The consequence for an adult is far worse than for a child in most cases. However, we live in a culture that encourages us to behave like the lying child by allowing us not to deal with the immediate consequences. We’re given countless ways to run away from reality, which we use to pile one misguided act on another. Well none of that actually means that the consequences go away, they just get kicked down the road. Deep down everyone knows that, so they have to keep kicking in the desperate hope that someone will save them like when they were kids. <br><br>Eventually society won’t have the energy to help people kick the can, and that’s when things will get ugly.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Varun<br><br><a href=#c5786172998454671166 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 8:43 AM</a><br><br>

And also an example of ignorance being an active state. I'm not talking about those much maligned people in Red-State America. For all the accusations of "ignorance" thrown at those people in so-called flyover country, the ones who seem to be most actively practicing deliberate cluelessness are the same people making the charge, those being inhabitants of sea-coast, big-city bubble-lands. <br><br>I say this because I've read a a swathe of articles in coastal publications that purport to be progressive and who constantly tell us that they live on a much higher moral and intellectual plane. Maybe TOO high to see clearly what's happening on the ground not so far away. <br><br>But it's rather more likely that the explanation is simpler. Now, I don't want to put words in your mouth JMG, but I think you'd say they're being jerks. <br><br>They ask, why did Hillary lose the election? And their answers seem to be centered on the inadequacies of people that voted for Trump. They natter on and on that such voters are guilty of the many "isms" and "phobias" in the progressive handbook of societal pathologies: racism, sexism, Islamophobia, xenophobia, homophobia etc. That is, they most ludicrously elevate simple intolerance or distaste into full blown psychiatric conditions - phobias. So not only are these Trump voters bigots, they're nuts.<br><br>But more particularly, ignorance being an active state, the glitterati selectively (and jerkishly) disregard their own role in the economic demolition of wide areas of the country and the removal of the bread-and-butter mainstays of tens of millions. In this account, the flyover slobs have no gripe. They may FEEL ignored or left behind or culturally threatened, but these are mere feelings with no basis in reality. No, they have nothing to complain about but, to the extent that they do have problems, they are of their own making. <br><br>And besides (consistency being the hobgoblin of little minds) they insist that everyone knows that what ails the rust-belt, globalization, is really a natural tectonic force, overwhelming and irresistible. Adapt, make your peace with it, or die. <br> <br>Globalization or no, according to the luminaries, things aren't so bad, not even for those racist hicks.

Many contained endings that included the monster/evil person carrying off the little girl, often times after killing her family. I loved a tale called The Hobyahs ("Hobyah, Hobyah, Hobyah! Tear down the hempstalks, eat up the old man and woman, and carry off the little girl!) I found The Goose Girl particularly disturbing, as the villainous woman at the end met her just deserts by being dragged through the streets naked in a barrel with nails pounded into it. Many of the stories certainly had a moral to them. Perhaps this fed my early love of horror stories and movies? My brother read Bram Stoker's Dracula to me when I was no more than 6, and I have memories of sitting on the bed in the front bedroom, listing to him. I still have vivid images of the Count crawling up the castle wall, Renfield gobbling up flies in his cell, and the Bloofer Lady trolling for children. At 10 I wanted to stay up late on Saturdays to watch the Double Creature Feature (my mom only allowed me one movie at that age). I still love a well written horror story (Thank Cthulu for Lovecraft!).<br><br>Off topic, John, but in line with some of your previous entries: You've discussed how as nations collapse people realign, sometimes into armed groups.

This year I am back in Australia again. The contrast is staggering. Ethiopia is arguably the world’s most sustainable civilization. Dinknesh (Lucy) was found there, the world’s oldest humanoid skeleton dated over three million years of age. <br><br>Children are polite in Ethiopia. Teenagers will rise when an adult enters the room. Disciplined work is a given in whatever you do. There is no materialistic gift tradition for Christmas either. Families get together for a sumptuous meal for Christmas. They give thanks for what they have. <br><br>Ethiopia has a significant rural population that live without electricity or running water. So charities and NGO’s from the world over try to bring them the modern way. They see it as their first order of business to acquire the most wasteful SUV that they can find, to move their do-gooding behinds around. They are spending monies that they have collected from little old ladies back home on 5 star hotels and the left overs on bringing rural Ethiopians the trappings of modern life. <br><br>The tragedy is that some people get the impression that those material things grow on trees. That they come without price. Oxen pulling a plough is age old sustainable technology, a tractor requiring oil and spare parts from China is not. At the moment, most Ethiopian food is still farmed the old way. <br><br>I suspect that the world’s most sustainable civilization will have a better chance of dealing with resource depletion than any other. To this day, donkeys deliver cement to building sites in Ethiopia in parallel with trucks. The donkey herd operator can turn a profit by saving massively on capital cost and by not being dependent on foreign oil. <br><br>I once sat in a café overhearing a demanding late teenage American Ethiopian in Addis Ababa complain to her mother back home on her latest iPhone that her Ethiopian host mother was expecting her to do household chores and that she observes a curfew. In addition and perhaps her biggest complaint was that the internet is intermittent in Ehtiopia. The hysteria in her voice was comical. What will she do when one day back home in the US of A she will have to settle for less all around?

Were I in a similar situation, my inclination would be to feed them to the aliens or dinosaurs, early on, and get about the business of survival, unencumbered. <br><br>Growing up in the 50s, we were often threatened with "coal and switches" but in my Finn/German family, it didn't come with any cultural background. It was Santa who'd deliver such things to bad little boys and girls. There was a popular Christmas song at that time, played ad nauseam. "Santa Clause is Coming to Town." Santa was this all knowing, all seeing, omnipotent person who kept track of naughty and nice. Kind of a walking, talking "permanent record."<br><br><a href=#c1595762500258893612 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 12:27 PM</a><br><br>

Over a decade ago, my sisters, a few friends, and I would celebrate Buy Nothing Day by promoting the product NOTHING-TM. We'd dress up like real salespersons (and one of us as Santa) complete with T-shirts that read "NOTHING - What you've been looking for!," Santa Hats, big bags that said "FREE SAMPLES (and NOTHING in smaller print), and wear lanyards with fake salespersons' names like "Frida Laff" and "Joy Full." We would enter the largest shopping mall in Delaware to promote our wonderful product. We fit in quite well (at first) because there were lots of other salespeople giving out free samples of their products. We didn't approach anyone, but waited for customers to come to us as we wandered around. When customers saw we offered FREE SAMPLES, they'd come up and ask for whatever we had. We would ask them to hold out their hand, then we'd take out a clear container (labeled NOTHING) from our bag, and pour NOTHING into their hand, while enthusiastically telling them, "It's a revolutionary new product, guaranteed not to put you in debt, zero waste, family friendly, fun and creative, satisfaction guaranteed..etc. !"<br><br>Every customer we interacted with laughed and thought it was funny (we weren't being antagonistic towards anyone; it was all done in a lighthearted, friendly, and goofy manner). I specifically remember one man was elated upon receiving NOTHING, telling me that he kept telling his wife that was what he wanted for Christmas but she wouldn't take that for an answer and he had been dragged by her to the mall to choose a gift for himself. He then went and got his wife to come up to us to prove his point that he really wanted NOTHING for Christmas!<br><br>However, despite the positive reaction from customers, mall management was not so happy. Within 15 minutes, the mall manager had stopped us in the hallway, and various police officers gathered around. We were told that we had to leave the mall immediately, that we were soliciting (what were we soliciting - NOTHING?), that our T-shirts were offensive (is NOTHING really that offensive?), etc. We kept asking for more detailed information on what mall policy we were really violating, but they refused to give us answers. Mall management had no sense of humor whatsoever. Then because we weren't quick enough about leaving the mall, police officers put us all in handcuffs and arrested us (our improvisational act was pretty innocuous and getting arrested really wasn't in our plans). We had mug shots taken of us, were fingerprinted, and were banned from mall property for three years. The next day, the main headline in the state's local paper was "Sisters arrested for 'nothing'"<br><br><a href=#c1387633296003537044 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 2:09 PM</a><br><br>

We had to go to an all-day trial for our charges (what a waste of taxpayer money). At one point "evidence from the crime scene" was brought out (yes, in complete seriousness). Item #1: T-shirts that said "NOTHING What you've been looking for" Item #2: Santa hats Item #3: Security Camera photo of the group of us walking goofily down the mall hallway. During the entire trial, the mall manager never smiled or laughed. I thought the greatest crime was for someone to have no sense of humor whatsoever.<br><br>And yes, we ended up being convicted (of trespassing). The next day the headline in the newspaper was "Guilty of Nothing." I think the journalists covering our story had fun playing around with the word "nothing". The last time I applied for a job I had to have a criminal background check, and was worried I might get questions about what showed up on it. I was prepared to tell my potential employer that yes, I had been arrested but not to worry -- it was about nothing -- quite literally!<br><br>I guess in this age, a group of people armed with NOTHING entering a shopping mall is very threatening!<br><br>Check out this slideshow of our activities, set to the tune of Frank Sinatra's "I Got Plenty O' Nothing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-9066gvniE<br><br>Wishing everyone plenty o' nothing this season!<br><br><a href=#c3074224889820318931 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 2:09 PM</a><br><br>

Unfortunately we live in a society where you need to remind your readers that disability is not a lifestyle choice. I can see from some of the comments here that some of your readers are interpreting what you wrote the wrong way.<br><br>I had some of those "disorders" the commenters think are fictitious. I'm autistic. I also have severe depression and anxiety. And yes, I was punished. Most of my childhood memories involve being punished for one thing or another, half of which I don't think I even understood. The other children were not just allowed but sometimes encouraged to torment me for being different. Being punished for crying and self-harming did not cure my depression. Being shouted at did not cure my anxiety. Being told I was worthless and that my stalker was threatening my family because I was "different" did not cure my autism. So now I'm an adult with all of my original problems, plus PTSD, plus a host of stress-related and medication-related physical illnesses. <br><br>I'd like to point out that the way I was treated might itself be a symptom of entitlement and abundance. The adults around me felt entitled to live in a world where they didn't have to cope with disabled people, and thought that if they could make me suffer enough I would magically give them what they wanted. And I have a hard time picturing a pre-industrial community wasting THAT amount of time and effort in trying to turn a person into something they are obviously incapable of being. Surely the ability to harvest a crop would have been more important than the ability to carry a conversation at the level a team of child psychologists deemed "normal." I expect people were still cruel--in my experience all humans are vicious animals, not only the children. But I would also think they would have other things to do with their time and energy, and that they wouldn't have the rigid artificial standards of "normal" that the modern school system does.<br><br>Of course, I don't expect nature to make allowances for my disabilities, and I might not have survived childhood in those days. But that doesn't change the fact that my autism was not a choice, and I couldn't change it any more than a person in a wheelchair can choose to walk, no matter what the consequences are.<br><br><a href=#c8052900655557408002 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 2:20 PM</a><br><br>

When I was a child, I'd sometimes get to go to Point Defiance Park in Tacoma, a half hour or so south of where we lived, and there was a similar attraction there -- a trail through a patch of woods with painted sculptures, cottages, etc., all with reference to fairy tales. The last time I went there, in my early teens, it had basically been abandoned -- the paint was faded and peeling, the statues crumbling, the trail half overgrown. It was inexpressibly sad -- and a fair metaphor for the abandonment of the folk culture of American childhood.

Firstly Donald Trump is a current vivid example of a man who feels immune to consequences, “I can grab them by the pussy...” and he is not mentioned except once and that once does not examine his failings. I can empathize with people who felt his offer was better than the status quo but I think we are seeing that what we actually end up with is yet another version of the status quo in all its horror. <br><br>My second point of divergence is the power of folk tales to educate children to consequences. I was raised on the Grimm Bothers and Russian folk tales. I also stole coins from my parents’ purses, teased my younger brother, drove far too fast and drank too much. I knew there were consequences, I simply believed I could avoid them, except for hangovers. <br><br>I also joined the bigger grimmer myth-makers, I became a church goer to the bemusement of my atheist parents. This was at age 11, then at 13 I discovered masturbation and had a private battle between solitary sex and Christianity. Sex won but I spent the next two years miserably convinced I would go to hell. Fear of consequences can be tormenting. Atheism was a relief. <br><br>I did not have parents who saw Christmas as a reward for a year’s goodness or badness. If I was bad and got caught I was hit but I knew I was still loved. Christmas was a time when the family celebrated that love for each other, coal would have been irrelevant.<br><br>I took real risks as a kid, I hiked bush with poorly formed tracks, I wandered along rocky surf coasts, I snorkeled alone, miles from home, I ended up driving more skilfully because I pushed my limits (to the detriment of other people’s safety). I came home with cuts and bruises and a growing understanding of how to live in a world where there were consequences. I do not think that tales by themselves would have worked for me.<br><br><br><a href=#c5979791666367436272 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 3:13 PM</a><br><br>

As you say in the comments, the Romans celebrated the solstice on Dec 25th by the Julian calendar. The Catholic church in the 4th century decreed that Dec 25th was the birth day of Christ. An interesting side note from either apologists or theologians says they picked this date partly because Jesus is seen as the light of the world, and it was only appropriate that he was born on the darkest day.<br><br>Anyway, the Catholic church (and western Europe) switched over to the Gregorian calendar several hundred years later, moving the solstice back to the 21st, but leaving Christmas on the 25th.<br><br>The Eastern Orthodox Church, on the other hand, kept the Julian calendar for their liturgical calendar, so even though they celebrate Christmas on Dec 25th by their reckoning, that equates to January 7th by the Gregorian calendar (at least for now).<br><br>Oddly, you could say we all celebrate the solstice in some small way on all three of these dates. I guess that's what happens when you measure astronomical events with human calendars.<br><br>Happy Solstice.<br><br><a href=#c4607154386231454167 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 3:17 PM</a><br><br>

In one, bikes are supposed to be driven just like cars, use a full lane, stop at all signs and lights, and signal all turns.

As anyone who's studied the traditional lore knows, angels aren't fluffy little debutantes with oversized pigeon wings who scurry about making life comfortable for the supposedly entitled. They're terrifying, unhuman beings who are as likely to kill as to help. A classic account: "They had the likeness of a man. And every one of them had four faces, and every one had four wings....and as for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox, on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle...as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps; it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning." Then there were the vast wheels within wheels, colored like beryls, studded with eyes, and dreadfully vast, that accompanied the angels just described! If your son is indeed a little angel, he's one terrifying kid.<br><br>Sven, I want to hear that carol! <br><br>TJ, that's a valid question, and it has a simple and straightforward answer. I've never owned or used a new computer. Since I need a computer and internet access to make a living -- publishers require manuscripts in electronic formats these days, and handle editing and proofs over the internet -- I buy obsolete machines that would otherwise enter the e-waste stream, use them until they die, and then pass them on to charities that refurbish them and give them to the poor. That way I'm sparing the biosphere the very large ecological costs of making a new computer, and also sparing it the additional costs of dealing with e-waste. <br><br>In the same way, if you happen to need to own a car -- and given the idiotic way that the built environment in the US has been laid out, some people do -- buy a used car with decent gas mileage, run it until it drops, and then pass it on to one of those charities that hauls clunkers away, parts them out, and uses the funds for various good purposes. Since so huge a fraction of the ecological cost of a car is the direct and indirect cost of manufacture, you can slash your footprint hugely by never buying a new car. <br><br>The faux environmentalists I'm critiquing aren't the people who own cars or what have you because they actually need them. It's the people who insist they love the Earth, but wouldn't be caught dead in a ditch owning a used compact -- no, they've got to have the latest model Ford Behemoth SUV with all the energy-wasting extras, and use it to commute 45 miles each way with not another living soul inhabiting any of the seven other seats. Oh, and they paste a bumper sticker on back saying "Live Simply That Others Might Simply Live" -- and yes, I've seen that sticker on that kind of vehicle.

My take is that you're on the right track in adding the qualifying phrase "<i>healthy</i> self-esteem," but I'd encourage you to reflect on the possibility that people can have an unrealistically high sense of their competence and self-worth -- to think that they're competent when they're not, and to think that they're worth more than they actually are. That's the point at which healthy self-esteem crosses the line into an unhealthy excess of self-esteem, and people begin acting like jerks. <br><br>Caryn, and that's a good point, too. <br><br>Peacegarden, thank you. The humor and the edginess are both ways of dealing with the severity of the predicament we're in, of course. <br><br>Breanna, thanks for these. <br><br>Violet, many thanks for your story! Yours was an uncommon response to the mess that's been made of childhood in our time, but apparently a functional one. <br><br>Donald, you're very welcome. The all-caps ballistic rage is the thing that fascinates me -- not a normal reaction, though a common one. As for the minor key Christmas carols, I'll certainly check that out. Have you ever heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_PtnvVQhqA" rel=nofollow>"The Star-Spangled Banner" in a minor key</a>? It's harrowing. (If my novel <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> ever becomes a movie, I want this as its central musical theme.)<br><br>Ganv, of course. One of the points of community is finding ways to soften the otherwise brutal forces pushing toward warfare and starvation. Will ours manage it? I'm sorry to say I doubt it, but it still seems worth trying. <br><br>DiSc, that's horrible! I hope you'll surreptitiously take your son to the public library so he can pick out his own books to read. <br><br>Scott, thank you! You and your daughter are both quite correct, of course. So many people want to do whatever they feel like, and insist that the consequences won't happen -- and when they do, it's always someone or something else's fault. <br><br>Robert, thank you also! There may be a troll or something; I only got the one copy. <br><br>Eric, as I noted, there's a lot of diversity in Druidry! Of course the bear has close connections to the northern sky -- she's the constellation of the Great Bear, Callisto, and there's also the symbolic connection to the element of Earth and the northern quarter, which are among the correspondences of the winter solstice. As for a writing contest, hmm. The problem there is that I don't have any experience writing or editing children's stories, so would have a hard time judging the results.<br><br><a href=#c6658647865289027269 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 4:15 PM</a><br><br>

Lovecraft, though -- I find his work delightfully imaginative but not scary at all, with one exception -- "The Color Out Of Space" is genuinely creepy. The others? I'm invariably cheering for the monsters. (Though, to be fair, I also cheered on Rodan, Ghidorah, et al.) Thank you for the heads up; I wonder if the left has finally realized that the reason the Bundy brothers were treated with kid gloves, and the NDAP pipeline stopped suddenly the moment a large cadre of veterans showed up, is that the only thing the US government genuinely fears is the risk of armed insurgency. <br><br>Sydney Mike, many thanks for the data points from the real world. <br><br>Sister Crow, you can certainly name Wikipropaganda if you like!

Have you considered writing that up as an essay and getting it in print? It's a splendid story, and deserves more circulation. <br><br>Jay, where on Earth did you get the idea that I was including symptoms of disability in an essay that's about excessive self-esteem and a refusal to accept consequences? I have Aspergers syndrome, btw, so I can sympathize with your experience; I also got a lot of bullying in childhood because of it -- but that has nothing to do with what this essay was talking about. <br><br>Dan, of course tales by themselves aren't enough, and I never said they were. They're a starting point, that's all. As for Donald Trump, yes, I know that frantic vilification of the man has become a mandatory form of virtue signaling in some circles just now, but -- ahem -- this isn't one of those circles. We could talk at quite some length, you know, about how Hillary Clinton's career shows exactly the same belief in immunity from consequences that you decry in Trump...<br><br>Canon, oh, granted. As a Druid, I prefer to use the actual movements of the heavens to time my festivals, but to each their own. <br><br>Inohuri, that would do it! <br><br>Donalfagan, glad to hear it -- on both counts. Dedicated cycle lanes really are a good idea. <br><br>M Smith and Sgage, bingo. Angels aren't cute; they inspire dread and awe. <br><br>Ed-M, yes, I did! It's a fine story in its original form, and deserves retelling. <br><br>Jeff, thank you. I'm flattered at the amount of material from my book <i>The Druidry Handbook</i> that the author quoted, and I was impressed by the way that the section on apologetics zeroed in on two of the really crucial divisions between Druidry and modern Protestant Christianity -- the latter's insistence that human beings are a special creation separate from, and superior to, the world of nature, on the one hand, and its insistence on the uniqueness of Jesus as the sole source of salvation, on the other. Of course I'd point out that from my perspective and that of many other Druids, these claims made by Protestant Christianity are wrong, that the first is a massive source of misery, failure, and destructiveness, and the latter is little more than the standard soap salesman's claim that his product is infinitely superior to Brand X -- but that's not something a Christian apologist is going to discuss, of course. <br><br>Prizm, good heavens. I'm delighted, not least because the authors have done the unthinkable, and looked to the past to see if anyone else ever had to deal with a crisis like the one we're having in the presence. Huzzah! <br><br>Talus Wood, to my mind, that's because "primitive" societies -- that is to say, hunter-gatherer societies and the like -- are natural to human beings, since the environments and social contexts of such societies are the things that our species evolved doing. Complex societies like the one you and I inhabit are much less natural for us, and it takes much more training -- and discipline -- for each generation of fierce young animals to learn how to get by functionally in that more complex and less natural setting.<br><br><a href=#c477007056931403976 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 5:29 PM</a><br><br>

And thanks for the seasonally appropriate post!<br><br>As soon as you mentioned in your post “bear” and “actions have consequences” in the same sentence, I was immediately reminded of The Godson -- the most mystical (and therefore my favourite) short story by Leo Tolstoy. The key lesson for the Godson on his quest for his “God”father is taught by a mother bear, who ends up first harming, then killing her cubs and then killing herself by flinging a log tethered to a tall tree higher and higher. The log simply returns the same force she applies to it. Unfortunately, the Godson is not “ripe” to receive this teaching and after doing an extraordinary amount of harm to the world in a short time while wielding godlike powers (kind of reminds me of what we’ve been doing since the start of the industrial revolution), he has to spend most of his life learning this lesson (along with a few other spiritual lessons). <br><br>Your observations about the lack of such lessons being taught by Western society to its youth in recent decades is bang on. Largely thanks to being the offspring of a strict Third World mother, my children have been spared such a fate. They also have a solid grounding in traditional fairy tales of the West and Asia. I am happy to report that my children are often praised by employers and other adults for their sense of responsibility. I think that’s because under our roof, they know very well that all actions have consequences (some of them dire!).<br><br><br><br><a href=#c788613971732158795 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 6:41 PM</a><br><br>

Being the tool-using intelligent species we are, we promptly set about to alter circumstances to make life better, easier and more survivable. We cultivated things like fire, animals and crops. We created tools to ease the effort of crafting our environment and altering our circumstances.<br><br>Fast forward many thousands of years and you arrive at the current fossil-fueled age of abundance. You also run into the western concept of the social democracy. We, as a society, found we had enough resources, natural and social, to alleviate some of the harsher circumstances people fell into. Hungry? We’ll feed you. Homeless? We’ll shelter you. Sick? We’ll try to cure you. All arguably good things.<br><br>Here’s the rub - sometimes a person’s circumstances are really a product of their own choices. In other words, consequences. How do we as society differentiate between the two? In western social democracies, for the most part, we don’t. Should we? Should people be allowed to suffer because of their own actions?<br><br>New Orleans was built on a low lying swamp - that’s circumstance. So we built dykes, installed pumps, and drained the swamp. As a consequence, most of New Orleans now sits 10 feet below sea level. So when Hurricane Katrina came along and restored the water level to its natural elevation, was that circumstance or consequence? Should we as a society pay to alleviate the suffering caused by circumstance, or stand aside and let people learn about the consequences of building houses below sea level in a flood plain? Of course, the taxpayers came in and bailed them out, literally and figuratively, and people are rebuilding right where they were flooded out.<br><br>The liberal ideology of the past couple centuries have brought governments into every aspect of our lives “for our own good.” They can point to specific instances where great suffering could have been prevented if only such-and-such rule or program were in place, so the rule is made, government bureaucracies created to run programs. As we reach for that utopia with no suffering from circumstance, we also end up in a virtual padded cell where we are protected from ourselves, from the consequences of our own actions. A place where we can’t learn from experience, a place where we are dependent on the government for guidance in all aspects of our lives. Sadly, many Americans are clamoring for this utopia, to be protected in their safe spaces, to be led about by the liberal elite.<br><br>It’s time to break out of the cell and face the consequences.<br><br><br><a href=#c1021979963676907762 title="comment permalink">12/22/16, 10:08 PM</a><br><br>

Perhaps because they distill huge quantities of human experience into single drops of essential meaning. And morality is the art of connecting action to consequence in imagination, where such tales take up residence (or at least it is greatly facilitated by the practice of that art). <br><br>One thing that I think is often overlooked is the way in which inequality fosters asymmetry between action and consequence, such that, if a structure of inequality becomes marked and deep enough, the link between action and consequence may break down altogether. <br><br>Another word for "toxic self-esteem", after all, is "privilege" -ie, to be so positioned within some set of arrangements that the consequences of one's acts will be automatically distributed towards others. Without consequence following action (ie feedback) in the system, it can no longer correct its course and becomes caught in a loop of futile cycling. <br><br>This would be like a galley ship in which all the errors of the tillerman rain down as whippings upon the backs of the chained oarsmen. The tillerman has no (immediate) reason to change course, and the oarsman lack the power to do so, taking any utility out of their forced experience of consequences. <br><br>Consequences suffered because of the acts of others (over which one has no power) may be no more useful as lessons (or system feedback) than acts committed without consequences to oneself.<br><br>None of this means that consequences can be avoided, but I think it says something about why, ultimately, elites and privileged classes fail to learn from them in a timely way.<br><br><br><a href=#c6315543206223573361 title="comment permalink">12/23/16, 3:31 AM</a><br><br>

Sometimes, trying to keep a post from being too long, I think I leave out certain caveats and side notes that may be needed. Apologies.<br><br>I would never deny that some children do have genuine disabilities - even 'unseen'. They are very real. I agree that for a few the path of counseling and even the behaviour modifying drugs can be beneficial, but from what I've seen this path is not only overused - it is now the only path a lot of schools follow for any kind of misbehaviour or deviation from the norm. This is what I have a problem with.<br><br>Personally, I kind of stumbled across this career as an educator of young children, but have found it to be my absolute calling. I love it and love them, my darling, frightening little devil-angels! One side-effect is that I've gotten pretty astute in picking up on which ones are actually struggling with things like impulse control and opposition, those who don't see it at all, they're just not mature enough yet, those who see and try to follow instructions, but often can't or fail and those who know darned well, but simply don't, as it suit their wants. Working with them every day, engaging with them and well, just caring: even after only a few months - it's actually not hard to see. But in the end, most of the time it's irrelevant as the 'cure', the magic pill of positive healthy interaction is the same.<br><br>As the mother of one who was diagnosed (IMHO correctly) as being on the periphery, but definitely, under the umbrella of the ADHD spectrum, I've gone through the whole testing/analysis/therapy route - but no drugs. The thing as a parent I always wanted to know was, "So what do we DO about it?" Answer: The magic pill that is the cure is the same one our grandparents and great grandparents had: There is no magic pill - your child just has to learn to work harder than the rest to keep up, to learn coping strategies to get around, on top of, squish under, or slog through whatever problem/challenge they have. <br><br>Well, OK - that and be food-nazi-diligent about their diet helps a lot. Preprocessed foods and sugars exacerbate the problem for most kids. Exercise helps, as does a strict limit to any screen time.<br><br>The good news is that hard work and creating coping strategies ends up pushing many of these kids far ahead of their peers later in teen and adult life. <br><br><br><a href=#c528802374209886040 title="comment permalink">12/23/16, 7:38 AM</a><br><br>

Have you considered writing that up as an essay and getting it in print? It's a splendid story, and deserves more circulation."<br><br>My sister did write an essay about it which was published in a small non-profit newsletter, but other than that no essay was published that circulated widely. At the time though, several people wrote letters to the editor and a journalist wrote an op-ed in support of us, plus we were interviewed briefly on NPR, so the story (the basics, at least) did get some circulation. Unfortunately, our experience with media coverage was mixed -- the underlying issues behind why we did what we did was often ignored. Also, we were sometimes referred to as "protesters," which annoyed me, because it really wasn't a protest -- at least not in any overt sense -- we saw instead ourselves as participating in a kind of "embedded theater" to illuminate the absurd theater that everyday life has become. We never told anyone not to buy stuff; it was done in a way so people were free to come to their own conclusions. One person encouraged us to write an actual play based on it -- it had the makings of a great farce.<br><br>Despite the reaction from mall management, diverse people expressed support for our efforts, which was heartening. For example, our most enthusiastic supporter happened to be a Christian conservative activist (who was also an anti-abortion activist). She wrote letters to the editor in support of us, generously donated to help cover the cost of our lawyer (though in the end, we wished we had represented ourselves), came and supported us at our trial, and even said she would have participated but family time was more important to her. It made me realize that at least on issues about consumerism (in contrast to very polarized issues such as abortion), if messages are framed rightly, I think there is a lot of opportunity for alliances of both the political left and right to work together.<br><br>I'm not sure how much difference our efforts made, but many people appreciated the story and the absurdity of it all. Compared to other types of activism I've been involved in, it was the one I felt most passionate about. Why? I think it goes back to what you've written before -- it was focused on the industries of demand instead of industries of supply (and that's probably why, despite being such an innocuous action, it was so threatening). Also, it used humor, which I find is too often neglected in activist work. In the absurd age we live in, where people are simultaneously too serious but not serious enough, it is really necessary to use humor to make people take things seriously!<br><br><a href=#c7438438188101699465 title="comment permalink">12/23/16, 7:53 AM</a><br><br>

Ditto for me. We likewise knew we were loved even we were ashamed. <br><br>In our case it was wartime with air raids. And food rationing continued for more than a few years after. There was sentiment and some tribute to piety from mum but pretty much zero theology. I retain affection for carols whatever the words. Our beloved older brothers did a lot of looking after baby brother and me. I don’t ever recall my parents praying. It was more a matter of them staying alert, reacting very fast and doing and hoping for the best and being thankful. <br><br>Though I was an omnivorous reader I deliberately rejected <i>‘Grimm’s Fairy Tales’</i> I think before I was 11. I remember when I was 13 or 14 carrying my opinion into a classroom debate that the stories were mostly dressed up European atrocity stories. Well … a bit sweeping; but I was rather young and the record of WW2 was beginning to get to my generation’s consciousness. The record of Eastern Europe must have been circulating, though if I remember correctly the photographic detail was a year or two later.<br><br>I have never liked or understood Christian Church services much though I have been to relatively few. Ancient English churches were OK, and some sincerely affecting, but I never really got Christianity – did not favour or reject one form or another. I gave C of E a short trial when 17 and met some nice people but came across the Nicaean Creed and did not rate it. So I still like Christmas, though it’s mostly the time of year and the singing.<br><br>It would be good if we could break the modern spells and sing again.

Attitudes toward death in Judaism and Christianity -- I don't know enough about the various forms of Islam to extend the discussion there -- actually vary drastically; there are certainly versions of both faiths that fixate on a supposed triumph over death, and then you get versions that are very, very deeply into the acceptance of death -- the faithful die and stay dead until, at some point very possibly far in the future, God resurrects them via a miracle.

Mr Catton has had my brain working overtime on those matters. Hey, you know what? That book is important enough to undertake a re-reading of it. And so the other day I started just that, and today over lunch I happened to read a startling chunk of information. Our food which is produced via the system of industrial agricultural methods has a negative net energy in that it produces far less energy than is consumed in the production of that output. And then just to be sure, he went on and gave a solid example from 40 years ago. Things can not have improved in the meantime. No wonder people have such inflated expectations as to the agricultural surplus produced from here. The surplus is just not that great using the systems that I do. But the flip side of that equation is that the rest of the eco-system here gets to benefit from the work here. I'm starting to seriously consider the question of choice that I posed to you last week. Perhaps Orwell got it right when he wrote in the book 1984 that Freedom is Slavery? It is a complex matter.<br><br>Hi trippticket,<br><br>I've always enjoyed your handle! And I must say congratulations and best wishes for your shop. If I were living in the area, I would support your business. :-)!<br><br>That is a crazy attitude. Yeah, my lot here do the same, and mostly they look after their own canine business. The dogs have been very busy of late as the local population of deer has increased and as summer has hit here in full force, the deer are moving into higher elevations. Twice now I have caught a herd of deer on the edge of the orchards, and the dogs to their total respect will happily chase the deer (Stag and all!) off into the forest for a fair distance. Dogs are a critical tool, no doubts about it. I've learned to live with all of the different birds and animals that drop by here for a feed but deer are something else altogether and can reach much higher into the trees in the orchard and the scraping of the antlers on the tree bark...<br><br>Hi nuku,<br><br>Exactly, it comes to all of us in the end and it is a very serious limit. I'm personally surprised that it is a taboo subject in our culture. But no doubts that you are correct in those assertions. Personally, I have no beef with any Gods so hopefully when I pass on such concerns as the ones you raised and are often displayed by some religions adherents don't apply? It seems as good a strategy as any you have to admit? :-)!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c3464407303097161866 title="comment permalink">12/23/16, 8:32 PM</a><br><br>

Even though I voted for him. However, he doesn't remind me of a spoiled brat 5 year old throwing a tantrum or my Father-in-Law with diagnosed Dementia. Trump speaks the exact same way my father-in-law did. You could have a great conversation with him about house construction or real estate, he was quite knowledgeable, but then he'd go off and who knows where it would lead. My wife and I spent 5 years dealing with this, she was her father's legal guardian. Whenever we see another Trump tweet, we both can't help but be reminded of some very stressful times. The subject matter and manner of speaking is identical.<br><br>There's a huge difference between Obama's behavior and Trump's. I've never had the feeling that Obama was going to see something in the news that tweaked his nose the wrong way and lash out with something that was going to massively endanger the entire country. I most definitely feel that way about Trump.<br><br>If the President doesn't have enough self-control to keep himself from tweeting threats whenever somebody insults his Restaurant or prints something bad about him, he doesn't have enough self-control to be President. Think what people would have said if Obama had lashed out the way that Trump does every time another idiot questioned his Birth Certificate!<br><br>My biggest complaint this election is that <b>NEITHER</b> candidate that made it to the election that was worth a d**n. <b>Both</b> were completely unsuited for the office. I knew what Clinton was going to do, all bad. Trump gives no <i>specific</i> clues to the exact details of what he might do, but, at least to me, the generalities are more than bad enough.<br><br>I still remember the room I was standing in when Reagan was elected, it was an oh... frack moment. This time I knew it didn't make any difference who was elected, my response was going to be the same, except worse. Unlike many, just because Trump scares me, doesn't mean I think Clinton is any better. Clinton's supporters/rationalizers can't see her lies and Trump's supporters/rationalizers can't see his lies.<br><br>I'll end my mention of this subject, won't bring it up again. I'm reminded of something one of the Mexican Astronomers my Father worked with in the 1970's told him. "You know what's the difference between Mexico and the U.S.A? <i>We admit our Politicians are crooked.</i>"<br><br><br><br><a href=#c1274693092673897485 title="comment permalink">12/23/16, 8:59 PM</a><br><br>

From what I've seen there's quite an infestation. Do they assume that they have a natural right to wealth and power, not to mention an absolute right to not be challenged? Does history ever tell us about any aristocracy, hereditary or not, that presumed so much, that had such an towering sense of their own entitlement? <br><br>From what I've read and heard, even the most hidebound English toffs had a sense of obligation, for example, to lead in war-time, to set an example, to put themselves in harm's way, even if they did assume leadership as their natural right. Would we ever see such a sense of personal duty in a "snowflake"?<br><br>As far as non-English aristocrats go, I think you see a degree of insecurity about their place, that is, fear of being displaced and killed by foreigners or ambitious people in their own realm. I think their idea was that only the paranoid survive, to quote Andy Grove. Do we see any of this in snowflakes? <br><br>I think that, in the past, American aristocrats, even if not in the old-world model, assumed they had commitments, for example, Bush 41, who served in WW2 as a bomber pilot, and JFK, who served as a PT boat skipper, and his brother Joe who died in the air service.<br><br>But I think that the downslide came in the Vietnam era. I read that only two grads of MIT died in Vietnam as opposed to some fifteen former students of a Boston high school in a neighbourhood of Polish and Italian immigrants. You hear about sons of the rich, like Mitt and Dubya and Trump, that managed to avoid service or at least the more kinetic aspects of it. You hear about Republican chicken-hawks who won't stint on sending others into battle. But shared sacrifice? No more, not like before. <br><br>So what name do we assign to the new ideology? Snowflake-ism? Or to their mode of behaviour? Snowflakery? When these people get out into the real world, have they got any idea of what confronts them? There's no safe spaces. Even if that odious gang currently tormenting Syria and Iraq gets dispersed, the economic and societal factories that churn out their like will still exist. There's a multitude of challenges, military and non-military, that come with eight or nine billion aggressive, resource-hungry people. They will have to be confronted. Are the snowflakes up to it? <br><br>Even if the snowflakes manage to acquire power, I suspect that such delicacy of sensibility won't be of service to them, nor their presumption to safety. I think their time at the apex will be short. <br><br><br><a href=#c4679656814283169472 title="comment permalink">12/24/16, 7:34 AM</a><br><br>

You who so strongly advocate children (and adults, of course) pulling their own weight, and dislike the sense of entitlement that means "I don't have to help!" are praising a poem whose narrator is a privileged family child who os pleased to be playing with toys while Annie does all the chores. Which child are you identifying with? Annie? Or the narrator?<br><br>You do not want use the 19th Century German "scare the kids witless" verses like the ones quoted ("cut off their thumbs for thumb-sucking") as guides to child rearing. We don't take them seriously, just as examples of going over the top for emphasis. The original writers, while they did exaggerate, were serious. At least according to Alice Miller, whose books make out a plausible case for a philosophy based on "breaking the child's will" to unquestioning obedience by any and all means, being responsible for the mentality which went along with the Holocaust. She uses period sources to document the brutality with which this was done, and cites two simple factors: the unquestioning obedience, and a volcanic mass of underlying rage in the brutalized child grown up. Incidentally, nowhere does she claim all children were treated like this, merely that many were, and that Hitler himself (like Stalin, which is also on record) had such an upbringing. So I would be really, really careful that a concern for consequences has limits like everything else. <br><br>(Incidentally, it was a German himself - 15th century - who memorably compared people and their treatment of ideas to a drunken peasant trying to ride a horse. "First," Martin Luther noted sardonically, "he falls off on one side, gets back on, and then falls off on the other side." <br><br>Me, I note that at least the peasant wasn't roaring down the Interstate the wrong way at 100 mph, with the power to do the amount of damage 20th history has shown we can do. Even if the peasant did wake up with a mouthful of hay and horse droppings, since at least the horse knew where home was and how do get there. Even with Hans Hayseed on his back bawling out alehouse songs and falling off. Which - to push the metaphor further than it wants to go, very few of us do any more.)<br><br>Christmas Carols: I love the sincere simplicity of Silent Night, which, done right, actually conjures up the little country church with neither organ nor orchestra. Just the pastor, a guitar, and the congregation singing in a straightforward A major key. <br><br>BTW, "I'll be home for Christmas" ceases to be mushy if you know the context, which I learned very late, from a Popejoy Hall production of Irving Berlin's songs staged as a tour of the 20th century. The period is the very early 1940s, and the next song in sequence was "Suppertime." <br><br>At any rate, The Grey Badger stumps off with best wishes for Christmastide/<br>Midwinter. May the light ever return. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c2156320806223041651 title="comment permalink">12/24/16, 11:10 AM</a><br><br>

How are orphans treated now in various parts of the world? <br><br>As far as 'Struwwelpeter', I was certainly not advocating that people use it to train up their kids!

I have asked a friend who is a retired lawyer to read it, she said it wasn't her area of law so she didn't really have any insight into it .<br><br>Well, hopefully. I'm worried about nothing. I'm just wondering, could our government now label "climate change" and "peak oil" or any thing similar Russian propaganda? I believe Trump already labeled "climate change" Chinese propaganda. So does that mean that TAR could be labelled a propaganda site? Am I reading too much into this?<br><br><br><a href=#c6824486858292560112 title="comment permalink">12/24/16, 10:46 PM</a><br><br>

Mary's parents had fallen in love across social boundaries in England sometime around 1850. He was a son of a wealthy English family, and she was an Irish servant girl in the household. To marry against his family's wishes, they fled England for New York. There they had three children, two boys and Mary. When Mary was still too young to have learned which day of the calendar was her birthday, her parents died of one of the diseases that regularly swept through the New York tenements in those days. Friends of the young couple, who knew their story, wrote to his parents back in England, and the grandparents sent a relative across the ocean to inspect the orphans, The two boys reminded that relative of their father, but the girl more resembled her dsspised mother, so Mary was rejected and dumped into a New York orphanage, while her brothers were taken back to England and a life of privilege. When Mary was old enough to work, she was sent westward on one of the Orphan Trains. She got as far as Muncie, Indiana, where she finally found someone who would buy her from the orphanage for a servant, to serve until she was 18. This was George W Seitz, who owned a hardware store. She was treated well for a servant, but when she turned 18 and her term of service was up, she west to Colorado to find a husband in the silver mines there. (She was a plain woman, and she thought her chances of marrying well would be better in a place where men considerably outnumbered women.) In Leadville she met and married a mining engineer, Isaac Taylor Tallman, and they had two children, the younger of whom died as an infant. Mary had fond enough memories of her time with the Seitz family that she made the hard trip from leadville back to Muncie to show them her new baby; clearly they had all parted on good terms. True, she had been a servant in the Seitz household, like Annie in the poem, but thought herself fortunate to have had that life instead of a much shorter life filled with much harder work in the slums of New York. <br><br>The poet, James Whitcomb Riley, was also from Indiana, and he was born within a year or two of Mary Corbit. The orphan trains were a regular thing in his day, and Irish servant girls bought off from them, like Annie in the poem or Mary Corbit in real life, were a common thing for the time and place where he lived. In those days even privileged children did not have a life of leisure: they worked, too, though their work was less "menial" than that of the Irish servant girls. The Seitz's son would have started working in the family's hardware store all day long at about the same age as Mary began to spend her days doing household chores, and the Seitz's daughter would have had work of her own all day in the house, though her work would not have been as menial as Mary's. The evening was the only time when everyone normally had some time off, to rest and relax as a family together before going to bed. In the poem, the servant girl and the family's own children amuse themselves together around the fire with scary stories.<br><br>(to be continued)<br><br><a href=#c7553152691622301629 title="comment permalink">12/25/16, 2:42 AM</a><br><br>

But any child below the top layers of society would spend his or her days working. If you had loving parents, your work might be light, and you might hope to be taken care of even if you became disabled and unable to work ever again. But mortality was high, and no child could afford to take for granted that there would always be loving adults to look after them. Children knew that, too. If you, a child, wanted to live and become an idnependent adult, you would have to work all your days, startig as soon as you were old enough to do any work at all. That was just how a child's life was, unless you had been born into the very top ranks of the privileged. <br><br>And for my money, that sort of childhood producd a crop of tougher, nore resiliant grown-ups from the children who survived it, than today's usual manner of doing childhood.<br><br><br><a href=#c3849679318288178773 title="comment permalink">12/25/16, 2:43 AM</a><br><br>

A lot of people have a death wish now and it gets expressed in various ways. Willfully neglecting one's health is just one way. A lot of people simply don't have the will to live in a post-progressive, post-"American dream" world, and express their death wish in various ways. Think of how death rates &amp; alcoholism shot through the roof in the post-Soviet USSR and Eastern Europe. We'd better just steel ourselves towards it all. Besides, neglecting your health and expressing your death wish has a certain logic to it from a certain perspective, and if you just realize that Mam Gaia is way too overcrowded and there just aren't enough resources to go a around anymore, perhaps you can feel compassion and understanding to those expressing their death wish.<br>I'm really amazed how many young people have bought into the "savings account" lie about Social Security and Medicare. When I tell them that no, Social Security and Medicare are not "savings accounts", that money that is withheld from their paychecks goes directly into some old person's Social Security check and Medicare, they're rightfully outraged and want an immediate end to the practice. Most young people do not believe in an independent old age, and think that old people no longer able to provide for themselves should be dependents like children. They think that this would inspire a sense of responsibility towards younger generations by the old if they knew they would be dependent in their old age.<br>I used to tutor immigrant children in a branch library in a heavily immigrant neighborhood, but stopped b/c I got so discouraged that I was unable to stop the digital and commercialized tidal wave of shale. I really felt that there wasn't anything I could do to go against such a tide of shale, but I do feel it is unfortunate that only the wealthy can afford to send their kids to Waldorf schools while low income folks have to put up with digital and commercialized shale. Perhaps I gave up too quickly, and there is a way to go against the overwhelming tide?<br><br><a href=#c8712749387808435969 title="comment permalink">12/25/16, 2:37 PM</a><br><br>

From time to time, he hires help for maintenance and cleaning. He tried to call on a man who had previously been a good worker, and whom he knew to be in need of work, but the man's (government subsidized) mobile phone wouldn't take the call. After the work was done, the landlord and laborer met again by chance, and the landlord asked why the laborer couldn't be called. "The government only give us 120 phone minutes a month," he said. "That only lasts about a week."<br><br>Now, I may not have the right number for the the total number of minutes, but I think you get the idea.<br><br>My mother told a story about an impoverished single-parent mother for whom their church offered to purchase some groceries. "Oh, that would be great, because the kids have no milk, and I'm out of cigarettes." When the food was delivered, the recipient called out from the couch: "Just leave it on the kitchen counter. I'll put it away when my [TV] show is over." [I got these quotes third-hand, so I won't pretend that they're word-for-word accurate, but that's the gist of the story that was told to me.] How does a person of charitable intent proceed from this point? To what extent does an offer of charity entitle one to dispense advice as well?<br><br>(As I learned from my first wife, every offer of assistance can be regarded (fairly or not) as an indictment of the recipient's competence, and an attack on their ego.

The Druidry of the Druid Revival does indeed draw on Celtic traditions, mostly medieval through 18th century Welsh lore, with a good healthy dollop of Iolo Morganwg's inventions -- and of course he was a bona fide Welshman, so whatever he cooked up is Celtic by definition, isn't it? ;-)<br><br>Cherokee, I know. I read it over again every couple of years, and find something new in it every single time. I'd encourage every reader of this blog who doesn't alreaydy have a copy of <i>Overshoot</i> to run right out and get a copy -- it's frankly more important and more worth reading than anything I've written. <br><br>August, fair enough. I'd characterize the difference between Obama and Trump differently; it's simply a matter of which of them cares about appearances. Obama is profoundly concerned with maintaining the right image -- that's why he made a speech at Hiroshima deploring nuclear weapons, while his administration was busy launching a nuclear arms race with Russia. Trump doesn't care about images, so he tweets about launching an arms race. Still, we'll see. <br><br>Sven, thanks for this! I'd also recommend the novel <i>Krampus the Yule Lord</i> by Bron, which pits Krampus against Santa Claus in today's Appalachia in a struggle to the death over who rules the Yuletide.<br><br>Silva, so noted!

More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Patricia, by all means dissent, but you're misstating the context of Little Orphan Annie pretty dramatically. The poem makes it clear, if you know the habits of the time, that all the other kids have been doing chores until well after dinner; and in a society with no social safety net, the habit of hiring orphan children to help with the domestic economy was an effective way to keep them from starving in the streets. As for fairy tales and Alice Miller, I've read her work, and find it a sustained exercise in cherrypicking. The same habits of childrearing that gave us Adolf Hitler also gave us the great humanitarian Albert Schweitzer, you know, and a vast number of perfectly ordinary men and women as well.<br><br><a href=#c2776591788433832737 title="comment permalink">12/25/16, 7:08 PM</a><br><br>

I haven't read Bettelheim in way too long. <br><br>LatheChuck, back before the current sense of universal entitlement got bolted into place, it was standard for people to draw a distinction between the deserving poor and the undeserving poor. The difference was that people in the former category were poor through no fault of their own, and could be expected to recover economically with some well-timed help, while those in the latter category got poor through bad habits or bad judgments, and would just end up in the gutter again no matter what was done to help them. The usual habit was to restrict charity to the former category.

Some counties may be in a double bind in that if they improve a road at all they may have to meet new Federal standards for width, and markings, and separation of functions i.e a bike trail cannot double as pedestrian walkway, that would require widening the right of way, which would entail buying more land along the road. Even if it is only two feet on each side it adds up. A case of the perfect becoming an enemy of the good. I have attending planning meetings in my community, which has narrow, shoulderless roads and this was the response of the county engineers to suggestions of bicycle trails or equestrian trails. <br><br><br>Re snowflake--I have commonly seen it used to mean someone who seems to feel that they are such an unique individual that the ordinary rules should not apply. As in expecting a special early administration of the final exam because they have to be home for break in time to leave for the Bahamas with their parents. The parents obviously share this POV since they made travel plans that conflict with their child's schooling. The forum section of the Chronicle of Higher Education is a treasure trove of such tales, as college professors vent to one another. <br><br>In training children to become responsible adults I think we need to bear in mind the contradictory messages of Christian culture. Children are seen by some as innocent little souls, in need only of gentle guidance. But at a deeper level many regard them as little "limbs of Satan", steeped in original sin and needing severe treatment to steer them into something approaching a godly life. Other cultures do not share this view. Japanese culture, for example, does emphasize hard work and discipline, but it comes out of basic belief that human children want to be successful humans just as squirrel babies want to be successful squirrels and need loving guidance to accomplish this. The human soul is compared to a mirror, which is always ready to reflect the light, although, like a mirror it may become soiled by the trials of daily life. I recommend the Parent Effectiveness Training books of Dr. Thomas Gordon. They emphasize communication and identification of what the problem actually is. They adopt the I-statement approach or Dr. Carl Rogers. For example, instead of "YOU are a bad, noisy boy." say "Slamming the door hurts my ears. Can we close it more quietly?"<br><br>I remember reading once that Native Americans were deeply shocked by the fact that the Europeans beat their children. <br><br>We might also consider the flip side of the helicopter parent: the parent who cuts the kid loose at 18, disclaims any responsibility to continue paying for education or anything else. This seems to be the attitude of some divorced non-custodial parents paying child support, basicly firing their kid for the supposed crimes of ex-spouse. I had college students in my classes who were working a 40 hour week while carrying a full load of courses despite having parents who could easily have afforded to help. Needless to say, dozing off in class because you work the night shift at the casino does not lead to academic success. I predict that some of these people will end up dying on a park bench because when the safety net fails their kids will not be inclined to take mom or dad in or pay for their care elsewhere. <br><br><br>Christmas table discussions reveal a general unwillingness on the part of relatives and friends to accept the idea of actual or looming resource shortages.

So the question is, at what layer of padding does one's comfort zone lie? These layers go back at least to early agriculture and arguably further. The US laid on a more finely crafted layer with the Declaration of Independence, resulting in a new kind of space which inevitably the human penchant for wealth and power found comfortable for actions leading over and over again to consequences which finally brought us the Great Depression followed by the New Deal, which, although a 'couple of centuries' of liberal ideology is mentioned, I suspect may be the layer which creates the most discomfort for those desiring 'freedom' to ignore these consequences and who have also failed to learn from experience.

In other words, consequences. How do we as society differentiate between the two? In western social democracies, for the most part, we don’t. Should we? Should people be allowed to suffer because of their own actions?" No, a person’s circumstances are never entirely a product of their own choices or are only to a very small extent. The question must also be asked: Should people be allowed to suffer because of the actions of others?<br><br> If one doesn't feel the need for any padding, well, even hunter-gatherers required a culture, so one may be seeking an Ayn Rand-ish utopia fantasy world where only the strong(est) deserve to tthrive. We may yet get something like that but I don't think you'd find it likeable. And noblesse oblige seems to be far less effective than social democratic welfare programs, which for all their drawbacks have forestalled further violent revolution--perhaps for better or worse......<br><br>Chuck<br><br><a href=#c4910748982637826599 title="comment permalink">12/25/16, 8:23 PM</a><br><br>

This is as I understand you for the formerly having pushed up the wasteful life of the overwhelming part of the population towards that unsustainable level, why the recent part the USA is now collapsing and recently helping for jobs going abroad as well as cheap labour entering, thus accelerate the impoverishment of the same population beforehand made so over-consumptive.<br><br>Instead, the only thing I, at such occasion do observe is your blaming attitude, which I do not share.

We cannot help it.<br><br>I understand you angrily arguing against it, in your idealistic hope to change the tide of fate, despite that you know and repeatedly talk about it, that its human nature and disaster will enfold no matter what we do whatsoever.<br><br>We only can go with the tide along, hoping to stay afloat, while the maelstrom carries us along.<br><br>Contradictory so you seems to wish, that there would happen a turning around of the leading leftist fractions, in order for the whole society to become a movement preparing for the impact of "post-peak" collapse.<br><br>Thinking of myself, I see that supposed habit of you reflected within myself.

If you decide to give something, you decide to give it, because you wanted to, because you thought it a good thing to do.

The only way to psychologically balance such a <i>depth</i> (and hence retain some shred of self-respect) is to assume the <i>heights</i> of a grand person who is degining to accept your charity, or to re-frame the gift as their "due" for which reciprocation is not needed.<br><br>But before I get called naive, let me add that I try to take this sort of generous interpretation as a matter of <i>strategy</i><br> <br><br><br><a href=#c2249267010835859641 title="comment permalink">12/26/16, 5:45 AM</a><br><br>

It has been fascinating to witness how you have disseminated almost organic lifespans of failed political movements in your home country. The way how you profile the rise and fall of civilizations and human infrastructures in general has been unarguably greatest offering of your blog (for me at least). You treat these often delicate subjects as someone with background in biology would examine evidence of human cultures. This attitude has wider implications than just in this “peak oil” or “net energy” scene. It is a new way to see human species during it’s voyage through time and space, through history, as one piece of complex ecological puzzle. Overshoot and bottleneck events are very real, and they are already shaping faith of mankind, but story tells also about tragedy and comedy of cultures being born, living and dying. I have come to a conclusion that when oral, and much later written, traditions enabled human tribes to differ ecologically from each other by means of generationally transmitted traditions and culture, it was final revolution that take us away from the common path with other primates. The epochs of these metanarratives, cultures and civilizations, are the true great stories and tragedies of our species. <br>So I have a question for you. Historical research has been able to recognise civilizations as far back as to ancient Sumer and Egypt. There were probably sophisticated cultural spheres before that, during Neolithic, but their traditions did not leave behind written records so their legacy is truly lost. Megalithic temples of Malta prove that there was highly sophisticated culture around the Neolithic times, but that is all they can tell. People can project their own fantasies and hopes into these impressive megalithic sites around Europe, but they truly are only their own projections. Still, some justifiable guesses can be made. So what you think? Has earliest cultures we know earlier predecessors from which they sprang? If so, can our civilization be forgotten as totally as those? And was the high point of Western civilization truly during 18th century, as Spengler suggests? And if you think so, why? Here in Europe TRUE conservatives are both monarchist and advocates of aristocracy. For them, French Revolution was tragedy that derailed Western culture from it’s true roots. Monarchy, Christianity and reverence of legacy from antiquity were tripod legs of this original Western identity. And of course they are right. Those truly are bastions of what it means to be Westerner. Only people in relatively young countries of European diaspora can thin otherwise. But was the pre-Revolution truly high tide of Western culture, and why? And what was in the revered legacy from imperators of Rome and philosophers of Hellas?<br>I truly hope that you find inspiration to answer for these quite large questions. Your outlook at these things is deeply honoured, even if totally different cultural and geopolitical environment inevitably causes deep differences between our understanding of world. <br><br><br><a href=#c6794830741168981793 title="comment permalink">12/26/16, 6:50 AM</a><br><br>

Originally published unde the title, _Have You a Strong Will?_ in 1899, it went through several evisions at its author's hands before reaching its final form in 1903. It has remained in print ever since, though more commonly under the titel, _The Mystic Will: A Method of Developing and Strengthening the Faculties of the Mind_. You can download it from several places on the web, including the Internet Archive. Don't skim it, though it's written in a deceptively esay style. For maximum understanding, go through the book slowly and thoughtfully, take notes as you go, systematize its process in your own words from these notes, and then go bck and read it slowly again.<br><br>Another truly excellent book on the subject is _Mind Power_ (1912), by William Walker Atkinson, also downloadable here and there from the web. This book, like Leland's, had a somewhat complicated publication history before reaching its final form in 1912. Atkinson was extraordinarily prolific as an author, publishing under a good number of pseudonyms such as Yogi Ramacharaka and Theron Q. Dumont.

Some counties may be in a double bind in that if they improve a road at all they may have to meet new Federal standards for width, and markings, and separation of functions i.e a bike trail cannot double as pedestrian walkway, that would require widening the right of way, which would entail buying more land along the road. Even if it is only two feet on each side it adds up. A case of the perfect becoming an enemy of the good. I have attending planning meetings in my community, which has narrow, shoulderless roads and this was the response of the county engineers to suggestions of bicycle trails or equestrian trails."<br><br>I didn't wish to bore the list with details, since standards vary from place to place, but since you bring it up, I will go into some specifics. The road in question is 22' fog line to fog line, with two 10' lanes, one each way and a double yellow center line. The right of way is 60 feet, enough for almost triple the road. One of the problems is that it is a State Highway, which means the decision makers are literally far removed from the issues. Existing power lines, fences and covering ditches etc would need to be addressed; but the cost of adding both separated bike and pedestrian or equestrian paths is quite feasible. This Low Tech article explains the costs: http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/12/the-chinese-wheelbarrow.html<br><br>In our county (Jefferson County, Washington State) there isn't a legal problem combining pedestrian, equestrian and bicycle traffic on one path. We have a rails to trails path a few miles away that is designated as such a combined use, and all users have been considerate and tolerant of each other.<br><br>The challenge I have for our legislatures is if we're doing so well, we can afford the paths. The failure to build the paths is an admittance that in 10 or 20 years _all_ roads will be paths for unpowered transportation because only the military, rich criminals and the criminally rich will be driving.<br><br>Glenn<br><br>in the Bramblepatch<br>Marrowstone Island<br>Salish Sea<br>Cascadia<br><br><a href=#c4055078088439334813 title="comment permalink">12/26/16, 1:13 PM</a><br><br>

Very modern. <br><br>Hubertus, with all due respect, when people insist that we don't have any choice in the matter -- unless they're talking about something where we really don't have a choice, such as death or the finite nature of concentrated energy reserves -- I see that as a copout. Each of us makes choices all the time. Each of us can choose to make change happen in our own lives, or not.

There's a lot of very good material out there, but Leland and Atkinson are among the best. <br><br>Shane, if it's ugly and wrenching, all the better -- the heavier the weight you lift, the greater the strength you build. As for Social Security, maybe so; we'll see how that unfolds. <br><br>Juhana, that's a good question. I personally find it improbable that human beings identical to you and me lived as hunter-gatherers and nothing else for half a million years, and then all of a sudden five millennia ago up and started building cities all over the place. Rising sea levels since the end of the last ice age may well have covered over an earlier round of urban societies -- there's actually some hard evidence for this -- and the foreshortening of history caused by the myth of progress is of course also an issue. It would not surprise me, all things considered, if it turned out that there had been advanced civilizations during the last ice age, different enough from our idea of advanced civilization that many of its scattered relics weren't even recognized as such. (That was John Michell's hypothesis in <i>The View Over Atlantis</i>, though he was much more of a visionary than a (pre)historian.) <br><br>With regard to European civilization, I tend to agree with Spengler that it reached its cultural peak around 1800, but it reached the zenith of its global power around 1900 -- in that year, most of the planet's surface was ruled either from European capitals or by European diaspora societies. (Britain alone ruled a quarter of the planet's land surface directly, and dominated much of the rest.) Then came 1914, and in the forty years that followed -- Sarajevo to Dien Bien Phu, basically -- that fell to bits. Now? Over the long run, once the US implodes, I suspect Europeans are going to have to decide whether they'd rather accept Russian suzerainty or learn to pray in Arabic. <br><br>And the European diaspora, as usual in such cases, will go its own way. Spengler was right there, too, in pointing out that a civilization never really outgrows its original homeland; attempts to export it are only skin deep. You might be interested to know that there's an old tradition in occult circles that America won't have its own civilization until sometime in the 26th century...<br><br>Varun, yep.

Another point of view is that without your communication I would not have read the book! And also a further point of view is that because of your communications, I was able to read the book without descending into a dark place or throwing a temper tantrum. I'm at acceptance / realism and it is a nice place. There really is a need for an initiation ceremony for people facing the future.<br><br>You know, if you ever decide or want to really annoy people. And I mean really, really, annoy them, have you ever considered writing about how the various social security systems are breaking apart at the seams? To my mind it looks like a break down in the agreed upon social fabric. Down here, they changed the retirement age recently to 70 for my generation and nobody seem to notice. And the ease with which the legislation got through an otherwise gridlocked parliament was very telling in itself. Of course Parliamentary benefits and pensions are going away too because of that, but that is another story.<br><br>After the hottest Christmas day here in 18 years (70 years for Adelaide) at 36.3'C (100'F), the mass of humid oppressive air outside right now makes the place feel like the tropics. I've often wondered whether this increase in humidity is one of the feedback loops which people don't tend to consider when it comes to global weirding? Certainly it will change the face of agriculture as humidity tends to increase the recycling of plant material into soil. What people may not understand about that is that it means diverting a substantial chunk of the plant matter that people currently consume into food for bacteria, fungi, yeasts etc. Those little critters will be the winners out of global weirding in the end I rather suspect.<br><br>Hi nuku,<br><br>Thanks for the awesome story and image!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c1042794864111094218 title="comment permalink">12/26/16, 3:42 PM</a><br><br>

Except for some science fiction, the contemporary fiction of any sort that I've read is as oblivious to what's coming down the road as the 1900-1910 era fiction was of the impending Great War and its aftermath. What they are crying doom about when it's not all existential blah, is right-wing politicians and fundamentalist religion and the death of all that is lovely, liberal, tolerant, and civilized at the hands of the same. Occasionally climate change. <br><br>But I'm not the best one to ask. I lost interest in contemporary literary fiction some time ago, finding it boring, pointless, or distasteful, and not worth digging for whatever gems there may be. This is not 'moralizing' but an individual aesthetic gut reaction. (I also found myself becoming excruciatingly bored with Analog SF magazine, which had been a favorite of mine since I was 10 and it was Astounding SF. For what that's worth. Same old, same old.) <br><br>I enjoy novels written by writers who have turned out good murder mysteries and by certain sf writers, who are keenly aware that a novel must be about something and must have a plot, unless they turn pretentious when they do so.

Your comment is spot on, and an essential point and part of a healthy child-rearing / society-rearing process. Thank You for including it here. I would agree, punishments for bad behaviour hardly work, and in the long run would most likely backfire into some truly horrid adult behaviour if they are uncoupled from love and caring, the rewards of good behaviour. Like yin and yang, they must go together because good and bad are both relative - there is no good without bad to compare it to, and vice versa. (I might add, this is not restricted to parents, but to us teachers and care-givers too, in our however-limited capacity with the children in our care.)<br><br>I would add to your list of sources of 'de-empathizing' children; Iris Chang's "The Rape Of Nanking'. The first 1/2 of the book is an in-depth study on the careful desensitization of young Japanese boys for future harsh military service. They were taken from their families and raised in a sort of 'boot-camp' at a young age, (7 year old, or so, as I recall, although I'm not sure). I understand there was some measure of this harsh, de-empathizing culture dating back to the days of the Samurai, (Patricia would know more about this, and can maybe chime in?), but it was stepped up purposefully by the military prior to WW2.<br><br>These examples, however, IMHO were intentional systematic processes of human behavioural manipulation - and for specific causes, (war and creating 'perfect' warriors) I don't think it is innate in human nature to treat each other and especially for parents to treat their own offspring with no love, only cruelty, and neglect. I would not argue that there are some that are cruel, innately - however, I do think they are outliers. Neither would I argue that (especially neglect) is seen often now, but I suppose that is also a result and sign of how far gone our society has gotten to. We've fallen apart.<br><br>I'm not a Druid, but I think starting with the love of and for Mother Earth / Mam Gaia is and was an essential tenant to embrace for us silly weak, fragile humans to find any kind of peace and happiness here on her belly.<br><br><a href=#c4931028450852781386 title="comment permalink">12/26/16, 6:23 PM</a><br><br>

My grandparents (and 100 generations before them) had an entire community that pushed them into "adulting", normalized it and the lack of technological progress and social change made the notion that one would grow up to be like your parents utterly normal and nothing to be bothered by. My parents may not have had community, but they had economic stability and a culture they were confident in - so some errant gametes turned into a healthy family even if a maternity-grade wedding dress was involved. Strangely enough, after the initial accident, a deliberately-created sibling of mine was created.<br><br>Now, in addition to the economic uncertainties which hinder family formation, there is a culture which actively discourages settling down and family formation. Nearly every young woman I know grew up watching Sex and the City, a show about four hyperpromiscuous young ladies who apparently find happiness through pseudo-anonymous sex. The protagonist's futures as miserable cat ladies is not shown.<br><br>Although modern youth culture certainly deserves criticism, there is a very real issue of cultural engineering grossly distorting human expectations and roles in rather perverse ways.

It was these projections against which ASPO protested. The article that Colin Campbell and I published in 2003 showed that conventional oil would reach its maximal production rate (peak production) at 71 Mb/d in 2010. In reality, the peak occurred at a little over 70 Mb/d in 2007. Since then, production has decreased. If we added in unconventional oil except fracking we saw a peak in production in 2013 at 85 Mb/d. Like the IEA and the EIA, we did not include oil from fracking in our production estimates from those times. To state that the Peak Oil movement failed is thus a mistaken assertion. Instead, what has happened is that the IEA and EIA are now adjusting their predictions to more closely align with our prediction from 2003. In the meantime, the world has partially succeeded in compensating for the decreased production of crude oil. However, according to the IEA's World Energy Outlook report from October 2016, there are now signs that world oil production, (that, when including oil from fracking, was 93 Mb/d in 2015), will have decreased during 2016 and there is much to support that it can be as low as 80 Mb/d in 2030. Rather than fail, ASPO has instead made the world conscious that the scenarios presented by the IEA and EIA in 2002 were unrealistic. The manuscript of our new book, Our Global Addiction to oil – depletion, fracking, and reduced climate threat” has very recently been sent to the publishing house Springer for publication. When that has occurred we can, once again, take up this discussion on whether or not the Peak Oil movement failed.<br><br><a href=#c2024576043477512015 title="comment permalink">12/27/16, 7:31 AM</a><br><br>

That Santa Claus rewards his worshipers by using proxies, well, what would one expect from a spirit or deity of such a materialism oriented religion? (I am not quite sure where exactly the line between a spirit and a deity of such a religion is drawn, but I cannot think of another entity so worshiped by the adherents of Progress, so perhaps deity is the correct term here.)<br><br>Of course there is a good deal of overlap between old Saint Nicholas and the new Santa Claus, as Santa Claus is usurping the older Saint Nicholas' position, and there are a good number of folks fighting back against Santa Claus, and often hampered by older relatives who wish to spoil the grandchildren. Goodness knows I've had more than one argument with my mother over whether or not my children should be told that Santa Claus is real, and I do not care if I am spoiling her fun by not lying to my children!<br><br>Another brief thought, are we raising children to adulthood or to continued childhood? It seems to me a great deal of trouble for young people today could have been avoided by adults remembering that children must become adults if they are to thrive and raising them up accordingly, rather than trying to raise them while preserving their childishness.<br><br><a href=#c7148778744715436074 title="comment permalink">12/27/16, 11:50 AM</a><br><br>

I, for one, wouldn't mind seeing the end of romantic marriage in favor of good, old fashioned platonic or arranged marriage, whether straight or gay. I, for one, wouldn't mind seeing a return to Victorian or pre-Victorian norms whereby it's okay to step out on your spouse, but the marriage is sacrosanct and must be honored for life w/out severe social consequences. Today's obsession w/romantic love is bizarre, IMHO. I would like to see a return to "wed lock" without necessarily requiring a monogamy that never really existed the way people imagined it did. I would, however extend an egalitarian right for women to step out just as much as men, so long as they never, ever considered breaking the bonds of marriage. What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Besides, as social primates, humans don't really do monogamy well, though they probably can manage to stay married, given enough societal pressure.<br><br><a href=#c1628569407443780780 title="comment permalink">12/27/16, 3:03 PM</a><br><br>

While I'm hoping that we've shut the door on sexual puritanism for good, I'd be glad to see a resurgence of good, old-fashioned discretion, where there's a time and place for everything, and where one could indulge in anything privately, yet still have tasteful discretion about not discussing it with any and all.<br><br><a href=#c1619559444260431785 title="comment permalink">12/27/16, 5:09 PM</a><br><br>

(There are a lot of studies about this in the science of ethology, if you're interested, it's the science of how evolution guides behavior. It's all fascinating stuff.) Extramarital sex creates many risks in sexual relationships, including STD's and pregnancy outside of wedlock, which is why it has been taboo. Today, individuals are free to explore open relationships of all kinds (involving consenting adults), but once you step outside of the norms you encounter a territory with risks that aren't normally covered in the usual social narrative. Of course, that line is yours to cross, and you are free to do so. I know many people who have chosen this type of lifestyle, some happily, and some with ghastly unforeseen consequences. As with anything, when you step into the realm of the taboo, you walk alone. <br><br>Arranged marriages can work beautifully, but unfortunately, to build a society on arranged marriages, one of the most common ways to enforce the permanence of marriage to a stranger is to keep one of the sexes in a socially inferior position, and it's usually the woman. The majority of places that continue to arrange marriages hold women under strict laws. <br><br>The most interesting alternative to the traditional marriage I have found is called a walking marriage. Basically, families live in a matriarchy headed by the grandmother. All her descendants live with her. When couples pair up, the man goes to sleep in the woman's bedroom every night and then returns to his mother's house in the morning. All his work and the fruits of his labor go to raising his nieces and nephews. There is no marriage to speak of, if the relationship ends, he just stops spending the night. It has no affect on the children if the relationship ends, in fact there is no word for father. The "fathers" are the uncles. The family unit is based on blood ties with people you have known your whole life. That said, I don't see our culture changing in this direction any time soon, or ever, really. For our society, I agree we need to emphasize a stronger commitment to marriage. I think if people had more time at home to be together, instead of working hours of every day with strangers while your spouse works with other strangers and strangers raise your children in school, all our social bonds would be stronger and it might be a lot easier to be faithful to your spouse. I think all our social problems come from the drastic departure from the tribal life we evolved to live and the agrarian life we lived after that. This separated, mechanized way of life destroys social bonds of all kinds and replaces them with electronically mediated simulations of contact.<br><br><a href=#c4513631578834117132 title="comment permalink">12/28/16, 1:38 AM</a><br><br>

However, having been raised by hippies, I would say increasing promiscuity by itself solves nothing, and if you think that sex outside marriage would make staying married easier, I would say you're missing the big picture, and the urge for promiscuity is actually a symptom of a much bigger problem. Again, I think all these problems come from how far our society has deviated from the lives we evolved to live. We are changing the world faster than our DNA, bodies, hormones, brains, and cultures can keep up, and the social fabric is tearing apart as a result.<br><br><a href=#c4921368310240552730 title="comment permalink">12/28/16, 1:39 AM</a><br><br>

The rule could be each gluten-free, go to a certain school, spank, don't watch tv...you get the idea. The world is full of advice for parents. <br><br>What you quickly discover if you have two or more children, is how vastly different those children are despite coming from the same genetic parents and being raised in the same household. You also discover that they have a certain personality and internal drivers that as a parent you can shape slightly with a lot of effort, but at the core they are who they are. If you have a child who is emotionally, physically, or socially outside of the normal range for children, it will impact your family and marriage in ways you can not imagine. <br><br>Parents in this society are endlessly beat-up in the media and in conversation. People says things about parents that you could never say about any other group of people. Parents are human beings trying to do their best. It might not always look like that from outside. They have children who are very different from each other, little support from community (yet lots of judgement and condemnation), a government system which demands attention during all waking hours, and a specific performance expected. No wonder so many mothers specifically are on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety pills. Our society is driving parents crazy.<br><br>I was born in 1968. My mother left my brother and I, both under age 7, to play outside all day in the old manufacturing town we grew up in. The yards were found to be full of lead and other toxins decades later. We weren't allowed in the house except at dinner time. Sandwiches were handed out for lunch and we drank from the hose. When we moved to a suburban development, we were given a key to let ourselves in after school, ages under 9, make a snack, do our homework because both parents said they would not help with it, and do chores before 5pm. We then ate dinner and roamed the neighborhood until dark with the other children doing minor vandalism. <br><br>Any of that is cause for social services to come where we live and investigate these days. Perhaps it is different in poorer area of the country. But in suburban mostly white areas, leaving children alone or letting them roam will get you unwanted attention.<br><br><a href=#c2676253127640133516 title="comment permalink">12/28/16, 4:35 AM</a><br><br>

I tend to agree w/JMG that sex phobic norms reached a peak during the peak of Western industrial civilization and then went into decline thereafter, and the abandonment of sex phobia since the 70s is a result of industrial decline. There are plenty of sexual norms across societies besides traditional Western monogamy. The ancient Romans were very sexually open. As Bill has mentioned before, probably the optimum living arrangement for gay men would be a home of 5-10 guys. I could see where a homestead based on such an arrangement would be very successful.<br><br><a href=#c8342776141000176079 title="comment permalink">12/28/16, 1:40 PM</a><br><br>

We agree that many people in our society do not have “healthy” self-esteem, you feel that many people have too much self-esteem (an overly inflated sense of competence and self-worth) while I feel those same people actually lack self-esteem (I’m certainly not saying that they lack mental or emotional issues :).<br>We are in agreement that our society does a poor job with self-esteem by taking away the consequences of one’s actions and always telling young people that they are great no matter how they perform (trophies for everyone). If you believe that they are developing too much self-esteem from the way society is raising young people that implies that we are doing the correct things but too much of them. So if we just cut back on what we are doing and stop at the correct amount of self-esteem everyone would have “healthy” self-esteem. I.e. give out fewer “trophies”.<br>If you believe that society’s approach to self-esteem is fundamentally wrong, that indicates a very different course should be taken. I feel that the current approach is producing young people who lack “true” self-esteem but have given by society either a sense of entitlement or the knowledge that if they act with a strong sense of entitlement they will get away with whatever they want. You might see this as “artificial” self-esteem (or mental illness) taking the place of “true” self-esteem. They learn to act entitled but actually have a low sense of competence and low sense of self-worth. By always telling young people that they are doing great when they know they are not, we cause confusion. They are never quite sure how they are doing, because they hear they are great no matter how they act.<br>So I think we would agree that having young people live in a world where there are consequences for their actions, both good and bad, would help develop “healthy” self-esteem. It would allow them to earn that sense of competence and self-esteem and they would be much more mentally healthy and resilient.<br>Hope that my writing is adequate to get the idea across and gives some food for thought.<br>Thanks for all the thinking you’ve caused me to do.<br>Bob<br>http://www.InvestingWithNature.com<br><br><br><a href=#c8740799358025017562 title="comment permalink">12/29/16, 6:24 AM</a><br><br>

However, they are technologically simple societies in which child-rearing is still integrated with adult work and social life. One thing young animals do is imitate their elders, and the children in these societies grow up surrounded by adults working and getting along with each other. Furthermore, from toddlerhood, the children are given miniature versions of the adults' tools made to the same quality standards. That includes bows and arrows that shoot true, and any small creature that a little hunter brings down will be added to the family meal with appreciation just as an adult hunter's would be. There's also no really onerous work. Some is dangerous, and the young may be forbidden to participate until they reach a certain age, but there's none of the miserable backbreaking labor that you start to see with the invention of the animal-drawn plough. The work is pretty much all the kinds of activity that are widely practiced as hobbies in the industrialized world: hunting, fishing, gardening, crafts, etc. Children don't have to be forced to do it. <br><br>In a preschool classroom with ten three-year-olds for every adult, the kids will mostly end up imitating each other, and problematic behavior patterns that might have been the short-lived eccentricity of one kid can be multiplied and reinforced to the point where it may take years to eradicate. Simple immaturity can also be strongly reinforced. And the nuclear family home in which Mommy and one child are alone together pretty much all day is not much better. One way or another, we prevent children from learning their adults roles (or even appropriate social behavior) in the natural way of our earliest ancestors and then we have to beat it into them.<br><br><a href=#c5255547862500490344 title="comment permalink">12/29/16, 3:42 PM</a><br><br>
