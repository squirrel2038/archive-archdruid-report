<div class=MsoNormal>
A few days from now, 2016 will have passed into the history books. I know a fair number of people who won’t mourn its departure, but it’s pretty much a given that the New Year celebrations here in the United States, at least, will demonstrate a marked shortage of enthusiasm for the arrival of 2017.</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s good reason for that, and not just for the bedraggled supporters of Hillary Clinton’s failed and feckless presidential ambitions. None of the pressures that made 2016 a cratered landscape of failed hopes and realized nightmares have gone away. Indeed, many of them are accelerating, as the attempt to maintain a failed model of business as usual in the teeth of political, economic, and environmental realities piles blowback upon blowback onto the loading dock of the new year. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Before we get into that, though, I want to continue the annual <i>Archdruid Report</i> tradition and review the New Year’s predictions that I made at the beginning of 2016. Those of my readers who want to review the original post will find it <a href=../../2016/01/down-ratholes-of-future.html>here</a>. Here’s the gist. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Thus my core prediction for 2016 is that all the things that got worse in 2015 will keep on getting worse over the year to come. The ongoing depletion of fossil fuels and other nonrenewable resources will keep squeezing the global economy, as the real (i.e., nonfinancial) costs of resource extraction eat up more and more of the world’s total economic output, and this will drive drastic swings in the price of energy and commodities—currently those are still headed down, but they’ll soar again in a few years as demand destruction completes its work. The empty words in Paris a few weeks ago will do nothing to slow the rate at which greenhouse gases are dumped into the atmosphere, raising the economic and human cost of climate-related disasters above 2015’s ghastly totals—and once again, the hard fact that leaving carbon in the ground means giving up the lifestyles that depend on digging it up and burning it is not something that more than a few people will be willing to face. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Meanwhile, the US economy will continue to sputter and stumble as politicians and financiers try to make up for ongoing declines in real (i.e., nonfinancial) wealth by manufacturing paper wealth at an even more preposterous pace than before, and frantic jerryrigging will keep the stock market from reflecting the actual, increasingly dismal state of the economy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We’re already in a steep economic downturn, and it’s going to get worse over the year to come, but you won’t find out about that from the mainstream media, which will be full of the usual fact-free cheerleading; you’ll have to watch the rates at which the people you know are being laid off and businesses are shutting their doors instead.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s almost superfluous to point out that I called it. It’s been noted with much irritation by other bloggers in what’s left of the peak oil blogosphere that it takes no great talent to notice what’s going wrong, and point out that it’s just going to keep on heading the same direction. This I cheerfully admit—but it’s also relevant to note that this method produces accurate predictions. Meanwhile, the world-saving energy breakthroughs, global changes in consciousness, sudden total economic collapses, and other events that get predicted elsewhere year after weary year have been notable by their absence. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I quite understand why it’s still popular to predict these things: after all, they allow people to pretend that they can expect some future other than the one they’re making day after day by their own actions. Nonetheless, the old saying remains true—“if you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you’ve always gotten”—and I wonder how many of the people who spend each year daydreaming about the energy breakthroughs, changes in consciousness, economic collapses, et al, rather than coming to grips with the rising spiral of crises facing industrial civilization, really want to deal with the future that they’re storing up for themselves by indulging in this habit. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s go on, though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>At the beginning of 2016, I also made four specific predictions, which I admitted at the time were long shots. One of those, specific prediction #3, was that the most likely outcome of the 2016 presidential election would be the inauguration of Donald Trump as President in January 2017. I don’t think I need to say much about that, as it’s already been discussed here at length.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The only thing I’d like to point out here is that much of the Democratic party seems to be fixated on finding someone or something to blame for the debacle, other than the stark incompetence of the Clinton campaign and the failure of Democrats generally to pay attention to anything outside the self-referential echo chambers of affluent liberal opinion. If they keep it up, it’s pretty much a given that Trump will win reelection in 2020. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The other three specific long-shot predictions didn’t pan out, at least not in the way that I anticipated, and it’s only fair—and may be helpful, as we head further into the unknown territory we call 2017—to talk about what didn’t happen, and why. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Specific prediction #1 was that the next tech bust would be under way by the end of 2016.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s happening, but not in the way I expected. Back in January I was looking at the maniacally overinflated stock prices of tech companies that have never made a cent in profit and have no meaningful plans to do so, and I expected a repeat of the “tech wreck” of 2000. The difficulty was simply I didn’t take into account the most important economic shift between 2000 and 2016—the de facto policy of negative interest rates being pursued by the Federal Reserve and certain other central banks. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That policy’s going to get a post of its own one of these days, because it marks the arrival of a basic transformation in economic realities that’s as incomprehensible to neoliberal economists as it will be challenging to most of the rest of us. The point I want to discuss here here, though, is a much simpler one. Whenever real interest rates are below zero, those elite borrowers who can get access to money on those terms are being paid to borrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Among many other things, this makes it a lot easier to stretch out the downward arc of a failing industry. Cheaper-than-free money is one of the main things that kept the fracking industry from crashing and burning from its own unprofitability once the price of oil plunged in 2013; there’s been a steady string of bankruptcies in the fracking industry and the production of oil from fracked wells has dropped steadily, but it wasn’t the crash many of us expected. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same thing is happening, in equally slow motion, with the current tech bubble. Real estate prices in San Francisco and other tech hotspots are sliding, overpaid tech employees are being systematically replaced by underpaid foreign workers, the numbers are looking uglier by the week, but the sudden flight of investment money that made the “tech wreck” so colorful sixteen years ago isn’t happening, because tech firms can draw on oceans of relatively cheap funding to turn the sudden popping of the tech bubble into the slow hiss of escaping air. That doesn’t mean that the boom-and-bust cycle has been cancelled—far from it—but it does mean that shoveling bad money after good has just become a lot easier. Exactly how that will impact the economy is a very interesting question that nobody just now knows how to answer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s move on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Specific prediction #2 was that the marketing of what would inevitably be called “the PV revolution” would get going in a big way in 2016. Those of my readers who’ve been watching the peak oil scene for more than a few years know that ever since the concept of peak oil clawed its way back out of its long exile in the wilderness of the modern imagination, one energy source after anobter has been trotted out as the reason du jour why the absurdly extravagant lifestyles of today’s privileged classes can roll unhindered into the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I figured, based on the way that people in the mainstream environmentalist movement were closing ranks around renewables, that photovoltaic solar energy would be the next beneficiary of that process, and would take off in a big way as the year proceeded.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That this didn’t happen is not the fault of the solar PV industry or its cheerleades in the green media. Naomi Oreskes’ strident insistence a while back that raising questions about the economic viability of renewable energy is <a href=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/16/new-form-climate-denialism-dont-celebrate-yet-cop-21 target=_blank>just another form of climate denialism</a> seems to have become the party line throughout the privileged end of the green left, and the industrialists are following suit. Elon Musk, whose entire industrial empire has been built on lavish federal subsidies, is back at the feed trough again, announcing a grandiose new plan to manufacture photovoltaic roof shingles; he’s far and away the most colorful of the would-be renewable-energy magnates, but others are elbowing their way toward the trough as well, seeking their own share of the spoils.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The difficulty here is twofold. First, the self-referential cluelessness of the Democratic party since the 2008 election has had the inevitable blowback—something like 1000 state and federal elective offices held by Democrats after that election are held by Republicans today—and the GOP’s traditional hostility toward renewable energy has put a lid on the increased subsidies that would have been needed to kick a solar PV feeding frenzy into the same kind of overdrive we’ve already seen with ethanol and wind. Solar photovoltaic power, like ethanol from corn, has a disastrously low energy return on energy invested—as Pedro Prieto and Charles Hall showed in their 2015 study of real-world data from Spain’s solar PV program, the EROEI on large-scale grid photovoltaic power works out in practice to less than 2.5—and so, like nuclear power, it’s only economically viable if it’s propped up by massive and continuing subsidies. Lacking those, the “PV revolution” is dead in the water. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second point, though, is the more damaging.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The “recovery” after the 2008-2009 real estate crash was little more than an artifact of statistical manipulation, and even negative interest rates haven’t been able to get a heartbeat going in the economy’s prostrate body. As most economic measurements not subject to fiddling by the enthusiastic accountants of the federal government slide steadily downhill, the economic surplus needed to support any kind of renewables buildout at all is rapidly tricking away. Demand destruction is in the driver’s seat, and the one way of decreasing fossil fuel consumption that affluent environmentalists don’t want to talk about—conservation—is the only viable option just now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Specific prediction #4 was that the Saudi regime in Arabia would collapse by the end of 2016. As I noted at the time, the replacement of the Saudi monarchy with some other form of government is for all practical purposes a done deal. Of the factors I cited then—the impending bankruptcy of a regime that survives only by buying off dissent with oil money, the military quagmires in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq that have the Saudi military and its foreign mercenaries bogged down inextricably, and the rest of it—none have gone away. Nor has the underlying cause, the ongoing depletion of the once-immense oil reserves that have propped up the Saudi state so far. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That said, as I noted back in January, it’s anyone’s guess what cascade of events will send the Saudi royal family fleeing to refuges overseas while mobs rampage through their abandoned palaces in Riyadh, and some combination of mid-level military officers and Muslim clerics piece together a provisional government in their absence. I thought that it was entirely possible that this would happen in 2016, and of course it didn’t. It’s possible at this point that the price of oil could rise fast enough to give the Saudi regime another lease on life, however brief. That said, the winds are changing across the Middle East; the Russian-Iranian alliance is in the ascendant, and the Saudis have very few options left. It will be interesting, in the sense of the apocryphal Chinese curse, to see how long they survive. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So that’s where we stand, as 2016 stumbles down the ramp into time’s slaughterhouse and 2017 prepares to take its place in the ragged pastures of history. What can we expect in the year ahead? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To some extent, I’ve already answered that question—but only to some extent. Most of the factors that drove events in 2016 are still in place, still pressing in the same direction, and “more of the same” is a fair description of the consequences. Day after day, the remaining fossil fuel reserves of a finite planet are being drawn down to maintain the extravagant and unsustainable lifestyles of the industrial world’s more privileged inmates. Those remaining reserves are increasingly dirty, increasingly costly to extract and process, increasingly laden with a witch’s brew of social, economic, and environmental costs that nobody anywhere is willing to make the fossil fuel industry cover, and those costs don’t go away just because they’re being ignored—they pile up in society, the economy, and the biosphere, producing the rising tide of systemic dysfunction that plays so large and unmentioned a role in daily life today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus we can expect still more social turmoil, more economic instability, and more environmental blowback in 2017. The ferocious populist backlash against the economic status quo that stunned the affluent in Britain and America with the Brexit vote and Trump’s presidential victory respectively, isn’t going away until and unless the valid grievances of the working classes get heard and addressed by political establishments around the industrial world; to judge by examples so far, that’s unlikely to happen any time soon. At the same time, the mismatch between the lifestyles we can afford and the lifestyles that too many of us want to preserve remains immense, and until that changes, the global economy is going to keep on lurching from one crisis to another. Meanwhile the biosphere is responding to the many perturbations imposed on it by human stupidity in the way that systems theory predicts—with ponderous but implacable shifts toward new conditions, many of which don’t augur well for the survival of industrial society. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are wild cards in the deck, though, and one of them is being played right now over the North Pole. As I write this, air temperatures over the Arctic ice cap are <a href=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2016/12/gauis-publius-north-pole-50-degrees-warmer-than-normal-in-december.html target=_blank>50<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>°</span>F warmer than usual</a> for this time of year. A destabilized jet stream is sucking masses of warm air north into the Arctic skies, while pushing masses of Arctic air down into the temperate zone. As a result, winter ice formation on the surface of the Arctic ocean has dropped to levels tht were apparently last seen before our species got around to evolving—and a real possibility exists, though it’s by no means a certainty yet, that next summer could see most of the Arctic Ocean free of ice. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nobody knows what that will do to the global climate. The climatologists who’ve been trying to model the diabolically complex series of cascading feedback loops we call “global climate” have no clue—they have theories and computer models, but so far their ability to predict the rate and consequences of anthropogenic climate change have not exactly been impressive. (For what it’s worth, by the way, most of their computer models have turned out to be far too conservative in their predictions.) Nobody knows yet whether the soaring temperatures over the North Pole this winter are a fluke, a transitory phenomenon driven by the unruly transition between one climate regime and another, or the beginning of a recurring pattern that will restore the north coast of Canada to the conditions it had during the Miocene, when crocodiles sunned themselves on the warm beaches of northern Greenland. We simply don’t know. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the same way, the populist backlash mentioned above is a wild card whose effects nobody can predict just now. The neoliberal economics that have been welded into place in the industrial world for the last thirty years have failed comprehensively, that’s clear enough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The abolition of barriers to the flow of goods, capital, and population did not bring the global prosperity that neoliberal economists promised, and now the bill is coming due. The question is what the unraveling of the neoliberal system means for national economies in the years ahead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are people—granted, these are mostly neoliberal economists and those who’ve drunk rather too freely of the neoliberal koolaid—who insist that the abandonment of the neoliberal project will inevitably mean economic stagnation and contraction. There are those who insist that the abandonment of the neoliberal project will inevitably mean a return to relative prosperity here in the US, as offshored jobs are forced back stateside by tax policies that penalize imports, and the US balance of trade reverts to something a little closer to parity. The fact of the matter is that nobody knows what the results will be. Here as in Britain, voters faced with a choice between the perpetuation of an intolerable status quo and a leap in the dark chose the latter, and the consequences of that leap can’t be known in advance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Other examples abound. The US president-elect has claimed repeatedly that the US under his lead will get out of the regime-change business and pursue a less monomaniacally militaristic foreign policy than the one it’s pursued under Bush and Obama, and would have pursued under Clinton. The end of the US neoconservative consensus is a huge change that will send shockwaves through the global political system. Another change, at least as huge, is the rise of Russia as a major player in the Middle East. Another? The remilitarization of Japan and its increasingly forceful pursuit of political and military alliances in East and South Asia. There are others. The familiar order of global politics is changing fast. What will the outcome be? Nobody knows. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As 2017 dawns, in a great many ways, modern industrial civilization has flung itself forward into a darkness where no stars offer guidance and no echoes tell what lies ahead. I suspect that when we look back at the end of this year, the predictable unfolding of ongoing trends will have to be weighed against sudden discontinuities that nobody anywhere saw coming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We’re not discussing the end of the world, of course; we’re talking events like those that can be found repeated many times in the histories of other failing civilizations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That said, my guess is that some of those discontinuities are going to be harsh ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Those who brace themselves for serious trouble and reduce their vulnerabilities to a brittle and dysfunctional system will be more likely to come through in one piece. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br>
Those who are about to celebrate the end of 2016, in other words, might want to moderate their cheering when it’s over. It’s entirely possible that 2017 will turn out to be rather worse—despite which I hope that the readers of this blog, and the people they care about, will manage to have a happy New Year anyway.</div>

The Republican governor of this otherwise Democrat-ruled state vetoed a bill in effect requiring continued subsidies for PV, and so the SRECs (Solar Renewable Energy Credits) generated by my rooftop solar system, that I sold for $120 each in early 2016, I can expect to sell for about $15 each in early 2017.<br><br>2.

I have been watching it ever since the record low in 2012, and every year brings new reasons to be concerned, or as in the case this month, downright disturbed. If I may hazard a prediction of my own (I hope it's not too soon). I expect a record low for arctic sea ice this year, but not an ice free arctic. I would also like to predict that whatever year the arctic hits the milestone definition of "ice free", it will not suddenly inspire society to stop emitting greenhouse gases as some people believe. Unfortunately, I think a lot of people will just shake their heads in shame at our governments not fixing the problem and then go back to emitting their own greenhouse gases as usual. As for your other predictions, I think you were right more often than you were wrong, and I think we have no reason to expect the trajectory to change any time soon, unfortunately. I hope you continue to inspire your readers to make the necessary changes in their own lives that will build resilience, because resilience is what we really need in the face of our increasingly uncertain world.

Priceless! Since you brought up neoliberal economists, perhaps, I may say, the rumors of their death have been exaggerated. I just finished Philip Mirowski's book, "Never Let a Serious Crisis Go To Waste," which is a description of how these same neoliberal economists came through the crash of 2008 unscathed and are likely to continue doing so. I recommend it, though it's dense, academic writing. If you have a grounding in the work of Leo Strauss and the Chicago School of economics, and Ronald Coase, you may have an easier time. I'm just beginning Kingsnorth's "The Wake." Quite a change of pace!

The other 2/3 of the Chinese population have a lifestyle more in line with that of developing countries. (Wouldn't you say developing country is a misnomer indicative of the religion of progress?) The breakdown of the population by economic status in India is comparable to China. Correct me if I'm wrong in this generalization.

In fact, I am Filipino and am based in the Philippines, full-time.<br><br>I make just a tad under US$30,000 a year. If you compare that to the latest data from Silicon Valley, where the interns (!) make the equivalent of $68,000, it really does appear that I'm underpaid. However, considering that real GDP per capita of the Philippines is $3,000, by this measure I am pretty wealthy and I do consider myself quite wealthy both by contemporary but especially by historical standards.<br><br>It's not really that we're underpaid. Most of the tech industry is just an elaborate pyramiding scam. The so-called tech Unicorns (startups with a "valuation" of $1B or over), are exactly that; they are legendary creatures that serve to tell the mythical story of American Progress and Innovation. Big consultancy firms like Accenture, Oracle, IBM, and so on, scam governments and corporations out of billions of dollars as they do what is basically reinventing the wheel (except with more bugs).<br><br>$30k goes pretty far, actually, since you can live fairly small around here. Unfortunately, it's starting to become more common that folks with that kind of money (and more!) live paycheck-to-paycheck, trying to live Western lifestyles. Y'know, multiple car, way too huge house, quarterly foreign vacations...<br><br>I wish we're half as innovative as we say we are. Skills and competence in tech pretty much have zero correlation with rank and salary, just like in government or academia. There is little incentive for industry professionals to improve, since you can get a 20%, 50%, or 100% pay bump by simply jumping between jobs. according to McConnell's "Code Complete", folks read less than one trade or industry-related book <i>annually</i>. My actual experience screening candidates for interviews bear this out; I've encountered junior guys who have built some pretty impressive stuff and "senior" guys who literally couldn't program a multiplication table.<br><br>Everyone is motivated by greed. Big companies buy up smaller ones in order to eliminate competition. Small companies are created, not to make profit, but in order to exist long enough so that their founders can "exit" (i.e. sell out to the Big Guys) and retire in some tropical paradise.<br><br>I've read about your blog posts complaining about how technology has become unnecessarily complicated and yet less useful with every new version. I am embarrassed to admit that this is all true. More parallels between tech and government here; just as the solution to bad bureaucracy is more bureaucracy, the solution to bad tech is even more tech.

Am. bubble bursts such as US education or auto loans.<br>I believe house prices have topped out and are now decreasing in Vancouver, New York, San Francisco and London. I don't know about Sydney. A global stagnation quite likely, but I don't think it qualifies as a full-bore recession. US stock market crash? Not a lasting one. Yes, there have been bankruptcies in oil and gas this year. China's economic problems have continued, and I believe corporate debt and insolvent lenders are continuing to worsen, but I don't have reliable data, so who really knows. Unspecified big trouble... most of this was political, or very closely related to political ie. Brexit, Trump's win, Venezuela's food riots. Sales of new autos has started decreasing in the US, and GM and Ford have cut jobs. Sub-prime auto loan delinquencies have risen.<br><br>So overall, I'd say reasonable on the 1st prediction even if a lot of it is happening below the radar of the mainstream media.<br><br>2)Trudeau will break more election promises to middle class people than to wealthy ones/corporations.<br><br>Given how long it has been taking to get the ball started rolling on legalizing marijuana and changing the first past the post electoral system, plus his okaying the Kinder-Morgan pipeline and failure to change problematic parts of Bill C-51 (related to CSIS, privacy and spying on citizens), I'd say I called this one.<br><br>3) Canada will run a deficit.<br><br>The liberals budgeted for a deficit, and it looks like it will be bigger than predicted due to poor economic growth this year.<br><br>4)Refugee crisis will continue and will cause worse problems in Europe this year than last.<br><br>I honestly don't know what will happen with ISIS and the wars in the Middle-East, other than they aren't over yet. The USA will lose some influence and Saudi Arabia's probs are likely to worsen.<br><br>The refugee crisis has continued, and continued to cause problems. I don't know that they are any worse than last year. There have been fewer migrants due to Europe refusing to let them in, but there has probably been as much or more in the way of social disruption and societal angst related to those already present.<br><br>Well, I'd say that the US has continued losing influence in the Middle-East, and the wars there continue still. Saudi Arabia's problems continue, and they have run a deficit in 2016 as well as 2015. They're still fighting in Yemen, too.<br><br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c5936349409735899803 title="comment permalink">12/28/16, 7:48 PM</a><br><br>

We have had snow and cold for most of December, and it looks like another cold wave is in store for next week; all due to the sagging jet stream bringing down Siberian pleasures. The great result is that the growing snowpack is good for the salmon stocks. This is an odd year, but also a bit of a return to normal. 40 years ago my friends used to skate down the river that I now live on, in fact, all the way to the salt chuck. Despite the tide changes, it was common enough. In the forties, people would drive trucks across lakes that have not frozen over for the last 75 years. I have lived on this river for the last 13 years and have seen it freeze over only 2-3 times. In turn the ice broke up with every tide change and a squirrel would drown trying to cross.<br><br>I am very worried about climate change and we have adjusted our lifestyle to at least pay lip service to the concept. Air travel is a thing of the past for us, and our last trip south was 17 years ago. We do what we can, but I am afraid AGW will only be accepted after a few more Katrinas or more drastice summer flooding in southern US.<br><br>My prediction is an economic and geo-political S%!t storm beginning in 2017 which will turn the finger pointing at Trump. I also predict much unrest in the US, with increasing violence and crackdowns as our southern Neighbour edges deeper into Police State. I do not think Trump will make it to the next election and the remainder of his term will be served out by Mike Pence. Why? He will be removed by the powerful, one way or another.<br><br>Regards, and all the best.

It just recently became available in English, and I think it would be of great interest to you and to readers of this blog. It's a visceral depiction of what real lived experience was like in a time of material and mythological crisis, which for a relatively privileged millennial American like me is absolutely indispensable. It really drives home some of the points you've made in your last few posts and I'm sure you'd find it interesting if you haven't read it already.

One lesson I learned from the weirder side of my education is that, as the traditional saying has it, the planes are discrete rather than continuous; if you want to make something happen in the realm of ordinary sensory experience, you need to be ready to do stuff with matter and energy; if you want to make something happen in some other realm, you need to get to work with the tools and substances appropriate to that plane. It does seem to work...<br><br>Doctor W., many thanks for the link! I'm delighted to see people picking up the gauntlet I flung down with <i>Green Wizardry</i>, and talking about their own experience with appropriate tech -- and it's good to see that continuing. <br><br>John, stick to your guns. Seems to me that you're doing the right thing -- and I bet you learn a lot from the coyotes. <br><br>NomadicBeer, yep. Magic is powerful, and stunning historical ignorance is more powerful still. I suspect that the only thing in their heads when they think of Barack Obama is an image of how warm and fuzzy his victory made them feel in 2008. Sigh...<br><br>Shane, keep at it! <br><br>Tower, good heavens. Hmm. I'll have to think about that. <br><br>Shane, don't hold your breath.<br><br>Ian, thank you. It's really fairly simple, actually. I really, truly don't believe in progress. I don't believe that humanity is any more important in the great scheme of things than, say, jellyfish, or club mosses, or trilobites, or the living things that will emerge on this planet long after our species is gone. Once you embrace that recognition -- not as something to shudder at, but as the simple reality of things -- the fall of a civilization is no more troubling than the coming of winter or the gradual waning of each of our lives. It's simply part of the natural cycle of things, and once you grasp that, you can get on with your life, knowing that the historical weather is going to be kind of rough and planning accordingly, without getting stressed out about it. <br><br>Mr. G, all of those seem entirely plausible to me. <br><br>Dylan, congrats on getting the story published, and on your memetic engineering. I'll be interested to watch how the slow deflation of the tech bubble proceeds. <br><br>Juandonjuan, I wonder if Musk bought the patents from Dow because he knows he's better at hunting down subsidies than they are. <br><br>Ray, exactly. Yes, that's the broader context for interest rates -- the interest rate minus the rate of inflation is a good approximation for the level of real growth in a society, and when it's negative, that society is contracting. You're right, too, that no modern economy can deal with the kind of sustained contraction in which every investment on average loses money.

If we are all spiritual beings primarily, in material incarnation to learn a series of lessons, then we're not going to be spared those lessons just because we don't happen to like the experience.

What that says to me is that you, and others who insist on a flat journalistic style, underestimate both the intelligence of the internet's readership and the desire that many people have for prose that has some flavor, some complexity, and some richness. <br><br>So thank you, but no thank you -- I'll continue to write the way I like to write, for the people who like to read it, and if that doesn't please you, why, there are thousands of other blogs on the internet that write the way you prefer.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c7573514989215344352 title="comment permalink">12/28/16, 10:48 PM</a><br><br>

In the course of his duties, he occasionally spotted a wolf lurking on the periphery of his flock.Each time he dutifully brought this to the attention of the relevant authorities in the village, and each time they failed to see any wolves. This caused them to be quite rude and even abusive to the poor boy. Feeling very under appreciated and his self esteem quite bruised, he moved to the city and ended all contact with his friends and relations in the village.<br>In the city he became a stock broker, specializing in shares of Beyond Predators. He was very bullish on sheep and, especially with money at zero percent or less and the land being an externality, he advised his clients to buy as many sheep as they could.<br>He now wore Armani suits and had very expensive haircuts, drove a Porsche and dated all the prettiest girls at the office.<br>If any of his clients ever asked about wolves, he said, as far as he knew, they were extinct, and even if they weren't, Beyond Predators had the bet hunters in the business.<br>In the meantime, the village had acquired a new shepherd.Occasionally a sheep or two would go missing, but the shepherd and the village elders reckoned that they must have got sick and died or wandered off and got lost. The loss wasn't that great and their other investments were doing well, so they didn't worry.<br>Sometimes after a long night partying or too much coke, the old shepherd turned stock broker would have visions or nightmares of wolves, but in his lucid moments he reckoned: what the hell, I have a mansion and bunker in a gated community with a couple of years worth of tinned food and gold bars and a staff of loyal guards.

I am an old-timer in the computer and software industry and I could not agree more with you as I watch layer upon layer of software being built to address limitations of other layers of software while the complexity of architectures reach mind-bending levels while offering little benefits. Often the new layers of software recreate abstractions already designed during the 80s and 90s in a much less efficient way (most brilliant tech was subverted by Microsoft in the usual way: getting into the tech committee as a member then subtly changing it generating "dialects" and incompatibility then using the commercial weight to destroy the standards). Tech was often designed as useful and simple, then subverted for power and control. <br>Here we are: the messed up and dysfunctional software battlescape is the result of 30 years of fighting for the minds of developers and users and drive them to use one half-designed technology or the other. The result is that knowledge of the overall architecture has disappeared and developers often recreate parts that exist already at different levels in the architecture much less efficiently (websockets! everything is going full circle! just because system managers dont want to change firewalls!).<br>I feel the whole mess is cracking under its own weight. And the same is going to be true with every information system subverted by business interests (science.. when 5% published is untrue it all becomes suspect and worthless).<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c915229739747950520 title="comment permalink">12/29/16, 2:13 AM</a><br><br>

Since he has pretty much summed up my initial thoughts, let me push them in a different direction:<br><br>The theory behind negative rates is that it will induce people to spend their shrinking savings and then take up credit in order to subscribe for some free money. It will not work (for very long), as it amounts to a promise of 'jam tomorrow': you part with your savings now, but the free money does not materialise until very late in the repayment schedule (in the form of a forced saving, which is a very damaging phenomenon in its own right) - and in the meantime you do need to make those monthly repayments, or else. The first politician of note to mention it on live television will be universally vilified by the mainstream media, but we have already seen what happens to politicians universally vilified by the mainstream media... ;) Here's hoping that such a politician also proposes a constructive response - for example, to let money shrink into irrelevance and to build a cooperative movement instead. I suspect that NIRP and co-ops can coexist perpetually in perfect harmony.<br><br>It also strikes me how the transition from positive to negative interest rates is similar to a transition from fossil to renewable energy sources. In both cases you take an existing stock of concentrated wealth (savings/fossil fuels) and replace it with a stream of diffuse wealth (total repayments lower than principal borrowed/various forms of converting sunlight into fuels), and declare them to be equivalent. They are not of course, and it's a difference in kind not just in degree.<br><br>MigrantWorker<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c2585744564291460960 title="comment permalink">12/29/16, 2:28 AM</a><br><br>

Many people who came together in the campaign had/have incompatible outcomes in mind - it's a virtual guarantee that a sizable minority are going to feel cheated when they get what they thought they had voted for, and find it isn't at all what they had expected.<br><br>The UK govt seem to be handling it badly - on the one hand insisting the 'will of the people' gives them a clear mandate, but on the other being very unclear about how they will apply it.<br><br>It all reminds me of a fractious family outing - just over half the family ('a landslide', ahem...) wanted to go out, so the whole family has to go. Those who wanted to stay home sit sulking in the back seats whilst the others tell them to shut up and stop moaning. Meanwhile, it dawns on everyone that they haven't yet decided where to go to. Everyone pipes up with suggestions, but the driver now tells everyone to shut up as it's the driver's decision alone, whilst insisting that the expressed will of the family to move is what gives the driver that authority to decide, and it would be a very betrayal of the passengers to listen to their suggestions for possible destinations.<br><br>There will be the usual litanies of 'are we there yet?', a good deal of motion sickness and incessant fighting over who reads the map. The driver refuses to reveal the destination, but insists everyone will love it once they arrive - yes, those who wanted to stay home, those who wanted to go the seaside and those who wanted to head into the mountains...<br><br>The question is, when the disillusionment sets in, will the reaction be a turning back or a doubling down on the anger???<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c5135920923629845844 title="comment permalink">12/29/16, 4:23 AM</a><br><br>

The percentage of the world in violent conflict continues to decline or stays roughly the same. My basis for this prediction is the Limits to Growth Earth3 model.<br>5. Arctic ice cap disappears. Trump makes the polar bears pay for their own relocation program. <br>6. At least one prominent person in Silicon Valley recognizes the limits of technology for controlling and guiding human behavior. <br>7. Trump closes all American embassies, offers to do all diplomatic work through his personal Twitter account. <br>8.

I've read they may dwarf those of Saudi Arabia and that they could come on line available as soon as 2020. I've also read that while all eyes have been on the mideast, last fall Obama surreptitiously increased our military activity in Somalia. That's concurrent with the ICJ case between Somalia and Kenya to figure out who owns what.<br><br>Re: negative interest rates, in an interview not long ago Bannon made that part of the economic strategy he intends to push for. I do remember reading a couple years back, they tried that in Europe. Doesn't seem to have bailed them out, although in the article I saw they interviewed a woman who had an negative interest rate on some loan (mortgage? I forget now) so she was actually getting a little $$ monthly from it. Definitely strikes me as a hail Mary pass...<br><br>On Climate Change, it's taken a scary turn for me in recent months. We've been in a drought for 2 years now at my place. It wasn't until September of this year, when we had 0 rain all month, that I discovered the entire New England coast, from the Mass cape and islands to Bar Harbor, Maine, it has reached extreme/exceptional levels. I was conserving water all spring and summer. Other than the 1st 2 weeks after planting, I stopped watering the garden at all, did the "if it's yellow let it mellow" with the toilet, reduced showers to every other day at most, etc.. I did give parts of the pasture an assist at critical points. I always collect drinking water for the horses off the roof, as long as there's some rain to collect. Still, at the end of September, my well started drawing sandy, silty water. So I kicked into high gear, stopped using the well altogether, drove every other day to the pond up the road to bring water in for the horses, driving 10 miles to a public spring to bring drinking water home for the rest of us laundering out, showers reduced to once/week maximum, and replaced the toilet with woods except middle of the night emergencies. This continued for nearly 2 months. Fortunately October and November both got average levels of rain. I allowed myself to return to using my well water once things froze outside. <br><br>I watch my swale levels, the local pond, and the water flow at the spring (which filled 8 bottles in 30 minutes when I 1st started collecting and jumped to 9 bottles in 10 minutes once we'd had 5" of rain) to get an idea of the water table levels. I believe I have enough to get through winter and into spring. If we continue to get average precip over the winter, we should be out of it by then; time will tell. Meantime, I'm back to "if its mellow," and have upped my limit to 2 showers/week.<br><br>The hardest part I found getting used to was the constant sense of grimy dirtiness, since all cleaning was at a minimum...<br><br>Anyway, happy new year and thank you for your continued insight!<br>Cheers,<br>Mary<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c1284494717743338816 title="comment permalink">12/29/16, 5:48 AM</a><br><br>

Nothing much can be done about SJWs except ignore them until such time as their own constituencies decide they want more effective, sensible and pragmatic leaders and spokespersons. I think the Democratic Party has begun its own long decline into irrelevance at this point. As for the Republicans, they can win elections, but they can't govern. I suspect that the major and most effective obstruction of Mr. Trump's policies is likely to come from within his own party. We have already seen the Speaker of the House defy the President-elect over a made in America requirement for purchase of no less important a commodity than steel. Is Mr. Ryan being bribed by Chinese interests? Who knows? Our media would rather chase after imaginary Russian spying.<br><br>There is clearly a news blackout in the USA regarding Arctic shipping.

This is partially inspired by last weeks discussion of the deserving poor.<br><br>First when thrown into a situation where I have no idea what to do I always tell my self "It is very unlikely that this will kill me." Or something to the effect. This shuts up the 'panic' voice well enough, and means that entirely petty concerns (I'm hungry, I'm cold, A drunk guy tried to pee on me, Where's my $20, My knee hurts, I have a cough) need not be overwhelming. Also it makes things more interesting, you can treat each situation with curiosity and and a sense of adventure. This also ties into a sense of worldly detachment, accepting and being unphased by the fact that most things are totally out of your control, which functionally make them more interesting. <br><br>Also, the main challenges when being in a situation where you are not in control are internal. This is hard to see in a reflection, but easy enough to see in others, judgement working as it does. I think the old concept of 'deserving poor' might need reworked for our era because of the moral baggage that has built up around 'deserving'. But still for each person they have internal definition which defines what situations they can make the best of and which are toxic. Learning this about yourself is very valuable, but usually very awkward.<br><br>Deserving and Undeserving poor are not two categories that folks can be sorted into. Instead each person has a unique range of things that they can draw real benefit from and things that will only exacerbate existing internal problems. Considering some of the homebums I used to hang out with, there was a truly productive way to be kind and civil with each and every one of them. But of course several had emotional patterns such that I wouldn't trust them to be invited to one of the organic farms where I volunteered.<br><br>If you end up in a dire situation where you need help, it is important to know what kinds of help with feed your virtues, and what will mostly nurture your vices. For instant I can be indulgent, and being offered too much comfort is not a benefit to me, but there are people I know who need comfort offered to them to keep them hale. Hopefully you won't be forced int ot wandering with home bums, but these things are true if you need to help a friend or family member who is forced outside of their comfort zone. Helping others invokes help for yourself when it is needed, so do it, but don't be exploited or feed vices. Learning to read others is the skill which cuts the costs of helping and reaps the rewards. Beyond kin and kith, it also radiates to the power to benefit community if you are well positioned, that is to say if you have noble oblige. Nietzsche says that generosity is one of the hardest skills, this seems true to me, if you are in a place to help others, being able to determine what help they can receive is a subtle thing. For resilience first learn what help you can receive.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c2644693326937840018 title="comment permalink">12/29/16, 9:10 AM</a><br><br>

There was about a month where I was homeless in the Bay area, and a few of those days I was allowed to crash at another house of the same kind as Ghost Ship. The Music Box. It was a early or mid 20th century house, very big, I would say just a couple notches under the cusp of being a mansion. But it had aged hard. There were a couple dozen young crusty types living there mixed with a few professionals who enjoyed the anarchic scene. The main living room had super high ceiling and eacn of the four corners had bunk beds built to the ceiling, a few people paid extra to have one of the relatively small bed rooms in the up stairs, mostly couples. There was anarchy and punk rock scene stuff all over the place, and music equipment of all kinds. I remember some young ladies that operated a Food not Bombs homeless feed out of the kitchen. It feed homeless in Oakland and also feed to massive appetite of the them germinating Occupy Protests. <br><br>Once I passed muster with a couple of the Alpha dudes and gals I was welcome to crash for free, by virtue of socializing smoothly and offering what help I was capable of when I noticed someone working on something. In my last post I said that remembering that you will probably survive is essential, but obviously this scene was every bit as much of a fire hazard as the next squat, and there is some dice rolling going on. If you can function with sobriety your survival chances go way way up should something go wrong.<br><br>As far as I could tell there were many many many housing arrangements like The Ghost Ship or the Music Box. Some were of the Anarchist scene I visited, but even the techno nerds have such haunts. I visited a very entertaining building that have a main room which had once been a 30 foot high parking bay... you know a big big room. They had filled it with a scaffolding made of 2" steel pipe arranged into 5'*5'*5' cubic grid, and decorated with printed pictures of he blocks from the old Mario games. It was a vast jungle gym for climbing and also hosted a number of sleeping nooks. It is astonishing just how much is happening in any given block of urban space. And actually impressive how few tragic events happen.<br><br>Sorry for being all over the map here, but this brings to mind a comment from the friend who long ago introduced me to ADR. There are a lot of feasible adaptations to the limits of our time, in principle. The most difficult and brutal limit is the limit of our cultures ability to imagine and implement them.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c7416112496911606839 title="comment permalink">12/29/16, 9:54 AM</a><br><br>

"We believe Obama will be recognized as the best president ever".<br><br>This is a perfect, real-life illustration of something that I have been trying to articulate to myself under the general question of, What the heck just happened to people? This bizarre disconnect you describe at least confirms that I am not imaging that a lot of people have just slipped down a notch in something very like sanity.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c3494827990053809907 title="comment permalink">12/29/16, 10:48 AM</a><br><br>

It is not only that Computer Industry is a racket that funnels private taxes from the actual economy into the creators of current crops of IT products. The very technology itself is well past the sustainability and even the comprehension by a single human mind. Everything is a mashup of overly complex subsystems that are shoehorned together by increasingly complex and inaccurate interfaces.

This is already a failure on my part, - though a minor one, - since I have been working towards this goal for the most part of 2 years.<br><br>The way I see it, catabolic collapse does not have to be just about material and financial capital. It happens every time skilled labor refuses to work under the ridiculous non-plans of managers, which themselves are just responding to the delusional daydreams of the market.

They are also buying a mothballed TVA nuclear power plant to convert. I don't know if it will work but if so FF power, solar and wind will be moot.

I love this time of year. Let's see how i did:<br><br>1) Hilary Clinton is elected our next president. In more detail - Donald Trump does not win the nomination. He is either forced out in some manner by the GOP and runs third party undercutting the GOP nominee or he gets to the convention with enough delegates that the convention is brokered and he is forced out there. In any case whoever the eventual GOP nominee is Trump supporters don't back him (likely him as I don't see Fiorina pulling it off) and Hilary walks to victory.<br><br>Clean miss! Not even close! I sucked air on this one.<br><br>2) Saudi Arabia does not collapse but the beginnings of its collapse are evident before year end. Wide spread unrest and protests put down brutally, economic collapse and military embarrassments. More evidence of Saudi Arabia's involvement in world event will come out but now they will actually get attention by the media and the public. Iran's stand off with Saudi Arabia which looks foolish now will look strategically smart in hind sight.<br><br>Pretty much a miss too. But I will roll this over for another year.<br><br>3) The markets (bond, stock, housing) stumble and bumble and herk and jerk all year long with an overall downward direction. There are a few sharp sell offs with some relief rallies. The end of the year closes down. The serious sell off does not begin until next year or very late this year.<br><br>Well missing number 1 made this a miss as well. The markets stayed in a tight trading range almost all year and soared on the Trump surprise. I still think a serious downturn is in the offing - now more than ever.<br><br>4) After many feints and false starts at least one European country finds themselves with a slight majority of its population favoring one of its radical parties. The backlash against immigration builds momentum all year long with more attention getting events like the one that occurred over New Years in Cologne. <br><br>My first solid hit. Italy, France, most of the northern states are all now facing realistic pressure from far right parties driven by terrorist and high profile criminal acts.<br><br>5) The Oregon stand off sputters to an end and everyone breathes a sigh of relief. What most won't see is that there is a growing number of American's who agree with the sentiment of those men (not necessarily their ideas but their anger). A much more serious version of this event occurs somewhere in the US with much more serious actors. However, this time the actors in question will adroitly use legal loop holes, sharp arguments and social media to position themselves. <br><br>Eh, half a point. The stand off did indeed fade but a new sharper event did not occur.<br><br>6) And here is my hail Mary prediction. An actually serious politically motivated act of violence (homegrown) occurs on American soil some time in 2016 with serious loss of life and/or property and/or serious political consequences. I will not predict which faction this will come from (because it could come from any of them).<br><br>And another clean miss. Stand by for my 2017 predictions!<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c9195880234096053973 title="comment permalink">12/29/16, 11:52 AM</a><br><br>

The photos are pretty telling of the apparent lack of resilience to such storms in a city: <a href=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-29/melbourne-hit-by-heavy-storms-causing-transport-delays/8152964 rel=nofollow>Melbourne hit by heavy storms causing flash flooding, transport delays, emergency callouts</a>.<br><br>I'll clean up over the next few days.<br><br>Incidentally, I saw a comment last week calling for a return to previous social arrangements as a fix for the problems.

Exactly -- simple sentences can only express simple thoughts, without nuance or any room for the development of an argument. I suspect that writing advice like Madmagic's has a lot to do with the epidemic of simplistic thinking in America these days. <br><br>Hubertus, that's certainly one way to approach it. <br><br>Tony, from the perspective of the flyover states, Trump has already started doing exactly what they want him to do: bullying corporations into keeping jobs at home, and patching up relations with the Russians so that we don't have to watch more body bags coming home from the Middle East. If Ambrose Evans-Pritchard's <a href=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/12/28/trumps-trade-policies-become-shocking-day/ rel=nofollow>latest tirade in the Torygraph</a> is anything to go by, the Trump transition team is currently talking about a flat 10% tariff on all imports across the board -- which he can impose unilaterally under current law -- and which would be hugely popular in flyover country as a jobs-creation move. Thus his core voters aren't disillusioned with him at all -- they're pinching themselves to make sure they're not dreaming all this -- and for them, the shrieking of affluent liberals is a nice tasty layer of icing on the cake. <br><br>Hereward, yep. Where I live, along the same lines, inflation is nonexistent but prices somehow just keep rising anyway...<br><br>Latefall, interesting. I don't have the time to set up something like that myself, but I could see participating in some such thing. <br><br>Avery, funny. With regard to Ray Kurzweil, did you ever hear of the 18th century English prophetess Joanna Southcott? When she was quite old, she announced that she had become pregnant by the Holy Ghost and was about to give birth to the Messiah. Nine months later, she died. Her disciples kept her on ice, waiting for her to rise from the dead, until the stench became too bad. If Kurzweil does die in the next year, I expect some similar scene among his followers...<br><br>Hereward, thank you. It occurs to me that I may want to do a post on writing, in the on-again-off-again education sequence, to address some of Madmagic's points. <br><br>Mary, every few years some new oil discovery is ballyhooed as bigger than Saudi Arabia. It's a standard marketing ploy to attract venture capital. The only places on Earth that haven't been prospected thoroughly enough to find every really big oil field are beneath the Greenland and Antarctic ice caps. <br><br>Bill, the electoral college is how we do things in the US. Clinton knew that going in, and still wasted huge amounts of money and other resources in areas that boosted her popular vote totals but did nothing to address the vulnerable demographics that she had to win to take the electoral college. That's a pretty rousing example of incompetence.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c5571233944727711643 title="comment permalink">12/29/16, 2:20 PM</a><br><br>

<div class="avtb a_fa375e" id=c1814494328066047558></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11082602126850605083 rel=nofollow>Brian Kaller</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>JMG, <br><br>Thanks for another great year. Many of my acquaintances declare this to be “the worst year ever,” which seems a bit melodramatic to me, even as I sympathise with their dis-satisfaction. <br><br>More interesting to me is the reasons they give. In some cases I know people who have experienced a death in the family or job loss, which is understandable, but most people are simply referring to Trump, Brexit and celebrity deaths. Trump and Brexit we’ve discussed here before, and people will have their own opinions about them. But rarely do people mention Syria, or the Arctic sea ice, or suicide rates in small towns, or the quality of their water, or any of the other serious problems their communities are facing. Most commonly, when they refer to tragedies in the news, they are referring to the deaths of people they never knew, and who never knew them. And they don’t just feel disappointed, but in some cases, betrayed. <br><br>Betrayal seems a strange emotion for such things, but I gather that the events of 2016, for many Westerners my age, violated many people’s sense of how life was supposed to work – especially people of my generation. Take people’s outrage at celebrity deaths – obviously they’re far less important than geopolitics or the climate, but if we’re talking about mass psychology, I think it illustrates a useful point. <br><br>Many people my age are remarking on the number of singers and actors who died this year -- Alan Rickman, George Michael, Carrie Fisher, Prince, David Bowie, Gene Wilder, and so many others – as a human tragedy. It occurred to me, though, that it’s not an unusual year so much as a change in demographics. Most people have their first crushes, teenaged obsessions and fond memories of people who were famous when they were teenagers, say, 10 to 20. <br><br>Since most of those teen idols will be in their 20s and 30s when famous, modern people go through life idolising people a decade or two older than themselves. In other words, I told my friends, we're getting to the middle-aged window when celebrity deaths tend to hit us. It’s a normal part of a cycle, and not an unprecedented catastrophe – but none of my friends had ever experienced this, as they’ve never been this age before. This year’s elections, likewise, are not unprecedented – whatever you think of Mr. Trump, we’ve had far worse elections than this, just outside of the tiny window of pop-culture memory. <br><br>Another factor is that these days, popular singers and actors fill our media screens, out of our televisions and phones, and we often hear them on grocery-store loudspeakers. We might hear George Michael several times a day, whereas we might hear our grandmother a few times a year. Thus, celebrities become far more familiar than family members or neighbours, and we instinctively grieve for them as though we knew them. In the same way, our modern media spends an inordinate amount of time talking about one office (president) in one country (USA), so people’s hopes around the world rise and fall with the election of an office that used to be quite minor in its influence, until all our hopes and dreams cling to it. <br><br>In a parallel universe we could have mourned the deaths of many famous chemists or nuns or aid workers, rather than actors and singers, and bemoaned the unusual number of deaths this year. We could have agonised over our mayoral election, and when it didn’t go our way, we might bemoan that this is the end of our town forever. In other words, much of people’s grief is wholly a phenomenon of the media around them. I would like to compare the feelings of people who lived more isolated from pop culture, and see how differently they interpreted current events. <br><br>Thanks for letting me vent those shower thoughts, and Happy New Year. :-)<br><br><br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c1814494328066047558 title="comment permalink">12/29/16, 2:21 PM</a><br><br>

That's actually pretty good compared to the run of the media. I could see any or all of those happening. <br><br>Donalfagan, delighted to hear it. <br><br>Somewhatstunned, I go some distance beyond panpsychism, in a Schopenhauerian direction, but panpsychism is a good start.

Different plans are appropriate for different people. <br><br>Jeremy, thank you. <br><br>Helix, thank you also. <br><br>Jay, and let's make that three for three! One of the reasons that I don't expect interest rates to go up significantly is that a number of governments, that of the US in the lead, would have to default on their debts if interest rates were anything but nominal. I expect instead to see the entire system of government financing turn into a charade in which governments issue debt which is bought via central bank money-printing operations. Exactly how far that can proceed before other chasms open up beneath the money system is an interesting question. <br><br>Ray, thank you for this! It's good to hear from somebody who's been there. <br><br>Bruno, thank you. <br><br>Elros, it's relatively easy to gimmick a net energy analysis by externalizing costs right and left -- that's why, for example, pro-solar calculations always assign solar PV a far larger net energy rating than do skeptical analyses such as the one I cited by Prieto and Hall. Economic viability is a good check on that. If nuclear power actually had the sort of net energy its proponents claim, it would make money on a scale that would have every utility in the world scrambling to get one. The fact that nuclear fission is never affordable without huge government subsidies shows that the net energy claims being made for it are unrealistic. It's always crucial to look for such real world checks, to be sure that you're not being sold a line of (radioactive) goods!<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c8187414823260948027 title="comment permalink">12/29/16, 2:36 PM</a><br><br>

It emerged largely in reaction against the culture of political correctness imposed by affluent liberals, and like most reactive movements, uncritically embraced some of the basic assumptions of what it was reacting against while simply reversing the value signs (e.g., the rhetoric of race in politically correct circles insists that racial pride is a good thing for everyone but white people, and so the Alt-Right insists that racial pride is a good thing for white people, without noticing that this simply affirms the underlying narrative of racial-identity politics and so furthers the politically correct agenda). Based on what I've seen over the last few years, I think there's a very real possibility that something new and far more original will emerge from the alt-right, and challenge the orthodoxies of our time from directions nobody is expecting yet.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c5724596932901765951 title="comment permalink">12/29/16, 3:36 PM</a><br><br>

Did they mention where they wanted you to shill? <br><br>Sackerson, Australia would be somewhat better, but to be frank, given the difference in efficiencies, you'd probably be better off concentrating on solar thermal technologies there too. <br><br>Rapier, the thing that's changed is that neoliberalism is no longer the only acceptable alternative in the political sphere. Of course it's still around, and will be for some time, but when the incoming US administration is seriously talking about trade barriers, and rising powers such as Russia and Iran are cutting trade deals specifically designed to insulate them from the global economy, we've entered a new stage in the process. <br><br>Brian, that's an interesting point. I find myself wondering if there have actually been an unusual number of celebrity deaths in 2016 at all. I don't keep track, and a great many celebrities are unknown to me -- for example, I have no idea who George Michael might have been -- but it seems to me, as I cast my mind back, that there's a fair death toll of celebrities every year. <br><br>Pygmycory, good.

The conclusion was that no matter what people might try to do to goose the production after 2017 it would be impossible to keep up with the decline rates.

Of course, the stupider set is going to blame the Jews or something ridiculous but of course there will be those who know better.<br><br>Your assessment, JMG, as an assertion that the alt-right is a reaction to affluent liberal identity politics is pretty accurate. Of course, the alt-right response to that assertion would be "Even if you aren't interested in identity politics, identity politics is interested in you". The reality is that the American identity started collapsing around Vietnam, and as identity politics and various aspects of liberalism start interfering with the replacement identities which Americans (and many other Western countries) have adopted for themselves, those Americans are looking for other identities. Overpaid football players taking a knee during football games or the actors which depict tired comic-book heroes in blockbuster movies endorsing Clinton is a good example of this.<br><br>In these racially charged times, with traditional sources of identity failing or becoming hostile to white people, and Black, Latino, Islamic identity, etc surging, I can hardly fault someone for white identitarianism. I don't think it's the right response, but I am certainly vulnerable to it myself, being a rootless person of mixed European descent. It's not rational, but I don't accept the scientistic orthodoxy that the irrational is irrelevant anymore, so I don't care much. Ultimately, I think it comes from a combination of racial identity politics and a completely empty, atomized and rootless culture, and don't see white idenitarianism as a telos but rather a symptom of a deeper problem.<br><br>Something that many people, especially comfortable people, in our present era fail to ask themselves is "who is we?".

I don't know if it's of interest to you and if by chance it is whether you ever write about it . The question pertains to the idea that consciousness evolves. I'd be talking about Wilber, Gebser, et al . Are you of the opinion that consciousness is as it ever was in spite of recent movements that allowed women autonomy and sexual liberation among the genders; which could be explained by the elite throwing a few bones to the masses in recent decades because it was in their financial best interest to do so, and that cheap fuel created the conditions to give the nod to a few issues that were previously a no no and for elite consumption only? Also, is the advent of technology directly related to the evolution of consciousness ? <br><br>Happy New Year!<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c1786497915175496745 title="comment permalink">12/29/16, 4:56 PM</a><br><br>

Today's world has a wide variety of offerings for different types of people of varying intelligence. Greer's writing style is meatier, written in a more intelligent way, not dumbed down for a wider audience precisely because Greer's audience is the intelligent people who are looking for something more substantial. Greer's writing style works because the style matches his audience, people who want a deeper analysis and appreciate richer language. There are a thousand other dumbed down sites following the "rules"- for example, write at no higher than an 8th grade level so everyone can understand it. If that's the kind of world you want to live in, maybe we can save tax money by abolishing high school. Or maybe some writers should hold the audience to a higher standard and help contribute to the "wising up" of the adult population. I personally love this writing style. It's more like the styles of much older works, with long sentences that make you think and word choices of depth and color. Don't change a thing! (Unless you want to write more often....

It is at this point that we will discover that the road that we have been kicking so many cans down is actually a cull de sac.<br> With half-way competent leadership, we could have some confidence in the future but there lays the rub. I suspect that a major reason for a lot of the discontent these days leading to Brexit, Trump and the like is the realization that the people in charge are just not up to the job. In fact, too many are tone-deaf, self-entitled "professionals" - the same sort that ran and screwed up the campaign for Clinton who herself could be counted as the epitome of this class. Does anybody here have any confidence in that people like Abe, Juncker, Trump, Merkel, Holland, Blair can be counted on to do the right thing in an emergency? For that matter, how about the professional class that is running the world's economy and our political establishments?<br> Of course the discontinuities are going to be harsh as you mentioned in your essay. The trouble is not so much this but the suspicion of what our leader's responses to the troubles will be with their own ideas on what the priorities should be. Hint - it won't be us!

The Carrier deal cost taxpayers $7million to keep 530 jobs in the US and was a one-off, not a policy. (I was and am a bernie supporter).

The off grid inverters are far more expensive than the simple and very dumb grid tied inverters. Plus there are multiple charge controllers, DC fuses, batteries, cables etc. The solar panels are the cheapie stuff and nobody thinks about all of the other stuff that is required. None of this stuff is worth anything to anybody, but to build a complete system is a true nightmare. Plus at 37.5 degrees latitude south, I get one hour of peak solar generation over winter. That means that if I have 5kW of panels I get to enjoy using 5kWh of energy per day and not one single watt more than that. And none of this stuff will be working as a complete system in a decades time.<br><br>Mate, please whatever you may think or have read, do not bet the farm on this stuff.

Happy New Year when it comes, although I accept that it won’t be all ‘happy’, I’m sure it will be at a spiritual leave, if nothing else. One thing, which i’m sure you are aware of, which will increasingly make its mark over the coming year, in my view, is the further expansion of disease resistance to antibiotics. A recent article in the Guardian covered it in length. The extensive use of antibiotics to treat animals, even a preventative sense, to maintain profits, is significantly assisting the efforts of disease and bacteria to work its way round them. I suspect that this will be a key factor in ‘curing’ the earth of its excessive population levels over the next 100 years, perhaps even more successfully than war. The oil/tech industry has played its part in cheating the natural selection system for about a 100 years, but its running out of ammunition rather rapidly.

I even mentioned that I thought Michigan would be one of the states trump would flip.<br>I think I can only honestly give myself half a point, since I prefaced my post by saying that I assumed the frontrunners would win their nominations, but I didn't yet take that as a given.<br><br>As far as the upcoming year, I have four predictions, starting with the most likely and ending with the least likely.<br><br>1 - Marine LePen will lead the French Republic by the end of next year, and the National Front will push for 'Frexit' from the EU.<br><br>2 - The Russian-Turkish-Iranian triumvirate will shoulder the US firmly out of the fertile crescent and secure friendly regimes in Damascus and Baghdad. These actions will push American influence in the Middle East to the Gulf States, a crumbling Saudi Arabia, and Isreal/Palestine. I make NO predication about how the US will react to these actions...<br><br>3 - A lack of Artic Sea ice due to the mild winter and methane cook-off leads to significant ice sheet collapse all around Greenland. I will go so far as to say that Greenland looses a full five percent of it's land ice, and marks the beginning of the terminal decline of Greenland's ice cap (though that process will take decades).<br><br>4 - This is my Hail Mary prediction; we see a preview of the domestic insurgency everyone here has expected for some time. Between the escalating violence around police shootings, veterans turning up to support Native American environmental protestors and the Bundy clan remaining at large and emboldened by their acquittal, the countryside is ripe for some kind of triggering incident. I won't even begin to guess at the scenario leading up to the incident. We could be looking at the start of a bleeding Kansas, or a one-off event like John Brown's raid, but either way, the similarities between now and 1857 are just too many to ignore.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c9018430337899274288 title="comment permalink">12/30/16, 6:31 AM</a><br><br>

For me, there's just too much bad blood between the South and the North, and the well is just too poisoned. IMHO, the North has demonstrated that they are just not to be trusted and cannot negotiate in good faith with the South. In some future CSA, such as you've described in Twilight's Last Gleaming and Retrotopia, I can see the CSA having closer relations and ties with Mexico, Quebec, and East Canada than with New England and the mid-Atlantic--I'm not even sure that the CSA would have diplomatic ties and exchange ambassadors with them. The Midwest/Great Lakes is another story--the history there is more conflicted--I think we would cautiously work with them on issues of interest.<br>I can't really speak for the other regions, but if this polarization intensifies the way it has every presidential campaign since "W", and secession/dissolution continues to come up and move from the loony fringe to the mainstream, I can't see the South not taking the opportunity to regain her independence, even if other options were on the table. If the United States was in as weakened a state as the USSR in the late 80s, the South would be a fool to forego her independence and work to maintain the Union--"fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me." I am hopeful that the US would be as weakened as the USSR, if not more so, and that the dissolution would proceed as peacefully as outlined in Twilight--the Con Con option really is the best.<br>To my mind, the United States and its attendant civil religion, Americanism, and the underlying liberalism behind it have all outlived their usefulness and need to die and exit the stage. Really, the United States is a country about nothing, and without the American dream, which died in the 70s, if not earlier, there's no real need for it to exist. If we don't need to be pushing Americanism on other nations, then we don't need to be pushing it at home, either. When so many other nations do democratic republicanism and liberty so much better than the US, a nation founded only on those principles ceases to have a reason to exist.<br>Besides, I have designs on being the heir and successor to none other than Judah P Benjamin himself. :-)<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c8144451246886880615 title="comment permalink">12/30/16, 7:07 AM</a><br><br>

From unexpected sports outcomes (I remember being cued into Western Tennessee State vs Michigan State before the upset in that NCAA Tourney) to the big stuff (Never predicted Trump, but was definitely prepared for it – complete with visualizations depicting what would happen – and tried to prepare others for the possibility) to personal stuff (Saw the end of a long-time relationship coming in my dreams), I've seen things coming that, until recently, would have had me blindly reacting to the blindside.

But this is very similer to the physical condition of one or more of the celebrities that have famously passed away during 2016. Specificaly, the artist known as Prince, who maintained a brilliant career at the same time his body was going downhill from a combination of physical injuries, medical neglect and drug use. The show was kept on the road with various painkillers etc, eventually leading to a situation where only regular use of the synthetic opiod pain killer fentanyl would keep the artist on the road and in the studio. Much like zero interest rates this kept the music coming and the money flowing, and to those on the outside looking in everything was fine. But one day, seemingly without warning the fabled rock star was dead slumped to the floor of his music studio elevator.

They are costly and impermanent.<br><br>My ancient solar panel (Arco Solar, maybe from an early attempt at solar power) when last tested about 20 years ago put out 16V no load and 12V at 2 Amps in direct sunlight.<br><br>The problem would seem to be at the demand end. If most appliances / machines / devices can use 12V high Amp and 5V low Amp why not have a low power inexpensive inverter only for the devices that demand it? RV appliances (of course except stoves) are easy to find. LED lamps often run at 5V and the lamps for 12V have 3 LEDs in series (or a really crappy current / voltage regulator with high EMFs and a life span NOT 50,000 hours).<br><br>A large enough 12V battery bank could do most of the regulation. Cars usually provide around 14.6V motor running at small loads down to 9V starting a very cold engine. Lead acid batteries are 2V per cell, the more expensive deep charge / RV battery can last if cared for. There would need to be some sort of regulation as simple as variable shades on the panels or a regulator that could shunt excess power to some other use such as pumping water.<br><br>Inverters from 12V to 5V are common also (cigarette plug USB chargers etc.).<br><br>The downside would be Edison's problem of transmitting a distance which DC does poorly. Fat wires for are also needed for high Amps at low Volts but for short distance it works out, and they aren't going to fail because of a blown transistor. Look at the wires under the hood of a car. Fat wires to the starter and smaller according to the end needs. Look at the fuse panel for more approximations.<br><br>Desktop computers run internally off 12V and 5V but it must be well regulated. Printers and most monitors would need AC for their power supplies.<br><br>Another possibility is 110V DC not unusual on older boats. Many motors with brushes (old vacuum cleaners) will run on that. Old tugboats often had a shaft generator on the propellor shaft that would be used with a 10 battery bank after cruise speed is steady (9 knots - it can feel strange to drive on the freeway after 6 weeks on a tug). Existing household wires can work, that's an Amps to Volts ratio problem. Just don't plug most modern devices in, it makes the magic smoke come out and then they never work again.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c6795245806841509423 title="comment permalink">12/30/16, 5:35 PM</a><br><br>

Can you point me to an online source? <br><br>Ray, good. That's the thing about analyzing mistakes -- they become opportunities for learning. Those who just keep on retailing the same claims year after year, without ever paying attention to their failures, miss out on that. <br><br>Jerome, the kind of reasoning that runs "this expert was wrong in this one case, therefore anything is possible" rarely makes for accurate predictions -- especially when the subtext of the reasoning is an attempt to make the universe conform to human cravings in the teeth of the evidence. By all means wait and see, but I hope you're not going to invest your life savings in PENV. <br><br>Justin, I get that. My hope is that as the alt-right matures and gets a sense of its potential power -- which is considerable -- the quest for meaningful identity will move in directions that don't prop up the underlying narratives of the political correctness that's being used by affluent liberals to pursue their class interests (at the expense, btw, of working class people of all skin colors and genders). More on this in an upcoming post. <br><br>Andrew, an enormous amount depends on what you mean by "consciousness" and "evolves." If you mean by that, as your examples suggest, "do social mores concerning gender and sexuality change over time?" the answer is of course yes; it's only in the stunted imagination of contemporary pop culture, for example, that gay people were forced into the closet when ancient Greece converted to Christianity and didn't get back out again until the Stonewall riots. On the other hand, if by "evolves" you mean "moves inevitably over time in the direction I want," I have some disappointing news for you. Perhaps you can explain in more detail what you mean. <br><br>Rapier, good. You'll notice that China's building its trade policy along lines laid down by geographic propinquity and geopolitical interest, rather than pretending that every point on the planet is equidistant from every other. <br><br>Jessi, thank you. I really do think I need to address Madmagic's notions at more length, in a post of its own. <br><br>Justin, those seem plausible enough. Now we'll see! <br><br>Kevin, and of course that's also a crucial point. As Arnold Toynbee pointed out a good long time ago, one of the distinctive features of a society on the way down is a leadership class that's lost the capacity to come up with effective responses to changing conditions, and satisfies itself with going through familiar motions instead. <br><br>Pantagruel, well, there's that! I wasn't even thinking of Proust or, say, Joyce -- no successful work of nonfiction prose has ever restricted itself to the kind of stilted journalistic prose Madmagic's potted rules produce. Go open any book on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list and you'll find paragraphs of varying length, complex sentences, and so on.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c4924405635046003354 title="comment permalink">12/30/16, 5:58 PM</a><br><br>

I consider Trump a better option than Clinton -- why on earth won't people call her by her last name, the way they do male politicians? -- because Clinton was the one demanding a military showdown over Syria between the US and Russia; because Clinton spent her time at the head of the State Department enthusiastically pursuing the neoconservative regime-change agenda that's caused so much misery and death around the world; because (despite her lukewarm and last-minute opposition to TPP) Clinton throughout her political career has consistently supported the neoliberal free-trade policies that have destroyed the US working class and funneled so absurd a fraction of our national wealth to the very rich; and because Trump, by contrast, has consistently called for less confrontational policies toward Russia, an end to the neoconservative monomania for regime change, and sensible trade barriers to return jobs to this country. If you'd taken the time to read any of my previous posts on the subject, rather than simply swallowing whole the party line being churned out by the corporate media that backed Clinton to the hilt all through the election, you would have known that already...<br><br>Rebecca, funny you should mention Hypatia. I did <a href=../../2014/12/dark-age-america-sharp-edge-of-shell.html rel=nofollow>a post about her two years back</a> which you might want to read. The Cliff Notes version is that Hypatia suffered the horrible death she did because the intellectual and cultural movement of which she was so impressive a part was wholly subservient to the class interests of the patrician elite of the late Roman world. If educated women today want to avoid a repeat, some attention to the way that current ideologies prop up the class interests of the affluent against everyone else might be in order. <br><br>Bob, I'd have expected a link to some kind of spam in that case.

It's hard to see what's really going on, and I hope the large degree of mixing between the Hispanic population and the white population helps quell things - if half your racialist movement (Hispanic or white) has a cousin or something with a spouse of the other race it's going to be a whole lot less ugly. "The Red Pill" is more of a poorly-mixed compound of half-truths or "always do the opposite of what liberals say" silliness than an actual escape from any sort of matrix. I mean, some of those ideas are significantly more truthful than liberal dogmas, but this is a case of the better not being the enemy of the best.

Plus these new phones take great pictures and seem to be a real plus while traveling. The cost is actually less then the land line (rural areas lack choices and that means paying more sometimes).

Instead, easy money is allowing the air out of the bubbles in a non-catastrophic manner. We have a canary that has spent 25 years in the coal mine of easy money, and it's still not dead or even dying. I think this requires some serious thought, but I can't explain how it happened or its implications.<br><br>Our canary is Japan, which has been doing exactly this since the early 1990s. Ever since their giant real estate bubble burst, they have been bumping along with interest rates of 0% and quantitative easing, and nothing has gone particularly wrong, excluding tsunamis and meltdowns. Nothing has gone particularly "right" either: their growth rate has been nearly 0 for the last generation, and their debt-to-GDP ratio has climbed to about 250% and is still rising. This is by far the highest in the world, yet the yield on their 10 year government bonds is currently a mere 0.04%; even Germany's is higher, to say nothing of the US. Japanese inflation is just about 0 too, if not negative; when Abe engaged in a huge program of deficit spending and more QE, it popped above 2% for about a year before falling right back to 0% again. Unemployment is a mere 3.1%, thanks in part to a population with a median age of 48 and a fertility rate of 1.3/woman. Sales of adult diapers surpassed those of infant diapers several years ago and haven't looked back.<br><br>Did they stumble on some sort of metastable state in which a First World economy can be maintained at a steady state with little inflation and no debt crisis despite constant deficits? It seems obvious that they can't push the debt/GDP ratio to something like 1000% without something breaking, but it seems that whatever the limits are, they aren't anywhere near them. In part this has to do with cultural factors, like the fact that they would rather have a declining population than accept immigrants and that the Japanese public is perfectly holding 0% government bonds. But they have shown that the current trajectory in Western countries could continue for at least a couple of decades longer, in principle at least.<br><br>In the West, we seem to have run into political limits well ahead of the economic ones. If the the powers that be (Clinton, Cameron, etc.) had managed to retain power and not run into any other limits like "rural insurgency" or "war with the world's #3 overall military and #2 nuclear power", it's not clear where they would have run into economic limits. If money is free or even cheaper, the limits to business as usual are fairly distant, even with no growth. Of course, ZIRP/NIRP and QE are just policies related to the tokens we use to allocate physical resources, and reality would eventually intervene in the form of rising pollution and declining nonrenewable resources. But it's not clear to me that the physical limits would necessarily have hit us until a couple of decades from now, allowing a generation's worth of a fairly comfortable plateau. <br><br>Is there any good counterargument to that? And is it possible that this plateau is what the mainstream establishment is shooting for? Of course it won't work out in the long run, 20+ years from now, but you know what Keynes said about the long run...<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c7407253311189681381 title="comment permalink">12/30/16, 9:38 PM</a><br><br>

And DC switching is a real drama because of the effects of arcing. If the average household had to pay for proper DC switches, fuses and/or circuit breakers, then you wouldn't have many electrical outlets in your household. <br><br>And just in case you were not aware, the mains electricity grid utilises huge transformers (which are the opposite of inverters) which have about the same lifespan as a well constructed inverter.<br><br>Mate, I reckon you are talking theoretical and completely missing the practical aspects of this technology. And if your old solar panel is so useful, why aren't you using it? Just sayin... What good is it doing sitting in storage just to be pulled out every now and then and tested just to make you feel good. It has a finite life, so I urge you to find a use for it.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c5086807092801508898 title="comment permalink">12/31/16, 12:55 AM</a><br><br>

I took a look at the website and it was enough to keep myself and my mechanical engineer friends laughing all evening. In addition to the obscure circular language and strung together important sounding and meaningless words ,the so called "technology" is so thermodynamicaly flawed that even the most utopian techo-optimist would not beleive it if spelled out in plain language. The crux of it is that they plan to feed electricity from the grid in to an induction heated boiler and use the steam generated to make more electricity than they put in. In addition to breaking every law of thermodynamics, a simple analysis of the process shows that even if every step acheived the highest theoretical efficiency possible the process would lose 40% of the energy fed in to it. Electical induction heating has been around for 80 years and is well understood, and no more efficient than dropping an electrical resistance coil in to a tub of water ( like your electric water heater). Also, the energy properties of water as it is heated and expands in to steam are also well known and can be calculated reliably to 4 decimal places by any third year mechanical engineering student. <br><br>I assume this operation is a scam to collect gullible investors or perhaps a subsidy dumper, but it seems too clumsy to succed at that. Finally, anyone wishing to look at the site should be aware that it is full of hidden links that will take you to sites advertising erection pills or worse.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c9190270321590432574 title="comment permalink">12/31/16, 6:30 AM</a><br><br>

That was a very interesting list of predictions. At this point, India looks to me like the world's most successful civilization. India absorbed two separate conquests, and then eventually neutralized one and spat out the other.

I thought Speaker Ryan's attempt to pre-empt a made in America requirement for sourcing steel in a recent bill--bridge and road repairs, I think--was a straightforward case of bribery by foreign interests, but perhaps there more going on as well? The ID politics wing of the left can't see any of this because of their inability to read maps.<br><br>As of 2016, the "Bernie wing" of the left has shown itself to be the only part of that coalition which can reliably win elections without resorting to massive fraud and propaganda. There are indications that Democratic party donors are about to pull the financial plug on the identity politics/neoliberal wing of the party. The Greens, with their weak candidate at the top, may have bombed in the national election, but they managed to run some very impressive young folks with sound, innovative ideas in local elections, and I doubt that those youngsters are going to simply retire into private life.

India and Pakistan? Israel and Iran? Europe and Russia?

This morning, I came across this: <a href="http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/33-giant-chinese-infrastructure-projects-that-are-reshaping-the-world/ss-BBwrEsC?li=BBnbfcL&amp;ocid=mailsignout&amp;parent-title=china-builds-out-the-air-as-frustrations-mount-below&amp;parent-ns=ar&amp;parent-content-id=BBxHDEW&amp;fullscreen=true" rel=nofollow>about massive Chinese infrastructure projects</a> which gives some idea of the resource-use competition, the population pressures, the consumption patterns, etc. The title of the slideshow suggests these projects are "reshaping the world" but the full extent of that reshaping isn't acknowledged - though I know ADR readers would recognize what is implied in terms of externalized costs, affects in other high-consumption societies, etc.<br><br>Meanwhile, an interesting parallel. 1st strand: China has millions of "left behind" children (<a href="http://video.aljazeera.com/channels/eng/videos/chinas-left-behind-generation---101-east/5231110112001;jsessionid=3892EF504F36ADC76D2FCBCF3C2E1566" rel=nofollow> a video about it here</a>, but you can google print articles on it too). The parents have left rural areas for urban jobs. With restrictive relocation policies, these parents either migrate alone or, upon producing a child while in the urban area, grandparents in often remote and rural locations are tasked with raising the kids. Whole villages, emptied of working-age adults, are shells of their former sources of livelihood for communities and now millions of kids are living in strained simulacra of families and communities. The parents, for the most part, are working in factories, producing all the "goods" (we need a new word, they're not always good!) that first, Americans wanted and now, upwardly mobile Chinese want. There's a concomitant set of problems related to mental health, abuse, and the increased likelihood of those children turning to crime.<br><br>2nd strand. The gutted "villages" in America where parents have their jobs due to outsourcing (to China, etc) or are chronically under &amp; menially employed. With nowhere to migrate to, instead we're seeing an increase in addiction, illness/death, suicide, debt - <a href=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/drug-addiction-led-grandparents-raising-grandchildren/ rel=nofollow>and correspondingly, more grandparents are being tasked with raising grandchildren.</a> Apparently the number has doubled since 2000.<br><br>In both countries, the young are thrown under the bus that their parents were forced onto.

So, based on our history, it seems each generation must go through a depression to learn the lessons of a depression. Perhaps if we were an older culture with a longer historical memory, like Russia, this would not be necessary, but we're not, and we've deluded ourselves into believing that the past has no bearing on the present or future, so, depression it is.<br>Also, there's a truism amongst many religions that affluence and decadence is evil and will be punished by God/the gods, whilst suffering is necessary for spiritual growth, so there are spiritual/religious reasons to want a depression, if you believe in gods of consequences.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c4147027680582513037 title="comment permalink">12/31/16, 9:47 AM</a><br><br>

As I've mentioned in previous discussions on US imperialism, I lean toward an earlier "start" -- roughly with the US-Mexican War. As such, I wonder if the expanded Union we have constructed since that time is not itself a product and function of our empire and that it is thus unsustainable in the absence thereof. If this is true (and I freely admit that it may not be), then the collapse of our empire will necessarily result in the present Union fracturing into smaller, more cohesive, and more culturally homogeneous units. Not exactly a consummation devoutly to be wished, but is it avoidable?

I'd be talking about Wilber, Gebser, et al. Are you of the opinion that consciousness is as it ever was in spite of recent movements that allowed women autonomy and sexual liberation among the genders; which could be explained by the elite throwing a few bones to the masses in recent decades because it was in their financial best interest to do so, and that cheap fuel created the conditions to give the nod to a few issues that were previously a no no and for elite consumption only? Also, is the advent of technology directly related to the evolution of consciousness?"<br><br>I think it is odd to use such a term as evolution of consciousness in this way, although I do get what you're getting at. To me, consciousness is that subtle something that underpins existence, it is that thing that a lifetime of meditation is supposed to get one to contact and identify with. <br><br>But the contents of consciousness, yes those evolve in the course of anyone's lifetime and certainly they evolve, or I might say unfold or develop, over the course of centuries and so on. But it sounds as if you are asking whether our newly developed ideas are somehow permanent. Again, to me a slightly odd question, but I think that as long as our civilization holds onto some kind of continuity they will not be utterly wiped out. On the other hand, I really do think that a lot of modern feminism is something close to nonsense in that it is not really compatible with life in the nonluxurious state, and also I am not at all sure that women were as oppressed as we were told. I'm reading a very serious book on research into life in the middle ages, and it is simply not true that women didn't inherit. In fact they often did and it was very fluid, able to be done according to each individual and family circumstance.<br><br>Also, I'm not at all sure that the current liberation of women is a matter of the elite throwing us bones. It may be that they found that with a modern, power gobbling society they could trick women into taking on the responsibilities of men and leave no one home to tend the hearth, and thus the family loses its home economy and becomes more dependent upon wage slavery and the kids more programmable. They told us it was bones, but it was really just a bunch of sticks.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c1050482889219209615 title="comment permalink">12/31/16, 12:12 PM</a><br><br>

In this regard, I don't think it is alone amongst Southern evangelical churches. The whole mainstream narrative about red state anti-immigrant bigotry doesn't really tell the full story. That is why I think Mexico and the Confederacy will be close allies once the US is gone. Very similar agrarian, traditional, class conscious, hierarchical societies. Besides, Mexicans are really just a mix of African, European, and Native (La Raza), and there is a strong cultural imperative in Mexico to mix your blood in with everyone else's. A lot has been made about how Latinos are "becoming white" here in the US.<br>@Dave,<br>IDK how it will all pan out. I think a lot of opportunistic carpetbaggers will flee once Southern independence is close to becoming reality again, out of fear of a phantom caricature of the stereotypical Southern "other" than any reality. A lot of assimilated Southerners will stay. JMG seems to place VA and NC in the Confederacy again, while splitting MO. He has offended the great people of the Commonwealth of KY by NOT placing it in the Confederacy. If I had to draw the line, I'd include all of the states of the original Confederacy, possibly minus VA, plus KY, part of MO (deferring to Missourians here on the list), and possibly WV (WV'ians, chime in please). I think Texas could be induced to join the Confederacy again if given Texas-sized clout in the government--a lot depends upon how much sea level rise separates Texas from the rest of the Confederacy.

I find the BBC will not report on anything that is happening until it is so far gone that they cannot decently ignore it any longer. <br><br>So, I am one of the few, the proud the brave who really are lucky to not be troubled by mass media. I was puzzled to see Carrie Fisher's death announced at all. As far as I know, she hasn't had an acting job since she was a teenager. She was quite old and so can be forgiven for popping off. I was more surprised at George Michael as he was only 53 but these things happen. Unlike JMG, I was a young person in England when George Michael was popular so I know who he was but I can't say I was keen on him. <br><br>So, these celebrity deaths have left me unfazed. I am also not upset at the election of The Donald as I think he will be better fun than the last few Presidents the Americans have elected. <br>Yours under the red cedars, <br>Max Rogers<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c8142591315743819912 title="comment permalink">12/31/16, 1:55 PM</a><br><br>

I usually get a massive eyeroll at this point. My family has always semi-seriously subscribed to the rule of three. So whenever there are two disasters, deaths, etc. in a row there will be speculation over who will be the third. Of course this involves some manipulation of the data. Does it have to be three air crashes within a short period of time, or can the ferry disaster count? All singers dying, or does two actors and one pop star count. Humans are amazing in ability to discover patterns.<br><br>For those who are counting, Californians lost our "First Dog." The governors dog, Sutter died of cancer yesterday. <br> <br>JMG - re your response to Phil H. about triage in times of shortage. My initial response was that this was only true of societies that had developed class divisions and a power elite. But with further thought I realized that in hunter/gatherer cultures there is a tendency for the triage to take place on a generational level. In many such cultures births are limited, or if that is not possible, infanticide is practiced. Parents simply don't try to raise more children than they have resources for. But we also know that in some cultures the elderly may voluntarily commit suicide when food runs short, cf. the popular culture image of an elderly Eskimo on an ice floe. <br><br>On the subject of the limitation of births, I also recently read "A Plague of Caterpillars" based on the author's anthropological research in the Cameroons. He observed that the extreme form of circumcision practiced in this tribe caused penile scarring and deformity that might contribute to a low fertility rate. I wonder whether this was true of the sub-incision rites of the indigenous Australians.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c1443910316744539894 title="comment permalink">12/31/16, 2:35 PM</a><br><br>

As such, you act as a reality check to the many folks who have the fantasy, but are basically clueless as to the limitations and necessary stepping down of lifestyle which “alternative’ energy demands. <br>Those who think that, after throwing together a couple of panels and some batteries, they will continue to live the life based on endless energy from the grid know nothing of what they speak!<br>I lived on mostly “alternative” energy for 17 years on my 40ft steel ketch as I cruised around the Pacific. 4 large solar panels + a towing generator, 55 amp alternator off the engine, 4 big deep cycle batteries, a small portable petrol AC generator for 3 small power tools, 12vt dc for everything else including small fridge, no inverter. You really get to know your energy limits when the lights start to dim. No jump starts for the engine on uninhabited atolls! Besides that you have to become very intimate with your systems because they take constant monitoring and maintenance as you well know. <br>I was also highly aware that all this gear was expensive and needed a supply of spare parts which did not arrive via cargo cult and which themselves were not made with alternative energy. At one point I divided the world into “us cruisers” and “all the rest of the world who made spare parts for us“.<br>I’m back ashore and on the grid now in semi-rural sunny Nelson NZ, but with a solar thermal hot water system (pump running on a small 12vt panel). I did the math on grid-tied PV, and it was a no go economically compared to hydro generated mains here in the S. Island (15-20 year payback). <br>Even though I’m sucking (lightly) off the tit of the grid (in a small house), at least I know that I could live much more simply if circumstances change.<br>Good luck in 2017 (we’ll all need a bit of that mate).<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c1453840398255796853 title="comment permalink">12/31/16, 9:32 PM</a><br><br>

Weißbach et al. 2013 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.01.029 from their large-scale EROIs analysis concluded that "The results show that nuclear, hydro, coal, and natural gas power systems (in this order) are one order of magnitude more effective than photovoltaics and wind power." This prompted a critical feedback from Raugei 2013 doi:10.1016/j.energy.2013.07.032 who -- politely -- cast doubts on the credibility of Weißbach et al. and their understanding of the matter. Weißbach et al. 2014 doi:10.1016/j.energy.2014.02.026 replied energetically and emphatically defending their results. In 2015 Raugei with a number of co-authors, doi:10.1016/j.energy.2014.12.060, published a rebuttal to the response of Weißbach et al. 2014, which, this time, was not exactly polite in academic terms. E.g. their concluding statement was "Finally, Weißbach et al.'s defence of their untenable assertions by setting up straw man arguments and misinterpreting and misquoting Raugei's comments comes across as a worrying indication of their seeming lack of familiarity with scientific standards and widely accepted methodological conventions."<br><br>Since many science readers do not read details, this exchange basically serves to discredit Weißbach et al. I must say I myself found these articles only recently and cannot at the moment judge about the technical merits of the analyses on either side. However, it is informative how the critics treat the key statement, that renewables will not be able to sustain the humanity on their own (my emphasis):<br><br>“This viewpoint speaks to a larger issue regarding the goal of making an EROI calculation. Is it to examine a technology's ability to make use of existing societal energy resources when plugged into the current electricity supply mix, or to examine that technology's ability to supply all electricity needs on its own? It seems that the authors [Weißbach et al.] are trying to do the former, however statements regarding the wind resources at Germany's coast being “too sparse to supply the society” [[3], p. 214] or the statement that “significant buffering efforts are indispensable for a grid only consisting of renewables” [[1], p. 1006] suggest the latter. If the latter is the goal, then why are the same demands not made of gas-fired or nuclear electricity? The EROI of natural gas supplies would ALMOST CERTAINLY decline if these resources were required to supply all of society's electricity needs.”<br><br>Providing no evidence against the claim that renewables are unable to sustain the society, an impression is created that the latter claim of Weißbach et al. is incorrect.<br><br>In my country since we rely a lot on selling gas and oil such positive talks about renewables are not very common. You should read the (few) liberal media, i.e. those in opposition to the official authorities, to find such views -- apparently borrowed from progressive venues like Quartz or the like. In such media I invariably notice the same foggy attitude. A typical tool is to confuse consumption of electricity with total power consumption “forgetting” that the former is about an order of magnitude smaller than the latter. For example, the title of an article on a recent drop in PVs price could ask: “Time to give up the fossil fuel?” Then the response is, “no, it is (unfortunately), not exactly the time yet, because renewables are projected to cover JUST 28% of TOTAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION by 2021 (from the current 23%). But they are booming exponentially!!!”<br><br>The reader is left with an impression that if not in 2021 than perhaps by 2025 we will forget about fossils. The reality is however that it was all about total ELECTRICITY consumption, <a href="http://www.bioticregulation.ru/ab.php?id=energy08" rel=nofollow>which is about 10% of total energy consumption</a>. Thus at best the renewables will make a 3% contribution to our needs, a major piece of which has always been the hydropower.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c4367211301224141514 title="comment permalink">12/31/16, 10:21 PM</a><br><br>

If PV was so flawed EROEI/cost wise, then there simply aren't enough subsidies to have installed 300 Gigawatts(peak) around the end of 2016, unlike, say the technically flawed/EROEI deficient algae based biofuels or cellulosic ethanol, both of which are essentially derelict.<br><br>I still agree that BAU is not supportable by renewables <i>without significant conservation/behavioral/political changes</i>, because of the financial/political/behavioral issues work to impede the transition to renewables.<br><br>An example: without protective tariffs/prescriptive laws/etc., a country being ecologically honest and producing increasing amounts of iron via renewables would be un-competitive in the neoliberal globalized world. But if we wait until the last coking coal is gone, we run off "Seneca's cliff", and don't have time to do the development-by-deployment (e.g. learn by doing) that is the only real way to make these sorts of transitions work. Yet as you point out, the neoliberal economists get apoplectic when one mentions trade barriers, and their sudden (re-)imposition will likely have unforeseen negative impacts.<br>Then how do we allocate this green steel among the producers of steel objects? "Sounds like communism to me".<br>And some consumers will complain about increased cost of cars, etc. during the transition period.<br><br>Another example is the rancor over Elon Musk's "subsidies", yet the massive fossil fuel industry subsidies seem politically sacrosanct, and unmentionable in most of the press.<br>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/elon-musk-robert-murray-coal-green-subsidies<br><br>It is these oft-ignored, wicked hard problems of human values, attitudes, and interests that impede sustainability, not the lack of technical capability of PV and wind and storage.<br><br>re: (to Sackerson) "... better off concentrating on solar thermal technologies ..."<br>Passive solar thermal I agree, for simple space heating and hot water it's quite hard to beat.<br>Excepting of course social convention, HOA/zoning restrictions, first cost basis "accounting", etc. that work against such rationality as free, clean heat from the sun.<br><br>Not clear if you meant solar thermal electricity and power using concentrators, but if so, I disagree about it being a general solution, due to the old nemesis of relying on direct normal insolation (DNI) and related issues that people have struggled with for a century.<br>See the parts dealing with DNI/dust/etc. from this comment from March 2014 re Cogenra (which, as I surmised at the time, would fail with its PV/thermal combined panels).<br>http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2014/03/the-steampunk-future-revisited.html?showComment=1394424536520#c1549747281556275106<br><br>Changed link note: on solargis.info, go to their "iMaps" link, then one will have to find on the map under "solar" and select "direct normal" and "global horizontal".<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c5418016989660234809 title="comment permalink">12/31/16, 11:08 PM</a><br><br>

MacIntyre has plumped overall for Aristotle as <i>’the’</i> protagonist to match against the voices of liberal modernity. Given that I agree with MacIntyre about the failure of the Enlightenment Project I am interested in his take on the essential conflict between ‘good and good’ that he sees exemplified in Sophocles’ dramatic tragedy that he says Aristotle is blind to. The failure of the British state for instance might be exemplified in the appeal to ‘Free Market’ ideology (a curious modern appeal to ‘the Gods’ it seems to me) that was so central to the decisions involved in the Irish Potato Famine in the 1830s. <br><br>MacIntyre provides and makes a telling point from Australian philosopher John Anderson who urges us not to ask of a social institution: “What end or purpose does it serve?” but of “Of what conflicts is it the scene?” MacIntyre calls this a ‘Sophoclean’ insight and remarks – “that it is through conflict and sometimes only through conflict that we learn what our ends and purposes are”.<br><br>We approach again if we ever left it, the place where disagreement is not academic. I seek to know where ‘our practical intelligence’ as MacIntyre calls it, is based on such insights or lack of them. That much we discuss already on ADR.

My state (nj) had already done away with the state credits.<br>It was one of the best moves we made. between conservation practices(make hay while the sun shines ;-)), drastic decrease in electric bills and proceeds from srecs, after 4 years, we've gotten about a 40% return on the 'principle'.<br>we also pay close attention the developments in the srec market and build rates. Our srec broker provides detailed reports each month on the pipe line. There's been a steady increase in systems. Mostly what i've seen is a growth at the municipal level, with most of the towns here installing systems on public buildings, especially school owned property. There's also been a big increase in residential. Most of that is due to outfits like solar city, with their leasing arrangements. I wonder if that could be considered a 'grassroots' movement? Also I don't think many folks consider this aspect of the 'boom' as it were, focusing more ,it seems, on the Public Utility conversion. Having also worked in the power generation field, these small contributions become in essence 'co-gen' facilities, and do relieve a lot of strain during peak hours of use.<br><br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c1960849721957141719 title="comment permalink">1/1/17, 7:11 AM</a><br><br>

JMG has posited one interpretation w/his Retrotopia novel, though it's by no means guaranteed that will be the path the Great Lakes area takes. I'm thinking that the Midwest/Great Lakes area may be the area that will have the biggest existential crisis/vacuum in the post-American world. So much of Midwestern identity is staked on being middle American, all-American, the American norm, the Heartland, etc. What happens to that identity when there is no America anymore? At least all the other regions have unique regional cultures.

Unfortunately, everyone gets the whole package, whatever that turns out to be. "<br><br>Yes, this is very visible. No matter how much <a href=https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf rel=nofollow>evidence</a> is presented that the Russians are were and are hacking to affect political happenings in this country, there are those who keep saying that they see no evidence and it's not happening. Very similar to climate change denial, "There's no evidence for it, in spite of all the presented evidence, therefore it's not happening."<br><br>I don't think that for a minute that any Trump supporter would hold to that line if the evidence was that a foreign government had helped Clinton to win instead of Trump. The yelling and screaming would be earsplitting and there would be shrill calls for cyberwar and likely calls for armed resistance to invalidate the election.<br><br>I know enough about what goes on in tracing hackers to know that Trump is lying his head off about this. It is quite possible to be very sure of the origin of hacking attacks. And his excusers/supporters know this. But they want that one item that they support so are willing to excuse everything else, no matter how bad.<br><br>Just look at how people who say "But Trump has saved so many jobs!" The reality is that either what he says (2000 jobs saved) doesn't match reality (800 actually saved, only to be eliminated in a year by automation), or he takes credit for something he didn't do "I made Sprint bring 5000 jobs back to the US"(Sprint announced this in April of 2015, before he announced his candidacy!)<br><br>Don't think for a minute, though, that the exact same thing doesn't happen with Clinton supporters. For example no matter how much evidence was presented about her flagrant violations concerning emails, her supporters/excusers refused to see it. Those in the military and other sensitive jobs knew what would have happened to them if they'd done the same things. Yet, the only consequences Clinton suffered was to get richer.<br><br>Clinton was a huge supporter of TPP, but supporters only remember her saying she was against it after the big stink about her involvement with pushing it.<br><br>Neither one of the candidates was worthy of the office of President, but because people latch onto one issue and ignore everything else, we were going to get a total disaster either way.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c2533489851323829348 title="comment permalink">1/1/17, 9:22 AM</a><br><br>

My gut feeling is that those negative interest rates will not be available to everyone - unless they have a deposit. ;-)! Of course, people fail completely to understand that negative interest rates are a consequence of peak oil being now many years in the past. Also the economy I reckon reflects the general state of the environment and the higher costs that are being incurred as a result of global warming. If people only understood... You know I lost my entire crop of stone fruit this year, cherries, peaches, apricots and nectarines all due to the crazy weather - they're all gone despite the best practices in place here. The trees have recovered and fortunately the other fruit trees and berries are producing well in their place. But that is how global warming is affecting us - it is in the little things that nobody seems or wants to notice. You know, all of the commercial orchards also took a huge hit this year and I saw organic apricots for sale at about $20/kg. Quality cherries are at about $15/kg. And people were asking why is it so? It is sort of funny, but it isn't really funny. Diversify is the watchword!<br><br>You know the raw and naked self interest when it comes to peoples comments on renewable energy sources sort of revolts me. If someone said to me: I'm installing this here solar power system so that my kids - who will have to live with ever worsening climate conditions - don't end up hating my guts because our simple day to day choices ended up destabilising the planets climate; Well you know I might just give them a big hug because I'd have very warm and gooey feelings for them.<br><br>But no, it is always my economic savings, my rebates, expected rate of return etc. etc. It really is naked self interest and it is revolting.

I’ve lived in both Northern Virginia and the Hampton Roads area and there’s tension already. Where the cut occurs will depend on many factors including the spread / contraction of the NOVA sprawl and resulting demographic shifts. <br><br>However, I would expect a US civil war to be more like a more common insurrection civil war than the US Civil War is typically remembered. Most civil wars especially in the modern era are very localized guerrilla fighting over a board area with or without conventional armies. In many areas, the power of the controlling group isn’t certain and waxes and wanes. It’s marked by targeted attacks to settle more local disputes as part of the larger fighting along with a strong rural / urban divide. Examples of this are the Russian Civil War, the western side of the US Civil War, and the Taliban. Eventually some new independent nations might shake out, for the short and medium term I expect more of a failed state situation with scattered de facto rulers, or complete victory by one party or another after years of brutal fighting. The Logic of Violence in Civil War by Stathis Kalyvas goes into great detail on this sort of conflict and I recommend it.<br><br>Adding to the pile of writing critiques, I find JMG’s writing easy to read and insightful.

It is all very well the Fox News and Russia Todays of this world having their own biases.

There may be about 5% of the BBCs output that is worthwhile and distinctive, however 95% isn't, and maybe by budget 99%. It plays the same ratings game as overtly commercial broadcasters, since it earns money from marketing popular programs for repeats on other channels, or overseas, and there is much trashy entertainment that could just as easily be done by a commercial organisation.

I don't doubt that it'll survive the fall of Industrial civilization and rise again at some point in the future. The fundamental difficultly facing India’s pluralistic culture is that it is under constant assault by Christians and Muslims with financial support from outside the country. It is a project of cultural/religious imperialism. Once the petro-states go into decline (especially the Saudis) I expect a more indigenous form of Islam to once again flourish in India. Similarly once the west goes into decline I expect the Christians to also begin assimilating. <br><br>India and China probably won’t get into a direct conflict any time soon, but that’s only true in the long term if India avoids an imperial project. <br><br>Right now the country is in for a rough ride. On a side note, I do hope some of ADR's Indian readers are trying to find ways to direct the country in the right direction. He's basically handed them the keys. <br><br>As for the United States. The Wisconsin faction is what I call the old guard republicans who current hold power in the state. Gov. Walker and Congressman Ryan aren’t exactly on the best of terms with Pres. Trump. During the elections Walker was strongly opposed to Trump, as was Ryan. I expect them to resist much of Trump’s agenda simply because they profit from the continuation of business as usual. I don’t know what it will be that triggers Trump’s wrath against the old guard in Wisconsin, but I see it happening. Ryan’s actions show that the old guard still think that the old rules apply. <br><br>Regards,<br><br>Varun<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c2612558059385534504 title="comment permalink">1/1/17, 6:36 PM</a><br><br>

In fact, most of the people I know here don’t see themselves as Midwesterners but Northlanders. Their ancestors left the boreal forests in Europe and found something very similar in North America. Many I have met are only second or third generation and extremely proud of their ancestry. They speak numerous phrases of Swedish, Norwegian and particularly Finnish, still eat lots of the traditional foods,(even Lutefisk) are staunchly Lutheran and have a much deeper reverence for nature and the land than where I formerly lived. Additionally, there is a sizeable population of Ojibwe whose descendants have lived on the north woods for several generations longer than the Scandinavians. Their identity is greatly impacted by ancestral ties to the boreal forests and waters. <br> <br>I suspect you are correct in your assessment about the South’s future. As someone who is three-quarters hillbilly my ancestors have lived in Appalachia and later the Ozarks for nearly 300 hundred years. I agree that the South is a unique culture. Your comment makes me wonder if the ones who may suffer the worst identity crisis will be ones who have family and ancestors from differing parts of the country and no real ties to a particular land and the culture that develops around living on/with that land.<br><br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c6755112152160762923 title="comment permalink">1/1/17, 8:50 PM</a><br><br>

This would be true if the PV universe were alone in the world, but it is not. Every PV installation built displaces a similar capacity of other fuel sources, and if the source mix shifts rapidly to PV, the CO2 saved in operation likely more than compensates for the net CO2 produced by PV manufacture compared to fossil fueled plant manufacture.<br><br>The concept that locally manufactured PV installations are vastly more efficient from an EROEI standpoint than ones made in China and transported around the world is good to remember.

It seems to me that moving to a federal system would be a workable way to maintain some of the advantages of the current US while ditching some of the most pervasive problems -- but the way things are moving, partition (either peaceful, as in <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i>, or the opposite, as in <i>Retrotopia</i>, seems like the most likely outcome for me. <br><br>Maxine, good! I'm not at all certain, though, what "getting medieval" on the raspberries amounts to. Will you dress up in a houppelande and a wimple and sing "Sumer is Icumen In" at them? ;-)<br><br>Rita, exactly. Every society practices triage in one way or another, and the divergences are simply who does it and what the criteria are. <br><br>Fattigman, thank you. I won't. <br><br>Anastassia, excellent. I distrust Weißbach et al. on the basis of first principles, as their claim that nuclear power has higher net energy than petroleum conflicts with the constant and severe economic difficulties nuclear power has had wherever it's been installed -- and that's without adding in the costs of storing the wastes safely for millennia! So much of the debate over EROEI has been a matter of advocates of nuclear power and renewables pointing at each other and saying "Your power source is uneconomical" -- and I tend to think both of them are right. You're also quite correct, of course, that electricity is only a small piece of the picture, and next to nobody is talking about the larger issues...<br><br>Sunseekernv, I'm not surprised that you don't like Prieto and Hall! Until I see more detailed, whole-system analyses of actual built PV systems, though, I'm going to remain deeply skeptical of your claims. (And your attempt to tell Cherokee that he ought to be getting much more power from the sun than he actually gets is to my mind a dead giveaway that you're not dealing with the gritty realities of solar power.) I certainly agree that solar and wind power, along with waterpower, biomass, and human and animal muscle, are going to be the power sources of the future, since that's what will be left; I also agree that massive conservation and lifestyle change is a precondition to any transition to renewables...but it's quite possible for solar PV, say, to be quite a bit more viable than algal biodiesel (enough, for example, to repay part of the cost of that 300 GW buildout) but still not be able to hack it in the real world. <br><br>With regard to subsidies, by the way, it's entirely possible that at this point no energy source used by industrial civilization is actually paying its way. The accelerating collapse of infrastructure and standards of living in the US and elsewhere could be a symptom of early stage catabolic collapse, as every other form of capital gets gutted to keep the energy flowing.

The conservation laws of physics and the human inability to plan for the future can be counted on. But whether Trump will choose to pull back from military adventurism or send the fleet after the first country that gets under his thin skin remains to be seen. He is going to be taunted by hawks in his party in the US and by leaders abroad. They will call him weak if he doesn't use the military, and he won't be able to bear that. I fear the Obama administration will be viewed as our least militaristic era in the early 21st century. <br><br> The global military/economic/diplomatic arrangements that have existed since the early 90s are likely to change. And it could change rapidly in 2017 or we could muddle along. Very hard to predict. I would watch China/Japan/US relations most closely. Russia is loud but economically weak. The Middle East has long been unstable but I don't see a predictable flash point in the coming year. China is a huge force economically, militarily, and has huge influence across Asian and much of Africa. If the Chinese and Trump find a way to get along, we could do ok for the next few years. But it is quite possible that the war of words about economic issues degenerates into nationalistic power rhetoric in 2017 leading to a new cold or maybe even hot war between the US and China. Japan will be a stabilizing force. Together with S. Korea they have almost half of China's GDP. Don't forget that China is internally unstable with a political system that may not keep power if economic growth reverses for a year or two. I can imagine anything from a major economic setback from a civil war, to a relatively peaceful turn to democratic socialism, to a harsh clamping down by the communist party with moderate economic consequences. <br><br>When the next oil price shock happens, we need to watch Europe. Balance sheets in Greece, Italy, Portugal, Ireland still look very bad and the UK and France are not far behind. Another shock with the UK weak from a weakened pound and the inevitably divisive Brexit negotiations could destabilize the whole project. We should keep watch for who loses and who wins if the EU partially disintegrates.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c3533357210108267662 title="comment permalink">1/2/17, 10:19 AM</a><br><br>

And that same selfishness can be used to direct people toward less destructive lifestyles without them even being aware of it. A couple of examples from my small business: <br><br>Much of our work is selling HOME COMFORT to wealthy techies (who already live overly comfortable lives), by retrofitting their homes with appropriate sealing and insulation and fenestration. They are mostly oblivious to the dramatic decreases in heating fuel use that is our real goal.<br><br>Similarly, we sell HISTORIC PRESERVATION to the same crowd, usually by restoring and upgrading exisiting original wooden or steel windows to perform on par with the best new windows. The value they perceive for this work is mostly status, and again they remain ignorant of the resource conservation that is our real goal.<br><br>And (somewhat depressingly) I use the same strategy in my personal life. I'm currently working on a wood-fired masonry heater as the primary heating appliance in my own home. The whole family looks forward to indoor fires, but of course the real goal is to leave my kids a home that they can still enjoy once utility power gets too scarce or expensive.<br><br>The take home lesson for me, having done this work for two decades, is that trying to change minds is outside my skill set. That's a job for my betters (such as our gracious host). But I can still do right by myself and for others, even if they don't care.<br><br>Cheers to all and a very happy new year-<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c8886290200180347541 title="comment permalink">1/2/17, 11:47 AM</a><br><br>

(Clinton would also be dangerous in that under her administration many major problems would have continued to be swept under the rug but I believe her administration would have been less reckless than Trump’s will be and the results less chaotic and thus more salvageable). I do wish to point out that the bad effects of Trump and his administration of billionaire crony capitalists and hard-right wingers may not be fully apparent immediately and reserve the right to assess the long-term results of his actions, as well as immediate effects. <br><br>I am sorry that you think I simply buy a line – I am trained as a researcher, read widely in publications out of the mainstream from a wide range of perspectives, and consciously choose to try to understand the viewpoints and information of people with whom I disagree so that I can modify my own conclusions if I find concrete evidence to the contrary. I have not found any evidence so far that reassures me about Trump.<br><br>I am sorry to hear that you regard the real-life effects of bigotry, misogyny, and fraud on the part of politicians and leaders as issues you are not interested in. Republicans have proven over the past 8 years that they care nothing about the good of the country and are quite happy to throw everyone but their fellow Republican politicians and moneyed elites under the bus – Trump has now made his deal with them, fully embracing their agenda to privatize everything in sight and institutionalizing “pay to play” in all aspects of life. I fail to see how this will do the rest of us any good. <br><br>I do appreciate the way in which your blog promotes actual discussion.<br><br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c7715415366556625417 title="comment permalink">1/2/17, 12:49 PM</a><br><br>

Do a web search for "pvwatts vs reality" and one will find for most<br>people it's within plus/minus 10% in any given year.

Something seems wastefully wrong.<br>There <i>could be</i> a good external reason for that - I used Melbourne as it was near his latitude, but he could be in some mountain valley with fog and clouds MUCH MUCH more than the weather stations in Melbourne, or have shading issues that wouldn't be apparent without a tool like Solar Pathfinder or similar. But saying "clouds" without some numbers isn't proof.<br>Even notoriously cloudy Seattle is 64% of Spokane in December - not (less than) 50%.<br><br>One of the gritty realities of PV systems, particularly small ones, is that they are often <i>not</i> properly commissioned,<br>or they break silently (a string wire is improperly connected/becomes disconnected - birds/rodents on the roof?, module diode shorts, combiner box fuse blows, etc.) and either nobody checks at all or they just look at the inverter statistics which shows total power generated, but not to a string/module granularity.<br>(one of the advantages of module level inverters/optimizers, besides array disconnect, is to have per-module data).<br>People see the inverter lights saying "status OK" and they're getting power out (batteries charging off-grid, meter running backward grid-tied), so they say "fine" when things are not as fine as they should be.<br><br>If I had a system that only put out HALF of what PVWatts said it should, I would not dismiss this as clouds WITHOUT ACTUAL MEASUREMENTS.<br>I would look at each string's output, a clamp-on DC ammeter is simple enough, they should be within a few percent of each other with steady sky conditions.<br>I would track inverter stats closely, even hourly, for a while.<br>I would consider getting a home weather station with solar radiation sensor - Davis makes some nice ones with optional solar radiation sensor, around $800 U.S. total. Nice for gardening as well. Compare kWh/m^2/day measured vs. predicted.<br>If there is any possibility of shading, I'd break out the Solar Pathfinder - have any trees grown up, ...?<br>Any leaves/debris up there? Depending on how the modules are wired inside, could be major power loss to half cover a single cell.<br>Maybe even get a PV reference cell or small module that comes with its particular IV curve data and check the strings/modules against that.<br>The last thing I'd do is say PVWatts is full of beans.<br><br>Now, if Cherokee has done something like these tests, then we can talk about that data.<br><br>Not being concerned that a decent modeling package like PVWatts and a PV system output disagree by such a large amount seems odd.<br>Seems like getting a new car the EPA says gets X miles per gallon, finding one is actually getting X/2 mpg and saying "ok, no problem, I got bad roads here". 10-20% less, sure, but 50% less?<br><br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c221922112240307228 title="comment permalink">1/2/17, 9:15 PM</a><br><br>

It had a collection area of 46 hectares (hectare is 100 x 100 meters).<br>Assume it gave 24x7 power, compare to a PV system.<br>rule of thumb, PV capacity factor of 20%, so we need to overbuild by 5x to get 24x7 power, derate for battery loss, make it 6x.<br>6 x 50 kW is 300 kW.<br><br>How big is 300 kW of PV?<br>Assume 15% efficient modules (nothing special).<br>AM1.5 spectra is 1000 W/m^2, so we get 150 W/m^2 for module.<br>Module area is 300,000 W / 150 W/m^2 = 2,000 m^2 or 1/5 hectare of modules.<br>Ground packing factor is something like 1/5 to 1/10 for fixed tilt arrays, so we end up with 1 or 2 hectares vs. 46.<br><br>How much will it cost?<br>Utility scale PV is around $2/Wp (300 kW is kinda small, maybe we use $2.5/Wp) = $750,000.<br>Storage of 300 kWh for let's say 20 hours: Lithium-Ion capex of 400 $/kWh, x 300 x 20 = $2,400,000.<br>Large scale solar updraft is $6/Wp. 40kW x 6 = $240,000<br><br>Well, that's a heck of question isn't it. Should be much cheaper.<br>But wait, go get some real numbers, not just "50 kW max output" and "assume 24x7" (one of the touted advantages).<br>https://architecture.mit.edu/sites/architecture.mit.edu/files/attachments/lecture/SolarUpdraftTower_Project.pdf<br>Table at the top of page 7 - it only reaches that output for a few hours a day in June.<br>Call it 275 kWh/day at 50 kW max power = 5.5 full load hours a day - in Spain!<br>This is a PV-like capacity factor!<br>So we only need 275 kWh of storage for the PV system, or 400 x 275 = $110,000.<br>So for 1 or 2 hectares of land, plus $860,000 we have the equivalent of an updraft tower that won't fall over (like the one in Manzanares did).<br>And we save 44 hectares of land (109 acres). At $10,000/acre (cheap land), that's 1.09 million dollars. Goodbye any economic advantage.<br><br>Eyeballing the chart, the power drop-off in winter is far worse than a PV system with tilted modules,<br>so the PV system is better on that count.<br><br>And I didn't recalculate the PV array to only get 275 kWh/day, now it's only like 60 kW.<br><br>Moral of story: a lot of schemes (and I do mean a LOT) just don't pencil out with even a rudimentary analysis.<br>But fantasy sure seem appealing. It's nice to think about inventing the one big thing that will save the world,<br>but the vast majority of inventions never go very far.<br><br>Flat panel PV is widely applicable, scaleable from watts to Gigawatts, fails at the module/string/inverter level so most failures are partial, and amenable to getting cheaper because of a generic industrial ecosystem.<br>Concentrating PV/solar thermal power needs high DNI, is only applicable to utility scale, often fails at the whole plant level, and has/will never developed the scale to have an industrial ecosystem - everything is custom, thus expensive/unproven.<br><br>Which (partly) explains why there are 300 GW of PV in the world, but only like 5 GW of CSP.<br>I think there are good reasons (not all strictly technical) to dismiss or at least denigrate certain things.<br><br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c3276956490235734932 title="comment permalink">1/2/17, 11:10 PM</a><br><br>

If ever I saw an essay that was purportedly from you, in that particular style I would know that this time they hacked your account properly! Hehe! Of course, you may also be pranking us just to make a point? ;-)! The contrast would be pretty funny you'd have to admit?<br><br>I was reading Overshoot today over lunch and the author was discussing "niches". It occurred to me that in a world of saturated internet content, that writing in your own niche is an excellent adaptive strategy. Madmagic is probably very perplexed by your response. In fact, when people inevitably ask me about future strategies I always advise them to seek the niche that is not saturated with people and their demands. They don't always appreciate receiving that advice, but that is the hazards of the professional wizard, don't you think so? ;-)!<br><br>Thanks also for your support, I really appreciate that. Attacking the installation rather than the technology is a common strategy of true believers. It is not for no reason that I publish the real world statistics of the solar power system here for three weeks either side of the winter solstice. It is a real touch and go time for me with electricity. And this year, I used the petrol generator for about (from memory) six hours and that was the first time in three years that I'd used the generator and I felt really guilty about doing so.<br><br>The other thing I always find to be really strange is that people inevitably say: "Just chuck the solar PV power systems out there in the desert". It is almost as if they feel that nothing and nobody is there already. And the power losses to heat over those immense distances are not funny at all. Both the connector between this state and Tasmania and South Australia have broken recently so that technology is a big call. I never read anybody saying that they would happily live next to a huge commercial sized solar PV array. Or better yet, they'd happily cover the 2,132 km² of Snowdonia National Park with solar panel arrays. Just sayin...<br><br>As to the changing climate, oh yeah, I hear you. That train is running way ahead of schedule and the models that are released from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are watered down and then treated as if they are the reality - as if humans can negotiate with nature (of which we are all a part of). And then the risks are downplayed in the media. Sometimes, I feel as if I'm living in a cult and people have way too much to lose by taking a good look around them and seeing things as they are, so they keep on keeping on. I dunno...<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c3859878407190832989 title="comment permalink">1/2/17, 11:41 PM</a><br><br>

Re, your specific predictions: it feels to me like one of the other things that happened with many of them was that they were largely contingent on the way some of the other upheavals of 2016 were going to play out. A PV solar boom may well have happened under Clinton, but under Trump, the same issues are likely to be paved over in a similar manner to what happened under Reagan, with formerly off limits deposits on public lands and in formerly protected areas being opened up for drilling, and reductions in emissions regulations that boost the return over investment on fossil fuels somewhat, while increasing the externalities those regulations are there to mitigate. It really does look like we're heading right into one last big collective binge, right when the bills are coming due... A PV boom may come on the heals of that, but by then, there may be too many issues of the existential variety being faced by policy makers to give such things immediate thought. The other two issues seem similarly tied to the outcome of some of the political shifts going on right now... A tech collapse definitely did happen at the beginning of the year that looked an awful lot like 2015's oil collapse... and by autumn that, in tandem with several other issues (including the aftermath of the fracking bust) did look like they were about to throw the economy to the bears, but at the very last second Trump's election led a surge of speculation in manufacturing and infrastructure that paved over the other weaknesses. The Saudi Arabia situation is likely headed towards a fast conclusion now that Russia is likely to be moving to the center of the stage in that region. I expected their economic crisis earlier this year to be enough, but now given Russia's interests in the region and their backing of Iran, they will probably give things a nudge as soon as they're confident that they can do so without interference from other major nations with interests over there (such as the US). Had Clinton gotten elected, the US may very well have come to their aid in the form of various subsidies, and Trump is still on the opposite side of most of the rest of his own party when it comes to foreign policy, but right now everything is pointing towards Russia becoming the dominant power in the Middle East. At any rate, whatever 2017 holds... it won't be boring. I'm looking forward to seeing what you have to say as whatever this year holds comes crashing down around us.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c271245317443049658 title="comment permalink">1/3/17, 8:40 AM</a><br><br>

The last two days have been seasonably short (in Maryland), and very wet. My 5.25 kWp solar panels have produced 1.1 and 1.9 kWh each day. Peak output yesterday was 225 Watts. Without the big nuclear "backup system" half-way across the state, we'd be eating cold canned rations by crank-lantern light, and burrowing under blankets in no time.<br><br>Last January, after a big snowstorm, we went four consecutive days with zero output, due to the shading effect of snow on the panels. (Even 10% coverage, e.g., with snow slumped to the bottom of the panel, shuts them down, even if the rest of the panel is in full sun. I've seen ground-mounted panels with snow piled in front of them, and thought "If you'd only made your mounting posts a foot higher...")<br><br>And, on a technical note, my 21 panels have individual DC/DC power converters, so even though they're wired in series, any number of panels can drop out without reducing the efficiency of the others. I can review production on a panel by panel basis. The telemetry system shows me that one panel suffers for part of the day from a shadow cast by the chimney. The telemetry also revealed that the installer didn't quite complete the installation, because only 19 panels were producing when I first turned on the system. It takes some minutes for the master inverter to coordinate the control of the per-panel converters, and I re-ran the final installation step to get all 21 coordinated. The projected year-round power that the model promised us was slightly less than we actually generated, so I see sunseekernv's point about looking for problems. Would I have been happy with the output of 19 panels, instead of the 21 I paid for? Probably!<br><br>(To be fair to the installer, he and I talked about that final step as we ran out of daylight before it was done. Rather than have him come back on the next sunny day, we agreed that I'd check back on it to verify and/or complete the process. But I'm an electrical engineer; I'm not sure the typical owner would do what I did.)<br><br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c6167525308114361722 title="comment permalink">1/3/17, 3:53 PM</a><br><br>

I lived there for six years, but checked the climate charts to be sure my memory had not mellowed the reality. I was raised in Central California, which means I was used to dry, hot summers, reaching the mid to low teens. But for Reno the charts show highs in the low 90s (F). Remember that the Great Basin is relatively high altitude--Reno at around 4000ft. That does bring up the subject of how altitude affects solar panels. Does anyone have reliable data on that?

Very similar to climate change denial..."<br><br>But then in your PDF file, you admit that what you linked to previously with the word "evidence" was not actually evidence, but "[an] outline for the general reader." However, you speculate that "a real report [...] has most likely been provided to required members of Congress."<br><br>On the other hand, Rep. Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee-- that would be one of the "required members of Congress", yes?-- has stated that there is no clear evidence linking the Kremlin to the DNC hacks, just "lots of innuendo". Should I take his word for it, or yours?<br><br>When you say "no matter how much evidence is presented" it implies that you or someone, somewhere, has presented some kind of evidence, but that simply is not the case. It is not "denialism" nor "dementia" to ask you to back up your claims with evidence. Please do so. This fabled "real report", not general outlines of unsupported assertions, is what we all want to see.<br><br>(BTW, Cyrillic characters in a file's metadata is not evidence of anything.

The reason for the inability to utilise all of the energy produced by the solar PV panels is that the chemistry of batteries is such that they have to absorb electrical energy at an increasingly diminishing rate so as to reduce the risk of a runaway thermal reaction.<br><br>Before you start saying how inefficient an off grid solar power systems is, the only reason that grid tied PV systems can take any and all electricity produced in the mains electrical grid is that the losses in that system are huge.<br><br>You should be worried and you do not understand how these systems actually work. Again, I recommend you to get some practical experience with this technology before discussing it further.<br><br>If you airily dismiss or ignore this important point, I will not discuss the matter with you any further.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c4965483900783699680 title="comment permalink">1/3/17, 4:49 PM</a><br><br>

An energy source that doesn't need to be pumped or dug out of the ground, that is available nearly everywhere, that will last indefinitely and has no waste products seems to have an edge over the alternatives. In particular fossil fuels....<br><br>An article in Clean Technica brought this up.<br><br><i>The entanglement of the fossil fuel supply industry, banks, commodity traders, and the financialization of commodities currently allows fossil fuel supply transactions to be made in non-competitive ways,” they write. “The immense capital available to those operating the fossil fuel supply chain affords not only economic advantages, but also allows them to side-step regulation.”<br>There are subsidies for production and shipping, not to mention consumer subsidies for fossil fuels, all of which are often overlooked (or intentionally hidden) from public view during political discussion. On the flip side, renewable energy technologies like solar PV are forever placed under the microscope, with every facet of subsidy and benefit subjected to overbearing scrutiny.</i><br><br>https://cleantechnica.com/2016/07/15/new-studies-unveil-true-costs-fossil-fuels-solar-pv/<br><br>What are the subsidies PV enjoys &amp; how do they compare with the competition's?<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c43154887782595759 title="comment permalink">1/3/17, 8:18 PM</a><br><br>

I know there are lots of hard working people in the Golden State, and I do have sense of connection w/other Calif. expats, even though I'm not originally from there. There are many people still there that I'm trying to convince to leave while the leaving is still good. Still, that doesn't mean that Calif. isn't woefully overpopulated for its ecosystem and way too dependent on industrial systems that are going away, and that it is not poised to become the Michigan of the 21st century. Still, I understand that people's non rational reasons for living somewhere often trump the rational ones.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c5249527076919414331 title="comment permalink">1/4/17, 3:27 AM</a><br><br>

Consequences have a randomness that suggest that any such god who might exist likes to throw the dice an awful lot. A careless driver is more likely to die in a road accident than a careful one. But there is nothing even remotely deterministic about this. Plenty of careless drivers literally get away with murder while life-long careful drivers die because of one small lapse or being in the wrong place at the wrong time. <br><br>Scale this up to the level of an entire civilization. Those who suffer the consequences of poor societal choices, whenever these consequences might manifest, are often not those who had the most say in determing these choices. There is often precious little of what we overblown monkeys call "justice" in this process.<br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c8343696811412139481 title="comment permalink">1/4/17, 4:01 AM</a><br><br>

We are at 31 51' south of the equator. The panels are hardly set at optimum being fixed on our roof at an angle of about 20 degrees and facing a bearing of about 30 degrees (ie NNE. Not due north). They also get shaded in the early afternoon by a large Eucalypt in our front garden. Even so over the course of the first two years we generated 4810 and 4854 KWhr respectively. That corresponds to about 13.1 KWHr per day or an average 4.35 kWh/KWp for the whole year. <br><br>The amounts (kWh) generated for each of the calendar months in the first year are<br><br>Sept 373.6<br>Oct 445.7<br>Nov 523.6<br>Dec 539.5<br>Jan 557.9<br>Feb 467.8<br>Mar 479.3<br>Apr 332.8<br>May 289.6<br>Jun 194.7<br>Jul 288.7<br>Aug 317.4<br><br>The lowest amount generated for an entire month was in June with a total of 194 kWh. This represents 6.46 kWh per day or 2.23 kWh/KWp.<br><br>I have included a few interesting statistics from the first year of detailed monitoring.<br><br>The smallest amount generated in a day was on a day in mid-summer. The panels generated a total of 1.45 KWhr on a day with very heavy cloud, raining on and off all day. Light cloud can in fact increase the total generated compared to a completely cloud free day by a few percent. Compare that to our solar hot water system which works well overall, but requires direct sunlight to work and barely generates warm water on a day with complete cloud cover.<br> <br>There were 7 days during the entire year when 3 kWh or less was generated. (ie less than 1 kWh/kWp)<br><br>There were 26 days during the entire year when 6 kWh or less was generated. (ie less than 2 kWh/kWp)<br> <br>The lowest amount generated for any 3 day period was 12.7 kWh for a 3 day period in early June.<br><br>Temperature does affect the efficiency but one has to do careful measurements to notice it. The last couple of days have been sunny and the system generated 22 kWh per day even though the official temperature was 41C (106F), the temperature outside registered 44C in the shade and the metal shovels left in the sun were too hot to handle.<br><br>Over the last 5 years the efficiency seems to have dropped by about 2.5%.<br><br>So far we have generated 25,600 kWh of electricity over the last 5 years and 4 months.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Andrew<br><br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c3314266363192787051 title="comment permalink">1/4/17, 4:59 AM</a><br><br>

I like reading all the comments, and your responses to hold me over until next Wednesday, but I have to admit I am a little surprised by your comments on the Russian "hacking". I've learned from your posts to be suspicious of binaries (hacking threw the election outcome VS "move-along there's nothing to see here") especially when in previous posts you have postulated that Russia and China probably will (or already are) poking around to ferment a little discontent in the US but certainly not to the extent that the US frequently does to the point of arming rebels and overthrowing governments. If I were Russia, I would see a little internet mischief such as the timed release of unflattering information about the less favorable candidate a cheap and easy way to keep a meddling nation too distracted with internal matters to try any Nation Building in my back yard. I suspect this kind of stuff is always happening at a low level, just a part of the intelligence business, but this time the public releases are the "sour grapes" from the Clinton campaign. I cannot imagine our 17 vaunted intelligence services all wanted to publicly admit that this stuff happens all the time and there is nothing they can do about it.<br><br><br><br><a href=a-leap-in-dark.html#c2350490670586992622 title="comment permalink">1/4/17, 5:53 AM</a><br><br>

But the panels that collect the sunshine have a supply/disposal chain than requires energy to operate. There are mines, and refineries, and so on. The panels will not last "forever". If you intend to use electricity when your panels are in the dark, then you need storage. Battery-based storage has a supply/disposal chain, too. And even if it didn't, green plants have their own reasons for absorbing sunshine, and the same photons can't go to both. We may supplement residential consumption with residential generation (as I do), but I can't quite imagine running a steel-making arc furnace on solar power. That sort of thing is currently best done during the night, when the rates are cheap and the base-load generation under-utilized.<br><br>Steam turbines are fine, too, if you don't worry about where the steam comes from. We have plenty of water with which to make steam, and the steam turns right back into water! That water is even more pure than the water we started with.
