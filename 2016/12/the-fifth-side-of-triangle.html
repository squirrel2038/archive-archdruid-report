<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the things I’ve had occasion to notice, over the course of the decade or so I’ve put into writing these online essays, is the extent to which repeating patterns in contemporary life go unnoticed by the people who are experiencing them. I’m not talking here about the great cycles of history, which take long enough to roll over that a certain amount of forgetfulness can be expected; the repeating patterns I have in mind come every few years, and yet very few people seem to notice the repetition. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
An example that should be familiar to my readers is the way that, until recently, one energy source after another got trotted out on the media and the blogosphere as the excuse du jour for doing nothing about the ongoing depletion of global fossil fuel reserves. When this blog first got under way in 2006, ethanol from corn was the excuse; then it was algal biodiesel; then it was nuclear power from thorium; then it was windfarms and solar PV installations; then it was oil and gas from fracking. In each case, the same rhetorical handwaving about abundance was deployed for the same purpose, the same issues of net energy and concentration were evaded, and the resource in question never managed to live up to the overblown promises made in its name—and yet any attempt to point out the similarities got blank looks and the inevitable refrain, “but this is different.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The drumbeat of excuses du jour has slackened a bit just now, and that’s also part of a repeating pattern that doesn’t get anything like the scrutiny it deserves. Starting when conventional petroleum production worldwide reached its all-time plateau, in the first years of this century, the price of oil has jolted up and down in a multiyear cycle. The forces driving the cycle are no mystery: high prices encourage producers to bring marginal sources online, but they also decrease demand; the excess inventories of petroleum that result drive down prices; low prices encourage consumers to use more, but they also cause marginal sources to be shut down; the shortfalls of petroleum that result drive prices up, and round and round the mulberry bush we go. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We’re just beginning to come out of the trough following the 2015 price peak, and demand is even lower than it would otherwise be, due to cascading troubles in the global economy. Thus, for the moment, there’s enough petroleum available to supply everyone who can afford to buy it. If the last two cycles are anything to go by, though, oil prices will rise unsteadily from here, reaching a new peak in 2021 or so before slumping down into a new trough. How many people are paying attention to this, and using the current interval of relatively cheap energy to get ready for another period of expensive energy a few years from now? To judge from what I’ve seen, not many. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Just at the moment, though, the example of repetition that comes first to my mind has little to do with energy, except in a metaphorical sense. It’s the way that people committed to a cause—any cause—are so often so flustered when initial successes are followed by something other than repeated triumph forever. Now of course part of the reason that’s on my mind is the contortions still ongoing on the leftward end of the US political landscape, as various people try to understand (or in some cases, do their level best to misunderstand) the implications of last month’s election. Still, that’s not the only reason this particular pattern keeps coming to mind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m also thinking of it as the Eurozone sinks deeper and deeper into political crisis. The project of European unity had its initial successes, and a great many European politicians and pundits seem to have convinced themselves that of course those would be repeated step by step, until a United States of Europe stepped out on the international stage as the world’s next superpower. It’s pretty clear at this point that nothing of the sort is going to happen, because those initial successes were followed by a cascade of missteps and a populist backlash that’s by no means reached its peak yet. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
More broadly, the entire project of liberal internationalism that’s guided the affairs of the industrial world since the Berlin Wall came down is in deep trouble. It’s been enormously profitable for the most affluent 20% or so of the industrial world’s population, which is doubtless a core reason why that same 20% insists so strenuously that no other options are possible, but it’s been an ongoing disaster for the other 80% or so, and they are beginning to make their voices heard. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At the heart of the liberal project was the insistence that economics should trump politics—that the free market should determine policy in most matters, leaving governments only an administrative function. Of course that warm and cozy abstraction “the free market” meant in practice the kleptocratic corporate socialism of too-big-to-fail banks and subsidy-guzzling multinationals, which proceeded to pursue their own short-term benefit so recklessly that they’ve driven entire countries into the ground. That’s brought about the inevitable backlash, and the proponents of liberal internationalism are discovering to their bafflement that if enough of the electorate is driven to the wall, the political sphere may just end up holding the Trump card after all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And of course the same bafflement is on display in the wake of last month’s presidential election, as a great many people who embraced our domestic version of the liberal internationalist idea were left dumbfounded by its defeat at the hands of the electorate—not just by those who voted for Donald Trump, but also by the millions who stayed home and drove Democratic turnout in the 2016 election down to levels disastrously low for Hillary Clinton’s hopes. A great many of the contortions mentioned above have been driven by the conviction on the part of Clinton’s supporters that their candidate’s defeat was caused by a rejection of the ideals of contemporary American liberalism. That some other factor might have been involved is not, at the moment, something many of them are willing to hear. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s where the repeating pattern comes in, because movements for social change—whether they come from the grassroots or the summits of power—are subject to certain predictable changes, and if those changes aren’t recognized and countered in advance, they lead to the kind of results I’ve just been discussing. There are several ways to talk about those changes, but the one I’d like to use here unfolds, in a deliberately quirky way, from the Hegelian philosophy of history. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That probably needs an explanation, and indeed an apology, because Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel has been responsible for more sheer political stupidity than any other thinker of modern times. Across the bloodsoaked mess that was the twentieth century, from revolutionary Marxism in its opening years to Francis Fukuyama’s risible fantasy of the End of History in its closing, where you found Hegelian political philosophy, you could be sure that someone was about to make a mistaken prediction. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It may not be entirely fair to blame Hegel personally for this. His writings and lectures are vast heaps of cloudy abstraction in which his students basically had to chase down inkblot patterns of their own making. Hegel’s great rival Arthur Schopenhauer used to insist that Hegel was a deliberate fraud, stringing together meaningless sequences of words in the hope that his readers would mistake obscurity for profundity, and more than once—especially when slogging through the murky prolixities of Hegel’s <i>The Phenomenology of Spirit</i>—I’ve suspected that the old grouch of Frankfurt was right. Still, we can let that pass, because a busy industry of Hegelian philosophers spent the last century and a half churning out theories of their own based, to one extent or another, on Hegel’s vaporings, and it’s this body of work that most people mean when they talk about Hegelian philosophy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At the core of most Hegelian philosophies of history is a series of words that used to be famous, and still has a certain cachet in some circles: thesis, antithesis, synthesis. (Hegel himself apparently never used those terms in their later sense, but no matter.) That’s the three-step dance to the music of time that, in the Hegelian imagination, shapes human history. You’ve got one condition of being, or state of human consciousness, or economic system, or political system, or what have you; it infallibly generates its opposite; the two collide, and then there’s a synthesis which resolves the initial contradiction. Then the synthesis becomes a thesis, generates its own antithesis, a new synthesis is born, and so on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the oddities about Hegelian philosophies of history is that, having set up this repeating process, their proponents almost always insist that it’s about to stop forever. In the full development of the Marxist theory of history, for example, the alternation of thesis-antithesis-synthesis starts with the primordial state of primitive communism and then chugs merrily, or rather far from merrily, through a whole series of economic systems, until finally true communism appears—and then that’s it; it’s the synthesis that never becomes a thesis and never conjures up an antithesis. In exactly the same way, Fukuyama’s theory of the end of history argued that all history until 1991 or so was a competition between different systems of political economy, of which liberal democratic capitalism and totalitarian Marxism were the last two contenders; capitalism won, Marxism lost, game over. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course that’s part of the reason that Hegelianism so reliably generates false predictions, because in the real world it’s never game over; there’s always another round to play. There’s another dimension of Hegelian mistakenness, though, because the rhythm of the dialectic implies that the gains of one synthesis are never lost. Each synthesis becomes the basis for the next struggle between thesis and antithesis out of which a new synthesis emerges—and the new synthesis is always supposed to embody the best parts of the old.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is where we move from orthodox Hegelianism to the quirky alternative I have in mind. It didn’t emerge out of the profound ponderings of serious philosophers of history in some famous European university. It first saw the light in a bowling alley in suburban Los Angeles, and the circumstances of its arrival—which, according to the traditional account, involved the miraculous appearance of a dignified elderly chimpanzee and the theophany of a minor figure from Greek mythology—suggest that prodigious amounts of drugs were probably involved. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yes, we’re talking about Discordianism. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m far from sure how many of my readers are familiar with that phenomenon, which exists somewhere on the ill-defined continuum between deadpan put-on and serious philosophical critique. The short form is that it was cooked up by a couple of young men on the fringes of the California Beat scene right as that was beginning its mutation into the first faint adumbrations of the hippie phenomenon. Its original expression was the <i>Principia Discordia</i>, the scripture (more or less) of a religion (more or less) that worships (more or less) Eris, the Greek goddess of chaos, and its central theme is the absurdity of belief systems that treat orderly schemes cooked up in the human mind as though these exist out there in the bubbling, boiling confusion of actual existence. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That may not seem like fertile ground for a philosophy of history, but the Discordians came up with one anyway, probably in mockery of the ultraserious treatment of Hegelian philosophy that was common just then in the Marxist-existentialist end of the Beat scene. Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson proceeded to pick up the Discordian theory of history and weave it into their tremendous satire of American conspiracy culture, the <i>Illuminatus!</i>
trilogy. That’s where I encountered it originally in the late 1970s; I laughed, and then paused and ran my fingers through my first and very scruffy adolescent beard, realizing that it actually made more sense than any other theory of history I’d encountered. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here’s how it works. From the Discordian point of view, Hegel went wrong for two reasons. The first was that he didn’t know about the Law of Fives, the basic Discordian principle that all things come in fives, except when they don’t. Thus he left off the final two steps of the dialectical process: after thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, you get parenthesis, and then paralysis. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second thing Hegel missed is that the synthesis is never actually perfect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It never succeeds wholly in resolving the conflict between thesis and antithesis; there are always awkward compromises, difficulties that are papered over, downsides that nobody figures out at the time, and so on. Thus it doesn’t take long for the synthesis to start showing signs of strain, and the inevitable response is to try to patch things up without actually changing anything that matters. The synthesis thus never has time to become a thesis and generate its own antithesis; it is its own antithesis, and ever more elaborate arrangements have to be put to work to keep it going despite its increasingly evident flaws; that’s the stage of parenthesis. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The struggle to maintain these arrangements, in turn, gradually usurps so much effort and attention that the original point of the synthesis is lost, and maintaining the arrangements themselves becomes too burdensome to sustain. That’s when you enter the stage of paralysis, when the whole shebang grinds slowly to a halt and then falls apart. Only after paralysis is total do you get a new thesis, which sweeps away the rubble and kickstarts the whole process into motion again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are traditional Discordian titles for these stages. The first, thesis, is the state of Chaos, when a group of human beings look out at the bubbling, boiling confusion of actual existence and decide to impose some kind of order on the mess. The second, antithesis, is the state of Discord, when the struggle to impose that order on the mess in question produces an abundance of equal and opposite reactions. The third, synthesis, is the state of Confusion, in which victory is declared over the chaos of mere existence, even though everything’s still bubbling and boiling merrily away as usual. The fourth, parenthesis, is the state of Consternation,* in which the fact that everything’s still bubbling and boiling merrily away as usual becomes increasingly hard to ignore. The fifth and final, paralysis, is the state of Moral Warptitude—don’t blame me, that’s what the <i>Principia Discordia</i>
says—in which everything grinds to a halt and falls to the ground, and everyone stands around in the smoldering wreckage rubbing their eyes and wondering what happened. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
*(Yes, I know, Robert Anton Wilson called the last two stages Bureaucracy and Aftermath. He was a heretic. So is every other Discordian, for that matter.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s apply this to the liberal international order that emerged in the wake of the Soviet Union’s fall, and see how it fits. Thesis, the state of Chaos, was the patchwork of quarrelsome nations into which our species has divided itself, which many people of good will saw as barbarous relics of a violent past that should be restrained by a global economic order. Antithesis, the state of Discord, was the struggle to impose that order by way of trade agreements and the like, in the teeth of often violent resistance—the phrase “WTO Seattle” may come to mind here. Synthesis, the state of Confusion, was the self-satisfied cosmopolitan culture that sprang up among the affluent 20% or so of the industrial world’s population, who became convinced that the temporary ascendancy of policies that favored their interests was not only permanent but self-evidently right and just. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Parenthesis, the state of Consternation, was the decades-long struggle to prop up those policies <a href=../../2016/11/the-free-trade-fallacy.html>despite the disastrous economic consequences</a> those policies inflicted on everyone but the affluent. Finally, paralysis, the state of Moral Warptitude, sets in when populist movements, incensed by the unwillingness of the 20% to consider anyone else’s needs but their own, surge into the political sphere and bring the entire project to a halt. It’s worth noting here that the title “moral warptitude” may be bad English, but it’s a good description for the attitude of believers in the synthesis toward the unraveling of their preferred state of affairs. It’s standard, as just noted, for those who benefit from the synthesis to become convinced that it’s not merely advantageous but also morally good, and to see the forces that overthrow it as evil incarnate; this is simply another dimension of their Confusion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Am I seriously suggesting that the drug-soaked ravings of a bunch of goofy California potheads provide a better guide to history than the serious reflections of Hegelian philosophers? Well, yes, actually, I am. Given the track record of Hegelian thought when it comes to history, a flipped coin is a better guide—use a coin, and you have a 50% better chance of being right. Outside of mainstream macroeconomic theory, it’s hard to think of a branch of modern thought that so consistently turns out false answers once it’s applied to the real world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No doubt there are more respectable models that also provide a clear grasp of what happens to most movements for social change—the way they lose track of the difference between achieving their goals and pursuing their preferred strategies, and generally end up opting for the latter; the way that their institutional forms become ends in themselves, and gradually absorb the effort and resources that would otherwise have brought about change; the way that they run to extremes, chase off potential and actual supporters, and then busy themselves coming up with increasingly self-referential explanations for the fact that the only tactics they’re willing to consider are those that increase their own marginalization in the wider society, and so on. It’s a familiar litany, and will doubtless become even more familiar in the years ahead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For what it’s worth, though, it’s not necessary for the two additional steps of the post-Hegelian dialectic, the fourth and fifth sides of his imaginary triangle, to result in the complete collapse of everything that was gained in the first three steps. It’s possible to surf the waves of Consternation and Moral Warptitude—but it’s not easy. Next week, we’ll explore this further, by circling back to the place where this blog began, and having a serious talk about how the peak oil movement failed. </div>

In other news, I’m delighted to report that
<i>Retrotopia</i>, which originally appeared here as a series of posts, is now <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2016/12/retrotopia.html>in print in book form and available for sale</a>. I’ve revised and somewhat expanded Peter Carr’s journey to the Lakeland Republic, and I hope it meets with the approval of my readers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Also from Founders House, the first issue of the new science fiction and fantasy quarterly MYTHIC has just been released. Along with plenty of other lively stories, it’s got an essay of mine on the decline and revival of science fiction, and a short story, "The Phantom of the Dust," set in the same fictive universe as my novel <i>The Weird of Hali: Innsmouth</i>, and pitting Owen Merrill and sorceress Jenny Chaudronnier against a sinister mystery from colonial days. Subscriptions and single copies can be ordered <a href=http://www.mythicmag.com/2016/12/mythic-1-has-arrived.html>here</a>.</div>

And of course in that process, the synthesis that emerges does not create the "best traits of both parents," but rather a more or less random shuffling that may produce adaptable traits just as certainly as it may produce deformities and genetic diseases. It seems as though, from there, ideas drawn from evolutionary biology and population ecology could be applied on a broader scale. And of course, in that case, some syntheses would be universally maladaptive, others would only work in particular circumstances, and some might be slightly more resilient. I'm not sure exactly how the satirical addendums of the Discordians could be applied to that approach, but it does at the very least, seem like another approach that could be placed alongside it that could salvage the bits of the philosophy that do make sense, while finding a way to resolve it into something that has better predictive power.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c1494655708899768007 title="comment permalink">12/7/16, 1:45 PM</a><br><br>

Consternation certainly reigns among the beneficiaries of the Confusion, who still do not seem to have internalised the fact that the British electorate voted the way it did. And so we have Prime Minister loudly proclaming that we will trigger the Article 50, goddammit - while at the same time there is an ongoing Confusion about who is legally allowed to trigger it, whether the result of the referendum is binding to the Parliament or not, or that maybe we should have another referendum and get a more palatable answer (the possibility of the current, unpalatable answer being confirmed is never mentioned). Meanwhile the EU itself has managed to shake off its initial Consternation, sadly by going back to being Confusing: and so the UK is at odds with Germany which insists on taking all of the toys and shutting the door, while Poland makes effort to become better friends with us.<br><br>All this put together creates conditions for an expanding Paralysis - which already exists to a certain degree, what with the Schrödinger negotiating committees which were (supposed to be) set up to negotiate the conditions of Brexit but cannot negotiate anything yet for an as yet undetermined period of time because their mandate for doing so is unclear.<br><br>And lastly, Chaos is set to remain - we may be maybe stepping away from one trading bloc, but the priciple of free trade is not yet seriously challenged - and so will Discord that results from it.<br><br>So all five stages seem to be running in parallel in late 2016 UK, and each of them can conceivably strengthen in the future.

The basis of my idea is that the reality we experience has a spiritual component of which the physical world of the senses we perceive is merely an outgrowth, and when a society tries to pretend that the core spiritual component doesn't exist or doesn't matter in favor of the material world, we set ourselves up for a nasty fall. This is the "Principle of Mentalism" in the <a href=http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/kyb/kyb04.htm rel=nofollow>Hermetic Laws</a>.<br><br>Our materialism motivated us to set up a global neoliberal order in which the FIRE (Finance, Insurance, Real Estate) aspect of the economy is emphasized and industrial production is farmed out to poorer countries or automated when technologically possible. As you pointed out, this set-up made the upper 20% in the developed countries fabulously wealthy and bent the other 80% over the proverbial table. <br><br>The imbalance this situation created along with peak cheap oil brought us the economic crisis of 2008. And so the upper 20%'s worship of the material world and its artifices made them impose a "bailing-wire-and-duct-tape" fix on the global neoliberal economic order without addressing any of the underlying problems. Since they were only instituting a turbo-charged version of what they had been doing previously, it made sense that this would increase the intensity with which the most affluent became even more affluent while everyone else suffered worse than ever.<br><br>The thing about the bailing wire and the duct tape is that the ingenious ways in which they have been applied has caused the whole system to keep chugging along far longer than any of us doomers thought was possible (hence the phenomenon of "collapse fatigue"). But the only thing that the bailing wire and the duct tape is really doing is preventing the world economic system from re-balancing itself from the imbalanced state that is increasingly being inflicted upon it. Of course the reason our elites are doing this is that when the balance restores itself, the resulting massive economic dislocation will likely make the legendary Great Depression seem like a Lutheran church-picnic in comparison! <br><br>But this doesn't make the re-balancing any less necessary because the universe always seeks to balance itself out. This is the "Principle of Polarity" in the Hermetic Laws. And the more the re-balancing is artificially postponed, the greater the pressure that will be formed by the universe's natural drive to restore balance. This is inevitable, because reality is always in motion and can't be just frozen in place like some kind of fly in amber, as you pointed out. This is the "Principle of Vibration" in the Hermetic Laws. The circular manner in which it moves is the "Principle of Rhythm" with which Hegel was apparently so fascinated. So the more re-balance is postponed, the more intense the dislocation will be when it finally happens. <br><br>(To be continued. I had some problems submitting this, so I apologize if you receive more than one submission of this post. Hopefully you won't.)<br><br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c7969435328112717255 title="comment permalink">12/7/16, 2:26 PM</a><br><br>

Trump. As regular readers of the comments know, I am not exactly sanguine about what a Trump Administration will mean for this country. But I still think that his political rise is part of the process I am describing here. On the spiritual level of reality, the universe (which includes our collective human consciousness) knows that the more the re-balancing dislocation is postponed, the worse it will be when it occurs (and the more likely that the sheer intensity of it could make us do something very stupid like end up in a nuclear war out of sheer desperation). So something must be brought into the picture to precipitate the re-balancing dislocation so that the resulting fall doesn't destroy civilization and humanity from too much pressure being allowed to build up.<br><br>I think Trump will be a disaster, but on the cosmic level, he needs to be a disaster in order to precipitate the next stage of catabolic collapse that has been delayed for far too long. And Hillary Clinton being the worst possible candidate to oppose Trump was part of this cosmic process to make sure Trump gets into the Oval Office, even if only by a whisker, to act as this necessary agent of chaos. Everything causing everything else and all events happening for a reason is the "Principle of Cause and Effect". So when the Hillary's sanctimonious supporters scream "We told you so, we told you so" when a Trump Administration brings down the global economy, I'll just shrug and reply, "Yeah, so what?"<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c1069710590220777527 title="comment permalink">12/7/16, 2:27 PM</a><br><br>

It's good to see someone other than myself notice this. <br><br>I believe that there is in fact a way to fit the political events and trends that have emerged since the end of the cold war into a semi-Hegelian worldview. The kind of capitalism we had during the early 20th century, where the economic elite controlled a much smaller portion of total economic activity than today, and the political elite could be counted on to represent people other than the economic elite, is a synthesis. Its antithesis was socialism, where the political elite controlled economic activity. The emergence of the synthesis ("corporate socialism") began in the United States during and after WWII, when the economic and political elites began co-operating much more closely. This process began when auto companies were temporarily turned into defense contractors during the war, but afterwords the economic elite acquired a much more equal footing with the political elite. It was essentially completed in the 1980s under Ronald Reagan. A similar synthesis emerged in China due to Deng Xiaoping's capitalist reforms, and spread to the former Soviet Union after the cold war ended. The shape of the antithesis of the synthesis is not entirely clear yet, but will become more so as the current populist uprising becomes the new political establishment. <br><br>The main difference between this theory and Hegelianism is that none of the stages is necessarily an improvement of the past one. I would also categorize the fourth and fifth stages added by the Discordians as part of the emergence of the antithesis of the synthesis.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c7529663824351262208 title="comment permalink">12/7/16, 2:42 PM</a><br><br>

(You want the one where the volumes are titled <i>The Eye in the Pyramid</i>, <i>The Golden Apple</i>, and <i>Leviathan</i> -- Robert Anton Wilson wrote a couple of others on his own, and they were frankly not as good.) <br><br>Stunned, delighted to hear it. No multiple postings, btw -- it came through alone and intact. <br><br>Mister R., well, we'll see, won't we? From my perspective, as I've noted here repeatedly, the issue with predictions of collapse is that they fixate on fast collapse fantasies and so fail to notice the collapse that's already well under way, and accelerating, around us right now. Thus I think you'll be disappointed in your prediction; the massive crash so many people have been expecting won't occur -- but what will occur is a ragged, unsteady, but ongoing decline in standards of living and quality of life throughout the industrial world, which will have the same effect in the long run. <br><br>Ezra, sure, you can use a different quasi-Hegelian analysis if that works better from your perspective. To quote an old adage, "Discordians must always stick apart." <br><br>Austin, excellent! That just earned you tonight's gold star, decorated with holy hand grenades. <br><br>Shane, oh my. I was wondering when that was going to happen. Can you describe the pushback in more detail? This is actually of some importance. <br><br>Wendy, depends on what you've already done. Have you weatherstripped, insulated, done all the usual conservation things? Have you glanced through the Green Wizardry book or its equivalents, identified projects that would fit your needs and resources, and gotten going on at least one of them? If your employment depends on cheap abundant energy, are you making arrangements to do something else for a living? It's all the same stuff I've been talking about all along -- it's just that for a little while, you'll be ahead of the rush.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c5914950207873530159 title="comment permalink">12/7/16, 4:59 PM</a><br><br>

Most of the cost for natural gas is the fixed (connection) cost. It also helps that I set the thermostat to 15C in the winter. The roof is painted white - that is another cheap step that has great ROI on both heating and cooling.<br><br>- I make bread at home using a "rain" starter (just some dough that I left in the rain for a bit last summer). I am too lazy to knead so I just double the dough once a day for a week. It works! Also pickling, cooking etc. I haven't eaten outside in a long time.<br><br>- I have some fruit trees (work in progress).<br>- I learnt how to build houses, repair most things around the home, prune trees etc.<br><br>The biggest step for me was to detach from the work stress. I do my job and go home.

I don't doubt it has its' uses, but I can't help thinking that you might be somewhat overthinking the recent unpleasantness. What I am seeing is that some arrogant, spoiled people got told no. In no uncertain terms. They don't like being told no, and it wasn't supposed to happen to them and so on, and besides that, a lot of them are out of jobs, or the shiny new positions they were promised just went bye bye, and so, being ill bred oafs and oafesses, they are staging a major squalling tantrum.

At the moment, I'm learning to culture sauerkraut (raw cabbage preserved by fermentation in salt brine). Why? Because I read (in Wikipedia, I think) that, just as the British navy carried limes as a source of vitamin C to prevent scurvy, the Germans carried sauerkraut. In a world where fresh, vitamin-rich citrus fruits don't get trucked to Maryland from Florida during the winter, vitamin C might be scarce.

Lack of funds don't permit much, though I did buy outlet insulators and will install them as my next step). I am chipping away on various projects/skills and things designed to cushion us a little. I guess it was kind of a silly question to ask - of course it depends on what I've already done and of course there's a massive list of things yet to do. I'll admit to recognizing how far we (as a family) can/will fall to collapse relative to what feels like my meager preparations. I'm casting about out of worry. Sorry 'bout that.<br><br>--<br><br>On another topic, had anyone noticed whether, in the aftermath of the Oakland warehouse fire that killed 30+ people, media reports tended to focus mostly on the "artsy" aspect of place without coming out and naming it for what it was: a tenement house? For all the talk about coastal elites and how CA is not to be taken as the reality of the rest of America, I think that this can be seen in another light (ie. not just alternative types living in their boho commune - but as young people effectively shut out of the housing market and making a go of it in an illicit and unsafe way). The plight of many here, while grim and terrible like other parts of the US, hasn't translated to political fed-up-ness, for some reason. I did read quotes from people who were living in the "Ghost ship" who survived the fire and at least one person noted that she was effectively homeless and on the street after this, but the parallel between tenement housing (and tenement fires) wasn't drawn.<br><br>And one last off topic sharing of current events. The president of the UC system has stated that she won't do anything to aid federal powers, once Trump is installed, in the gathering of information about undocumented UC students or in the enforcement of immigration laws. Apparently she's above federal law. Meanwhile, as a Master Gardener in my county, I'm prohibited from sharing any information about the now-legal-in-CA cultivation of marijuana because it's against federal law and the university doesn't want to jeopardize federal funding. Uh, mental disconnect much?<br><br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c7981433283133136413 title="comment permalink">12/7/16, 7:13 PM</a><br><br>

Novels and films, for instance (though the falling-action and denouement tend, for reasons of suspense, to be relatively short compared to the first three). Similarly the five stages of grief and the five stages of collapse.<br><br>But another way of thinking about this is that whenever you have five points arranged in a line, you have four spans between them. And it's interesting to see how often the number 4 comes up in nature and mathematics, especially when it comes to cycles.<br><br>In a cyclical process, the end ("point 5") of one cycle is also the beginning ("point 1") of the next. Midnight tonight, sunrise, noon, sunset, midnight tomorrow night. New moon, first quarter, full moon, third quarter, new moon of the next month. Winter, spring, summer, autumn, winter of the next year. In the case of the expanded dialectic, the thesis of the new order is inherently intertwined with the paralysis of the old. Death and rebirth.<br><br>What the religion of progress does, I think, is to forget half the circle. They stop at Point 3 rather than continuing on to Point 5 (which is, of course, Point 1 of the new cycle). Thus you have "undeveloped" (point 1), "developing" (point 2), and "developed" (point 3) countries, which is basically like saying a nation goes from metaphorical midnight/winter/new moon to noon/summer/full moon and just stops there: It is forever summer; the moon is forever full. In reality, nations proceed past point 3 into point 4 (declining), ultimately arriving back at "undeveloped" again (point 5 and, if resources and circumstances permit, point 1 of the next cycle).<br><br>Employing some astrological symbolism, we can reasonabhly say that the religion of progress is enamored with the eastern hemisphere of the sky - the part going from Nadir to Midheaven by way of the Ascendant, which is governed by <b>choice</b> and <b>fate</b>. The fate- and circumstance-ruled western hemisphere, containing the hated Descendant, is virtually anathema to them.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c180205977736014188 title="comment permalink">12/7/16, 7:17 PM</a><br><br>

The bizarre-ity was of course compounded by the fact that Clinton and everyone else had just *watched Bernie Sanders campaign the correct way right in front of their faces*. And now it just continues on and on, into ever greater realms of out-and-out nuts where small facts like that Clinton lost votes from Obama's 2012 turnout in key states are forgotten in favor of vague conspiracy theories about Russian hackers, neo-McCarthyism, and just sort of squeezing one's eyes shut, covering one's ears, and shouting "Racist!" over and over again.<br><br>The Discordian quasi-mock theory of history you've explained here provides a pretty good explanation for all this.<br><br>Upon rereading tonight, it occurred to me that theories of history are strange and dangerous beasts that are best left in the wild of dilletante circles of philosophes or the zoo of academia, never allowed to roam the streets of society and government, where they will only reek havoc.

In future posts we'll discuss how to avoid it. <br><br>Keith, okay, try this one: the Trump administration accidentally helps the American working class by changing some of the things that are hurting the latter, even though Trump's appointees have no idea that this what they're doing. Or this one: Trump's appointees do such a bad job that the reaction breaks the grip of the conservative movement on the US working class and gives Bernie Sanders et al. an opening wedge, leading to a landslide victory for a Democratic candidate in 2020. Or this one: Trump's strategy at this point depends on getting enough leading GOP figures in his cabinet that he can get legislative backing for his plans, and he actually has a plan. Or this one: a significant fraction of the political class has realized that austerity policies have failed so badly they risk destabilizing the US economy and government, and Trump is their front man for extensive reforms. There are others. My point is that overly simplistic models of the future rarely reflect political reality. <br><br>Repent, I'll probably wait for them to appear elsewhere, as Faceplant is way too much of a time eater, and I have little enough time as it is. Still, thank you! <br><br>Pinku-Sensei, yes, I thought I remembered you were a closet Discordian. Wester is funny; presumably that was the day that some messiah or other descended from the living? <br><br>Shane, no, I'm just rambling as usual. I'll write more on that when I think of something else to say, and other issues don't distract me. <br><br>Wendy, good. Of course you're right that the business in Berkeley is simply the latest return to the past, with Victorian tenement slums sprouting again. As for the president of the University of California system, I wonder if it has occurred to her that with a single executive order, Trump could make every university in that system no longer eligible for federally insured student loans, federal research grants, etc., etc., etc. Given that most of America outside the formerly Golden State would cheer heartily if that happened, I suspect Trump will do exactly that if she doesn't back down. Strange days...<br><br>Barrigan exactly. The metaphor I've used is that the myth of progress assumes that after spring comes summer, and after summer comes uber-summer, and after that comes uber-uber-summer, and the harvests just keep on rolling in and winter is a myth. Too bad the universe doesn't work that way. <br><br>Auriel, "emanations of Trump" -- now that sounds like something HP Lovecraft would have a field day with! <br><br>Chris, nope. It's just as stupid in German. <br><br>Matt, oh, granted. They're having a tantrum, and if you've ever tried to talk to a child who was throwing a tantrum, you know how useless that is. Give it a while, and once they've run out of breath and bruised their fists and heels on the floor, some of them will probably figure it out. <br><br>Bob, yes, I know about Thornley; chaos, discord, and confusion are not always safe to be around all the time.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c2833372300038541824 title="comment permalink">12/7/16, 9:01 PM</a><br><br>

That's why Discordianism works better as a takedown of high-falutin' but myopic philosophical idealism, rather than as a philosophy in its own right. To anyone buying a copy of the <i>Principia Discordia</i> as a result of this blog post (and please do so, as it's a hilarious and strikingly insightful read), I recommend that you also pick up a copy of the Taoist classic Zhuangzi. Burton Watson's translation is my favorite. It's possibly the single most overlooked work in all world literature. All Chinese people know large parts of it by heart, but I think Americans by and large have never heard of it. If you're feeling some existential crisis as the Long Descent continues, Zhuangzi is a great book to lead you onwards and upwards.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c4555668497534152774 title="comment permalink">12/7/16, 9:08 PM</a><br><br>

Insulation without careful air sealing rarely works well, and often causes condensation problems, which can and does rot roofs, among other problems. <br><br>2) Most houses have one or more dramatic defects, big holes even, which often cause much or most of the air leakage. These defects (we call them pots of gold) are always hidden, and often associated with built-ins or chases, or are between new and remodeled areas. Finding and fixing these is often more important than weatherstripping and other typical air sealing project. It is almost always necessary to work thoroughly through all of the attic and crawl space. <br><br>3) There are no magic materials or formulas. You just have to go over ALL of the building surfaces carefully, and seal every crack and hole. Often, the biggest problems are in the nastiest, hardest-to-get-to spots.

Your blog is the only reason I would miss the internet.<br><br>I had not heard of the Discordians, but you had me laughing out loud, and I will soon be educating myself. I could use a few laughs. Of Schopenhauer, I am a fan. This is a very curtain-drawing way of shedding light on our situation (predicament?), and I thank you. I am already a lover of reading (no TV for over ten years, never once missed it), and I will never catch up with everything you've introduced me to.<br><br>Wendy: good for you on the gardening, that's probably the most important and most effective thing you can do. I concentrate my efforts on produce that can be stored as-harvested (that is, without extensive or energy-intensive methods), like winter squash, onions, garlic. Tomatoes get canned, and I've made several gallons worth of jam this year from ground cherries, peaches, and hot peppers. Sugar, at least for now, is cheap, and jam is easy. Sauerkraut, as already mentioned, is easy. Shredded cabbage, salt, cram it into a jar, wait. Fruit wine is just as easy - same process (but use sugar instead of salt). If you're interested in any of this, I highly recommend Sandor Katz's Art of Fermentation - he takes the stress out of learning something new.<br><br>A woodstove is not cheap to buy or have installed, but mine paid for itself in eight years, and I haven't paid for firewood for seven years. Of course, if EVERYONE gets a woodstove, there go my sources of free firewood, and hello Peak Wood. The rub, with this, is that unless you're HOME during the day in the winter (to feed the stove), the woodstove doesn't save you much money. Insulation is probably the better route to go for all-around effectiveness. <br><br>In the time of affordability, I guess I would additionally suggest that you stock up on things you can use in times of unavailability. It sounds obvious, but think jars and lids for canning; candles; knives and sharpeners; banjo strings for God's own instrument...<br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c8285989394892183010 title="comment permalink">12/7/16, 11:21 PM</a><br><br>

But I digress, as always.<br><br>The tug-of-war is meant to represent a power struggle between countervailing forces. The rope connects the competing interests and the forces applied to the rope are known as incentives. When the forces are equal, no movement is observed. It goes without saying that there will always be plenty of grunting as each side strives to realize their goal, but it is the movement that we, the audience, are focused on.<br><br>The process of a tug-of-war depends not only on brute strength, but on momentum. A slow movement to one side is in fact a momentum that must be neutralized, then reversed. If one side is able to build upon a momentum, the movement will accelerate.<br><br>In this tug-of-war there is no demarcation point; no line to indicate victory. There is no gym teacher to signal the end of one war and the start of another. There are but two teams pulling in one direction, or another; in opposition, or obliquely. The arena in which this struggle takes place is not a gymnasium, but a mesa. It is an unusual mesa in that it is shrouded in fog, so much so that no one can be sure where the cliff edges are located.<br><br>That the tug-of-war is taking place on a table top is of little interest to our grunting participants. They are too engaged in their struggle to care about uncertainties such as the future. They are driven by incentives, not wisdom.<br><br>During one era of this ceaseless match it came to be that some participants on the team on the "left" began to flounder and die. They were known as the unions. Seizing the momentum, the opposing team turned the tug into a rout. They began to pull everyone, with great enthusiasm, towards the foggy unknown. There were a few observers who tried to shout a warning about the cliffs that lay out yonder, but the "winning" team could not be deterred. Power concedes nothing without a demand, they insisted. As the audience continued to observe, they continued to pull.<br><br>"Let go of the rope!" someone shouts. "Let them have their Pyrrhic victory." Alas this is not an option in an endless tug-of-war where we are all connected. In the olden days, when one team or clan or species overcame another, it was possible to watch without being pulled over the cliff alongside them. Nowadays the stakes are higher, but there is no question of calling an end to this contest, sometimes referred to as the cycle of life. There remains the question of whether such cycles can be managed. In a real life tug-of-war you just join the losing side and lend your strength to it. Physics does the rest.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c7140670685977489252 title="comment permalink">12/8/16, 2:48 AM</a><br><br>

I've nothing to add on the main themes, but the pre-amble triggered a couple of thoughts that may be of interest...<br><br>Firstly, you probably haven't noticed, but the Governor of the Bank of England recently observed that Britain is experiencing it's "<i>first 'lost decade' since the 1860s</i>". This immediately brought back to my mind your recent post on the fallacies of "free trade" (or "laissez-faire", as it was known in Britain in the mid nineteenth century). I doubt many other people made the connection...<br><br>Regarding oil prices, I've been thinking recently about the similarities between market pricing mechanisms and industrial control systems. Please bear with me here... ;) <br><br>Back in my serious home-brewing days, I did a fair bit of tinkering around with PID controllers for both hot liquor and fermentation temperature control. For those who don't know (I know you brew, but I don't know what sort of equipment you use), these systems involve various forms of feedback between sensors and heating (or cooling) elements in an attempt to provide accurate control to a target setting. Critically, they require "tuning" to account for the physical properties of the control loop - for example, how quickly the heating element can actually heat a volume of water, or how well insulated the system is. A well-tuned system will rapidly converge on a set of stable inputs which achieve the target setting. A slightly less well-tuned system will tend to oscillate around the target. In a really badly tuned system, the oscillations will increase in magnitude over time, as the system drives itself into ever-increasing instability. How easy or difficult the system is to tune depends largely on the rates at which various parts of the control system respond - the more slowly the system responds, the more difficult it is to stabilise. <br><br>The feedbacks between oil price and both demand and production seem to function in a similar way, and empirical observation clearly indicates that the system is not converging on stability. The important thing to realise here is that it's entirely possible that the system may fall into the third category (escalating instability). <br><br>Now here's the kicker - as we move to increasingly expensive and complex forms of oil extraction, the difficulty of financing these operations makes it more challenging to quickly ramp production up or down to respond to price signals, which slows the response of the pricing control system, and makes the system progressively less stable. In this case, market forces could well achieve the exact opposite of what conventional economics insists they should, and we could end up with a situation in which the price of oil has almost no relation to the "correct" market price.<br><br>Like I say, not particularly relevant to today's post, but it's an idea that's been kicking around my head for a while, and I thought you might find it interesting...<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c707940401354968872 title="comment permalink">12/8/16, 4:35 AM</a><br><br>

They conceal almost nothing; one might as well be wearing a miniskirt for all the freedom of movement one (does not) have, especially when sitting. Finally, on all but the slimmest women, they are neither comfortable nor flattering, and if you have a lumpy figure, which most of us do, you still have to wear the hated pantyhose under them.

If you are in the middle of the fifth phase of a five phased scheme, it's probably safe to call it a fit, even if the mainstream refuses to see it. This is not to say that the process has no validity, it just seems that it cannot predict how long phases last and what they will look like in their particulars.<br>The whole process reminds me of a summer job I had in a chemistry lab where I had to weigh some vial over a period of time while some reaction was going on and then plot the data points and draw a curve through them. I had a french curve and so I plotted what to me seemed like very nice curves with multiple inflection points, perhaps as many as five. I did this over a period of weeks with the professor never checking on my work. When he did finally look at it, he dismissed my curves as rubbish. Problem was, from my point of view, that he never told me that I was only allowed to have one inflection point. Or as they used to joke in the physics department, if your equation has enough parameters, you can fit an elephant.<br>Don't know if you saw it, Stacy Herbert quoted you on the Keiser Report, broadcast # 1001 link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qgKhZuCyYg around 5:32 in the video.

That was a really fun essay.<br> Many years ago, when I began to really watch social and economic politics compare to history, (how we got where we are from where we were) and try to see the bigger picture; I came up with a theory that the whole thing, social justice, politics, economic philosophy.... was much like a pendulum swing. With or without knowing it, players on both the 'Right' and 'Left' side of values, interests and actions would move the pendulum to the right, until it could not go further - then there would be pushback or momentum to move it to the left. It would start to swing back, gain momentum and get to the furthest reaches of the left, then swing back towards the right again. It has no beginning and no end, and no real point of stasis. It's always moving. And no, it never gets to the 'top' of either side. Neither side ever gets ALL of what they want and hope for.<br><br>A much less sophisticated analogy than either Hegel or Discordian thought, but it still kinda works and I think holds similar ideas to the 5-sided triangle you describe. I will have to further investigate both Hegel and Principia Discordia when I can. Sounds like a fun endeavor.<br><br>@ Chris / Cherokee Organics: Thank You for that comment also. I've been seeing the same phenomenon from a very different perspective. Trying to teach some (ANY!) form of limits to my 4-year-old students, and whenever I engage the parents for reinforcement/support, I get a blank stare. It is clear, there will be no help from that quarter in teaching limits to these little ones. It has occurred to me that they also have little to no experience with the idea of limits. This is not the top 1% or even the top 20%, yet the majority of people here have and CAN get pretty much whatever they want whenever they want. They truly don't seem to get the idea of limits.

The class was a tour de force of philosophical context and explication surrounding the text. But alas, the text itself remained impenetrable. I concur with your assessment of Hegel, his abstraction from Kant is exponentially greater than Kant's from Hume. One bit of gossip, Kojeve apparently said something to the effect that "he who forms an authoritative interpretation of Hegel will rule modern politics." The problem of external validity was apparently irrelevant, though I'm pretty certain it remains, as always, the only one.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c4068063168879922941 title="comment permalink">12/8/16, 7:14 AM</a><br><br>

Makes me wonder if the gangs of Mexico have made a peace of sorts in Mexico (making the factories a good investment and home a viable option for native Mexicans) and are starting to project power into the United States to the north.

Naming vociferous science deniers to positions of greatest influence hardly leads towards hope of furthering the project of protecting the environment, clearly our most important legacy.

Something useful for these colder darker night.<br><br> @temporaryreality (Wendy)<br>Thanks for you commentary on the most unfortunate "Ghost Ship" fire in Oakland, CA this past weekend. I only know rudimentary information about it, but some of the reports I've heard on the local NPR stations - both the one in the SF Bay Area and that in Sacramento - have discussed, albeit briefly, the issues that you bring up - how the warehouse can be likened to a tenement, although NPR commentators didn't use that term. But it's useful. The news programs and commentary I heard did go into some detail about the lack of affordable housing all around the Bay Area, in particular, and about how the majority (if not all) the tennants really had few to no other options in terms finding living/working spaces in Oakland.<br><br>One program discussed how this warehouse "commune" (if you will) lifestyle is something apparently quite common in Oakland going back decades (I have heard about such shared art/living space loft/warehouses for quite a while, but it's anecdotal). One program out of Sacramento listed similar spaces in Sacramento utilized in similar ways for decades, which has contributed to our growing arts "scene." And Sacramento is just getting more expensive.<br><br>There were discussions about how these warehouses are not adequately set up for this use, with the clearly attendant safety issues/violations. <br><br>Some limited discussion has happened in terms of cost of living, lack of any real solutions for low cost housing, etc. I doubt much will come out this, sadly, other than the usual hand wringing, finger pointing and finding someone to blame.

Fond memories of being promoted from Pope to Bishop by R. A. Wilson for helping with a Bicentennial prank involving the Illuminati. I do recommend the uncompleted Historical Illuminati series for a weird take on American History. The titles are The Widow's Son, The Earth Will Shake and Nature's God. <br><br>I find the allegiance of main stream Democrats to the idea of unlimited immigration to be mystifying. For most of them it is certainly not self-interest. None of my friends can afford undocumented nannies. Is it subconscious guilt for enjoying the privilege of life in the US? I mean politically I understand why neither Republican nor Democratic congresspersons have approached a solution, but what is in it for the rank and file? How does anyone imagine that they are benefited by more competition for jobs, university admissions, housing and so forth? Yet I am pretty I have badly damaged a friendship by asserting that, while I would like to see immigration policy undergo a rational reform, I see no problem with enforcing existing laws. Refugees, I granted, are a different problem entirely. <br><br>Given the Brexit vote, do you see a possible redo of the Scottish Independence vote resulting in a Scottish exit in order to align with the Continent?<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c3936514047953613958 title="comment permalink">12/8/16, 10:56 AM</a><br><br>

And so the stories that are told are usually the ones that benefit the story-teller. But these stories are so oversimplified that they don't have any predictive power. I am not sure that the story of a challenge to internationalist ideas of the wealthy by populists that have born the brunt of globalization is any better. Globalization has improved the lives of a lot of people. Look at the plight of the poor in India and particularly China and you see huge gains. Globalization and automation have hurt the uneducated in wealthy countries since it has forced them to compete with uneducated workers around the world and with machines. Moving forward, more of the educated population will have to start competing with billions around the world and with automation for their jobs as well. <br><br> As I see it, the real danger is the siren call of 'non-competitive' economic ideologies. Anyone who tells you that they can stabilize economic arrangements by taming competition is either self-deceived or trying to deceive you. Logic, morality, tradition, religion, patriotism and more are all proposed as bases upon which the nasty competitive nature of reality can be tamed. But at the end of the day, if someone can out-compete you, it is a pretty safe bet that they will. So the best we are going to do is develop constraints that tame the worst excesses of the competition. Trump voters and Brexit voters probably are mostly a small course correction. The real decisions are still to come as we figure out whether there can be a social contract to manage the global competition in our resource and pollution constrained era or whether we will descend into military competition.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c570006430404664816 title="comment permalink">12/8/16, 11:47 AM</a><br><br>

I read the "Illuminatus" trilogy while hitch-hiking around GB in 1979. Those books along with "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" (plus "Another Roadside Attraction"), and all of Carlos Castaneda's books (I know, I know), made me understand that my mind was not limited. In fact, as I may have mentioned before, my relationship with the Geography Dept at San Diego State, where I got an early copy of Dr. Johnson's book, "Muddling Toward Frugality" had put me in touch with the ideas of M. King Hubbert as a young lad. I read the Limits to Growth my senior year in high school, one year after it was published by the Club of Rome.<br><br>In other words, I've been on board for a long time with Peak Oil and awareness of all the other insults that we've been heaping on the thin envelope of ecology that supports human existence. That said, I have begun to question even my long-standing counter-culture beliefs. This after taking a serious look at the UN Agenda 21, which is evident everywhere in local planning and zoning efforts. I've begun to pay real attention to the conspiracy researchers, such as James Corbett at The Corbett Report.<br><br>Enjoying as much as anyone a rapid ride down the rabbit hole, I've been reading books that are opening my eyes to new possibilities. I'm not saying that I'm buying the into it, but M. King Hubbert was a founder of Technocracy Inc, back in the 30s. And, there is an interesting case being made for the effort to bring the planet under the control of a single scientific, shall we say, management. I'm not even necessarily against that in concept, although who is in charge of the hen house is an important consideration. <br><br>The reason I bring this up, is based on your intention for revisiting where this blog all started. Although I didn't get here until 2011, I went back and read every post. This is the notion that I would like you to consider. The supply of oil has always been manipulated to make it appear scarce and more valuable. In light of this, have you read F. William Engdahl's book "Myths Lies and Oil Wars"? With Paris accords and Rio and carbon tax and Agenda 21, Tri-Lateral Commission, Skull and Bones and Technocracy - (Antony Sutton's evidence that western financiers financed both the Russian Re-Revolution and Hitler and China's rise of Yale Man Mao...), does the linear progression to the end of oil still dominate as the critical determinant for the future of global society?<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c4433347523720421216 title="comment permalink">12/8/16, 12:37 PM</a><br><br>

It has helped to understand your nation's political machinations in a way that no news media has done. Thank you for that. I have noticed that this (un)welcome clarity of analysis has caused upset among some of your readers. Phenomenon is familiar from Europe. <br><br>It caused deep resentment to talk with fashionable, green "downshifters" as resently as couple of years ago. Green party is big thing here in Finland; it has even sit in national government many times. But mainstream Green downshifters were peculiar in their view how this contraction and bottleneck was coming; it was very liberal and very political correct contraction they saw ahead of this road of ours. Political problems connected or caused by end of growth politics were duly ignored, if they did not sit well into liberal world view. So this victory of Trump was no surprise for me. It seems to be common feature of human species that people can thow whole geopolitical and sociopolitical segment of their own population under the bus and truly except that nothing is going to happen. That those masses are going to play with the rulebook handed down to them by those not thrown under the bus.<br><br>Sheer stupidity of this approach is astounding. Here in Europe, where working class grassroots movements have been order of the day from late 19th century onwards, their partial metamorphosis into current form of right-wing populism has been more rapid as the grassroots organization was already on place. In your country, it seems that horizontal, grassroots political organizing by common, working or lower middle-class people is not so strong. Because of that, amount of resentment and feeling of externality by large segments of population seem to surprise many in your nation. It has been hilarious (and somewhat sad) to see all these surprised people have same temper tantrums and rage ventilation taking place in your national culture's context that has already been played out by here in Europe a decade or little less ago. Trump spoke about problems they see in their everyday lives. So they voted him, because he represents their interests. It is truly that simple. For the same reason working families here in Europe turned into Social Democracy back in the days, even when elites denounced them for doing that.<br><br>At the same time, collapse of working class neighborhoods into relative lawlessness and rise of embryonic war bands has continued as your catabolic collapse model predicts: one step at time and slowly. But change has been astounding if you look it from decade's standpoint.<br><br>Molding of local, feudal loyalties into "young men warrior societies" has continued uninterrupted, both in native football firms and one-percent clubs, and in Salafist madrassa schools. Same kind of development bloomed in former Yugoslavia as full sectarian warfare. And in the Yugoslavia, it was not those liberal types whom adapted best. It was common, engineering types of men who build all those river turbines giving small-scale electricity into their own house after grid was gone, and whom insulated just one or two rooms from that house to survive through winter. I was there, in international relief context, just after the fighting had ceased. Fresh marks of both human brutality and human ingenuity in extreme conditions was amazing to witness.<br><br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c8903687304922104463 title="comment permalink">12/8/16, 12:41 PM</a><br><br>

Check up on "cliodynamics". It helps a lot to see where the world (well, Europe and the States at least) are in the cycle. It's just at the beginning of things falling apart, not at or near the bottom. <br><br>One of the ways you can tell this is the beginning, and it's downhill from here, is comparing the situation of the elites vs the average Joe. If the average Joe is hurting but the elites are still enjoying life, things haven't gone downhill very much yet. The lowest point is when the heads of the elites have rolled. Except that it doesn't usually happen in the Hollywood movie style: the evil rich people are taken down by the good and righteous little guys, and peace and justice follows. It happens far more often with the elites stabbing viciously each other. Or with somebody taking power by lying to almost everyone about practically everything (yes, Trump, exactly) who then proceeds to destroy just about everything, and in the process, the elites also get thinned down. Sometimes, history does some heavy revisionism on these guys, and that's where the ideas of Hollywood movies came from. The guys of the French Revolution were pretty nasty, but that isn't how they are remembered.<br><br>When things look this bad at the beginning of the downhill, you have good reason to suspect that the slide down won't be pretty at all. I think it isn't unreasonable to expect dictatorship and WWIII. I know, I sound like I've lost it. I hope I'm wrong, but I'm not counting on it.<br><br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c6209191297203509790 title="comment permalink">12/8/16, 1:54 PM</a><br><br>

Oddly enough it was his non-fiction that did it for me; there's some wonderful rhetoric in some of his short essays like "13 choruses for the divine marquis" http://www.alphane.com/raw.htm?marquis.htm. Well, it seemed wonderful to me back then. And the jocular skeptical-skepticism throughout even the weirdest of his non-fiction like Cosmic Trigger is something that always stays with me. I actually never read Illuminatus! fully but your post gives me an urge to correct that at long last.<br><br>I wonder what Wilson would have made of the Archdruid Report. I've been reading your blog since the "Two Agricultures, not one" post back in 2010, with occasional breaks, and I'd say its had as big an impact in my late twenties/early thirties as his writing did earlier. You introduced me to peak oil as a concept, but more generally your detailed exploration of the reality and necessity of limits (resource limits, limits of human knowledge and capability), your "Conservatism" if I can call it that, has been a necessary tonic to Wilson's "Jumping Jesus" faith in informational and technological progress (http://www.rawilson.com/sitnow.html).<br><br>Thesis and antithesis indeed. I'm still working on the synthesis. I'll be looking forward to seeing your correctives vis-à-vis your past writing on peak oil too.

If you treat continual change as the basic rule of existence, you tend to end up with models that work, curiously enough...<br><br>Patricia, the fact that Hillary Clinton favors pantsuits doesn't suggest anything to you but a shoutout? <br><br>Avery, I personally find Lao Tsu more useful, but I won't argue about Chuang Tsu -- I've owned a copy of his works since my first stint in college, and wouldn't be without it. <br><br>Wendy C., you're welcome and thank you! <br><br>Temporaryreality Wendy, delighted to hear it.

And all the while the steady rise in deaths from ordinary microbes, many of which are now immune to antibiotics, goes unnoticed. That's a very solid example of the pattern I was discussing. <br><br>Wendy C., funny. That one's been applied to several other groups in its time, too. <br><br>Jessi, thank you. If you've read it recently, you're way ahead of the curve. <br><br>Jbucks, as I recall, I also mentioned that I'd do that series of posts when I want to reduce my readership sharply; I can't imagine that you'll have a lot of company! Still, I'll consider it. <br><br>Joe, to my mind the fact that 3200 veterans mobilized to help the protest is already a potential turning point -- but we'll see what comes of it. Apparently promising movements have fizzled before (cough cough Occupy Wall Street cough cough), you know. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, ah, well, it was merely a speculation.

Me, I'd rather fuse Schopenhauer and Jung, with just enough Nietzche for seasoning, and see the World as Will and (mis)Representation -- the Will seeking individuation, generally via the school of hard knocks, and the Representations being mucked up with any number of projections of misunderstood unconscious contents -- but that's a theme for a different day.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c5666791544887547503 title="comment permalink">12/8/16, 7:10 PM</a><br><br>

Now add the stages of Parenthesis and Paralysis! <br><br>Librarian, have you tried taking the dream seriously and hosting such a dinner?

That's high praise. <br><br>Spanish Fly, thank you! I'm listening to the Mertens piece as I type this. Odd, but distinctly listenable. <br><br>Bob, okay, but does your model allow you to predict the behavior of social movements? To my mind, that's the point of a model -- it tells you what changes to expect. Your model of the peak oil movement, similarly, is far too simplistic to communicate anything useful to those who want to learn lessons from its failure, which again, is to my mind the point of the exercise. <br><br>Robert, ever since the beginning of this blog I've been pointing out various bits of popular or intellectual culture that don't make sense when applied to the real world -- the myth of progress, the myth of apocalypse, binary thinking, neoprimitivism, the obsession with fast collapse, and the list goes on. Hegel is just the latest sacred cow I've plopped on the barbecue grill. Get used to it; there will be more -- and Heidegger may moo in protest all he wants; he might just be next on the grill. <br><br>Gregorach, yep. That's a good practical example of the way that feedback can cause stabilization, cyclic alternation, or chaos, depending on the way that it loops back into the system. One of the major flaws in contemporary economics is that it assumes the first option by preference, when the last is often the case! <br><br>Brian, the time element's always the issue! My guess is that the timing's essentially unpredictable in advance; all you can do is learn the typical characteristics of each phase, so you can figure out where you are and what's coming up next. <br><br>Phil, that's a workable metaphor as well! <br><br>Wolfgang, the advantage that a qualitative model gives you is that even if you don't know the timing, you can identify where you are and know what's not coming next. When someone insists that the Confusion du jour has settled some social problem once and for all, for example, you know they're wrong, and that the result will gradually turn into a dysfunctional jerry-rigged mess and then fall apart. You may not know when, but you can certainly refuse to buy into the Confusion and begin to quietly brace yourself for the inevitable.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c2714744057015281150 title="comment permalink">12/8/16, 7:47 PM</a><br><br>

That said, I think an authoritative interpretation of Hegel is (a) as inaccessible as Shangri-La and (b) an irrelevance at this point. Fukuyama seems to have been Hegel's last hurrah -- and thank goodness!<br><br>Donald, true enough. With regard to your data point, that's something that a lot of people missed; the loss of jobs has been continuing, and getting worse. It's not a static thing -- and that's one of the things that's driven the working class to revolt. <br><br>RAnderson, again, we'll see. As I've noted before, it would take very little for the Trump administration to be an improvement over its recent predecessors; if Trump can extract the US from the Syrian mess, stand down generally from the endless wars in the Middle East, ditch some trade treaties, and maybe reenact Glass-Steagall, I'll consider it a step in the right direction. <br><br>Matthias, so noted.

That's political competition, and tariffs and other trade barriers are among the classic tools of effective political competition between nations. Look at the way that first Japan and then China built up their industrial economies behind trade barriers; the US did exactly the same thing between 1861 and 1945, and it worked extremely well in all three cases (and others as well). <br><br>Panda, thanks for this! The fact that these are lumped together as "jobs" in the abstract, when they have essentially none of the benefits of the steady jobs they replaced, is an example of the way that excessive attention to quantitative data at the expense of qualitative data produces bad analysis. <br><br>Coboarts, the thing I've noticed consistently is that conspiracy-based analyses of current events pretty consistently lead to inaccurate predictions. Do you recall how, until a little over a month ago, all the conspiracy-based analysts were insisting that the Deep State would prevent Trump from being elected? That's the kind of mistake I mean, and there have been a lot of them. (Engdahl in particular has, if I recall correctly, a long string of whoppers to his credit.) Thus I'd suggest that you reconsider the matter. <br><br>Juhana, exactly. People vote their interests; they don't vote for what elites think their interests ought to be, especially when their interests conflict directly with what the elites want. We're a ways further from warband territory here than you are, at least at the moment, but we'll see. <br><br>Eric, yes, I know. These days a lot of my ideas somehow appear in various corners of the mainstream media, without attribution. No complaints; the ideas are getting out there, which is what matters. <br><br>Izzy, point taken! There was a certain naive idealism common in those days, and long extinct in ours, that made statements like Wilson's seem to make sense.<br><br>Maria, I'm familiar with the cliodynamics theories. If they impressed me, I would have cited them. They don't, so I didn't. Tell you what; if you turn out to be wrong, and we don't get a dictatorship and/or World War 3 in the next four years, will you admit that? <br><br>Morfran aka Rumighoul, I don't at all object to the label of conservative; I consider myself a moderate Burkean conservative, after all. No doubt Wilson and I would disagree sharply about the value of technological progress, not to mention the value of Timothy Leary's contributions to 20th century thought -- I think you had to know the man or something; I've never been particularly impressed. Even so, by all means seek a synthesis -- just remember that parenthesis and paralysis follow in due order! <br><br>Ed-M, Russian history from 1900 to 2000 makes a very good example of the five stages of the Discordian theory of history, no question. <br><br>David, glad to hear it!

I tend to challenge his value judgments about existence -- like all value judgments, I'd argue, those are irreducibly personal -- but his analysis of consciousness and its objects, will and its grades, and so on? Brilliant and, to my mind, utterly convincing. <br><br>Rapier, if you want to insist that it should not have been a liberal project, I won't argue with you for a moment. Unfortunately, it was a liberal project, because liberal parties, politicians, and pundits bought into neoliberalism hook, line, and sinker, accepting an improvement in conditions for a variety of minorities in exchange for turning a blind eye to the cascading economic injustices of the neoliberal project. That said, of course there's a distinction, and it's worth making. <br><br>Donalfagan, be glad you weren't doing involuntary Hegel exercises. To judge by his writings, those involve vast amounts of gas. <br><br>Tim, excellent! True; linear progress is a temporary condition at best, and what follows on the heels of each civilization in history is not a bigger, shinier civilization, but a dark age from which some new civilization must build all over again from scratch. <br><br>Peter, yep -- people always get agitated the first time they see the fnords.

What I liked about Wilson was essentially the clarity of his writing, his humour and his overall attitude to life, and it only took a few hard shoves from yourself on the subjects of resource limits, likelihood of space travel etc for the residual regard for his Leary-themed techno optimism to topple.

This is all reminding me of the bloke trying to fix a problem and is convinced that only a hammer will do because There Is No Alternative. Thus he keeps going back to his tool box and gets out a claw hammer, a ball pein, a sledge hammer, a wooden mallet, a rubber hammer, a power hammer - in short, anything but trying any of the other tools in his tool box.<br> I have to say too that in reading over this essay that at times I am very dubious about some efforts to assign patterns and 'themes' to the study of history in that in can end up like the six blind men and the elephant (http://www.noogenesis.com/pineapple/blind_men_elephant.html). You end up with a partial picture that does not reflect the full reality as may be the case with Hegel's three stages which was extended by the Discordians to five stages.<br> I think that in the end that we are going to have to junk historical, economic and political theories and just do stuff that works - Retrotopia style. If it works, then you keep doing it. It it fails (e.g. austerity) then you forget it and try something else until you find something that works. A bit like how the scientific method is suppose to work. We could do worse than to try this approach.<br> For a bit of light relief and as the essay is on philosophers, may I recommend the film clip at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur5fGSBsfq8 for a demonstration of philosophers in a possible real life situation?<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c548588113691515030 title="comment permalink">12/9/16, 5:10 AM</a><br><br>

That's political competition."<br>First, I am not 'in favor' of competition. I simply observe the reality that those that win the economic, military, (and political) competition control the resources that we all depend on. And those who think they can remove the competition from reality are deceiving themselves.<br><br>Sure, political competition is important. But it hasn't been successful in taming economic competition. In earlier times with much more difficult communication and transportation, some used politics to isolate their economies from global competition. That is great if you can win the economic competition by using political action inside a country to ensure highly competitive industries. But it is nearly useless to win the political competition and lose the economic competition. What usually happens is that political convenience causes governments to shield their non-competitive industries from global competition. Without competition, industries don't innovate and fall further behind. If you can use political action to spur strong industry in a closed economy, that would be great. But the much bigger lesson from history is the Soviet Union and before that Japan and China who failed badly trying to do this. I am not claiming the Anglo forces pushing trade on the far east were 'good'. Just that they won the competition and politics didn't help those were behind economically and militarily.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c650631375548879157 title="comment permalink">12/9/16, 6:42 AM</a><br><br>

Now that is true and it was outright theft, but I have pointed out that it was not as if the ancestors of today's Mexicans once had a country or a civilization there.

To my mind, that's the point of a model -- it tells you what changes to expect. Your model of the peak oil movement, similarly, is far too simplistic to communicate anything useful to those who want to learn lessons from its failure, which again, is to my mind the point of the exercise.</i><br><br>The lesson to be learned from the Peak Oil movement is to refrain from making patently false predictions. World oil production was extremely unlikely to undergo a sharp drop due to the economic factors involved. I suppose an earlier lesson is not to draw a frequency distribution curve just for the sake of illustrating a topic.<br><br>Models are built on an analysis of past behavior and observations of the present. That doesn't mean they will turn out to be predictive tools. Consider Marxism as a model that describes socioeconomics. Can we use Marxism to predict the future? Only in a limited context. Marxism can be used to question the status quo, and to advocate alternatives, but it is useless in telling us how to get there. Leninism, Maoism, Stalinism and the like are all failed attempts at seat-of-your-pants social engineering. The intentions may have been noble (Trotskyists will dispute this), but the complexities proved insurmountable.<br><br>My tug-of-war analogy draws upon the Marxian view of antagonistic social relations, which isn't unique to Marxism when applied to other contexts. It assumes that human beings will act in their perceived self interest. It assumes they will act individually and in groups. For Marxists, this is expressed in terms of Labour vs. Capital, Wages vs. Profits, etc. They describe these relationships as being in conflict due to their opposing interests. For example, the archetypal employee should want to receive the highest possible wage for the least amount of work. The archetypal employer should want to pay the lowest wage while extracting the greatest amount of work. The actual situation is a compromise between those ideals, which will depend on the relative bargaining power of the participants. An economy with high unemployment would tend to favour the employer, leading to lower pay and harsher working conditions. And vice versa. Hence there is tension.<br><br>What some would deride as Marxism others would conclude is common sense. It doesn't take a Marxist to be familiar with the concept of overreach and backlash. These are lessons that can be learned through observation, or from history, if one is willing to learn.<br><br>If a relationship is antagonistic, some form of countervailing force is required to keep it stable or balanced. Removing the bargaining power of labour is analogous to removing the governor in a steam engine. The incentives exist to drive our economic system out of control.<br><br>Can my tug-of-war analogy be used as a model to predict the behavior of social movements? Of course not. There are psychosocial dynamics within social movements that affect its development and conduct. Maintaining solidarity and remaining on target as far as objectives are concerned is an ideal. Sometimes the objective(s) is an ideal. You have covered this and more in previous essays.<br><br>That being said, what does philosophy offer in terms of prediction? How many angels will be dancing on the head of a pin? At least that prediction is specific. I'm having trouble seeing what role philosophy plays in generalized predictions. There is the precautionary principle but that is usually ignored...<br><br>The philosophy of our species appears to be a form of pragmatism. Learning lessons "the hard way" is a feature, not a bug.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c597785196894143983 title="comment permalink">12/9/16, 8:59 AM</a><br><br>

They live deep in the forest, but obviously they have to drink water at the farm dams (which I don't have - and that is just another reason why not (also the dams attract deadly poisonous snakes)) and the deer eat the herbage in the meadows and road sides.<br><br>My belief is that there used to be a deer farm in the valley below way back in the day and when the people sold up, move on, went bust – or whatever, they let the deer loose into the forest. <br><br>To be honest though, if the deer managed to establish a population despite the considerable difficulties that they would have faced, then they are taking advantage of an ecological niche which is in this forest. They're really consuming a lot of vegetation and turning that into manure which should enrich the soils of the forests, plus their tracks will be starting to open up the forest in ways that the marsupials can't or won't do. The deer just have to remember to keep off my apple trees as they eat the bark off them for some strange reason but then that is why I keep dogs who know how to work in a pack.<br><br>Hi Caryn,<br><br>Exactly. If they win, then they lose. ;-)! That is the unfortunate joke on all of us. The trick really for the long term is to come up with a game for the kids where they have to work out how to produce more than they consume.

My take on the synthesis is that it´s never perfect, always contradictory, and precisely for that reason gives rise to an antithesis - the antithesis is a product of the synthesis´ own contradictions. (In the Marxist version, capitalism gives rise to its own grave-diggers, the proletariat) But if so, why does the process suddenly end? And when it ends, why does it always end with an ideal state, rather than simply decompose completely - a more realistic scenario? Hegel´s philosophy strike me as a curious pantheist version of - surprise - Christianity, while Marxism is a materialist version of Hegelianism. Fukuyama is simply world history repeating itself twice, second time as farce. <br><br><br>For those interested in Hegel (what´s *wrong* with you guys, ha ha), I can recommend two books. "Hegel Myths and Legends" is a valiant attempt to defend Hegel. It contains the claim that the scheme thesis-antithesis-synthesis really comes from one Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus, a German philosopher completely forgotten today. Calling Hegelianism "Chalybäusianism" does have a certain Discordian ring to it, a bit like screaming "Heil Schicklgruber".<br><br><br>Then there´s "Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition", which makes the claim that Hegel was really an esotericist! Could be of some interest to the less Discordian sub-set of ADR´s readership, or to those more infatuated by "the other blog".<br><br><br>Combining Schopenhauer and Jung? Sounds scary, although The World as Will and Misrepresentation is a keeper!

I am aware of the larger categories of how to collapse early (also see <a href="http://teresamcguffey.com/greenwizards.org/?q=node/34864" rel=nofollow> this checklist on the Green Wizard's site</a> for a bulleted list of things one can do).<br><br>I'm making my way (somewhat haphazardly, but still) through items on the list and their derivatives.<br><br>And maybe it's a fool's question, to ask <b>specfiically</b> what one can do with cheap energy now that will be difficult, out of reach, when energy is scarce and expensive, but that's the direction I'd attempted originally. Obviously energy is wrapped up in everything (energy costs for imported goods: learn to make things with local materials, energy costs associated with food production (growing, fertilizing, shipping): learn to garden). BUT, beyond that is kind of where I'm pointing -- if there's a way to answer it.<br><br>In that regard, while cooking for myself now is a good thing, it's not something that utilizes "inexpensive" energy now in hopes of a later benefit.<br><br>I thought Vesta's info was helpful - and prompts me to not assume I can't afford to make efficiency upgrades now but to actually get an estimate of costs.<br><br>Along those lines maybe - learn to raise poultry now <b> and</b> <i>determine or generate local feed sources</i>. Or purchase ... phosphate garden amendments ( (?) that's the one we're likely to see declines in in the near future, right?). One of the things I did this year was source used food grade IBCs (bulk containers for shipping liquids) that I converted into rainwater catchment. One is nearly full and the other will be filling shortly). In the future it might be harder to transport them (or get them, when shipping liquids around the world is more difficult). Also, I would think decent gardening tools would be a good investment - or other non-electric general tools as well.<br><br>I don't know if I'm differentiating it well enough, my interest in the things related more directly to energy costs than the larger 'make yourself more resilient' set of things to be done. ?<br><br>Maybe this would be better discussed at Green Wizards, but I beg our host's pardon for carrying it on here - I know lots of readers here aren't on the GW site.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c4856966707460704488 title="comment permalink">12/9/16, 3:55 PM</a><br><br>

Next year, it would fall on January 15th, the day before MLK Day. Not a bad three-day weekend! Souther, on the other hand, falls in more crowded field.

That seems uncommonly sensible. <br><br>Zaphod, nah, the zenith came centuries before the fall. That's usually the way of it. By the time Greece fell into Roman hands the glory days of Greek philosophy were well in the past; by the time Rome fell and dragged the entire classical world down with it, the entire intellectual heritage of the classical world was either mummified or pushing up daisies. <br><br>Joe, the US government is afraid of one thing more than anything else, and that's the kind of spark that could trigger a domestic insurgency here in the US. A vast amount of US policy for the last decade can best be understood as (a) desperate preparations for such an event, and/or (b) equally desperate attempts to fend such an event off for at least a little longer. The lesson I'd offer activists in this regard? Make sure, when you confront the system, that you can offer it a credible threat of an uprising if they respond with violence. It worked for the Bundy brothers, it worked for the DAPL protest, and it'll work for others...<br><br>Chris, and that's also a valid model. I rather like "amorphous bubbling things," by the way, though that may just be because I've read a lot of Lovecraft recently. <br><br>Kristoffer, so noted!<br><br>Panda, this country has always had a lot of tenant farmers. The advantage is that this allows people without much capital to get started farming. Protofeudal? Sure -- but then, <a href=../../2014/11/dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html rel=nofollow>as I pointed out in a previous post</a>, there are good reasons why feudalism emerges whenever a civilization falls apart. <br><br>Pygmycory, so noted. <br><br>Tidlösa, my take is that Jung was significantly influenced by Schopenhauer, as indeed was the entire central European psychological movement; once you start talking about the world as representation, you're going to start noticing that the representations have a great deal to do with the perceiving mind, and that leads to the discovery of the unconscious and its projections. That said, Jung subtitled one of his major books as a deliberate Hegel reference -- "researches into the phenomenology of the Self" is a nod to "Phenomenology of Spirit," though it's also a dig in Hegel's direction. <br><br>Justin, funny.

I also think the Seshat project is a noble goal (for those of you who are not familiar, it is an attempt to organize all global historical, archaeological, cultural, and social publications in a digital format and on a single platform to make it more easily accessible for researchers, which would be impossible without the internet and data storage. Though I think this is exactly the type of thing the internet was built for, unfortunately this centralization on a digital platform will most likely not survive the decline of industrial civilization. Hopefully they will transfer all this information to a more durable medium.) <br><br>However, the inherent weakness of Cliodynamics, as stated previously, is the relentless drive to quantify history. Though this can help contribute to uncovering certain patterns and trends in historical processes by supplying hard data, it cannot stand alone in this regard. Historical narratives will always be incredibly important, and the peculiarities of cultural, religious and social development cannot be boiled down to an equation, as I think many proponents of Cliodynamics wish was the case. On several occasions, Peter Turchin in his work as criticized great works of history because they didn't back up their arguments with hard data. Well, does one need to supply data that Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon was significant, or for that matter actually happened in the first place? This type of thinking is unproductive. Dismissing other efforts as "old history" is also a baseless critique, as this implies that the work that went before is of no value, and that what is being done now is inherently better because of the simple fact that it is "new." Vico, Spengler, and Toynbee were able to construct valuable works of history that look at broad overall trends without quantifying everything in sight, and their work still stands the test of time.<br><br>Human interaction is a chaotic thing, and despite the insistence of many that the human-made world should make absolute sense, we will always only be able to uncover general patterns that give us a good approximation of historical processes, and at best help us anticipate future trends in a generalized way, but still leave plenty for us to scratch our heads about. I am not familiar with Discordianism, but as an effort to describe the chaos that is human existence, its basic assumptions seem better than most (or would it be correct that there are no assumptions in Discordianism, and that's the point?)<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c2963940772066907992 title="comment permalink">12/10/16, 8:14 AM</a><br><br>

The early stages of feudalism pretty much rely on the land lord and his armed followers being on the land he claims to collect the rent and services that the tenants trade for protection from other lords or from the roving bandits. It is not until the central government begins to be reconstructed that there are courts and government officials to enforce payment to a distant owner. <br><br>I am reading an example of this in Sylvia Townsend Warner's novel _The Corner That Held Them_ about a 14th century convent in an obscure corner of England. The convent owns or claims rents from a number of different properties acquired as the dowries that families customarily gave to support the convent into which they were delivering their daughter. But the nuns are unable to collect rents from the more distant properties without lawsuits, which may cost more than they gain. You know that if people will cheat the brides of Christ during a devout period of history they will have no qualms about cheating Consolidated Agraland. <br><br>I seem to also recall violence and threats against bank agents during the Dust Bowl and Great Depression. The government didn't fall apart then, but I can certainly see situations in which local sheriffs would refuse to enforce the "rights" of distant corporations or in which attempts to enforce such rights could lead to insurrection. <br><br>On a different note, a Republican columnist in my local paper (Sacramento Bee)referred to the Golden State's arrogance "as though we are America's lone path to enlightenment." Leaders of one of the few Democratic controlled state legislatures are talking about establishing state grants to pay the legal defense of illegal immigrants facing deportations and of forcing the federal government to get the approval of California voters for any wall on the southern border. The columnist, Bill Whalen, calls this an interesting twist on federalism. The latter idea is especially silly since the area around San Diego is already the site of extensive fencing, as any Google search will show.<br><br>(note to out of country readers--Sacramento is capital of California, which is nicknamed the Golden State for the 1849 Gold Rush. Our neighbor, Nevada, is the Silver State, after the Comstock Lode, and Arizona is the Copper State.)<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c5631308214492383358 title="comment permalink">12/10/16, 2:34 PM</a><br><br>

And thus we have the chaotic and often destructive (Erisian) real-world element that will ceaselessly wash away at what any culture or individual or movement has to offer for our supposed betterment. <br><br>The only part of your post I'm not sure I got was when you talked at the end about "what happens to most movements for social change". Are you describing the economics-trumps-politics heart of liberalism as being in part a "movement for social change" in the sense normally meant (i.e. how green movements are those for social change too?)<br><br>One last glance at Wilson (sorry); it seems to me he would have really dug a lot of your philosophical and historical perspectives, and the individualist in him ought to have appreciated your views on technological progress, if not agreed. But where he seems in my view to have gone off to extremes was in his "addiction to utopia" in Israel Regardie's words - and not just a technological one. He continually sought to wake from what he saw as the nightmare of history. From Wilson's Promethus Rising:<br><br>"Whether we speak in terms of Taylor's Matrist-Patrist dialectic, Vice's cycle of Divine, Heroic and Urbanized ages, the Marx-Hegel trinity of Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis, or any variation thereon, we are speaking of a pattern that is real and that does repeat. But it only does so to the extent that people are robotized: trapped in hard-wired reflexes....The current rampages of territorial-emotional pugnacity sweeping this planet are not just another civilization falling, Vico fashion. They are the birth-pangs of a cosmic Prometheus rising out of the long nightmare of domesticated primate history."<br><br>This touches brushes against your whole point about cycles of events and behaviour repeating and hardly anyone ever noticing, but from the perspective of someone who really thought this characteristic could be changed.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Jack<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c8410425164394408636 title="comment permalink">12/10/16, 2:43 PM</a><br><br>

I learned a lot from both camps, without having to pan through a whole lot of pointless bickering to get to the interesting stuff.

If that´s wrong (and it is), a specifically Marxist criticism of capitalism seems pointless. Of course, a new criticism of capitalism can overlap with the Marxist criticism on a number of concrete points, but it would still not be the same thing, due to the "Hegelian" framework of the latter. For instance, a Green criticism of capitalism would overlap with Marxism on the question of exploitation and *perhaps* on the question of how crises happen, but the framework would be completely different and entail zero-growth, "collapse now and avoid the rush", no romantic notions of proletarian revolutions, no teleology, etc. This would be so different from Marxism that I think most Marxists, and rightly so, would view it as non- or even anti-Marxist!<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c2412663640176174415 title="comment permalink">12/11/16, 4:22 AM</a><br><br>

For example, a 'normal' American gets socks from a store. Those socks came from knitting factories/mills, probably overseas. So, if there is a suppy interruption, no socks for the 'normal' American.<br><br>You now know how to knit socks, so you can buy yarn, and have socks to wear. (You now have more flexibility: buy socks OR buy yarn!)<br><br>Most of the craft store yarn (75% wool 25% nylon) that is worth knitting into socks comes from mills in Turkey or China, at least according to the lable. You will also find European and Amercan yarn in specialty stores. What if there is a supply interruption of sock yarn?<br><br>I have been considering unravelling thrift store sweaters, but the qualities that make a nice warm sweater don't make for a strong, durable yarn needed for socks. The qualites that make for a lousy sweater probably don't make good socks either. There is also the ethical issue of whether removing a quality sweater from circulation is or is not outweighed by the addition of 3-5 pairs of socks.<br><br>The solution would seem to be to learn to spin sock yarn, or team with a skilled spinner who can. This is more or less where I am stuck, and then your supply problem is the availability of quality wool to be spun into yarn to be knitted into socks.<br><br>Another example for the non-knitter: Cornbread. If the stove doesn't work, can I bake my bread in a dutch oven with charcoal? How about a solar box oven? If I can't get cornmeal, how about acorn flour? <br><br>tldr: simpler to go barefoot!<br><br>JMG:<br>If you need a topic, I would like to read your thoughts on charity.

You can start with either a spinning wheel or a drop spindle (instructions available on the Internet both for spinning and making spindles). The process is about as complicated as learning to ride a bike and you can produce very good yarn at home. You can also select different sheep breeds to change the qualities of your sock - Suffolk is very hard wearing and will not felt, while Merino is softer but will pill and felt more easily. Depending on where you are, you should be able to obtain sheep fleeces relatively easily from your local area. Many people in Australia on larger blocks of land have sheep or alpaca for keeping the grass down and will happily give away the fleeces.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c4811439077770610517 title="comment permalink">12/11/16, 3:02 PM</a><br><br>

They contain enough natural acids to suppress bacteria growth, so 30 minutes in a boiling water bath (near sea level, at least; high-altitude lowers the boiling temp.) is sufficient. Pressure canning is needed for low-acid foods, such as green beans and meats. <br><br>Also, for home canning to make economic sense, you need to have a source of raw food, and energy, that's either cheaper (or just more reliable) than the commercial food processors. Otherwise, you might just as well buy a year's supply of canned tomatoes when they go on sale (or maybe privately negotiate a large-quantity purchase).<br><br>I looked at self-contained multi-purpose (incl. pressure-canning, rice cooking, slow-cooking, etc.) appliances at Target today, and thought that I'd much rather have (as I do) cooking pots without the touch-panels, indicator lights, and microprocessor controls.<br><br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c3353642357971585046 title="comment permalink">12/11/16, 3:37 PM</a><br><br>

I made Bourbon balls for a party (I think it is the state confection of KY), among other things...<br>JMG, you asked about pushback regarding social change among wage class evangelicals. I was discussing an article I'd read about how the Southern Baptist Convention was in the process of conceding the culture wars and turning inward. I'd mentioned that the new leader (Russell Moore) of the SBC was a Calvinist, and had taken the denomination in a decidedly inward direction, while not necessarily changing SBC doctrine on social issues. I'd also mentioned how common tolerance of LGBT people was amongst younger evangelicals. Many people in the CUUPS (Unitarian Pagans) group were visibly uncomfortable with the idea, and pushed back against the idea of conservative change (no, they are still political, they are still pushing a political agenda, their not moving inward, they're still homophobic and intolerant of other beliefs.) It was as if they needed them to be the "Other" to rail against.<br>Other conversations of a more political nature that I've had amongst members of the CUUPS group, the local Fairness group (LGBT), and my older lesbian couple were pushing back against the idea that the GOP is moving away from social issues. Mentions of Trump's tolerance leads to charges that Pence is the one calling the shots, and more outright denial that the GOP is capable of change. I'd mentioned how free the Paul/Gray Senate race was of sexual orientation issues, of Hoover's (incoming state House speaker) commitment to focus on economic, not social issues. Mostly, there is an outright denial that such a comment was ever made, it is ignored totally as if the comment was never made while the person goes on about how evil and unchanging the "Other" is, sometimes, it is accompanied by offense, as if you'd broke wind at a cocktail party. However, I'm probably not the best person to ask about these things. If you really want to get inside the head of one of these people and know the thinking, or lack thereof, behind them, the person to ask would be Ahavah, if she hasn't left the readership b/c of "antisemitism" due to favorable comments you've made towards elements of the alt right. She seems positively petrified of the upcoming legislative session here in KY, let alone the national scene.<br>I will say that I was at the house of some of the people from our Fairness group, and I could not get over the difference in attitude. They seemed much more level headed and less panicky than at the meeting among the kids. Personally, I thought that the calm attitude was the more appropriate attitude to have among the kids. The panicky, hateful, hysterical tone of the adults over the results of the election at the meeting seemed very irresponsible.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c4765840957718571082 title="comment permalink">12/12/16, 4:48 PM</a><br><br>

I think there are some good ideas there; on the other hand, cliodynamics has fallen into the classic trap of premature quantification, in a very big way. If your conceptual models aren't good, quantification just means you're wrong to sixteen decimal places. <br><br>Zaphod, the peak of Western civilization came in the second half of the 19th century -- the period when European nations literally owned the world, and also the high point of technological innovation (which, despite the usual cliche, has been slowing since the 1880s). So we're more than a century past peak already, with the decline picking up speed around us. Whee!<br><br>Lordberia3, I think we've definitely passed peak globalization, and it's going to be a very rough road for a while as a result. With regard to the Russian-influence accusations, that's predictable -- Putin infuriated the globalists by prying Russia loose from the economic domination of the multinationals, so he's their favorite whipping boy these days. <br><br>Jeffinwa, they did indeed. (You'll want to imagine those words spoken in that very distinctive croaking voice used by those who inhaled...)<br><br>Rita, yep. That was one of the things that facilitated the end of the Roman order in western Europe: your barbarian warlord settled in, proclaimed himself king, and said to the slaves on the big plantations, "The land's mine now, but you can farm it in exchange for a cut of the produce" -- and the cut was much, much smaller than the tax burden imposed by distant Roman bureaucrats. Pretty quickly all the former slaves, now upgraded to peasants, were happy with the change, and the literate, formerly privileged former elite got to lump it. <br><br>Morfran, it's a common delusion. Five hundred years ago, the death-pangs of medieval society were identified by the Robert Anton Wilsons of that time as signs that the Age of the Holy Ghost was about to dawn. Five hundred years from now, there'll be some other excuse handy for those who want to claim that it's different this time.<br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c3422764201151859031 title="comment permalink">12/12/16, 10:23 PM</a><br><br>

At our house, the tomatoes get eaten fresh as fast as their produced, though.<br><br>My favorite thing for canning is applesauce. I get "cooking apples" (culled from the bins due to scratches, bruises, or other imperfections) at $10 per half bushel, which I take to be about $0.50/lb. So, I save money on the materials, and they're available during the months when we're heating our home anyway (so extra heat in the kitchen is a bonus, not a cost). But, as you've said, the quality is really outstanding. Commercial applesauce makers must be cheating us <i>somewhere</i>, maybe squeezing the juice out first, and making "applesauce" with the dry pulp + sugar. Or maybe they just add too much water.<br><br><br><a href=the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html#c8665368857494304557 title="comment permalink">12/13/16, 2:12 PM</a><br><br>
