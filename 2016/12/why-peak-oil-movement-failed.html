<div class=MsoNormal>
As I glance back across the trajectory of this blog over the last ten and a half years, one change stands out. When I began blogging in May of 2006, peak oil—the imminent peaking of global production of conventional petroleum, to unpack that gnomic phrase a little—was the central theme of a large, vocal, and tolerably well organized movement. It had its own visible advocacy organizations, it had national and international conferences, it had a small but noticeable presence in the political sphere, and it showed every sign of making its presence felt in the broader conversation of our time.</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Today none of that is true. Of the three major peak oil organizations in the US, ASPO-USA—that’s the US branch of the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas, for those who don’t happen to be fluent in acronym—is apparently moribund; Post Carbon Institute, while it still plays a helpful role from time to time as a platform for veteran peak oil researcher Richard Heinberg, has otherwise largely abandoned its former peak oil focus in favor of generic liberal environmentalism; and the US branch of the Transition organization, formerly the Transition Town movement, is spinning its wheels in a rut laid down years back. The conferences ASPO-USA once hosted in Washington DC, with congresscritters in attendance, stopped years ago, and an attempt to host a national conference in southern Pennsylvania fizzled after three years and will apparently not be restarted. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Ten years ago, for that matter, opinion blogs and news aggregators with a peak oil theme were all over the internet. Today that’s no longer the case, either. The fate of the two most influential peak oil sites, The Oil Drum and Energy Bulletin, is indicative. The Oil Drum simply folded, leaving its existing pages up as a legacy of a departed era.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Energy Bulletin, for its part, was taken over by Post Carbon Institute and given a new name and theme as Resilience.org. It then followed PCI in its drift toward the already overcrowded environmental mainstream, replacing the detailed assessment of energy futures that was the staple fare of Energy Bulletin with the sort of uncritical enthusiasm for an assortment of vaguely green causes more typical of the pages of <i>Yes!</i>
Magazine. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are still some peak oil sites soldiering away—notably
<a href=http://peakoilbarrel.com/ >Peak Oil Barrel</a>, under the direction of former Oil Drum regular Ron Patterson.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>There are also a handful of public figures still trying to keep the concept in circulation, with the aforementioned Richard Heinberg arguably first among them. Aside from those few, though, what was once a significant movement is for all practical purposes dead. The question that deserves asking is simple enough: what happened? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One obvious answer is that the peak oil movement was the victim of its own failed predictions. It’s true, to be sure, that failed predictions were a commonplace of the peak oil scene. It wasn’t just the overenthusiastic promoters of alternative energy technologies, who year after year insisted that the next twelve months would see their pet technology leap out of its current obscurity to make petroleum a fading memory; it wasn’t just their exact equivalents, the overenthusiastic promoters of apocalyptic predictions, who year after year insisted that the next twelve months would see the collapse of the global economy, the outbreak of World War III, the imposition of a genocidal police state, or whatever other sudden cataclysm happened to have seized their fancy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No, the problem with failed predictions ran straight through the movement, even—or especially—in its more serious manifestations. The standard model of the future accepted through most of the peak oil scene started from a set of inescapable facts and an unexamined assumption, and the combination of those things produced consistently false predictions. The inescapable facts were that the Earth is finite, that it contains a finite supply of petroleum, and that various lines of evidence showed conclusively that global production of conventional petroleum was approaching its peak for hard geological reasons, and could no longer keep increasing thereafter.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The unexamined assumption was that geological realities rather than economic forces would govern how fast the remaining reserves of conventional petroleum would be extracted. On that basis, most people in the peak oil movement assumed that as production peaked and began to decline, the price of petroleum would rise rapidly, placing an increasingly obvious burden on the global economy. The optimists in the movement argued that this, in turn, would force nations around the world to recognize what was going on and make the transition to other energy sources, and to the massive conservation programs that would be needed to deal with the gap between the cheap abundant energy that petroleum used to provide and the more expensive and less abundant energy available from other sources. The pessimists, for their part, argued that it was already too late for such a transition, and that industrial civilization would come apart at the seams. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As it turned out, though, the unexamined assumption was wrong. Geological realities imposed, and continue to impose, upper limits on global petroleum production, but economic forces have determined how much less than those upper limits would actually be produced. What happened, as a result, is that when oil prices spiked in 2007 and 2008, and then again in 2014 and 2015, consumers cut back on their use of petroleum products, while producers hurried to bring marginal petroleum sources such as tar sands and oil shales into production to take advantage of the high prices. Both those steps drove prices back down. Low prices, in turn, encouraged consumers to use more petroleum products, and forced producers to shut down marginal sources that couldn’t turn a profit when oil was less than $80 a barrel; both these steps, in turn, sent prices back up. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That doesn’t mean that peak oil has gone away. As oilmen like to say, depletion never sleeps; each time the world passes through the cycle just described, the global economy takes another body blow, and the marginal petroleum sources cost much more to extract and process than the light sweet crude on which the oil industry used to rely. The result, though, is that instead of a sudden upward zoom in prices that couldn’t be ignored, we’ve gotten wild swings in commodity prices, political and social turmoil, and a global economy stuck in creeping dysfunction that stubbornly refuses to behave the way it did when petroleum was still cheap and abundant. The peak oil movement wasn’t prepared for that future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Granting all this, failed predictions aren’t enough by themselves to stop a movement in its tracks. Here in the United States, especially, we’ve got an astonishing tolerance for predictive idiocy. The economists who insisted that neoliberal policies would surely bring prosperity, for example, haven’t been laughed into obscurity by the mere fact that they were dead wrong; au contraire, they’re still drawing their paychecks and being taken seriously by politicians and the media. The pundits who insisted at the top of their lungs that Britain wouldn’t vote for Brexit and Donald Trump couldn’t possibly win the US presidency are still being taken seriously, too. Nor, to move closer to the activist fringes, has the climate change movement been badly hurt by the embarrassingly linear models of imminent doom it used to deploy with such abandon; the climate change movement is in deep trouble, granted, but <a href=../../2016/08/learning-from-failure-modest.html target=_blank>its failure has other causes</a>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was the indirect impacts of those failed predictions, rather, that helped run the peak oil movement into the ground. The most important of these, to my mind, was the way that those predictions encouraged people in the movement to put their faith in the notion that sometime very soon, governments and businesses would have to take peak oil seriously. That’s what inspired ASPO-USA, for example, to set up a lobbying office in Washington DC with a paid executive director, when the long-term funding for such a project hadn’t yet been secured. On another plane, that’s what undergirded the entire strategy of the Transition Town movement in its original incarnation: get plans drawn up and officially accepted by as many town governments as possible, so that once the arrival of peak oil becomes impossible to ignore, the plan for what to do about it would already be in place. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of course the difficulty in both cases was that the glorious day of public recognition never arrived. The movement assumed that events would prove its case in the eyes of the general public and the political system alike, and so made no realistic plans about what to do if that didn’t happen. When it didn’t happen, in turn, the movement was left twisting in the wind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The conviction that politicians, pundits, and the public would be forced by events to acknowledge the truth about peak oil had other consequences that helped hamstring the movement. Outreach to the vast majority that wasn’t yet on board the peak oil bandwagon, for example, got far too little attention or funding. Early on in the movement, several books meant for general audiences—James Howard Kunstler’s <i>The Long Emergency</i> and Richard Heinberg’s <i>The Party’s Over</i> are arguably the best examples—helped lay the foundations for a more effective outreach program, but the organized followup that might have built on those foundations never really happened. Waiting on events took the place of <i>shaping</i> events, and that’s almost always a guarantee of failure. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One particular form of waiting on events that took a particularly steep toll on the movement was its attempts to get funding from wealthy donors. I’ve been told that Post Carbon Institute got itself funded in this way, while as far as I know, ASPO-USA never did. Win or lose, though, begging for scraps at the tables of the rich is a sucker’s game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In social change as in every other aspect of life, who pays the piper calls the tune, and the rich—who benefit more than anyone else from business as usual—can be counted on to defend their interest by funding only those activities that don’t seriously threaten the continuation of business as usual. Successful movements for social change start by taking effective action with the resources they can muster by themselves, and build their own funding base by attracting people who believe in their mission strongly enough to help pay for it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There were other reasons why the peak oil movement failed, of course. To its credit, it managed to avoid two of the factors that ran the climate change movement into the ground, as detailed in the essay linked above—it never became a partisan issue, mostly because no political party in the US was willing to touch it with a ten foot pole, and the purity politics that insists that supporters of one cause are only acceptable in its ranks if they also subscribe to a laundry list of other causes never really got a foothold outside of certain limited circles. Piggybacking—the flipside of purity politics, which demands that no movement be allowed to solve one problem without solving every other problem as well—was more of a problem, and so, in a big way, was pandering to the privileged—I long ago lost track of the number of times I heard people in the peak oil scene insist that this or that high-end technology, which was only affordable by the well-to-do, was a meaningful response to the coming of peak oil. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are doubtless other reasons as well; it’s a feature of all things human that failure is usually overdetermined. At this point, though, I’d like to set that aside for a moment and consider two other points. The first is that the movement didn’t have to fail the way it did. The second is that it could still be revived and gotten back on a more productive track. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To begin with, not everyone in the peak oil scene bought into the unexamined assumption I’ve critiqued above. Well before the movement started running itself into the ground, some of us pointed out that economic factors were going to have a massive impact on the rates of petroleum production and consumption—<a href=../../2007/04/cycles-of-sustainability.html>my first essay on that theme</a> appeared here in April of 2007, and I was far from the first person to notice it. The movement by that time was so invested in its own predictions, with their apparent promise of public recognition and funding, that those concerns didn’t have an impact at the time. Even when the stratospheric oil price spike of 2008 was followed by a bust, though, peak oil organizations by and large don’t seem to have reconsidered their strategies. A mid-course correction at that point, wrenching though it might have been, could have kept the movement alive. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There were also plenty of good examples of effective movements for social change from which useful lessons could have been drawn. One difficulty is that you won’t find such examples in today’s liberal environmental mainstream, which for all practical purposes hasn’t won a battle since Richard Nixon signed the Clean Air Act. The struggle for the right to same-sex marriage, as I’ve noted before, is quite another matter—a grassroots movement that, despite sparse funding and strenuous opposition, played a long game extremely well and achieved its goal. There are other such examples, on both sides of today’s partisan divide, from which useful lessons can be drawn. Pay attention to how movements for change succeed and how they fail, and it’s not hard to figure out how to play the game effectively. That could have been done at any point in the history of the peak oil movement. It could still be done now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Like same-sex marriage, after all, peak oil isn’t inherently a partisan issue. Like same-sex marriage, it offers plenty of room for compromise and coalition-building. Like same-sex marriage, it’s a single issue, not a fossilized total worldview like those that play so large and dysfunctional a role in today’s political nonconversations. A peak oil movement that placed itself squarely in the abandoned center of contemporary politics, played both sides against each other, and kept its eyes squarely on the prize—educating politicians and the public about the reality of finite fossil fuel reserves, and pushing for projects that will mitigate the cascading environmental and economic impacts of peak oil—could do a great deal to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>reshape our collective narrative about energy and, in the process, accomplish quite a bit to make the long road down from peak oil less brutal than it will otherwise be. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m sorry to say that the phrase “peak oil,” familiar and convenient as it is, probably has to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The failures of the movement that coalesced around that phrase were serious and visible enough that some new moniker will be needed for the time being, to avoid being tarred with a well-used brush. The crucial concept of net energy—the energy a given resource provides once you subtract the energy needed to extract, process, and use it—would have to be central to the first rounds of education and publicity; since it’s precisely equivalent to profit, a concept most people grasp quickly enough, that’s not necessarily a hard thing to accomplish, but it has to be done, because it’s when the concept of net energy is solidly understood that such absurdities as commercial fusion power appear in their true light. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It probably has to be said up front that no such project will keep the end of the industrial age from being an ugly mess. That’s already baked into the cake at this point; what were once problems to be solved have become predicaments that we can, at best, only mitigate. Nor could a project of the sort I’ve very roughly sketched out here expect any kind of overnight success. It would have to play a long game in an era when time is running decidedly short. Challenging? You bet—but I think it’s a possibility worth serious consideration. </div>

In other news, I’m delighted to announce the appearance of two books that will be of interest to readers of this blog. The first is Dmitry Orlov’s latest, <i>Shrinking the Technosphere: Getting a Grip on the Technologies that Limit Our Autonomy, Self-Sufficiency, and Freedom</i>. It’s a trenchant and thoughtful analysis of the gap between the fantasies of human betterment through technological progress and the antihuman mess that’s resulted from the pursuit of those fantasies, and belongs on the same shelf as Theodore Roszak’s <i>Where the Wasteland Ends: Politics and Transcendence in Postindustrial Society</i> and my <i>After Progress: Religion and Reason in the Twilight of the Industrial Age</i>. Copies hot off the press can be ordered from New Society <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/S/Shrinking-the-Technosphere>here</a>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

First is the fact that the Peak Oilers mostly failed to realize that what we had was a thermodynamic problem. That is, once all the losses from oil in the ground to useful work accomplished had been accounted for, there was very little surplus. Even small increases in the cost put the whole enterprise under water. Which implies that most everything that we hold dear in the modern world is at risk. Not from running out of oil in the ground, but from failure of companies to be able to make any money at it.<br><br>Second is related to human need for Integration. I am bridging off Dan Siegel's newly published book Mind: A Journey Into the Heart of Being Human. Siegel shows to my satisfaction that our Mind is formed by the flow of energy and information within our brain, our body, our society, our economy, and our artifacts. Confronted with the deluge of energy and information, we seek Integration...making sense of it all in terms of our intellect and our feelings. The world being what it is, there are times when the bitter facts of unavoidable reality demand some response other than resignation to what is. For example, most people are not going to accept a diagnosis of terminal cancer with equanimity. But our Minds still seek Integration. And so we are likely to invent 'solutions' such as religion or political saviors who make things better (kisses from Mommy accomplished this task when we were 2 years old). Other people may find reasons to deny the evidence. And yet others will find ways to put things in silos: yes, climate change is going to be awful, but today I have to take my grandchildren out for ice cream. Since the Peak Oil movement, as such, never offered any reasons for optimism, people were encouraged to find ways to avoid dealing with it. Which is not to deny that some people branched off into solar or survivalism or whatever. But the mainstream never found anything as magical as oil as it existed about mid-20th century. Instead, serious people urged 50 Million Farmers to take up homesteading.<br><br>I submit that the fundamental reason Peak Oil failed is that they had no solution and that people could see no light at the end of the tunnel.<br><br>Don Stewart<br><br><a href=#c4803715292250457689 title="comment permalink">12/14/16, 4:46 PM</a><br><br>

I agree that the phrase "Peak Oil" really needs to be replaced with something else since for a lot of people that phrase just means, "We're going to completely run out of oil very soon," a prediction which they've learned they can't take seriously. I've learned I can't get most people to listen to the word "Peak Oil" in a time when oil is so abundant and so cheap that ships full of oil were driving circles in the ocean waiting for a time for the price to go high enough for them to be able to sell it somewhere. <br><br>You have mentioned in your books that the decline will be a process so long and slow that no one alive today will likely be around to see it "end." This is tied into the fact that although we have hit Peak Oil, we are nowhere being completely out of oil. This may seem like a silly question, but about how many decades probably remain where oil will still be accessible to people outside the extremely rich and / or governments?/militaries I get that each year there will be fewer and fewer of us who can get it, but it seems that it'll still be around for a long time.<br><br><a href=#c6733274361052580994 title="comment permalink">12/14/16, 5:50 PM</a><br><br>

The peak oil movement wasn’t prepared for that future."<br><br>- my memory of those days (I was active on The Oil Drum) is that there was a wide diversity of opinions. Some (including me) insisted that the "Hubbert curve" is an interplay between geology and economics. The build-up before the peak is a matter of capital investment in the extraction of the resource, enabled by the economic profits the resource offers. And after the peak, the rate of extraction decreases due to economic limits, since heavy investments in scraping the hard-to-extract bottom of the barrel yield relatively lower profits. There was also much talk about the predicted "bumpy plateau" before and after The Peak, and that is exactly what' we've seen since 2005. The role of (unpayable) debt in funding efforts such as fracking (leading to those big bumps) was mentioned, but not adequately taken into account.<br><br>Alas the most public face of the "movement", the way it was reported on in the mainstream media (in the rare cases of any reporting at all), emphasized the simplistic story of developing scarcity and high prices.

You mention spreading the information to politicians and public and triggering changes to allow us to survive better in the future.<br><br>Well, at least in US both of these have been wildly successful to the limits of human nature:<br>- Political Awareness: Peak Oil awareness has driven a lot of the political agenda for the US since 2000. Invasion of Iraq, color revolutions, encroachment on Russia, all the South American dirty games etc. Just because this is not what most peak oilers considered appropriate response does not change the facts. Given political limitations, the US leaders could not go with anything long term. Short term the actions above have helped the empire a lot.<br><br>- Public Awareness: Most people that I talked to accept Peak Oil at least at a superficial level. They refuse to think about it though because they would have to accept the evil they bring to their own children. That's just human nature, I doubt any movement could change that.<br><br>- Adaptations: See above what the empire is doing. At the individual level, most rich people have a doomstead somewhere (usually South America or New Zealand). The militarization of the US police is an adaptation. There are many others very similar. Again, just because we don't like the direction the adaptation is going, it does not make it disappear.<br><br>In conclusion, I think you should celebrate the success of the Peak Oil movement, not bury it.<br><br><a href=#c821951180670045536 title="comment permalink">12/14/16, 6:04 PM</a><br><br>

I prefer to talk about narratives, because when human beings piece together the disparate data of their world, they're usually using a story, explicit or implicit, to do it. From that perspective, what you've said is that the peak oil movement failed to take control of the narrative and define the data in terms that made their stance make sense to people. With that I heartily agree.<br><br>Doctor W., thanks for the data points! That's basically what I've heard from elsewhere in the Transition scene. <br><br>DaShui, exactly. What the "peak demand" people aren't saying is that demand is peaking because the externalized costs consequent on falling net energy are wrecking the real economy of goods and services, and causing massive demand destruction everywhere outside of the narrowing circles of affluence. Same process, different manifestation. <br><br>Justin, exactly -- and exactly. Those are points that can be introduced, discussed, leveraged, and inserted into the collective dialogue. <br><br>Breanna, what you're talking about is of great importance -- lifestyle change as a key to social change. Feminists back in the Sixties used to say "the personal is political," and they were right. The lessons you're learning in helping other people to take up less ecologically damaging ways to live their lives can be applied more broadly -- so please take notes! ;-)<br><br>Barrabas, bingo. It seems like a very sensible policy to me. <br><br>Cortes, interesting. I hadn't heard of that. Can you point me to some online resources that discuss it? <br><br>Doctor W., the Obama years have been nearly as disastrous for the environmental movement as the Clinton years were, since in both cases environmentalists -- as a captive constituency of the Democratic Party -- were required to insist that the administration was doing something helpful about the environment when it wasn't. Trump's administration could be a godsend to environmentalists, if they (a) start being for something rather than against this, that, and the other, and (b) hold the Democrats hostage by refusing to campaign for them unless they actually further environmental goals. Here's hoping! <br><br>JimBob, I expect some amount of petroleum, in some sense of that increasingly flexible term, to be being pumped and burnt until the end of this century at least. It's just that long before then, only militaries, government officials, and the very rich will have access to any of its products. Now imagine how your average Joe or Jane will react to that prospect! <br><br>JacGolf, oh, granted. Again, narrative matters.

I've had a very lively conversation across the past two weeks with my on-line altercation group (I sent them your way last week, BTW, and if a guy named Yves is giving you trouble, it's my fault, but he does "get it" after a while), which has pitted me against a believer in abiotic oil. Of course, his opinion is that there is lots of oil if the profiteers would just get out of the way. I haven't tried to disprove it to him (Yves did, but he doesn't yet see why people think "scientific consensus" is a scam), but I pointed out "net energy" as the key concept to understand. This is the only thing he and I disagree about. He is a businessman, struggling through the bureaucratic hardships of our current era and facing the breakdown in social order square on, while casting about for practical solutions and trying out all sorts of ideas. In other words, he's the kind of person most likely to lead the way forward, and it matters not one bit whether or not he believes in limited petroleum resources: he'll just blame all the mayhem on the Rockefellers. Since he says, "We'll see what happens," and because the economy could go in any direction depending on how things work out with Mr. Trump, the idea he proposes of seeing whether abundance returns if only the ogres let it might not be the best yardstick. I will propose instead to follow the breakeven point of the oil price for producers and see if that rises, falls or stays even.

I think the evidence was pretty clear by the mid-2000s that we would have a serious problem by 2010 or so, but the shale gas boom pretty much surprised everyone. Kunstler could not have predicted the impact of shale gas because no one did. By taking pressure off the demand for petroleum it kicked both OPEC and Russia square in the nuts while giving the global economy a little room to breathe, which is to say carry on as if everything is normal. Everything is obviously not normal, but this way we get another decade or two to party. Hell, it might buy us time to find some gee-whiz sustainability solution that does not involve mass depopulation, unattended nuclear plant ruins and hand-made leather plow straps. <br><br>The shale gas dynamic in particular will me amusing to watch. Russia really hates our fracking industry. He really had Europe's nuts in a vise until we started exporting the stuff practically for free. Given the massive degree to which Russia depends on petro cash, our boom really is their bust. Putin hates our gas industry and would love to see it shut down. Now Trump and the GOP want to drill even beyond what economics calls for. Why, I don't know. But they seem really committed to this stuff. Lord knows his picks for Interior and EPA love them some drilling. If Putin has untoward influence over the GOP then expect them to go full Greenpeace over fracking and choke off sales to Europe (if we drill it, the gas has to go somewhere). If not, yippie kay yay and pass the hydrocarbon dowsing rods.<br><br><a href=#c4403410252402420311 title="comment permalink">12/14/16, 7:42 PM</a><br><br>

So that's at least one classic case of death by piggybacking. One of the weird things about the Peak Oil movement right now is that when it gets mentioned at all, it's usually on the sort of survivalist sites that wind up on the neo-McCarthy blacklists discussed a few weeks ago. It really does feel like it's been pushed so far out to the fringe that even mentioning it gets people backing away slowly... I was a little kid during the '80s and '90s and so never experienced that era... but was being a Peak Oil activist then roughly what it's like to be one now?<br><br>on other topics:<br><br>It seems like each Oil shock should hit the economy slightly harder than the one before. But with this last one, we wound up with a large and noticeable correction, but nothing quite like what we got in 2008. What we got instead was a series of global political crises that 2008 couldn't hold a candle to if it wanted. Was that essentially the same impact hitting in different spheres?<br><br>Last, though I'm sure you'll have already covered it in response to someone else: any suggestions for what you would call the next Peak Oil movement if you could plant those seeds?<br><br><a href=#c1586876245404516788 title="comment permalink">12/14/16, 7:54 PM</a><br><br>

Peak oil needs a proper funeral, or at least it needs to be acknowledged as deceased (images of the Monty Python parrot sketch are coming to mind as I type). Right now the PO thing seems like a funny phase I went through, although it did leave a lasting impression on my lifestyle. I'm happy with the lifestyle changes, but the PO fears that catalyzed them have abated. The PO movement itself is definitely in its waning performance stages now. <br><br>I never bought into the rapid and obvious collapse scenario - I didn't get into the PO topic until about 2010 by which time the price and demand dynamics had already kicked in and it was clear it was going to be a bumpy way down. What I didn't realize - or really internalize - was how long and slow the way down was going to be - I still believed that the impacts of declining net energy, debt, fracking bubbles and the like would be visible and significant. Of course these things are real, and they are having their impacts and will continue to. But so far these impacts have been fairly well absorbed into business as usual, and business as usual appears to be quite flexible and adaptive. We're carrying a lot of fat, after all. Currently, I really have no idea when any one of these impacts could prove truly disruptive to a degree that most reasonable people would have to conclude that energy depletion is real and that we absolutely must do something about it. <br><br>Of course, things are not really carrying on as usual - declining net energy is real and the economic impacts are real. But these impacts, at least for now, are hard to discern amid the rest of the noise. I think the hard problem to solve is this - the reality of energy depletion requires major changes in our lifestyles; these changes are hard to make for most people; and most people won't make them unless they have to. Unless the energy depletion impacts are discernible and immediate and undeniable, then the changes are not likely to be made unless people have some other set of reasons to want to make those changes. So, basically, without the fear of major disruption, we don't act. How, then, does any revamped movement get a broad mass of people to embrace LESS in their own lives (along with the mantra that there is no better future) without that fear as a motivator?<br><br><a href=#c2440732918467987943 title="comment permalink">12/14/16, 8:03 PM</a><br><br>

Fossil fuel use was still pretty minimal in the US in 1865, except for a handful of industries such as steel manufacture -- and those industries never did use slaves. <br><br>Elmo, if that's the way you want to frame it, by all means. I find other approaches far more useful. <br><br>Moshe, I remember that as well -- and I also remember the constant pushback I got whenever I suggested that the standard linear-decline model didn't take important factors into account. The peak oil organizations, which had a very large role in setting the public tone of the movement, could have taken a broader range of perspectives into account. My guess is that the dream of ample funding and public acknowledgment was too tempting.<br><br>NomadicBeer, not at all. Most of the adaptations you've described are short term patches that have already made things worse in the middle (and not very lengthy middle) term. There were always other options; there are still some of those, and some very simple measures could make the road down a lot easier. More on this in an upcoming post! <br><br>Cherokee, oh, granted.

Many thanks for the link -- to see a flicker of common sense breaking through in the New York Times is quite unexpected. ;-)<br><br>Tower 440, yeah, I've seen the same attitude expressed at top volume way too often to doubt it. It might be necessary to reframe the whole issue outside the context of environmentalism to get out from under the burden of all the nitwits who've used green this and ecologically conscious that to try to parade their own purported goodness in front of everyone else. <br><br>Casamurphy, sure -- just pay attention to the way her economic predictions repeatedly flop, and judge accordingly. <br><br>Denmon, while potential knowledge may be infinite, our capacity as a society to process and store knowledge is not. As the industrial age ratchets down, a lot of knowledge will be lost for a long time or forever. Depending on where we are in that process -- with misinformation crowding out actual knowledge -- we could already be past the point at which our society's knowledge base topped out and started to decline. <br><br>Steve, that is to say, it's a gamble, and it may not work.

Another is the severity and frequency of price swings. <br><br>Patricia M., and a happy post-solstice shopping orgy to you and yours! <br><br>Tim, those of us who were watching the economics predicted that marginal sources of hydrocarbons (you can spell that "shale gas" if you want to) would come on stream as things unfolded. As for our supposed oceans of exported gas, would you care to point me to a source with meaningful numbers that says that's actually happening? Last I heard, shale gas or no shale gas, the US is a net <i>importer</i> of natural gas. <br><br>Eric, no, it wasn't. There were some very respected people fronting the movement; there were a couple of US representatives who were supportive; the first ASPO conference I went to was full of investment brokers, who were interested in what the rising price of oil would do to their portfolios. It was a completely different world. As for your other questions: yes, the impact lands differently each time, and I'm not yet sure what to call it. <br><br>Yupped, fear is actually a lousy motivator. Preachers of all kinds should have noticed a long time ago that yelling about "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry (fill in the blank)" is popular entertainment but not much else. The interesting thing is that a lot of the changes that have to be made are already being made, as a matter of economics rather than ideology; demand destruction is a significant force these days, and so is the way that various groups outside the circles of affluence are downshifting their lifestyles in various not always obvious ways. Here in Cumberland, kids whose dads hotdogged in cars are hotdogging on bikes these days.

I mean “diminishing net energy” ... movement failed? <br><br>Well yes, if you had high hopes industrial societies would change radically to better meet the challenges declining conventional oil production. I never did.<br><br>We should give its promoters, including yourself, their due though. You in the peak oil movement (sorry, “diminishing net energy” has too many syllables) have been reasonably successful in getting the notion of peak oil to a larger audience. True it has been ridiculed and deliberately misrepresented in the corporate media. Yes, governments deny it. But in truth they get it. The proof of this is that their militaries get it. They have built it into their planning documents such as the JOE. These are signs of success. The meme is out there. Its not dead.<br><br>TOD and other sites shut down or changed their focus because getting the word out was their initial reason for being. Their aim was achieved. CERA, EIA, and IEA have all have admitted we are past the point of peak conventional oil production. There was no reason for those, or your, peak oil websites to continue beating the drum. They didn't and neither did you.<br><br>Now, do governments and other institutions plan to do anything about it? Well, its like anthropogenic climate change. No one of consequence really thinks it does not exist. The plan in both cases is simple. We in industrial societies plan to burn as much fossil fuels as possible and in so doing bake the planet. That's the plan ... has been from the beginning. <br><br>Not everyone thinks this is a good idea but, realistically, no one has come up with a better one. No, not even you JMG. You do not have a realistic plan. No one does.<br><br>Except maybe Mr. Dmitry Orlov. His plan is to muddle through (or not). So, while we burn as much fossil fuel as possible and bake the planet, we will attempt to muddle through. Still basically the same plan. Who doesn't attempt to muddle through? <br><br>OK. Here in Ontario we have some wind turbines and solar arrays and are phasing out coal powered power plants. Great. Maybe a better public transit system. Maybe. Still the plan is essentially the same because all those things depend on fossil fuels which, as I've said, we plan to burn ... all of it that we can. Maybe just a little later if we conserve and are more efficient. Still the plan is the same and on any time scale that matters, we bake the planet. <br><br>Is this a counsel of doom and do nothing? Not at all. Governments and other institutions will respond because they must or die. Will they respond too late with too little? Why of course. Its all part of muddling through or not as the case may be.<br><br>What am I doing? I grow and raise a fair part of my own food, burn only wood for heat etc.. It makes some difference for my family and I, but really it doesn't change much nor do I expect it to. When I can't use an internal combustion engine, I won't. When I can't pay for the lights to be on, I won't. I'm just muddling though. And the plan is and will remain the same: I, like everyone else in an industrial society, will burn as much fossil fuel as possible and bake the planet as I attempt to muddle through. After we have used all the fossil fuels and baked the planet we will still continue to try to muddle through.<br><br>Just stop burning fossil fuels? That is not going to happen until we are forced to because what it means is to stop being an industrial society. That is not a politically sellable idea. Neither that nor any significantly lower rate of energy use or lower tier of technology you may regard as better. Work the numbers. The time frames just don't change much. All the different models of the Limits to Growth showed pretty much the same thing. In any case, we have already hit the iceberg. We are in a classic progress trap. There is no way out. We will just have to muddle through ... or not as the case may be.<br><br><a href=#c3482887120817283629 title="comment permalink">12/14/16, 9:10 PM</a><br><br>

Definitely it coincides with the transition of power in the Whitehouse and government, but also at a time when more and more American people let it be known that they are wanting and ready for change. That is where many of us could come in, by trying to open more dialogue and planning on grassroots local movements, and what better way to brand it than as "Making America Great Again," except perhaps with a little less reference to Trump. It's a great opportunity to bridge the two groups, especially in communities in the Fly-Over States. The reality is, people want change, they want jobs, and they want some hope. Certainly what hope that is and the jobs which might be available vary based on area. That's why grassroots matters.

This happens to all of us if we focus to much on anything. An example of this is how priests that are very vocal against homosexuality and drug-use have an uncanny tendency to getting caught having drug-fueled sex with gay prostitutes.<br><br>I think that this psychological quirk of the human mind led to some proponents of the theory wanting peak oil to happen. They rationalized this desire either as a needed wakeup-call for the general public or that it was neccessary to prevent catastrophic climate change, but in the end I think most just wanted to see peak oil happen and they wanted it to happen as hard as possible. If this is the case, they obviously had no desire for preventing peak oil from happening or mitigating the effects. I think this also caused a lot of the apocalyptic predictions (people tend to confuse what they want to happen with what they think will happen) that alienated the movement from the public.<br><br>Im not saying that everyone in the peak oil movement behaved like this. It was probably only a minor fraction, but it was a vocal minor fraction that oponents of the movement could point at to discredit the movement.<br><br><a href=#c4739693590857334320 title="comment permalink">12/15/16, 12:11 AM</a><br><br>

Thieme and Engelen are members of the Dutch political party, Partij voor de Dieren (Party for the Animals of which Thieme is the leader) which currently has two seats in the Dutch parliament (that's proportional representation at work). The name of the party - something you will probably appreciate - is a kind of initiation; most people don't get it and think the party is only about saving the fluffy bunnies or some such like. Those who do get it, come to realise that a) how we farm the meat we eat says a lot about our society, and b) that a party that cares deeply about the welfare of animals necessarily has to take a whole system approach to agriculture, the environment and human society in general. From this starting point, political policies are derived which, far from being policies aimed at a single issue (nearly exclusively being the economy for most political parties), encompass a whole world in which humans are just a part. <br><br>The book is actually two in one. The part written by Thieme starts from the agribusiness, environmental side and the part by Engelen from the point of view of the unsustainability of the current western economic system. The two sides converge to map out their 'Plan B' because, as they say, there is no Planet B.<br><br>I think it could well appeal to druids and so, by way of a yuletide present, I have put enough in the tip jar to cover the cost of the book, should you wish to read it (unfortunately only available as an e-book in English at the moment).

Focus on oil as the only resource that's at issue, in a lot of ways, is the same sort of mistake that the global warming movement made with its identity, since it had no idea to talk about other shifts in global climate that were a part of the phenomenon. What they wound up doing was re-branding themselves as climate change, which was a name that was able to cover the broader scope of climate-related phenomena connected to greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>Perhaps a re-branding of the Peak Oil movement could expand into a broader resource scarcity movement, which would be able to fall back on other more visible issues when people aren't thinking about oil prices, while also being able to resist being trampled over by solar and nuclear booms by being able to focus on not only net energy, but on non-renewables such as rare earth metals and uranium when those booms happen. Toward the end, the Peak Oil movement was starting to do that very thing, but I'm not sure (and if I'm wrong please not only correct me, but point me towards it so that I can read it), they ever had anything that took a broad scope of all the non-renewable resources we were burning through, the industries that would be impacted, and rough estimates of their likely production curves and presented them in an easily accessible format for the layman in quite the same way as was done with oil and started a conversation on weaning ourselves away from those as well.<br><br>Of course, the biggest danger of a re-branding of that sort would be the possibility of such a movement getting absorbed into some other conservation movement and becoming a victim of the exact same sort of piggybacking that hurt the Peak Oil movement to begin with... but while allowing itself to be consumed by the environmentalist mainstream and the broader sustainability movement may have been too broad, perhaps focusing solely on oil is too narrow? Perhaps there's a middle ground that allows things like the impact of helium depletion on the medical industry, and of phosphate depletion on agriculture to be included in the movement, while drawing a clear boundary line that keeps it focused enough to avoid getting swept away by either the environmentalist mainstream or by sexier resource depletion issues like overfishing and deforestation that touch on slightly different, albeit overlapping issues?<br><br><a href=#c2753164029572717118 title="comment permalink">12/15/16, 7:42 AM</a><br><br>

Turns out they were fairly accurate. It was also interesting to me, from an engineering/scientific perspective. I had no idea drilling a hole in the earth was so complex. The secrets are all in the mud :-) And then, to watch the workers in the wake of the DWH blowout, operating robots under miles-deep water, wrangling pipes and tools under unimaginable pressure, as the oil volcano spewed. The old hands on TOD said the relief well was the only way, and they were right.. <br><br>I guess the peak isn't far enough in the rearview mirror, quite yet, for popular mass recognition. There were some perceptive Drummers who always said the production peak would be masked by demand destruction, and that was correct as well. <br><br>As I see it, the greatest takeaway from TOD is the handful of prognosticators and philosophers whose perceptions have proven to be correct.

That is like describing "winter" as a "movement." <br><br>I found the concept of the "transition town" kind of interesting, until I unexpectedly found myself living in one. Who would have ever thought that a tiny hillbilly backwater where the three most numerous institutions were churches, junk shops, and biker bars would have somehow been overtaken by a "green" invasion? The idea was sold to the local chamber with promises of money money money ("green is the new gold!"), got tangled in its increasingly incomprehensible jargon, and faded away. In the end the local conspiracy theorists convinced the city council that the "Transition Movement" was part of Agenda 21, and the pro-transition resolution was rescinded. But by then it was all but dead anyway. <br><br>The past and the present were not planned, and the future won't be either. Peak Oil will continue to play out in ways more complex and confusing than anyone will be able to anticipate, and there will be 7 billion different responses to it.

It seems to me that a major factor is short term thinking on all sides. I have always felt that peak oil is a major issue on the timescale that the IEA has predicted global oil production to peak, which is in the 2020s or early 2030s. Many on the Oil Drum were consumed with arguing about whether their prediction was off by 10 or 15 years. But it was hard for people to accept the uncertainty in what sources could be tapped at what price so that they could see the longer term. I thought you clearly predicted that the big question was what happened after the first big price spikes. And electing Trump with maybe an Exxon-Mobil executive as secretary of state shows we are going to amplify the chaos. We are only in our 3rd year below $80 per barrel. There is clearly another price spike coming, and Tillerson will benefit from high prices so it seems pretty predictable. I can't see why the serious ideas don't support as strong of a movement as in 2006. But humans are just really really short sighted. And movements seem to require new issues every year rather than a conservation law playing out over decades.<br><br><a href=#c585023677313610322 title="comment permalink">12/15/16, 8:07 AM</a><br><br>

Governments have been over doing the fear thing recently and it hasn't worked - just look at Brexit for a prime example. Instead, we should look to the success of long term religions. We need to give people hope, we also need to present a positive message around doing well with less. A positive anti-consumerism, the pro-spartan lifestyle, something of that order.

It is well known that Richard Cherney's energy commission studied peak oil and its geopolitical implications and was a major driver for the Iraq war. Vice-President Cherney obsession with removing Saddam Hussein from power appears likely to have been driven by a dream of a pro-American Iraq in the heart of the Middle East. A stabilized Iraq with a oil industry taken over by American oil companies would have given the United States huge strategic leverage in the coming decades as we entered the twilight zone of industrial civilization.<br><br>Now, we all know that this neo-conservative dream was an absurd fantasy but it if had worked out (which it never would have!) than it would have given the Americans a huge advantage of a post-peak world. To summarize, the US government did have a plan on peak oil, except it didn't work out. In fact, it exploded in their faces.<br><br>My own view is that the things that need to be done to start mitigating the impact of climate change, resource scarcity and a tottering globalized economy can be sold in a different way to the now largely discredited climate change/peak oil movements. Nationalism is still the most powerful force around and could be used to mobilise the public on a platform of greater national self-sufficiency, reduced energy usage and a diversification of our energy supplies. <br><br>If anybody can pull it off, maybe President Elect Trump can find a way of appealing to the public using the power of nationalism.

I agree that the POM should have anticipated such an eventuality because you shouldn't need to be some Nobel Laureate in the social sciences to know that industrial society isn't go to go gently into that good night.<br><br>As far as the geological reality is concerned, what I predict will happen is that once light-sweet crude production starts to go into serious terminal decline (which could begin to happen as early as 2021), the inferior grades of petroleum mentioned above will stop being kind-of-sort-of economical to produce in their current quantities (keep in mind they have to keep rolling over and rolling over increasing amounts of debt to keep it nominally economical) because of their relatively poor EROEIs.

Most of the people involved in this don't think about it as a response to Peak Oil but it ends up being an effective and useful one which meets most of your standards for effective change. In denser locations like Portland it is widely understood that the biggest barrier to more people walking or riding bikes instead of traveling by car is the danger posed by autos. So in addition to advocating for bike lanes, diverters, etc with the local political entities a growing movement of people gets out and does these things when necessary even when the city drags its feet. So if the city is dragging its feet in putting up traffic diverters on a residential street that is widely used by bike commuters, walkers and kids and has been swamped with speeding Cut-through car drivers ,they do it themselves at night with drums, big planters etc. Of course the city often removes them but as we speed down the long collapse the governments ability to respond decreases with time and the power of the guerrillas increases. The movement has been getting better at integrating more groups in to it so it is not really privileged cyclists in lycra, but more people who ride bikes to save money, haul kids and cargo on bikes, walkers, and parents who want their kids to be able to walk to school safely. The unofficial purpose of the movement is very simple, make it safer and easier to walk or bike and harder, slower and more expensive to drive.<br><br><a href=#c1989261395909745960 title="comment permalink">12/15/16, 10:04 AM</a><br><br>

You and I both attended the ASPO conference in Washington D.C. in the year 2011. We met briefly. <br><br>1. I work in the energy industry and I noticed that pretty much everyone was surprised at the sudden drop in oil price ― it was not just those who studied peak oil who so badly misjudged where we were going.<br>2. In his best-selling book “Black Swan” Nissam Taleb (2007) discusses those rare events that cannot be forecast but that have a major impact. His third criterion is particularly cogent here, “After the first recorded instance of the event, it is rationalized by hindsight, as if it could have been expected”. In other words we are all experts after the event. Having said which, I am still surprised at the speed and magnitude of the fall in the price of oil. (Taleb’s observation can be seen now in the political scene ― all those observers who failed to predict the Trump victory will now pontificate at great length telling us why he won.)<br>3. I have worked in the area of process safety for many years and, at the time of the 2011 conference, was studying the recent Deepwater Horizon event. I offered my services to the ASPO leaders but they were summarily rejected. I felt almost as if I was being viewed as one of “the enemy”. I think that they made a mistake ― they should have accepted data and advice from all sources.<br>4. I once had a successful salesperson tell me that you never try to sell through the emotion of fear. You don’t say, “If you don’t buy my product or service something bad will happen to you.” What you do say is, “If you do buy my product or service something good will happen”. It’s two sides of the same coin but it makes all the difference. It seems that too many of the Peak Oil and related types focus on what’s going wrong. Instead they should be offering a vision of a new world that is inherently appealing (if possible).<br>5. During the 1980 oil bust a bumper sticker around Houston was, “God ― send us another boom. This time we promise not to screw it up”. Well, He did and we did.<br>6. Many of my engineering colleagues have great confidence in incremental improvements that will address our problems. They point to the shale industry as an example. It is not revolutionary like fusion energy, but the technology was sufficient to solve the problem. (The motto, “Perfect is the enemy of good enough” comes to mind.)<br><br>I look forward to your continued discussion on this topic. I see that oil prices are drifting up. <br><br><br><a href=#c4449208424332156508 title="comment permalink">12/15/16, 11:29 AM</a><br><br>

The issue was considered fringe, and attracted fringe types, people who felt allergic to ordinary citizens and turned up their nose at the idea of reaching them. <br><br>Many of the people who came to meetings, it turned out, made a career of attending meetings of fringe groups and trying to take them over.

I thought their efforts would be more in demand than ever, as the economic crunch meant there was far more need to have gardening clubs, home-steading courses, activism and so on. Perhaps the economic crash violated people’s faith in an energy crash, or perhaps the crash meant that people suddenly had no hope of backers, and little spare money or time for activism.

I usually concede saying, "I think I saw something about that too. But didn't they said gas not oil? Because I think we're still importing the oil, but then we're refining it into usable gas and exporting it back out. Kind of like our local lumber mill exports exports lumber even though there isn't any active forestry within a hundred miles of us."

My babies were born in '82 and '95, and I also haven't had a clothes drier for nearly my entire adult life. My youngest was 12 when he announced that he'd discovered that his friends' mothers didn't own 2 washing machines, but that someone had actually invented a machine that dried clothes. I expressed astonishment that anyone living in Southern California, where we lived at that time, would think they needed such a machine and he agreed that it was a very peculiar thing.<br><br>The peak knowledge concept has me disturbed at the moment. I have several friends that I consider allies in our nascent local food movement who have waded into perilous currents. One is now exploring various geo-engineering and chemtrail conspiracy theories. The other is attributing the recent years of water shortages to Agenda 21 plotters. I've thought for some years that when some people are emotionally incapable of dealing with the intractability of real problems, they find imaginary problems to fixate on. This little theory seems to contain some truth and I'm not at all happy to have this confirmed.<br><br><a href=#c345529166103306810 title="comment permalink">12/15/16, 12:47 PM</a><br><br>

It's not to prevent peak oil, because the core idea is that that's not possible. It would make sense for the goal to be mitigation of the consequences, but I found no consensus on how that was supposed to be approached. Instead, there were arguments between various incompatible extreme positions, e.g. proponents of massive public alternative energy "build-outs" versus preppers.<br><br>Did anyone else notice that a large part of the remaining peak oil movement in 2012 appeared to get caught up (to its eventual detriment) in the Mayan apocalypse farrago, the coincidence of that date also being a plausible peak oil date being too tempting to resist? That might have just been a local peculiarity, which is why I'm asking.<br><br>If the movement were about mitigation, then the obvious action is energy conservation. "Energy conservation movement" has a nice familiar ring to it, too. A connector might improve it: "energy/conservation" or "energy•conservation" implying that using less energy conserves more than just energy, and conservation of other things also tends to conserve energy. I'd go with that, or an updated variant such as LESS.<br><br>By contrast, the gay rights movement had the clear goal of legalizing gay marriage in the U.S..<br><br>The importance of such a goal is that it allows one to engage in debate, in the formal meaning of that word, meaning not just any argument but an argument over a choice that can be made, by specific people or groups, in the present or future. For peak oil, because there was no consensus for action (no premise, in debate-speak), "debates" over peak oil outside the central sites were largely limited to arguing about whether or not it or its claimed follow-on effects would happen.<br><br>This seems similar to other stalled movements I've encountered, in support and in opposition. Creationists tend to want to "debate" about where the world came from, and most 9/11 conspiracy theorists want to "debate" about whether or not there were explosives in the towers. Oddly, I've found that given the opportunity to transform those arguments into valid actionable debate premises (such as "Creationism shall be taught in public schools" or "A new international investigation of the events of 9/11 shall be conducted") for the purpose of debate, most proponents will resolutely avoid doing so. I find that strange, and a bad sign. Unfortunately, a number of peak oil activists I encountered followed the same pattern, being more than willing to tell me what I should expect or believe but reluctant to discuss what I (or anyone) should do about it.<br><br><br><a href=#c3223498085285560773 title="comment permalink">12/15/16, 1:35 PM</a><br><br>

Being a central MD native and having gone to college there in the late '60s, my roommate was a Cumberland native and at the time I was seeing a young lady who lived in LaVale. I became somewhat familiar with the area, as I drove out to Cumberland to visit quite a number of times in my '63 Ford. His father was a mechanical engineer for a local consulting firm and her father had moved the family there from Texas, also to work for a sizable tech related concern. At the time, 1968-70, the big industries were mining and such major employers such as PPG, Allegheny-Ludlum Steel, Celanese, and Kelly Springfield (Goodyear) Tire, all employing a lot of blue-collar folks at very decent pay scales. Still, even then it was apparent that things had begun to fray at the edges, and Cumberland had always had a bit of a dodgy-hillbilly reputation with those from a bit farther to the east. Personally I liked the place a great deal, with it's low cost of living, access to recreation, Deep Creek &amp;c, down-to-earth attitude and canals and rivers and old brick buildings. While it's sad to hear of further economic decline, I can see why one might choose it as a place to live in during these increasingly interesting times. Clearly our host has done so, and with it his small part to reverse the aforementioned drain.<br><br><br><a href=#c6633974317741578658 title="comment permalink">12/15/16, 1:57 PM</a><br><br>

As far as I can see, these predictions, in general terms, have pretty much come to pass. But this would also happen over a long period of time.<br><br>Production of conventional (i.e. the standard drill-rig in a field) oil would begin to decline (it did), the price would rise from the roughly $20/Bbl price it held for decades (it did), unconventional and hard-to access sources would then be economical to exploit (e.g. 2000m down in the Gulf of Mexico or fracking or the Alberta Tar Sands), but the high price would cause economic dislocation (an ignored contributing factor to the 2008 crash and subsequent non-recovery-recovery), which would cause the price to fluctuate wildly over a period of time... and when previous fluctuations were on the order of $5 up or down that caused heart palpitations and cold sweats on the trading floor have now become fluctuations of $30 or so, I'd say that, in the parlance of the previous era, that's pretty wild.<br><br>You are correct, that some specific predictions failed, but my understanding of the overarching prediction, in the same way you describe the general narrative of the collapse of the U.S. Empire or the general narrative of the decline of Western Civilization. You frequently point out that the details differ and specifics cannot be described, but the morphology remains the same. Maybe I'm an outlier, but I'm comparing the rise and decline of the oil age to a wave, not a trampoline, with a decades-long transition period of crashes and bumps. It took 100 years to build up a massive oil-dependent economy and it will take time to eventually wind down, fast-crash fantasies or super-high-tech-pseudo-green fantasies notwithstanding. Again, as you have pointed out frequently these are the binary narratives of the civil religion of Progress, I expect -- and expected 10 years ago -- the global winding down to proceed over decades, not days.<br><br><a href=#c1924832282058806093 title="comment permalink">12/15/16, 2:15 PM</a><br><br>

First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.” I am not sure if we are at stage one or two in the peak oil truth. No later than 10 years after peak oil, we will enter stage three. People will be wondering why we did not see it coming. <br><br>Why has the Peak Oil movement failed? Well we have not quite identified the peak oil moment. It will come and the benefit of hindsight will help identify it. A blink in time, 10 years’ delay, will not make a difference in the big scheme of things.<br> <br>As to alternative energy sources that most expect, we need to highlight an essential advantage of fossil fuels. Two thirds of the ingredients in mass are not required to be carried to the point of combustion. The O2 is present in our atmosphere. We can draw on it when required to release incredible energy from carbon such as oil or coal in the chemical reaction that produces CO2. This is an absolutely essential point. A lithium battery must contain all the energy required to power the attached electric motor. We cannot take part of the ingredients from the environment.<br> <br>While net energy is a good point, the fact that high net energy is never likely to be more easily available from anything other than fossil fuels needs to be made. The O2 part is all around us. I have never heard a peak oiler talk about this.<br> <br>The dream of fusion also contains an inherent flaw of thought.

It could be getting even more traction right now, if it was still out there pushing. <br><br>Prizm, thank you. As you've noted, one of the things that can be done with a peak oil narrative is reframe it in terms of "a lot more things will have to be done by human muscles," = "more jobs." There are other ways to reframe it along the same lines. It really isn't that hard, once you get out from under the progress-or-apocalypse ideology. <br><br>Wendy, one thing a renewed peak oil movement could do would be to lobby for greatly improved passenger rail service. Here again, that would ally with existing interests and get people thinking of the movement as something that can give them something they want if they support it. <br><br>Ed, that's the sad thing. As I noted above, there were a number of us who were talking about how marginal fossil fuel sources would be brought on line once the price of oil went high enough, and I've also discussed the way that costs from those are being externalized to create a false impression of their economic viability -- but the core peak oil narrative rejected that. Oh well. <br><br>RobM, if that's the case, why are so many people so passionate about believing that the world is about to come to an end for one reason or another? That has no happy ending either -- everybody dies -- and yet it's always popular.

The reasons why so many people dismiss global warming as a hoax, it seems to me, have less to do with the failures of our education system -- bad as that is -- and more to do with the collapsing prestige of science in contemporary society, on the one hand, and the role climate change has had as a stalking horse for class warfare on the part of the affluent against the working classes, on the other. Of course a renewed peak oil movement would have to guard against those, too. <br><br>Kristofv, it's entirely possible that one of the things behind the current fad for austerity policies is a sort of sidelong recognition of limits. I wonder, though. There are deep and tangled roots to the currently fashionable attitude that the vulnerable must be punished for their vulnerability, and that attitude can be found just as widespread on the left as on the right -- it just chooses different targets.<br><br>Hereward, thank you! I'll check it out as circumstances permit. <br><br>Greg, as long as those subsidies aren't tax writeoffs, I'd be very much in favor of that.

It was those who kept talking about demand destruction who should have been listened to, at least as a Plan B. <br><br>Lucas, er, you may need to get out more. A great many people did in fact get bent way out of shape by the suggestion that same sex couples ought to have the right to get married. <br><br>Paulo, that is to say, the reality of peak oil is still clamping down on us, even though the movement fell apart. <br><br>Varun, hmm! That's an interesting prospect. I'll think about it. <br><br>Bill, er, you're aware of groups such as ASPO, Post Carbon Institute, etc.? That's what I was talking about, which is why I spoke of the peak oil <i>movement</i> rather than the <i>phenomenon</i> of peak oil. The existence of the latter doesn't erase that of the former. <br><br>Dmitry, in what possible way does it "destroy the family" to allow people to form families who otherwise would be legally prohibited from doing so? You might want to lay off the koolaid a bit. <br><br>Ganv, you're right about short term thinking -- and of course another spike in oil prices is coming; I expect it to peak around 2020, and then crash again. <br><br>Gavin, exactly. I see you've figured out my diabolical strategy! <br><br>Lordberia3, nationalism could do it. There are other things that could do it as well, and of course it's not an "either-or" situation. <br><br>Mark, there were several objectives. One was to get governments to take proactive steps to deal with declining supplies of crude oil. Obviously we're past the point where that could happen, if it was even a possibility. Another was to get communities, local groups, families, and individuals to do the same thing -- and that's still very much a live option.

As for The Oil Drum, I miss it too -- I used to read it daily. <br><br>Keith, that is to say, you find the way you've framed the narrative of late capitalism more interesting than the way you frame the narrative of energy. Not everyone necessarily agrees with your framing, you know. <br><br>Mister R., keep in mind that there's a whole continuum of oil between the lightest sweetest crude and the crap they dig out of the ground in Alberta. As the good stuff runs out, the slightly less good will take its place, and the slightly worse still after that. I doubt we'll see blind panic -- just an unsteady downward movement, like riding a defective elevator that goes down one lurch at a time. <br><br>Little Al, did you think of pointing out to your friend just how much in the way of subsidies the oil industry gets from the US government, via the depletion allowance and other giveaways? It's pretty phenomenal. <br><br>Clay, hmm. Have you considered running candidates for city offices who will set aside more bike-only corridors and the lke? <br><br>Bob, but there were specific reasons why peak oil got that label, and it didn't have to happen that way. <br><br>Russell, and yet the peak oil movement got going when petroleum was $10 a barrel. I still don't buy it. <br><br>ChemEng, er, I should probably point out that some of us did predict the drop in oil prices -- and, of course, Trump's victory -- well in advance. So it's not just 20/20 hindsight. <br><br>Brian, finding a way to screen out dysfunctional professional activists would be useful, yes. Some lodges I've worked with use the term "flake filters" -- the things you have in place to filter out flaky people who will otherwise absorb all your time and energy, and give nothing back in return. <br><br>Anton, good! But in this case there's a further confusion, because "gas" can mean "gasoline" or "natural gas," and the latter's the thing Tim was talking about. <br><br>Roberta, fortunately peak knowledge doesn't have to equal peak reasoning.

I'd really like to have some faith that our government is robust and flexible enough to allow things to continue without any major, violent conflicts, but that will require a lot of persuasion among many people who have seemingly different ideals.

You've put your finger on a core issue -- any future peak oil movement, to have any chance of shaping events, must have a specific goal in mind and must measure every choice against that goal. Mitigating the impacts of fossil fuel depletion -- that's a suitable goal. Once a movement has that in mind, whenever a proposal comes up, you can simply ask, "does this do anything to mitigate the impacts of fossil fuel depletion?' -- and if it doesn't, into the dumpster it goes. Period. Of course, as you've pointed out, that also encourages productive rather than unproductive debates, and it has a range of other good features as well. <br><br>Cherokee, I think that the media makes a big fuss about how horrible living off the grid is because otherwise, people would find out that it's more fun than the life the media wants them to lead. As for a postmortem for the year -- of course! That'll be either on the 28th of this month or the 4th of next month, I'm not yet sure which. <br><br>RAnderson, one of the details they didn't mention is that you can buy a 4 bedroom house here, a nice one, for $50k. It really is much cheaper to live in the rust belt...<br><br>Renaissance, you were clearly reading the more nuanced and historically literate end of the peak oil scene! That was, unfortunately, a minority view. <br><br>Ed-M, cheer up -- you could have squandered it on the Kardashians instead. ;-)<br><br>Emmanuel, excellent. Yes -- that's one form of an core concept from systems theory, the concept of homeostasis. Complex systems always respond to a disruptive influence with actions that attempt to restore balance. Buffering is one of the ways they do this. The climate is a complex system, and so is the global energy economy -- and so they behave accordingly. (It occurs to me that I should do a series of posts on basic systems theory one of these days...) <br><br>Molly, why do you say "too"? I'm a moderate Burkean conservative, you know, and conservatives are at least as likely to use renewable energy as liberals -- in some contexts, even more so. <br><br>Rapier, as I noted above, the impact of negative real interest rates on the energy situation is something that a lot of us missed. That simply guarantees that the real (nonfinancial) costs get externalized somewhere else -- but it's still a twist that matterrs, of course. <br><br>Sydney, I don't think there will ever be a "peak oil moment," except maybe in retrospect. Rather, changes will happen, and explanations will be invented after the fact. Your two remaining points, though, are spot on.<br><br><a href=#c7224739683128306609 title="comment permalink">12/15/16, 6:33 PM</a><br><br>

Any energy source that requires combustion/oxidation (in layman’s terms “burning“) is in a sense “outsourcing” to the wider environment a key requirement of the energy releasing process. The “waste product“ CO2 also needs to be outsourced into the environment for the process to contunue. <br><br>A simple example would be a car running in a completely sealed garage. The gas tank is full and you start the car. After using up the oxygen in the garage, it wouldn’t continue to run. Also, if the exhaust pipe of the car just filled the garage with CO2, the engine would eventually stop. So there needs to be an external source of O, plus the waste product CO2 needs to be externalized.<br><br>Going further, since we live on a finite planet, there is only so much “free” oxygen in the atmosphere at any given time. Where does that oxygen come from? Ultimately from green plants which metabalize CO2 using the sun’s energy. See “oxygen cycle”.<br><br>Unlike the car in the garage, the earth is a closed system as far as material inputs are concerned, it only requires light/heat energy from the sun.<br><br><a href=#c4700746333543681676 title="comment permalink">12/15/16, 8:12 PM</a><br><br>

What I wonder though is since our money is fiat (i.e. by decree only), as long as people accept the US dollar for the labor to extract the diminishing returns of resources in the ground, then really, why can't this go on for a lot lot longer? I mean some big oil company says well it will cost us one Brazilian dollars to extract that really resource intensive shale, which will provide less than one Brazilian dollars of energy output, but it doesn't matter because the Fed can conjure up the one Brazilian dollars at will for the big oil company (actually a little more complicated through lending to banks and share buybacks, but the net result is the same).

After all if there is less petroleum available then less will be burned. Peak oil is the cure for global warming. Energy efficiency and transition away from carbon will be mandated by the market and economics of scarcity. Whoopie, job done!

This year there was a "Great Green Fleet" initiative which consisted entirely of some biogas additives to existing fuel. Sounds a lot like "Greenwashing." Does about as much good as the 15% corn ethanol added to conventional gasoline (basically just a subsidy dumpster, and diverts land use from things like FOOD). <br><br>Also, the next generation of ships are horrendously expensive for their capabilities, and I don't remember if efficiency was even a design criteria. <br><br>Also, the streets in Norfolk (home of the world's largest Naval base) flood any time there is significant rainfall. Some lower lying areas have similar problems to Miami where the seawater comes OUT the sewer drains at high tide. With another 2 feet or so of sea level rise, I suspect the city will need serious infrastructure changes. On the base, sure the piers could be further elevated, but the vast parking lots where all the sailors park who actually work on the ships wouldn't be able to get there.

Part of the re-branding of global warming into climate change was a way to explain the phenomenon that would be able to answer the thought-stoppers of the "if global warming is real, why is there a freak blizzard in May?" variety, which basically the same thing as the "if peak oil is real, why are oil prices down" argument. It seems like different ways of attempting to deny peak oil have different chinks in their armor. For Solar and nuclear enthusiasts, there's net energy and other non-renewables with their own depletion curves such as rare earth metals for Solar, and Uranium for Nuclear. Fracking and other "tight oil" sources are probably the easiest part of the energy industry to use as an illustration of how net energy works, since its return on investment is so transparently reflected based on the oil prices at which it becomes profitable, or crashes as reflected in the late Fracking bust. For oil itself, part of how I've started slowly converting my friend in the oil industry over to understanding some things about peak oil is just through helping to prepare him for instability. I impressed him during this last cycle by warning him in advance that work was about to start getting scarce, and then letting him know accurately roughly when prices would start rising and giving him work again. With oil, it's starting to look like we're well into the "bumpy plateau" phase of the classic Peak Oil model right now, and one good strategy while in that phase might be pointing out the extremely transparent net energy and resource issues with the alternatives, in order to get alternative energy advocates to do the one thing they're currently refusing to do (adding reduction and conservation to their calls for alternative energy), while shifting the attention on oil away from the long game of decline and towards energy instability, since at that point the violent price swings and systemic instabilities that are part of this phase of peak oil can be more easily worked into the layman's understanding of the model.<br><br><a href=#c327731379499716336 title="comment permalink">12/16/16, 7:20 AM</a><br><br>

The oil industry’s history is too full of booms and busts to not realize it’s a spiral. That combined with the tremendous supply of unconventional sources means any descent could be extended out for a very long time. The Atlantic Republic could continue scrape by on tar sands after fracking dries up and then turn to coal liquefaction before the search becomes moot.<br><br>A positive message will be key to any successor to the peak oil movement. A doom and gloom message was my major take away from the old peak oil movement, and help lead to the movement’s downfall when things looked immediately less grim. That sort of message does work especially well in eras of revolution &amp; strife, but since the goal is to minimize that era as much as possible, it’s self-defeating. I don’t think making a positive message needs to be as hard as others have made it out to be. <br><br>While one can’t promise a life of cornucopian plenty, there’s other positive things it can promote. Pride and joy in both work and creative acts are lacking in the lives of many, and are a natural fit. Thrift and frugality are popular in many circles. For example, tapping into “Buy it for Life” groups to push for older but lasting approaches could pay off. There is the rich treasure trove of concepts and symbols inherited from the Romantics that can be used.<br><br><a href=#c4821125925907301261 title="comment permalink">12/16/16, 9:33 AM</a><br><br>

But there's one you mentioned you'd get around to writing and I've been waiting for. That is...why are most of the world's central banks pursuing zero and negative interest rate policies? What are the reasons for paying the borrower to borrow while taxing a saver? Does it have anything to do with the occasional articles I read about a supposed "war on cash" or is that just more catastrophizing blown out of proportion?<br><br>The only thing I can think of is to break the huge supply of money sloshing around the world looking for "investment opportunities". The law of supply and demand applies - I presume - to the investment market just as much as any other kind of market. <br><br>I'm sure there must be costs to implementing these strategies but for the moment the only one I can really see as obvious in my own life is the impact it has on retirees. My mother (in her mid-70s) constantly moans about the horrible returns she's getting on her various savings accounts and retirement account. She spent most of her adult working life thinking when she was in her 70s and 80s the interest on her savings would keep her comfortable. The same goes for my dad (in his late 70s) though he's less vocal about it. I know he too is frustrated and angry about it.<br><br>So I'd really like to see you do a post on why so many world banks are pursuing these policies. There surely must be angles to it I don't know about and haven't considered. It also will likely interest your international readers as well since these monetary policies aren't an exclusively U.S. phenomenon.<br><br><a href=#c2982399702902986356 title="comment permalink">12/16/16, 9:46 AM</a><br><br>

I have also not acquired any that need truly high temperatures, UVB, significant amounts of meat for food, or large quarters.

To me, this attitude is a red flag showing that people might be in an echo chamber. The idea that anyone worth giving basic respect to might disagree is denied. Thus the constant need to name the psychological issue that causes them to deny the obvious. This is convenient if you want to not have to question the belief you have chosen.<br><br>Of all the people I know who are horrified, perhaps even a little embarrassed at my lack of getting with the program, not one has openly come to me and asked me why I don't buy it.

I find peak oil and overshoot in general enough of a worry all by itself. The others fly to South America for vacation, have dishwashers, and drive 50 miles to a better grocery store and don't carpool when they do it.

Across six studies, we rely on this notion to demonstrate that conservatives are positively affected by past- but not by future-focused environmental comparisons. Past comparisons largely eliminated the political divide that separated liberal and conservative respondents’ attitudes toward and behavior regarding climate change, so that across these studies conservatives and liberals were nearly equally likely to fight climate change.

This referendum constituted ;-) an effort by evangelical leaders in this state to continue a number culture war battles. And voters said NO 60-40. Do you see similar grass roots rejection of culture war issues where you live? Are those rejections an off shoot of evangelicals turning away from political crusading at the personal level?<br><br><a href=#c1864113987565607741 title="comment permalink">12/16/16, 5:57 PM</a><br><br>

Now with low energy prices, interest has gone down, but not down to zero level. I expect energy issues to gain traction once more whenever oil prices go up again. <br><br>It is also clear that the basic message of having to do with less energy, less stuff is not palatable to most, hence the temptation to turn away and gaze at the extravagant claims made for renewable energy. It is irresistible. <br><br>The myth of progress prevents the vast majority of people in ever contemplating a post peak life of having less of nearly everything and of relying more on local resources. <br><br>I also got involved with local trade unions and small centre left green political organisations in attempting to raising energy issues. It got some traction, but the collapse in oil prices, the upsurge of shale oil and natural gas convinced many that technology will come up with timely responses, so why the haste. <br><br>I also saw with some horror that once our local centre left political organisations got funding from abroad, their interests in peak oil just dropped to zero and they got obsessed with climate change while doing exactly nothing about it. <br><br>Although I agree with JMG's analysis, in my experience the collapse in oil prices, the myth of progress did much to incapacitate peak oil movements and hinder any attempts to push forward sustainability issues. <br><br>I still try to maintain interest (via newspaper articles in my country) on energy and sustainability issues because in spite of all I occasionally meet people who read my articles, liked them and were interested in the issues raised. <br><br>It is still very worthwhile to do so for it keeps the issues alive and creates greater public awareness from which future movements may arise. <br><br>I am not too sure that "net energy" should be the next battle horse as although a simple concept to grasp, it is very difficult to get figures about it that are accepted by most people. But certainly it ought to be part of the cavalry! <br><br>These days, it seems to me more appropriate to talk in terms of the sustainability of human civilisation and the need to respond to the dynamics of change that we, ourselves, have triggered. <br><br>Perhaps, we could call ourselves "sustainability activists" for the focus is now how to ensure that a cultured, human and sustainable civilisation(JMG's thinking is acknowledged there!) actually makes it to the future. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c1056065591254629822 title="comment permalink">12/16/16, 8:43 PM</a><br><br>

Before that and for many years I used to write the occasional article here and there, but I had a background feeling that a turning point had been reached in our society and thought that providing an example of another approach to life would be helpful to others. All the writing about the fun hasn't changed the course that we are personally on! Not one bit. I gave the community groups a go in various forms and the incessant squabbling drove me bananas. I'm a practical kind of guy after all and so I worry about outcomes whilst others tend to worry about process.<br><br>I've been slowly absorbing the contents and message of the book Overshoot into my brain and world perspective and I'm personally curious about your views on a question or perhaps it is more of a concept that has been troubling me: I can't quite come to grips with the jettisoning and shutting down of the existing infrastructure which is going on down here right now. You see I realise that there are environmental gains to be made from pursuing that strategy, but I also realise that that strategy is being pursued for short term economic gains at the cost of making our society less resilient and of course those costs are being borne by the working class - and pretty soon the middle and also the salaried class will share that one too.<br><br>I get all of that, but what I don't understand in my own thoughts is that I'm sort of conflicted between policies that navigate a middle way between those conflicting objectives where everybody gets something but nobody is happy and the future is faced realistically and with good grace. My gut feeling tells me that we are so far in denial that we can't get to that place without a lot of societal pain which forces us to abandon previous narratives and replace them with workable ones. Dunno.<br><br>For example, I'm really curious as to how you began to imagine the Retrotopia fictional world? Clearly such a world is still perhaps not good for the environment, and it too faces the very real prospect of demanding too much from its environment and resources, but at the same time it is a more humane society and perhaps has less abstract stories running it so perhaps it could adapt more readily to changing circumstances.<br><br>The turning point for me in wondering about this was the recent announcement of the imminent close down of the Hazelwood coal fired power station down here. It makes great sense to do so from the perspective of the environment, but from a resiliency point of view it makes no sense whatsoever, and nobody is willing to question the growth narrative. It is like being on a sinking ship and chucking people over board every now and then just so that you - who is left on board can enjoy a few more hours of life. As a strategy it makes no sense whatsoever because the ship will still sink.<br><br>I reckon I'm mildly confused about it all...<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c533636200090639227 title="comment permalink">12/17/16, 3:03 AM</a><br><br>

The other part is buyers willing to put money into investments which promise no nominal interest, but guarantee return of principal (with "full faith and credit" of the issuing bank). No-interest bonds make sense when everything else offers substantial risk of loss: real-estate can fall in value, automobile buyers can default on their loans, banks can fail (or impose fees), businesses can face falling demand with no useful way to use new capital, stock markets can tumble overnight, precious metals can be stolen, etc. <br><br>The offer of zero-interest bonds indicates central-bank attempts to accelerate economic activity; the purchase of zero-interest bonds indicates pessimism about any other investment option.<br><br>A related topic is "inflation-indexed savings bonds". US citizens can buy them directly from the US Treasury, on-line, in any amount up to $10,000 per year, and expect the interest paid to be updated every six months, according to the Consumer Price Index, for the next 30 years. There are no fees, sales commissions, or secondary market, and very little interest paid (for the last few years), so they get no publicity from the usual financial middlemen who profit from the churn of other investment options.

Loved it. Loved them all actually.<br><br>Second, in answer to your "collapse fatigue" offering, my wife and I couldn't agree more. We are in the process of developing an organic family farm for a wealthy landowning friend, have been since May Day. This is the 3rd time since we "went sane" so many years ago that we have tried this co-farming, co-housing experiment. And yes, it's starting to come apart again. Predictably, I might add.<br><br>Each time I think we got distracted by the shiny - in our case it's mostly sunny open land (we live in a heavily wooded area and I have a hard time cutting down big beautiful trees), springs, access to power equipment, a farm-building budget this time, not to mention a much larger, nicer house to live in all 3 times.<br><br>In each case the trade-offs don't end up being worth it. We miss our property, our off-grid cottage that we built with our own hands, the pace of our life particularly, the quiet, the autonomy, the collapsing early... And in every case the barony has either gone back on their promises, or been intolerable enough, personality-wise, to offset the draw to their property. Sheesh. It's tiring.<br><br>So, we're probably going to slowly break ties, slowly start shifting back home after the new year, and head back to our already-collapsed way of life. Again.

Humans develop into functional beings with a large cultural toolbox to finish off what nature provides at birth. Although healthy human beings retain the ability to adapt throughout their lifetimes, an argument can be made that the important work in forming individuals is completed early in life. A broad direction is set, and human growth potential is largely baked in. Minds are set, making change a slow process. However, the young offer potential for change, if not crushed in the process. This is why conservatism is mostly held, the consequences for failure are too frightening to contemplate and those advocating change face added pressure and responsibility. The have to be "right".<br><br>This cultural and sociological component is THE most important deciding factor determining the course of events. The leaders, elders, parents, take the responsibility to pass on this cultural component of human development. If the culture is WRONG headed, only an external force will bring about change. The ideology driving Monoculture we see today, as easily seen in the process of modern industrial agriculture, applies across different aspects of society. This is what the new Feudalism attempts to point out. A return to a highly polarized society made more brutal by the maintenance of an unjust hierarchy.<br><br>The cultural problem is not solved by better arguments to refute monoculture or better, more accurate future predictions to the course of events. Its building and maintaining a different culture. Insight must be translated into the physical world. Direct action is the most important feature. What you do. The failure comes from this lack of integration between insightful ideas and physical social structures. The failures of our current cultural models are becoming painfully obvious.

They’re afraid that if they raise interest rates to historic levels, they’ll precipitate a recession or depression - see the mis-cue the Federal Reserve made in 1937 that plunged the recovery from the Great Depression into a secondary depression.<br><br><br>@John Roth<br><br>This probably explains much about zero interest rates and I was aware of it. But it doesn't explain negative interest rates very well to my mind. The Federal Reserve has considered the topic in some of their meetings from what I've read although they have yet to jump on the negative rate bandwagon. But even bringing it up means they're exploring it as a possible tool in the Federal Reserve box. <br><br>The EU could pursue zero interest rates just like the U.S. but it hasn't for quite some time and still doesn't. It also convinced Japan to emulate EU negative interest policy, not Federal Reserve zero interest policy. Why? What did Japan find so persuasive? Japan is famous for its peoples' high savings rate. That is no small political matter to put what amounts to a tax on the savers of Japan. But there must be some convincing reason for it or Japan's CB wouldn't have bought into it.<br><br>I hope JMG will get around to explaining his take on this in a dedicated post and what it might have to do with The Long Descent.

This enables borrowers do something productive with the money: prepare for a career, build a profitable factory, drill a productive oil well, work productive farm land, drive a car to work, etc. Finance (tertiary wealth) then allows consumable goods (secondary wealth)to be produced from raw materials (primary wealth), and everybody shares in the profits via the interest payments. But as the primary wealth is depleted, and the market for consumable goods is saturated, then finance is left chasing its tail. Inflation of the money supply can keep the interest payments flowing, but not enough to preserve the buying power of the depositor. <br><br>Which would you rather have: 4% interest paid in a 6% inflation environment, 0% percent interest with 2% inflation, or -1% interest "paid" with 1% inflation?

More on this as we proceed...<br><br>Chris, that's a hugely important point, of course. One of the basic rules of game theory is that you can only maximize one variable at a time; if you prioritize the biosphere, sooner or later you're going to have to accept less resilience, and if you prioritize resilience, sooner or later you're going to have to accept a worse outcome for the biosphere. Thus in the real world you end up making awkward compromises between a flurry of competing variables, none of which can be neglected but none of which can be given absolute priority.

It was one of the factors responsible for the 2008 financial crash and has acted as a drag on growth ever since then. We need to be carrying out research to show how the high oil prices and decreasing EROI have been affecting growth and destroying the pound in our pockets. This is what is important to people.

The Price mechanism is supposed to deal with scarcity. Unfortunately with peak oil the price mechanism breaks down. The price mechanism is supposed to signal scarcity because the price goes up. And sure, the price of oil does go up when supply cannot keep up with demand. However oil is not like other products as it is one of the basic energy sources our economies rely on. So when the oil price goes up the economy eventually goes into recession and this brings down demand and the oil price crashes. Therefore price is no longer acting as a signal of scarcity.<br><br>In conventional economics there is an infinite number of substitutes that we can use when one product goes into scarcity. This might have worked 100 or 200 years ago as when wood became scarce we could move on to coal. However we now live in a world of scarcity and all the substitutes out there contain low concentrations of energy than oil and are more expensive and have a low energy return on investment. You can’t run a modern industrial society on energy sources like this. <br><br>The inability of modern economic s to understand peak oil may be one of the reasons why some in the peak oil movement made the mistake that oil prices would remain high when scarcity hit.<br><br><br><a href=#c3173634922915294580 title="comment permalink">12/18/16, 4:35 AM</a><br><br>

It still remains controversial. All the information I have is anecdotal. There's Trump's embrace of the LGBT community during his campaign, and here in KY, we had an openly gay mayor run against Rand Paul, and the tone of that election was way different than in the past. Neither side brought up sexuality as an issue. Over 15 years ago, Ernesto Scorsone ran for a local Congressional seat, and there was a "whispering campaign" against him, and his GOP opponent directly said that he could not be for "family values" since he was not married. I don't think he was out at the time. The incoming state House speaker has stated that he is "focused on economic, not social issues". This is just a sea change in tone from the 80s-90s, when the GOP was running on social issues and "family values", with homophobia leading the way. I'm not sure if it's the Trump effect, but the GOP seems to feel that it's in their benefit not to push social issues anymore. We'll see come January if they actually follow through in action.

They refuse to eat anything but tiny live food, which means they are very hard for us to feed, and most people who buy them would have them starve to death.'

Perhaps I had a sense that the peak oil movement would not be permanent, and my novel was cast in a light-hearted and whimsical tone. Even so, I was asking questions about history, civilized life, and the nature of events. I think it's unfortunate to compare peak oil to same-sex marriage, which is an emblem for sterility. No, what could have happened and maybe should have happened was a renewal of the concept of stewardship: that is to say, the things that need to be done, environmentally and spiritually, to ensure continuity and create future. If anything, the West presents a case of an economy that has run off the rails and functions purely as a predator. What peak oil should have told us is this: to not use up everything makes future possible.

It wasn't until Saul became Paul that Christianity really began to blossom into a force to be reckoned with, lasting until present in its various incarnations.

But where I see people’s eyes glaze over is when the impact on peak oil gets to agriculture (not the transportation, but production), clothing, medicine, and just about any mass consumer product. You rapidly go from a small problem with an easy solution - I’ll just drive less or ride my bike - to a huge one since oil drives our entire society. The trick of any future peak oil movement will be to break down the societal dependence into smaller chunks, and fashion the outreach programs on them, leaving the overall integration for later, if ever.<br><br>The other issue is what I call the third-rail of peak oil - population. The sad fact is a non-fossil fueled world cannot support the current human population. How do you advocate, educate, or motivate a global population reduction of at least 30% over the next 30-50 years? Theoretically, it’s easy - just have a birth-death ratio of about 99% - about a 5% reduction in what we currently have. But from an advocacy viewpoint, people treat you like a one-eyed purple people eater if you bring it up. Perhaps this is a problem that will sort itself out, like during the collapse of the Soviet Union where chunks of the population simply “opted-out” by various methods.<br><br>As you rightly said in your closing, we now face a predicament, not a problem. While people are going to demand solutions, the most we can offer are mitigations. I can definitely see a movement where we present the steps to climb down as the whole fossil fueled society ratchets down in systemic creative (and no so creative) destruction. Local/sustainable farming, energy conservation where possible, alternative energy where appropriate, reduction of consumable goods in favor of durable ones (cloth diapers), and other things quickly come to mind. The hard part will be keeping focus when the timeline is likely to exceed the lifetime of most people living today.<br><br><br><a href=#c1638366588142605939 title="comment permalink">12/19/16, 7:57 PM</a><br><br>

Eliminating suicide prevention, addiction treatment, smoking cessation and anti-smoking programs are a good place to start. Developing less biophobic attitudes towards these predicaments could go a long way towards getting life expectancy down to more manageable levels. Looking at these things philosophically with a sense of fatalism or indifference could help. Not viewing every disease as needing a cure and thinking "if not for X, then what will people die of?" when people crusade for "curing" every imaginable disease is a good start. Simply surveying the vast cultural differences in attitudes towards disease and death and adopting a less biophobic one than the West would help. The Russians manage to be much more indifferent to smoking and drinking than the US. The third world is much more indifferent to disease and dying. It would really help if we viewed a lot of these things as predicaments and not problems in need of solving, and stopped getting so biophobically bent out of shape over them, and stopped trying to extend life as far as possible.<br>Regarding peak oil, one thing I think the US should have tried, but never probably will, is price controlling gasoline with a minimum price of say, $6-8/gal. or more, and investing the difference between the retail price of a gallon of gas and the cost to produce a gallon of gas, into conservation and less extravagantly wasteful transportation options. The same could be done for other fossil fuels, and should have been done starting in the 70s instead of the useless National Maximum Speed Limit. The only way to get people to change is to hit them in the pocketbook, and provide other alternatives (trains, transit, etc.)<br><br><a href=#c201769399308151355 title="comment permalink">12/20/16, 2:11 PM</a><br><br>

You are right, "and bake the planet" was rhetorical overkill on my part. Perhaps "and lightly toast the planet" or "and warm the planet on both sides" would have been better.<br><br>What I was crudely trying to convey was that the unpleasant climate change results of "burning all the fossil fuels we can" will be whatever they are going to be regardless of the human timescale we do it in. From the perspective of geological time its all the same: 50 years or 150 years to burn it all are both a blip.<br><br>I understand JMG is attempting to kick the peak oil movement in its collective ass. To what end though? Most people won't change their lives much, mostly because they really can't and/or don't want to. The bulk of humanity will change only when they have to. Its like people's reaction to death. We all know we are going to die but we all live like we are going to live forever. As for death or repentance, yes, yes, yes ... but later.<br><br>The Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau put this nicely to the effect that we have to get those pipelines working to get all that dirty tar sands oil to market so we have a healthy economy to address climate change. So: yes, yes climate change ... but later. First we have to burn all the fossil fuels. <br><br>Of course I have a problem with this. But realistically, could he say or do anything else? The hope is not there. <br><br>Incidently, I expect a militant response concerning the proposed pipelines from the first nations community when push comes to shove. A friend of mine was the operations officer in the army unit sent to address the Oka crisis. The government of Quebec wanted the Canadian Army to "attack" the Mohawks who had taken possession of the land in question. When they were told "attack" means "kill", they backed down and the well orchestrated events that followed were the result of agreements to ensure all sides saved face and no one was killed. One hopes the same for the domestic oil conflicts to come. Oh ... the Mohawks won ... over a proposed golf course!<br><br>Perhaps the kick in the ass is intended to get governments to respond in a more appropriate way. I fear the more powerful governments of the world are all too aware of peak oil. The actions they have and are taking basically involve getting a lock on what's left. This is certainly not the action most in the movement would have hoped for, but can we say it was not foreseen and perfectly understandable? <br> <br>The first consequence of governmental peak oil awareness has been war. <br><br>No one in the peak oil community who got the word out should feel guilty though. Its not your fault. But, realistically, did we think it would be otherwise?<br><br><br><a href=#c5446806149962180094 title="comment permalink">12/20/16, 2:28 PM</a><br><br>

Therefore, when we say something is going to wreck Western society unless we change, we are perceived as disingenuous at best, destructive liars at worst, and moral scolds in any case.<br><br>And now for a moment let me be the scold.

Most of the long-term ways of addressing Peak Oil that I have known or had the ability to look to in the future involved investing a decent amount of it. <br><br>So, my wife and I spent much of the last few years learning what we could, whether it is crafts such as crochet (her) and leatherwork and woodwork (myself), and both of us working in the family garden. We also took classes on timber framing and building with cob. So the skill set has expanded, slowly, over the years. <br><br>We've both settled on the kind of land we are looking for, preferring to stay close to our jobs and families if able, and taking up abandoned farmland or a home with acreage. <br><br>We want to demonstrate the hope of living in a post-petroleum future. I think, more than anything, the biggest problem I have had in trying to explain what a post-petroleum future looks like is that ready examples of good, healthy living in such a way were quite scarce on the ground. It's easier now that more folks have come forward and are actively demonstrating it, getting classes into our universities and working to spread the word by mouth if nothing else. <br><br>We're not quite to the point of buying our own land, not without some help, though we finally have the means to tackle that project in the long term.
