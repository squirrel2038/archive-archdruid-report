<div class=MsoNormal>
Last month’s post here on <a href=../../2016/05/against-cultural-senility_25.html>cultural senility and its antidotes</a> discussed the way that modern education erases the past in order to defend today’s ideologies against the lessons of history. While that post focused on the leftward end of the political spectrum—the end that currently dominates what we still jokingly call “higher education” in today’s America—the erasure of the past is just as common on the other end of things. Between the political correctness of the left and the patriotic correctness of the right, it’s hardly surprising that so many Americans stumble blindly toward the future in a fog of manufactured ignorance, sedulously shielded from the historical insights that could give them a clue about the troubled landscape about them or the looming disasters ahead. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This week I’d like to discuss another aspect of that erasure of the past. I’ll be concentrating again on the way it’s done on the leftward end of things, because that’s the side that’s doing the most to deform American education just at the moment, but I’d encourage my readers to keep in mind that the issue I have in mind is a blade that has two edges and cuts both ways. That issue? The censoring of literature from the past in order to make it conform to the moral notions of the present. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It so happens, for example, that quite a few works of American literature talk about people of color in terms that many people today find extremely offensive. Now of course just as many works of American literature discuss women, sexual minorities, and just about any other group of people you care to name, other than well-to-do, college-educated, white male heterosexual Anglo-Saxon Protestants, in highly insulting terms, but let’s focus on racism for the moment. In American universities these days, it’s fashionable to insist that such works should either be tossed into the dumpster, on the one hand, or reissued in new editions from which all the offensive material has been expurgated. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The justifications for these projects are appropriately diverse. On the one hand, there’s the claim that members of groups that have been subject to racial oppression should not be required to read books containing language or ideas that justify the oppression they’ve experienced. On the other hand, there’s the claim that people who don’t belong to those groups should not be allowed to read such books, so that they don’t adopt the language or ideas in question. Off in the distance lies the utopian vision of a society free of racism, and eliminating the language and ideas that were once used to justify racism is proclaimed as a step toward that goal. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Fair enough. What does history have to say about projects of this sort?</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As it happens, it has quite a bit to say about the results of censoring the literature of the past to support the moral crusades of the present, and in that connection I’d like to introduce you to a gentleman who was once quite famous in his way, though nothing more than his last name survives in our collective imagination these days. His name was Dr. Thomas Bowdler; he was an English physician who lived from 1754 to 1825, and in his retirement he put together a new edition of Shakespeare’s plays, “in which nothing is added to the original text; but those words and expressions were omitted which cannot with propriety be read aloud in a family.” Yes, he’s the guy who inspired the verb “to bowdlerize.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He was on the cutting edge of one of the great cultural projects of the 19th-century English-speaking world, the quest to eliminate every reference to sex from public discourse. The era that would take its enduring name from Britain’s Queen Victoria reacted against the relatively freewheeling sexuality of the preceding Regency era by embracing a more than Puritan horror of sex.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This wasn’t simply a pose; people in Victorian society were profoundly sickened and offended by human sexuality and anything even distantly related to it. The result was an era in which the legs—excuse me, “limbs”—of pianos in respectable English homes had little starched cotton skirts put on them to cover their overly erotic curves; in which the British ambassador bullied the Florentine authorities into putting pantaloons on Michelangelo’s <i>David</i>, so that lady tourists from the British Isles would not be scandalized by his state of undress; and in which we all started referring to the male of the domestic fowl by the newly minted term “rooster,” because what had previously been its normal English name, “cock,” had the same genital connotations then that it does now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Victorian rejection of sexuality achieved the level of cultural unanimity that today’s advocates of political correctness hope to achieve for their rejection of racism. All through the public sphere, rigid censorship of sexual content and strenuous denunciation of improprieties were universal; reputations were ruined and careers ended by incautious utterances or, in many cases, so much as a rumor of the same; across the English-speaking world, public figures spoke approvingly of the triumph of modern morality over the disgusting habits of the past, in much the same tones of self-satisfaction you’ll hear these days at the American university of your choice. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s our comparable historical example. How well did it work? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s where things get interesting. Human cultures are governed by something not too different from Isaac Newton’s famous third law of motion:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“every action produces an equal and opposite reaction.” The Victorian moral crusade against sexuality thus generated its inevitable countermovement, and for most of a century—from the 1890s until the late 20th century—just about every avant-garde literary, artistic, and cultural movement in the English-speaking world went out of its way to reject Victorian sexual morality and glorify casual sex. In the mid-20th century, that same reaction burst into popular literature; some of my readers may remember the torrent of science fiction novels from the 1960s—Robert Heinlein’s <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i> is probably the most famous of them—that proclaimed uninhibited orgiastic abandon as the next glorious step in human evolution. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The difficulty that Thomas Bowdler and his many equivalents had not foreseen was that erasing sex from literature and popular culture doesn’t make people innocent and pure, it just makes them clueless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Growing up in respectable Victorian society, young people were kept ignorant of every attitude toward sexuality except the one hammered into them day after day by all the officially approved voices of their society, and the result was that they had never learned to think critically about the ethics of sex. If you raise lab rats in an environment completely free of pathogens, and then turn them loose, quite often they’ll drop dead from common diseases that a normally raised rat will shrug off with ease, because they’ve never acquired resistance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Keep young people ignorant of sexuality, and the resulting lack of resistance may not be as lethal but it’s every bit as dramatic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If the partisans of political correctness in today’s world achieve their goals, in other words, one very likely outcome is a period up to a century in length, starting some decades after political correctness becomes the conventional wisdom of society, in which every avant-garde literary, artistic, and cultural movement in Europe and North America will go out of its way to reject political correctness and glorify racial prejudice. I doubt that the professors who are advocating the political bowdlerization of literature realize that this is where their efforts are leading, but then history has a nasty sense of humor, and seems to delight in playing such tricks on those who don’t pay attention to the lessons she has to offer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s go deeper, though. The strategy of bowdlerization assumes that the best way, or even the only way, to discourage undesirable expressions and ideas is to keep people ignorant of them. The history of previous attempts at moral censorship shows that exactly the opposite is the case: since it’s never yet been possible to get rid of every expression of an undesirable idea, making people ignorant of that idea simply means that they’ll react to it uncritically when they do finally encounter it—and while some of those reactions will amount to uncritical rejection, there will also be cases of uncritical acceptance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s the alternative? The capacity for critical thinking about whatever issue is in question—and that’s a capacity that can’t be produced without exposing people to the whole spectrum of ideas that relate to the issue, even those that happen to be offensive to modern sensibilities. For reasons we’ll be exploring further on, and in future posts as well, literature is particularly well suited to this kind of examination, and it’s precisely the literature that modern politically (or patriotically) correct thinkers find reprehensible that’s most valuable in this context. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A specific example will be more useful here than any number of generalities, so let’s take a look at a writer who’s come in for quite a bit of condemnation along the lines just sketched out: the American horror-fantasy writer H.P. Lovecraft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Was Lovecraft a racist? You bet; he proudly described himself using exactly that term in at least one of his letters. (You could get away with saying that in America between the wars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A significant fraction of Americans described themselves as racists in that era, before Auschwitz et al. made it too uncomfortably clear what kind of results then-popular notions about racial superiority could have when put into practice. I mentioned history’s nasty sense of humor earlier; one solid example is the fact that the single most enduring impact the career of Adolf Hitler had on Western culture was to make overt racism and antisemitism unfashionable in many circles.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Lovecraft’s racism wasn’t simply a privately held opinion, either. He put racist tropes into many of his stories. With very few exceptions, the people of color who appear in his fiction fall into a handful of classic stereotypes—the deferential drudges who “know their place,” the mindless masses who can do nothing right, the sinister and swarthy figures who deliberately serve the Wrong Side—if you know the pop culture of the time, you’ve met them all. Multiracial people tend to get even worse press at Lovecraft’s hands, with all the usual tropes present and accounted for; in particular, when you find out that a group of people in a Lovecraft story are multiracial, you can pretty much take it for granted that they’re in league with the tentacled horrors who are out to devour mankind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now it’s entirely possible to make a case that Lovecraft deserves to be read despite these unpleasant habits. That case has been made by a range of gifted writers, who point out that Lovecraft is among the greatest figures in 20th century horror fiction, and that the imaginative depth and the extraordinary richness of the philosophical issues with which he deals justify keeping him out of the dumpster to which politically correct opinion would consign him. I think there’s a lot to be said for that case, but it’s not the case I propose to make here. Rather, I’d like to suggest that if you want to get a clear sense of the underlying psychology of American racism—an understanding of the sort that will make it impossible for you to take racist notions seriously ever again—a close reading of the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft is a very good place to start. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s start by noting something that hasn’t always been given its due in studies of Lovecraft: people of color weren’t the only people who came in for abuse at his hands. His attitudes toward poor rural white people, as set out in such stories as “Beyond the Wall of Sleep” and “The Lurking Fear,” were just as bigoted. In Lovecraft, with few exceptions, if you’re not a well-to-do, college-educated white male heterosexual Anglo-Saxon Protestant, you’re probably being demeaned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, what gave the nonhuman critters at the heart of his most famous stories their frisson of horror in his eyes wasn’t so much that they’re hostile, as that they have the effrontery to exist at all. Consider “Dagon,” usually considered the first of Lovecraft’s mature stories, in which the narrator witnesses a huge, vaguely humanoid, vaguely froggy-fishy creature worshipping at a monolith that’s been thrust up out of the ocean by an earthquake. This sight drives the narrator to drug himself with morphine, and when his cash runs out, to fling himself out the window to a certain death. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Why? The froggy-fishy thing isn’t overtly hostile; it doesn’t even appear to notice the narrator, much less resent the intrusion on its religious practices; but the mere fact that there’s another intelligent species on the planet, one with its own religious and artistic traditions, is apparently enough to unhinge the narrator’s mind so deeply that suicide is the only way out. “I cannot think of the deep sea,” Lovecraft has his narrator say, “without shuddering at the nameless things that may be at this very moment be crawling and floundering in its slimy bed, worshipping their ancient stone idols and carving their own detestable likenesses on submarine obelisks of water-soaked granite.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Would he have felt better if the nameless things were worshipping <i>our</i> idols and carving <i>our</i> detestable likenesses? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With one extremely important exception, in fact, Lovecraft’s whole approach to horror centers on trying to make questions of the sort I’ve just posed impossible to ask. The unhuman creatures at the heart of his most famous stories are dim incomprehensible shapes seen only at a distance, revealed to the narrator of a story by a babbling, frantic description uttered by some half-reliable figure unsure of what he’s seeing. Thus the closest the reader gets to the mighty devil-god Cthulhu in Lovecraft’s most famous story, “The Call of Cthulhu,” is a narrative written by one man and summarized briefly in a narrative written by another—and that’s why the story works. Get any closer to Cthulhu and you start to wonder what things look like from his perspective, and then the whole thing falls to bits. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Lovecraft’s tentacled monsters and sinister cultists have been accused of being two-dimensional, but that misses the point entirely. They work as figures of horror precisely and only because they’re two-dimensional. Give them a third dimension, an inner life, a name and a perspective of their own, and they lose much of their capacity to terrify. If you’re going to project your own fears onto something, one might say, the recipient of the projection needs to be treated as a flat screen—a point that has more than a little relevance to the prejudices that Lovecraft himself embraced.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The one time in his fiction that Lovecraft deliberately broke with the approach just described is the exception that proves the rule. <i>At the Mountains of Madness</i>, one of his three novels, features a team of Antarctic explorers who discover archaic life forms, apparently long dead, in a cavern beneath the ice. Shortly thereafter, radio contact is lost, and when other members of the expedition go looking they find that the team and their sled dogs have been torn to bits; the camp has been destroyed, and the critters are gone. It’s classic horror—except that as the story progresses and two members of the expedition follow the trail of the critters, it slowly sinks in to the reader that the critters’ actions are precisely what a group of human explorers, suddenly awakened in the far future and assaulted by bizarre alien creatures, would have done. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a stunning reversal of perspective that adds tremendous force to the story, but Lovecraft can only maintain the horror by bringing in another, even more ghastly monster, whose perspective is excluded from the story by the usual means. It was also, if I may insert a personal note, one inspiration behind my new novel <a href=http://www.miskatonicbooks.com/THE-WEIRD-OF-HALI-INNSMOUTH-by-John-Michael-Greer-Signed-Limited-Edition-Hardcover.html>The Weird of Hali: Innsmouth</a>, which stands Lovecraft on his head by placing the tentacled Great Old Ones and their multiracial worshippers at center stage, and letting them speak for themselves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There is, though, another way in which the monster’s-eye view enters Lovecraft’s fiction, and it’s deeply revealing. Over and over again in his fiction—in “The Outsider,” “Arthur Jermyn,” “The Rats in the Walls,” and “The Shadow Over Innsmouth,” to name only the best examples—the revelation that brings the story to a close is the discovery that the main character belongs to the monsters’ side of the equation after all. The connection’s nearly always via an ancestress who wasn’t what she appeared to be—this theme recurs so obsessively in Lovecraft’s fiction that I frankly wonder if Lovecraft himself knew or suspected that someone on the distaff side of his ancestry was merely passing as white. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That sort of skeleton in the mental closet is far from uncommon among racists, by the way. I’m thinking here, among many other things, of a book I read years ago about the neo-Nazi scene in the United States. The author commented in his introduction that practically every one of the neo-Nazi leaders he interviewed claimed that some other neo-Nazi leader was really gay, Jewish, or not entirely white. The author went on to note that in a good many cases, those allegations turned out to be true. I hope I don’t have to remind my readers, along similar lines, of the number of gay-bashing preachers who turned out to have boyfriends on the side. Jung’s cogent discussions of the habit of projecting the shadow are relevant here: we hate most what we can’t tolerate seeing in ourselves, and our most savage denunciations are always directed, in one sense or another, at a mirror. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You can hear that said in so many words, and it might or might not sink in. Watch H.P. Lovecraft doing it, and if you read him closely and pay attention to what he’s doing, it’s impossible to miss. He took his own frantic terror of other races, blended it with the ethnic, cultural, and economic divisions of a troubled time, and turned that bubbling mix of status panic into some of the twentieth century’s most iconic horror fiction. In the process, like all great writers—and I would argue that despite his problems, Lovecraft was a great writer—he took his own idiosyncratic experience of the world and universalized it, creating literature’s most unsparing portrayal of the hatred and terror of the Other that every human being feels at one time or another: a hatred and terror that is always directed at some part of ourselves.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Grasp that—and a close reading of H.P. Lovecraft’s fiction, again, is a good place to start grasping it—and you’ll never be able to listen to racist cant again without instantly recognizing that the racists are projecting onto the blank screen of another human life something they find intolerable in themselves. For that matter, plenty of other modes of denunciatory cant stop being plausible once you grasp the lesson Lovecraft unintentionally teaches—and a good many of those modes of cant, dear reader, are to be found on the leftward rather than the rightward end of the spectrum. That’s what literature can do, when it’s not gutted of its power by bowdlerization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That, in turn, is why reading literature that upsets you, written from points of view with which you disagree, is a crucial element in the kind of education that might just get some of us through the profoundly troubled times to come. </div>

Homework Assignment #2<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
As previously noted, since this sequence of posts is on education, there’s going to be homework. Your homework for the next month, let’s say, is to read a work of literature that offends you. The choice of book is up to you; if there’s an issue that’s too emotionally traumatic for you to tackle just now, read something on another topic instead, but don’t go too easy on yourself without good reason. You’re not expected to agree with the author—that would defeat the purpose of the assignment—but rather to understand why the world looks the way it does to the author and some of his or her readers. The same rule that governs the creation of good villains in fiction applies here: you aren’t there yet until you can imagine some set of circumstances in which you would have ended up doing the same thing.</div>

Apparently evil people wanted to take away their America Rights to Suburban Life on rural old family style mega farms; so the people from the coasts moved everyone to concentration camps. People are starving but the squirrels (possibly the only wild animal Glen could think of) are fat.<br><br>The prose is what you would expect if a middle school short story by Ayn Rand were padded out to the lower threshold for being a novel.<br><br>Sorry Glen, I am picking on you, and, really I feel for you. The book, and the afterword more so, seems saturated with a feeling that the American Dream of the Reagan/Rand flavor is dying. Yeah, I get that feeling too. But, the books explanation for that feeling is very different from my own. To me the cause is complicated enough that a guy could blog about it for a decade, if so minded to, but simple enough to call fate. To me the death of that dream is, at this point in my life, a given. For Glen, not so, he doesn't display any interest in the issues that seem more explanatory to me. The book seems to float on a suspicion that a malicious and cruelly misguided intention must be directed against the American Dream. <br><br>I think so much of the American Dream here because the book reads much better if one takes it as the account of a bad dream. I grant that some of its critiques of how power corrupts are painfully accurate when projected on to 'The Authorities' and that poetically it does represent the feeling of being trapped against a vague and threatening future that is deafening right now.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c9103315222634156103 title="comment permalink">6/22/16, 6:42 PM</a><br><br>

Now it's a combination of descriptive and pejorative, mostly weighted toward the pejorative. I grew up where people of my skin color and facial features were and are called a term, "Haole" which again is a combination of descriptive and pejorative, with probably about a 50% weight on each. But I can see it eventually leaning toward being more pejorative as times passes by. I can see how myself, in say another 30 years if I'm still around, using the word as I grew up using it, would really grate on the ears of the young. <br><br>I could never figure out what was supposed to be so scary about H.P. Lovecraft's stuff. I read one story of his that had these frog-beings who could happily swim around anywhere underwater, and were part of some ancient and planet-faring civilization, and then the supposedly horrifying part is where the protagonist finds out he himself can swim around underwater and in fact is part frog-creature. Disregarding the biological impossibility of this, my reaction would be something like, "Wow, cool!" because I'd get to explore the oceans, and learn all this neat ancient spacefaring civilization stuff. <br><br>But I guess to a white, straight, Anglo-Saxon patrician from New England, being anything but such is a horrifying thought, and Lovecraft was only able to get such thoughts published by couching it in terms of frog-creatures.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c1683776624717299259 title="comment permalink">6/22/16, 6:50 PM</a><br><br>

I read "Call of Cthulhu" and "Shadow Over Innsmouth." I caught the whole senseless brown savage trope in "Call of Cthulhu," but kept reading anyway. My take away at the end of the story was that our white protestant hero (as a sort of stand in for respectable white protestant culture) just got shown that his whole way of thinking and mode of living was unadulterated bovine feces. His logical, scientific, and Christian worldview was entirely bunk. Instead, those senseless brown savages from the beginning of the story had a firmer grasp about truth of things than the fragile bubble of protestant white culture. I credit Lovecraft (ironically as it turns out) with allowing me to be open to critical theory. (I'm talking about Jurgen Habermas and Derrick Bell and critical legal and social theory, not Derrida and critical literary theory). "Shadow of Innsmouth" left me with the same impression.<br><br>Then I found out what a colossal racist Lovecraft was from some of his poems and letters. Whatever - still a great writer who got me thinking about things. It was also an object lesson not to turn your literary heroes into role models for your personal life.<br><br>I recently read "The Ballad of Black Tom" by Victor LaValle. The author was interviewed on "Fresh Air" and said that as a black author who loved HP Lovecraft's writing he'd reimagined "Horror at Redhook." I bought the book and it did not disapoint - either a straight weird fiction or a dialogue with Lovecraft. To me, that's how you deal with literature or (as in this case) authors you find disagreeable - you enter into a conversation with them. You don't Bowdlerize it.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c6601426828388344658 title="comment permalink">6/22/16, 7:05 PM</a><br><br>

Robert E Howard with the Conan tales was in that up to his eyeballs. The black characters in those stories fitted a lot of those particular stereotypes, and I just sort of read it, had a quiet chuckle to myself about it and then went on and did something else.

Yes, and one of the great lessons of the past is that constellations of prejudices and beliefs change over time. In Lovecraft's day, Christians were more likely to be liberal than not, and atheists were very often staunch conservative racists -- read H.L. Mencken for another classic example. A century from now, people will look back on our current belief systems and find them just as baffling. <br><br>Leo, political correctness is mostly influential in the academic industry these days; it also has a hold in some coastal states. Outside of those, not so much. <br><br>Breanna, how old are your children? If they're old enough to read complex narratives (say, <i>Tom Sawyer</i>) they're old enough to begin thinking about what they read, and you can begin introducing that sort of thinking in conversations with them -- the sooner you begin that, in fact, the better. <br><br>Ray, good. The sense of having the American Dream snatched away is very widespread in our collective life right now, and the range of scapegoats being blamed for it is truly impressive. <br><br>Repent, I'm forcibly reminded of one of the Beatles' lyrics: "I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together." Whether or not people believe that in a theological sense, it's certainly a psychological reality -- since each of us can only understand another person by modeling that person's thoughts and feelings on things we've experienced within ourselves, whatever we hate is always something we are. <br><br>Alex, I know! The only Lovecraft story I find actually scary is "The Color Out Of Space," and it's the one piece where he forgot about being prejudiced and focused on the experience of pure alienness. The others? As I noted a while back in <a href=http://galabes.blogspot.com/2015/01/a-seafood-dinner-in-lost-rlyeh.html rel=nofollow>the other blog</a>, I find them delightfully funny, with a kind of earnest absurdity that shines through his efforts at spookiness. But then I think octopi are cute, I kept lizards and snakes as pets in childhood, and if great Cthulhu rose from the sea I wouldn't expect him to destroy humanity -- why on earth should he care enough about humanity to bother destroying it? (It's like expecting Donald Trump to devote his presidency to destroying the world's population of chipmunks.)<br><br>Dylan, got your story -- if you'll put through a comment marked "not for posting" with your email address, you'll be in the contest. As for Heinlein, I grew up reading him, and still find some of his fiction entertaining -- but the political subtext is often pretty cloying. <br><br>Wizard, nah, being Irish is reserved for your next incarnation. ;-)<br><br>Chris, exactly! One of the unintentional lessons of Lovecraft is that white male Anglo-Saxon Protestants have no clue about what's actually going on in the world. I'm looking forward to reading LaValle, but I've made it a strict rule not to read any post-Weird Tales Cthulhu mythos fiction until I've finished writing <i>The Weird of Hali</i> series -- I want to contend with Lovecraft and his sources and peers straight up. <br><br>Cherokee, best wishes for snow! No question, Howard was a man of his time -- I'll be referencing him, over on the other blog, in the process of placing Julius Evola in his historical and cultural context. The two men had a remarkably large number of ideas in common, and not by accident.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c8502419438249634662 title="comment permalink">6/22/16, 7:58 PM</a><br><br>

When I studied literature at university, there was a strong emphasis on historicism - reading texts in the light of their historical context. So, for example, we read Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and understood the Doctor's "workshop of filthy creation" as a metaphor for the industrial revolution. We read The Tempest and tried to find in Prospero and Caliban a critique of early colonial encounters: “This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine.” <br><br>There is nothing wrong with historicism as a critical idea, but when it is taken too far, it can obscure the deeper imaginative meanings of a work of literature. This fact became apparent to me when we read Joseph Conrad's great tale of European imperialism, Heart of Darkness and my teacher emphasized the racist aspect of the text to such an extent that I felt he was questioning its place on the syllabus.<br><br>Now, don’t get me wrong. Heart of Darkness is racist. It uses the native people of the Congo as a metaphor for human savagery and fear, and describes them in an amorphous, almost mystical style. But if you get stuck on that point, you might easily miss the deeper meaning of the story – its critique of European colonialism in general and of that extraordinary character Mr. Kurtz, an ivory trader who is unable to resist the lure of “primitive savagery” because, in spite of his sophisticated European civilization, he is “hollow at the core.” The racism of the book is even undercut by its opening line of dialogue, in which Marlow describes London in the time of the Roman conquests: “This also has been one of the dark places of the world.” <br><br>Great artists tend to evade partisan political readings of their work because they seek the ambiguous depths in human experience. This fact alone ought to be enough to deter calls for censorship. But then, what is a great work?

It's a novel about Christian martyrdom in the days of Nero as a metaphor for the Polish experience with, well, everyone. Trying to understand the mindset in which a gruesome death for Christ could be something to welcome was an interesting experience. As a bonus, it includes a Roman character who is struggling to understand the appeal of Christianity from his own alien perspective.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c2222457791767371144 title="comment permalink">6/22/16, 9:00 PM</a><br><br>

The Democrats only have to wave the scary Republicans in front of affluent liberal/progressive voters and they perform dependably every time. Now the Republicans have the scariest possible candidate to wave. So many former Sanders sympathizers are lining up behind Hillary now because they are afraid of Trump. Victory for the Establishment is ensured (as if it was ever in doubt, with so much Wall St backing?). People are talking about how Trump will be unseated by sketchy means at the convention - but why, from the elites' perspective? He's the guarantor of Hillary's election.<br><br>Why doesn't Trump just ask Sanders to be his running mate? Wouldn't that spell certain (popular) victory over the widely-hated Hillary? Liberal/progressives would scream over the idea of Bernie joining forces with Trump, but wouldn't that be the only chance for their candidate to achieve a high office? What is the argument against it - that with a Trump-Sanders ticket then people in the gov't would argue all the time and not get anything done? How is that different from now? Yeah so why not? <br><br>We thought it was impossible but this is going to be a kick-the-can-down-the-road election and Hillary is going to take the next 4 or 8 years. What do you think?<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c6660647361940198010 title="comment permalink">6/22/16, 9:01 PM</a><br><br>

Everything I've read about the author to date kind disgusts me, I loathe the political movement that the author is connected to, and I <i>do not</i> want to read the book. I guess that's the one I ought to go with, then. <br><br>You mentioned the way that political groupings reverse themselves over time. This election is showing the way that happens, and it's doing it in a way that makes me feel like I've been sucked into a bizarro funhouse world. Did you happen to read Donald Trump's Big Speech about Hillary Clinton? There is so much that is loathsome about the man. But then he openly attacks the Iraq War, criticizes the decision to intervene in Libya as more of the same, and talks about the disastrous effects of NAFTA and other free trade agreements. It's hard for me to see how anyone who was involved in the anti-war or anti-globalization movements of 15 years ago-- you know, the ones that disappeared without a trace once the Democrats started managing the foreign wars and neoliberal trade agreements-- can vote for anyone but Trump. I made the mistake of saying this in a public forum and was attacked because "Trump could literally be the next Hitler."<br><br>The drying up of protest movements once the protesters' preferred political party takes power isn't new. But I wonder if the change will become more permanent this time, and the Democrats will just openly be the Imperial Party from here on out. <br><br>On last month's assignment-- I mentioned a couple of weeks ago that I tandem-read Little Women and the Mayan Popul Vuh. I was surprised by just how disturbing I found the second of those. Some of its images and moments are powerful, moving... And then there's the part where the followers of a trio of stone gods start secretly kidnapping people for use in human sacrifice. Eventually they become powerful enough that they can step out of the shadows and openly conquer cities and found dynasties. These are the heroes of the story, fulfilling the role of a Moses or an Aeneas. And they would work perfectly as villains in a Lovecraft story! <br><br>Speaking of Lovecraft... I also don't find his stories scary, for the most part. I find them strangely comforting. I often turn to Cthulhu when I'm feeling down. As for his racism... It does make some stories unreadable, but it doesn't bother me as much as it might because I just don't buy it. At various times in his stories and his private letters he attacks blacks, Jews, Italians, Spaniards, Asians, "poor white trash," the Irish, the Scandinavians, the Eskimo-- I once described him to a friend by saying "He's great once you get past the fact that he was prejudiced against you, all your friends, and everyone you've met." And once you realize that he was sort of raised as an overprotected shut in, you realize that his "politics" are really just his own terror of the outside world. I guess that's part of the lesson here though, isn't it?<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c3343155612828006943 title="comment permalink">6/22/16, 9:47 PM</a><br><br>

I have fond memories of exploring rare, old books I never saw elsewhere, and I was allowed to buy a few of my choice (your Homework assignment #1 brought back good memories of being introduced there to books published before 1900). Once I purchased some of the Bobbsey Twins books -- some of the first ones written in the early 1900s. I then remember my mom reading them to me at bedtime, and later on she reminisced on how it had made her uncomfortable. There were a lot of overt racist sentiments and remarks in the stories toward people of color, and prejudice against Gypsies. But I'm glad that despite her discomfort, she didn't stop reading them to me. It was educational to listen to a story from that time, reflect on it, and use it as a springboard for discussion. Later last century, a lot of the Bobbsey Twin books were rewritten and sanitized.<br><br>http://www.vintagebooklife.com/2014/12/top-ten-racist-moments-in-bobbsey-twins.html<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c8393296476315503413 title="comment permalink">6/22/16, 9:50 PM</a><br><br>

I am about halfway through and I was ready to give up a couple of times but still going. I cannot say that what he says offends me but it definitely annoys me to no end. I realized how well written some parts of the Bible are - direct and very human as opposed to pompous and moralizing like Paul Bunyan. So I guess it pays off already to stick with reading a book that I disagree with... To be clear, I am not a believer. I read the Bible out of curiosity and in turns amazed me, horrified me and opened my eyes to actual human nature.<br>As for the current assignment, I am tempted to actually try to read news in mass media. I haven't in a long time and I realized I cannot explain my position in conversation with friends. They refer to BBC or other liberal media, I refer to blogs like this and we cannot find any common facts. Yes, I mean actual facts not ideas. How can I provide concrete facts to support my assertions when I don't have any of their context from what they read or listen to.

He was cutting out all the parts that had to do with miracles, magic and the supernatural. Age of Reason, critical thinking, or, bowdlerization? <br><br>I belong to a 12 Step Program, that was started by a bunch of white, anglo-saxon, well educated guys, who had, clearly, read a lot of Jung. It is "suggested" (everything's a darned suggestion) that if we resent or dislike someone, perhaps it's because we don't like something about them, that we do not like in ourselves. That maybe, we might want to "take a look" at that. <br><br>I'd use that holding a mirror up to someone, so they can find the intolerance in themselves, with great caution. It can set off a violent ... even murderous reaction. <br><br>I often urge people I know to read widely ... outside their political comfort zone. Not that anyone pays attention to me :-). I read left, right and center. Part of it is, I just am very curious about what makes people tick. Part of it is "know the enemy, and what they're up to." Enemy from my point of view, which I know is very binary. <br><br>After the Oklahoma City Bombing, I read "The Turner Diaries", which were very much in the news, at the time, as a blueprint for what happened.

Is there racism? Yes - though the level of racism varies a lot from writer to writer (and interestingly, older Western fiction is not necessarily more racist than more recent Western fiction). However, white Western writers at least have non-white characters and think about race, and the writers which I bother to read try to think about it from the non-white people's perspectives (even though their prejudices may make these attempts seriously flawed). That is more than I can say for a lot of sci-fi / fantasy by white Americans, which often have no non-white characters at all, and even when they do, they often aren't as well written as the non-white characters by white Western writers.<br><br>I've also noticed an impulse that, when I criticise a work of fiction for displaying a certain prejudice, people assume that I want to censor that work (for example, if I am critiquing a play, people assume that I mean that the play should never be performed). That's not necessarily true. After all, if a work is censored, then people won't know what I'm talking about when I'm critiquing it!<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c5512453095168112508 title="comment permalink">6/22/16, 10:20 PM</a><br><br>

Know thyself goes the old saw and 'walk for a mile in a man's mocassins befoore criticizing."<br><br>PC thought is deeply ingrained in the West in a particular way. In Eastern Europe and monoethnic countries like Japan or China with independent cultures racism is much more readily acceptable. Americanization means acceptance of US films, music, TV series and ideology which have since hitler and 60s race riots become a pamphlet for racial toleration and integration of women into workforce. Latter is universally accepted and pop music based on jazz, rock coming out of US black music streams. People from the East however are more direct and often racist in their attitudes. Contact with minorities was negligible. Two germanies still exist side by side in point of fact in this regard. OTOH in the west PC does not mean tolerance but ignore till it is too late and white flight, similar to USA liberal white thought. Impoverished ghettoes are not romantic and the limits of ethnic contact is eating at a take out or using public transit. My Russian wife came from a Russia where, similar to USA, all 'whites' were really mongrels from various ethnic groups and one never noticed it until after end of soviet union. Now though racism, combined with identity search in newfound nationalism out of chaos of collapse creates stereotype thinking of every group. Jugoslavian war had similar trajectory. Decades of 'imagine' from john lennon mindset reverts to severe primitivism. The same is happening now to EU. It collapses soon likely as not and then it's 'every man for himself'. Millions of noneuropean whites here will then be all the more suspect if the french and german and brits begin to despise one another. Racism would appear to be their only commonality in 10-15 years. Collapse will lead to deportations of long tolerated minorities without national passports or local religion or local ethnic marriage partner and children. Integration will likely come to mean assimilation.<br><br>Everyone has character faults and external group 'x' is always a good foil. In USA Africans have served whites as scapegoats.

Clinton is running a campaign that appeals powerfully to the wealthiest 15% or 20% of Americans, and to certain pressure groups outside that class, and pretty much nobody else. I've heard from a lot of people who voted for Sanders, and the vast majority of them say they wouldn't vote for Clinton if she was running unopposed. She's defining herself as the candidate of business as usual at a time when business as usual has most Americans up against the wall. Could she still win? Of course -- it's not over 'til it's over, as Yogi Berra liked to say -- but the tactics she's trying to use are the same ones that got all those other GOP candidates steamrollered by the Trump phenomenon, and my guess is he's still more likely to be sworn in next January than she is, by a significant margin. <br><br>Jo, glad to hear it. That's exactly the sort of insight, and change of direction, that helps teach children to think for themselves about hot button issues. <br><br>Jim, Twain was definitely a giant, and America has had few authors who could stand beside him -- though there have been some. Paine and Conrad, well, not my favorites either...<br><br>Zach, I haven't the least idea, and I didn't claim that this has happened, either. I simply said that this has been advocated.

Yes, I did read Trump's speech, and in an upcoming post will talk about what it means that the Republican candidate is considerably to the left of the Democratic candidate on the whole range of economic, political, and military issues. If the mainstream pundits keep yelling "Hitler! Hitler!" while Trump keeps hammering on Clinton's neoconservative warmongering, this may turn into one of those elections in which the media loses control of the dialogue and things go spinning off in strange directions!<br><br>Beneath, that sounds like my favorite kind of bookstore!

I recommend that each of us make the choice to get to know our own. Trying to force knowledge on another person never ends well. <br><br>Notes, fascinating! I've read next to no Westerns. Can you recommend a good author or two? <br><br>Lewis, I don't remember that one at all. By the way, congratulations for using the word "fantods" -- a fine bit of ornate vocabulary!<br><br>Yucca, me too -- I'd hope to have the chance to watch the whole ceremony. <br><br>Bekah, if mild dislike is the best you can do, you may have to settle for that. Still, it might be worth looking for stuff out on the fringes, as far as possible from your own viewpoint; you may be able to find something that will set off a stronger reaction. <br><br>Steve, I'd be willing to take that as a working hypothesis!<br><br>Yucca, no argument there.

Now people no longer have to even see that they're being accused of political correctness… The term's never been non-controversial, and a large part of the problem is that it conflates two sets of ideas: the set of beliefs espoused by the left, and the imposition of orthodoxy relating to those beliefs such that all other discussion is shut down or, as we see now, treated as if it simply doesn't exist. The beliefs themselves may be reasonable enough (the only major quarrel I personally have with what we might call the "social left", or the feminist/LGBT/minority rights constellation, is its unshakeable conviction in its own righteousness) but that's going to quickly get lost in the backlash against being told what to think by a cultural mainstream that doesn't necessarily reflect the ideas of the majority of the population. (The loss of critical faculties in the process, as you've highlighted, certainly doesn't help.)<br><br>Your use of the word "justify" ("… containing language or ideas that justify the oppression they've experienced…") raises an interesting point, though I don't know if it was intentional on your part: a thing can only be justified if it is justifiable. That is, if the ideologies of these banned works are as flawed as people nowadays believe, then the works cannot justify the ideology - they can only excuse it. And this does seem to be the case, as seen in the ways Lovecraft unwittingly deconstructs his own racism and provides insights into the psychological causes of it, rather than providing any compelling reason to adopt the racism itself. So why erase it? Do the censors simply believe we're all too stupid for a critical reading, and will become racist by merely being exposed to racist works? Or do the zealots of anti-racism struggle with that critical reading themselves? (After all: we attack our mirrors.)<br><br>Anyway, I'm another one struggling to think of any work of literature that will actually offend me.

I've taken quite a meandering road in my (admittedly relatively short) years of considering politics, moving from right-wing based on ignorance and upbringing, through a few years of gradually moving left in an uncritical manner as I discovered that section of the internet and made left wing friends at uni, through discovering this blog, and then briefly considering myself anarchist, before ending up in my current opinion of vaguely left libertarian with strong belief in limits of growth. There are definitely multiple issues on which I no longer agree with my left wing friends.<br>I actually read a reasonable amount of things written by more right wing libertarians these days. After the Orlando shooting, my entire social media feed (yes, I know, it's a timewaster...) was filled with people expressing how tragic it was and calling for America to increase its gun control (gun control in the UK is pretty much taken as a given, being as we are at the moment where carrying anything bigger than a 3 inch folding knife without good reason is illegal, and self defense isn't counted as good reason, and if you carry something else with intention to use as an offensive weapon, that's also illegal) but I felt this really wasn't the whole story so I went looking for pro-gun accounts of the event and actually ended up on the Donald Trump reddit, which I discovered was surprisingly not homophobic.<br>On the topic of the homework, I will have to think what will cause me offense. I think it would probably be something that was overtly and unapologetically homophobic, seeing as I am a lesbian. Not in a just pretending gay people don't exist at all way, but in a "we included gay characters and portrayed them as sinful/mentally ill/depraved/evil and this didn't change by the end of the book" sort of way. But I don't know what books would be like that, so I could probably do with some recommendations...<br>The Brexit vote is today (actually, I will probably have voted by the time this comment goes through) and I'd like to thank JMG and the other commenters who commented on it. I've pretty much decided to vote leave because I want sovereignity, not to be dragged into ridiculous trade deals like TTIP, better control over borders in the face of the fact that the UK is the 3rd most populated country in Europe that isn't one of those super tiny countries that's basically a city-state, and I think that despite likely short term pain, it'll enable us a better chance to survive the escape from the status quo in the future.<br>Thanks for another excellent post,<br>L.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c7413847535866223922 title="comment permalink">6/23/16, 2:40 AM</a><br><br>

Your comments about expurgating the teaching of literature that contains racist notions might have been current twenty years ago during the height of the campus speech code movement, but I'm not so sure they're current anymore. <br><br>In fact, the reading anthology we use in our composition classes contains an essay that was written during the height of the speech-code period--that would be the mid-1990s--written by Johnathan Rauch and called "In Defense of Prejudice." In this essay, Rauch makes essentially the same points you make here. I assign Rauch's essay to my first-year composition students and usually find it's one of their favorite readings.<br><br>I am honestly far more concerned with the historical revisionism going on in the Right, in particular their rewriting of American history to support the notion of America's founding as a "Christian nation" and supporting the nationalist and militarist notion that all our actions have been just and right. I think the Right's revisionism has far more chance of causing negative consequences down the road than anything happening the left is offering these days; the Right, in truth, is far better organized, far better funded, and far more conscious of their goals and objectives than the scattered and tattered remnants of the Left are.<br><br>An aside: since the term "political correctness" has become such a common term with such a vague meaning (including it's frequent use as a snarl term), it would be very helpful for one to offer a working definition before using it, if one decides to use it at all.

First, I have been a long-time fan of HP Lovecraft, from the time I first discovered his stories back in middle school and the RPG associated therewith (being an old-time D&amp;D gamer, it was a natural fit). At the Mountains of Madness and Shadow Over Innsmouth were my two favorites. My copy of your first installment in en route.<br><br>Second, a quick report of last month's homework. I read The Moonstone, which turned out to be rather fascinating adventure/mystery written told with multiple narrators (similar to Dracula).

Some of your thoughts about Lovecraft remind me of Michel Houellebecq's "HP Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life" - he also thinks that the source of Lovecraft's horror was his racism. I got the impression that at the time he wrote it (around 1990) this was quite against the grain. He thought it was just foolish to deny this and seemed interested in the way Lovecraft had really dug into these feelings and amplified them.<br><br>Houellebecq's fiction might interest you, I think he has <i>some</i> similar questions about the validity of progress (I thought his novel "The Possibility Of An Island" was quite good for this), questioning what "our project" in the western world really is all about and ridiculing it's values. I am not always completely sure if he agrees with everything he discusses or is just entertaining the ideas and exploring them - his process I think is the opposite of yours, you have said that you are deliberately working through a single idea where I think he is just feeling his way through things, trying to expose some truths society seems desperate to hide, also I believe you are genuinely hoping to help people where I don't think that is true in his case, but still I find I get things from him. He's also quite a bit more vulgar than you, I should warn.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c1675353000015166942 title="comment permalink">6/23/16, 7:02 AM</a><br><br>

Now all forgotten, so racism is only by color now. –As shown by our own and far better, far more read, far more insightful commenters repeatedly talking about "white" (hetero, saxon, evil, etc) men...as if their targets like Lovecraft would not have blown a fuse if their daughters brought home a Slav, a Celt, an Italian, or even a Catholic.

I love old literature and read a lot of it so I figured I'd inevitably accomplish the task. Procrastination, in other words.<br><br>But thinking about this month's homework assignment, at first I was stumped: If I haven't already read a book, how do I know if it's offensive? Of course I could just surf Facebook for a while...but while it's almost guaranteed to offend my sensibilities it's also guaranteed to contain nothing potentially edifying whatsoever. No, the best bet, I thought, would be to find an author who could reliably be counted upon to offend. <br><br>And then I hit on the perfect one: H. Rider Haggard. I don't know what is more offensive in his works, the racism, the misogyny, or the reveling in the wanton slaughter of animals (most of them now endangered). I encourage those of your readers who are having trouble coming up with a suitable book to give HRH a try.

First, a lot of times I see people (in my opinion) slightly misunderstanding nonduality. That is, they get the concept but somehow come to the conclusion that because unity is the ultimate truth that duality is somehow not (also) true. Duality is the juice that gives rise to the manifestation of the universe. One does not overcome evil by proclaiming it a delusion. So duality is a subsidiary of unity, it is indeed LESS real, but it operates within its sphere. Brick walls and all that.<br><br>The other point somewhat follows from the first, and it is the idea of "not either or, but both-and". We don't have to fully understand it but we are all one and we are all individuals, it is a simultaneous truth. <br><br>In support of my argument I offer the Tao Te Ching verse 42: The Tao gives birth to One, the One gives birth to two, the two gives birth to three, and the three gives birth to the 10,000 things.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c226446985038938160 title="comment permalink">6/23/16, 9:49 AM</a><br><br>

It strongly and eloquently suggests that one can oppose monumental injustice on the basis of shared universal humanity, without loudly asserting universal equality. It could certainly complicate things, if that idea (which I suspect remains privately widespread) were admitted into present-day public discourse. (For instance, it might undermine the polarity of present positions on illegal immigrants and Muslim refugees, threatening the necessary deadlock of the status quo. Worse, it might lead to comprehension of the actual moral basis of present class dynamics in the U.S.)<br><br>For the new assignment, well… I've been meaning to read the Quran, but I don't expect to be greatly offended by it. Just a bit more of the same kinds of unease and disagreement I have with portions of my own preferred scriptures.<br><br>That means, instead, I'm going to have to read another Sherri Tepper novel. Yes, that's what came to mind the moment I read the assignment, as something that offends me, all the more so because the prose is good and the plots quite enjoyable. It's the combination of Tepper's adulation of nature with her evident, unbounded, and exquisitely expressed loathing of human nature that puts me off.<br><br>And is that because it reflects something in myself? Oh, no doubt.<br><br>Still, the assignment could have been harder. You might have asked us each to <i>write</i> the novel that would most offend us.

We were tracing the history of the European Union, trying to determine the point at which it stopped being a series of perfectly sensible trade agreements and open borders between a relatively small region, and started acting like a federal government, which erased the sovereignty of a host of nations with long and storied cultural histories reaching back for centuries if not millennia.

We may continue to respect them in the abstract, but what are we to do when they continue to fail to fulfil our natural conception of personality, meanwhile placing all their own preferential stresses on matters and ideals largely irrelevant and sometimes even repugnant to us?

The obvious response from the modern left is that sexuality is inextricable from what it means to be human while racism can be overcome. But in the end, I think you are right that modern abhorrence of racism will be replaced by avant guard embrace of racism. The root reason is rather unpleasant, but one great thing about the Archdruid report is that truth isn't avoided just because it happens to be unpleasant. At its roots, racism is also inextricable from what it means to be human. We are the result of evolution. And evolution will continue. No question that eugenic racism has created terrible suffering. But we continue to evolve and humans are going to take an active role in the evolution of our species and that will likely continue with species that descend from us....maybe more than one species at once. It is hard to see a far future that doesn't have multiple 'human' races or species that compete with each other. Even utopian visions like Star Trek regularly come back to the problem of genetic enhanced augments and the intractable conflicts that ensue. It might be simple selective breeding or it might be high tech genetic engineering, but it is hard to see a future more than 100 years after Adolf Hitler that continues to suppress what we know about how humans came to be. To be clear, I don't like it one bit. But if we take our history seriously, we may need to conclude that evolution includes genetic competition (which is a kind of racism) which is inextricably linked with what it means to be human (or any other biological creature). Of course people claim that we should rise above our history...and we 'should'. But that is exactly what the Victorians claimed about sex. If the analogy holds, the conclusion is that we probably won't rise above our history.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c3914056641485335741 title="comment permalink">6/23/16, 1:41 PM</a><br><br>

The perspective was that of a wealthy white Anglo Saxon protestant male who was educated and from a family of relatively high social class living off investment income along with some earned wages. In other words, the author's wealth and privilege made it seem like simply deciding to go on safari or take an extended vacation or tour were ordinary things that everybody does and nobody is surprised about. <br><br>It is also clear that in his era, men and women had completely different and often separate lives, which is very odd to modern Americans (but not so much to me, being familiar with ultra Orthodox Judaism...). <br><br>His biases were, frankly, white male supremacism. His views of the so called primitive Black Africans was patronizing at best, but he held several of these characters in high regard for their bravery and faithfulness. Female characters? Hardly.

Victorian London was rife with prostitution. At one point the age of consent was 12. An anti-trafficking crusader named Stead, purchased a virgin girl from her mother and wrote about the ease of so doing. He and his fellow crusaders were tried for abduction, partially on the grounds that they had not procured the father's consent, only the mother's. He served three months in prison. And while Victoria herself may have been "Victorian" her son Prince Edward was notorious for his affairs. Being royal, he had to confine his affairs to married women, so as not to clutter the field with possible claimants to the throne. <br><br>The Tarzan series is another wonderful (in the sense of causing wonder) display of Anglo Saxon racism. The African tribes are portrayed as savage cannibals, morally inferior to the great grey apes (not gorillas) who raise the infant Tarzan. As one might expect from a fantasy version of an English lord, Tarzan is a superb physical specimen and also excels intellectually. He is able to teach himself to read English with the books left behind in his parent's tree house. He teaches himself French by eavesdropping on the Belgian officer in the European expedition that penetrates the jungle in which he has grown up. He quickly adapts to civilized ways, but prefers the pure company of animals to the corruption of modern society.

I've been considering a post comparing Trump to FDR for a while now -- or, to cite an even more explosive parallel, Trump and Lincoln. Have you read the vilification the East Coast establishment heaped on Lincoln all through his presidency, until his assassination turned him into a plaster saint? Let's just say there are remarkable similarities. <br><br>Jason, over here, if you mention that you don't support Hillary Clinton, you can expect the same treatment. I had an old friend hang up on me in midsentence because I expressed a lack of enthusiasm for her -- and he hasn't called back. Fascinating, that the privileged have become so fundamentalist about their causes!<br><br>Rebecca, used book stores are your friend; the older the edition, the better.

Xenophobia is hardwired into the human nervous system, and so is xenophilia; we want to attack and drive off what's strange to us...and we also want to mate with it. Those two instinctual drives flow together into some remarkably strange behavior patterns. <br><br>Twilight, good -- and of course in our society, the dominant elite stopped thinking about the long term a long, long time ago. <br><br>Zach, I remember <i>The Pooh Perplex</i> well -- in fact, I own a copy. Great fun, and yes, a good reminder that any one critical stance will give you certain truths and a great many more absurdities if practiced exclusively. <br><br>Ray, by all means. I once considered writing a parody titled "The Cellophane Prophecy."<br><br>Clay, good! Yes, and that's one of the other benefits of reading offensive literature from the past. <br><br>Hiero, and that's why I'm trying to drag that kind of approach to literature out of the silo and hand it out freely to my readers. It deserves more attention than it gets. <br><br>Alexandra, by Frith, that'll do!<br><br>Myriad, I haven't read any of Tepper's later works, but <i>The Awakeners</i>, <i>A Plague of Angels</i>, others of that period? That's another matter. A very capable writer, and I'm used to the kind of SF that treats testosterone as the Original Sin, so had no trouble with them. Has she gotten into a more general misanthropy (as distinct from misandry) at this point? That could be entertaining. <br><br>WW, I somehow managed to miss Bomba the Jungle Boy. Thanks for the recollections!<br><br>Clark, good. Still good advice...<br><br>Notes, many thanks!<br><br>S. Treimel, didn't Hillary Clinton have one of those ghastly ghostwritten politician's books published under her name? That might be a fine choice. <br><br>Scotlyn, here in the US the mixing is well under way. I live just south of the Mason-Dixon line, in a poor neighborhood dotted with small churches, and I see mixed-race couples and multiracial kids every single day. <br><br>Thomas, it's a favorite of mine, too -- but you need to keep in mind that to Lovecraft, the ending wasn't upbeat at all. To him, the ending was a plunge into the shrieking heart of terror, because the protagonist got sucked down body and soul into the abyss, and ended up wanting that. Ambiguous? Of course. Revealing? You bet. But it's precisely the gap between Lovecraft's interpretation of those final scenes, and yours (and mine), that I find most interesting. <br><br>Nrgmiserncaz, I read mostly nonfiction, for a variety of reasons, but no argument -- fiction works a broader range of mental muscles. <br><br>Donald, the sanctimoniousness is a fascinating thing, when you remember that Hillary Clinton supports all the policies that Democrats insisted they'd never forgive George W. Bush for supporting. <br><br>Twinruler, well, we'll see.

It was very well written and entertaining adventure story, a very enjoyable read. What I objected to was the revealed back-story. The "angels" who were responsible for diverse acts of genocide, including introducing irresistibly addictive lethal drugs and AIDS-like diseases into the inner cities and releasing mythical monsters to ravage rural areas, were cast as the good guys on the side of God (literally) and history. Of course, the only characters opposing the "angels" were the most loathsome of villains, even stooping so low as to try to use (shudder!) <i>technology</i> to try to survive. I also found it it a bit questionable that the suburbs were spared the devastation (by having been literally elevated—they merit this why?), and the last straw was the dialogs near the end, stating outright (or at least strongly implying; I don't recall the exact wording) that real-world AIDS itself is a warning from God that we're foolishly failing to heed by seeking cures and treatments via medical science (rather than, I suppose, some sort of "just shut up and die" campaign). <i>The Family Tree</i> had charming qualities of its own, but no need to get into that one.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c6600509093359020666 title="comment permalink">6/23/16, 8:52 PM</a><br><br>

As a kid nicknamed "Duracell", I quickly learned that people in general, and children in particular, place a high premium on conformity. Any deviation from a putative norm is subject to social ostracism partly as a means of re-enforcing normative forms amongst the in-group. (This is why sub-groups like goths or mods or technos or biker gangs adopt very stringent yet unwritten rules about acceptable clothing and hairstyles.) thus, in all-white schools, absent anyone more obviously different, I got picked on for red hair and buck teeth and glasses. Wasn't any good at team sports, either. <br>I am in no way claiming discrimination typical of racism in my life, but I was picked on for being different.<br>I found out recently that, apparently, "Ginger" is considered a term of disrespect, akin to "nigger" according to some, both those who use it and those who are called it. All that I have left is a vestige of russet hair growing on the lower part of my face (the rest having long since turned dark, then mostly departed, leaving behind but a rime of frost around the back and sides). Still, it is curious to become aware that there are people who think of me that way. <br>It is equally curious to pull apart the thought processes that demand people stop reading literature from previous times because it contains thought patterns deemed unacceptable to our current sensibilities, when George Orwell explored what happens when officialdom tries to erase or re-write the past in "1984".<br>Personally, I'd rather know about it, explore it, and understand why this is wrong and thereby inoculated against adopting such ideas, gain the ability to see racism for what it is, especially when it comes wearing a different guise, than to be ignorantly susceptible to the lies about the past and about other people that is required by racists in order to perpetuate their hatred.<br>Apropos of this current assignment:<br>1) do political speeches of current candidates for the Presidency of the United States count as fiction? I'd argue that they do, because they are pretty much full of it and are very offensive to my sense of rationality, but I'd like your call on it, please.<br>2) How would I know if I'll find some piece of writing to be offensive until I've read it, especially since I find myself offended mostly by the absence of any valid logic or objectively provable reality on which the writers base their arguments? My sensibilities are otherwise pretty robust. Any advice?<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c2739518679154797674 title="comment permalink">6/23/16, 9:39 PM</a><br><br>

I do hope you have a chance to critique the campaign to stay at some point in the future? Did you know that articles in the newspapers here this morning, were still confidently proclaiming that the vote would be in favour of staying within the EU? The articles I did read on the subject over the past few weeks spoke endlessly about the risk to the banking sector and not much else, but that may have something to do with the source of the articles. It was weirdly one sided though and objectivity appears to be a far distant memory.<br><br>Oh, Mr Evola is a fascinating character, and wow, did he have his prejudices or what? Of course, he had the confidence of birthright and he allowed his opponents to believe that they were using him. A clever strategy! Also, he was quoted as saying something about the fascist party, which I once wrote here on your blog about the anarchists! It still amuses me to this day, how quickly I was shouted down. (This next bit is not to you, but to those cheeky so called anarchists) Honestly, people get a grip! :-)! Sorry, I couldn’t help myself from poking them!<br><br>Back to this weeks topic at hand. The English weren't the only ones in that game of censorship. The German's had a deft hand for censorship too and I only discovered today that the original story of Rapunzel told a delightful tale of a rather appealing and accommodating young lady who engaged in a bit of erotic play with her Prince and only had to spill the beans when she became knocked up. The Grimm brothers re-write was a fascinating case study in censorship where they took out all of the naughty bits whilst changing the underlying morality and also feeding the prevailing attitudes of male / female roles into that story! They had sharp minds those brothers. Incidentally the Grimm brothers notated the original story, but their motivation for censoring and shaping all of the rest of the tales too was for the pragmatic reasons of having to make some money. Their tale was one of a couple of hard working intelligentsia fallen on hard times, through circumstance and outspoken anti-establishment views.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c2523672602422120679 title="comment permalink">6/23/16, 9:51 PM</a><br><br>

Check it out yourselves. Now to this week's essay.<br> In reading about your thoughts on H.P. Lovecraft and how some of the horror in his stories were centered around the fact that there could be another race of intelligent beings with their own souls I thought - that is something that has changed. What to H.P. Lovecraft was ultimate horror can now be regarded as a potential away-mission for first contact in today's fiction. That is an certainly an improvement. The horror of the unknown now seems to have been replaced with horror of ourselves leading to a raft of rules and laws to outlaw human nature and feelings i.e. if you outlaw it, it will all go away - just like sexuality in Victorian society. Now how did that work out?<br> It seems that the obsession over the correct terminology is no longer content to be limited to questions of race but is now seeking new horizons as it moves into the area of gender as can be seen by such new acronyms such as LGBTQIA+ Saywhat? This is starting to verge on the insane rather than the obtuse. Recently in the Parliament of Brandenburg, Germany, a motion was lodged to extend hate speech laws to matters of gender which caused one politician to make the following response at http://russia-insider.com/en/politics/brilliant-german-politician-mocks-pc-addresses-parliament-60-different-genders-video<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c7480959016827811964 title="comment permalink">6/23/16, 10:10 PM</a><br><br>

He's even more, shall we say, colorful in Latin than in English, but there are some tolerably good English translations. <br><br>Pygmycory, that'll certainly fulfill the requirement!<br><br>Mayhawk, I'll have to check with the publisher. I know a trade paperback edition is in the works, but I don't know the timeline. <br><br>Cú Meala, either synchronicity or the simple fact that it's a good description of many aspects of the universe, take your pick. <br><br>Avalterra, oh, I know; that's why I call it a Lovecraftian epic fantasy. It's not horror -- how could it be, when it's from the perspective of the other side? To the worshippers of Cthulhu, Cthulhu isn't horrible and the thought of his reappearance isn't a subject of dread; it's the fulfillment of their wildest hope. I wrote it, if you will, from the perspective of the people who had the other reaction to the post you cited -- the people for whom the claim that "Man is the measure of all things" is as arrogant as it is absurd. (Owen's comment is mine: "Here's a child's six inch ruler; go measure a galaxy with it.") <br><br>Gabriela, I haven't read Onfray, and that's a mistake I'll have to rectify. Lynn White Jr., in a famous essay from almost fifty years ago, made some of the same points, and to my mind they're entirely valid. <br><br>Spanish Fly, de Sade will certainly do! As for prejudices, everyone has them, and the only significant difference -- and it is significant, though not as universally so as sometimes alleged -- is that some people, and some categories of people, have more power to act according to their prejudices than others. <br><br>Ganv, exactly. As I noted in a comment above, xenophobia is hardwired into our nervous systems for valid evolutionary reasons -- primates are generally wary about admitting outsiders into their troops, though they'll do it under the right conditions -- and so is sexual xenophilia; the combination of the two makes for explosive emotional reactions in response to anyone perceived as the Other, who becomes at one and the same time an overt target of hatred and a covert target of desire and jealousy. Try to suppress that bubbling cauldron of passionate reactions and the result is going to be a mess. <br><br>Submarine, by all means -- but hey, at least it's more readable than Ayn Rand. <br><br>Amy, you are indeed. The drink of your choice can be a necessary tool for getting through assignments like this one. <br><br>Dammerung, 4chan is well outside my reading list, so thanks for the heads up. <br><br>Brian, it's quite possible that Canadian universities have stayed outside the sort of thing I'm discussing. Canada is a different country -- yes, unlike most people in the US, I know this! -- with its own distinctly different intellectual culture. <br><br>Tomuru, and totally plausible, given the behavior of the Brussels bureaucracy. <br><br>Tim, many thanks for the examples. <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> -- gah. I had to put on hip boots to get through <i>Anthem</i> ; that was bad enough. <br><br>LatheChuck, yeah, that's one of the reasons I decided not to bother with McCarthy. Another was that gratuitous wallowing in shock value just isn't my cup of tea. Your example of modern absurdity, by the way, is very good. <br><br>Varun, sure, but only if you can read it without feeling a sense of superiority.

I don’t know what the end result of it will be, but the jigsaw has certainly been thrown onto he floor. It should make interesting viewing. Mind you, even though I expected it, I still have a sense of shock that its actually happened. You usually expect people to prefer the status quo on the basis that its better the devil you know than the devil you don’t. The establishment, big business, the world of finance, academia, the IMF, the EU and even the President of the USA have tried to put the fear of god into us to stop us voting out. All the experts including the Bank of England, hundreds of economists tried to convince us that voting out would be a disaster to our economy. Hundreds of A List luvvies from the world of film and theatre have pleaded with us not to vote leave. The fact the the people have been prepared to vote out in the face of this shows just how disconnected the elite has become from ordinary people.<br><br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c7977013696309520446 title="comment permalink">6/24/16, 12:25 AM</a><br><br>

I’ve had the same experience as you from most of the middle class liberals I know. They seem to think that if we vote to leave the EU, then we will lose all our human rights and descend into some kind of racist, bigoted hell. You wouldn’t think that they lived in a country that had a tradition of human rights and rule of law that dates back to the Magna, a country that chopped its Kings head off a 140 years before the French got round to doing the same to their King, a country with and a democracy that survived two wold wars and a great depression. Don't get me wrong, there is a hell of a lot wrong with our system of government and democracy; but at least we still have a democracy which enables us to kick a government out. And yet these middle class liberals prefer to be ruled by an unelected bureaucracy in Brussels. They always talk about reforming the EU, but it is difficult to do this if you can’t kick your rulers out at an election.<br><br>The one thing that has really shocked me is how dismissive many middle class liberals are about democracy. I have had some pretty arrogant responses to my arguments that we need to leave the EU to get our democracy back. But maybe I shouldn’t be surprised about this, as democracy threatens the class interests of the middle classes and it gives the working class a vote. They don’t appreciate that democracy that might prevent them from hanging from a lamp post.<br><br>The one thing that really annoys me is the way middle class liberals claim to have a monopoly if virtue and portray the brexit side said as being racists and bigots. I suspect that there is a real class snobbery behind this as much of the impetus for brexit comes from the working class. There is that tweet from Will Self that goes<br><br>“Not all brexiters are racists, but most racists will vote Brexit tomorrow”<br><br>You could respond<br><br>“Not all Remainers are rich sociopathic neoliberals who invade other countries and cause hundreds and thousands of deaths, but most rich sociopathic neoliberals will vote Remain tomorrow”<br><br>Thankfully democracy has triumphed and the next thing is to heel the wounds this vote might cause and start making cups of tea. So that will be the end of my rant<br><br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c9128387617037687660 title="comment permalink">6/24/16, 12:35 AM</a><br><br>

But as the result came in, it left a bitter sweet taste. Because as I recall you writing before, that the result does not necessarily guarantee the outcome I desire! As an example, one of the biggest failings of the EU, and there are many, is that about 40% of the EU budget is spent on agricultural subsidies, which have no cap. The largest beneficiaries of this in the UK are the uber wealthy land and gentry who largely own most of the land. And they have many representatives in this current government. You can rest assured that as part of the exit plans they will do their level best to preserve the flow of subsidies to their own pockets. Other benefits that goes to the masses, will be chopped, as will environmental protections that hinder corporate business. However, it improves democratic accountability, and I felt that was worth the risk. As a Scot, I also support Scottish independence for the same reason. Hopefully that is one step closer. The evidence is that the smaller the country the more democracy works, and the poster child for that is Iceland, with a population of a few hundred thousand.

SNP has tried and will probably try to preserve the previous British post-war social settlement in the form of re-distributive public goods, mostly health, pensions and welfare and educational services, which serve a good political as well as sensible economic purpose.

Other people whose analysis like yours I very much generally respect, including economist Steve Keen, took / take a dim and terminal view of EU, so this is nothing personal.

We await outcomes but our PM David Cameron will certainly go down in history. Arguably, bad economics leads to bad politics.

Sorry to hear about the humid night. I reckon our planet is getting hotter and wetter, but what do I know...<br><br>I thought you may enjoy this short extract from the 1812 edition of the Rapunzel story, which was taken from the original work of the German brothers Grimm. It casts a whole new light on the story:<br><br>"At first Rapunzel was afraid, but soon she took such a liking to the young king that she made an arrangement with him: he was to come every day and be pulled up. Thus they lived merrily and joyfully for a certain time, and the fairy did not discover anything until one day when Rapunzel began talking to her and said, "Tell me, Mother Gothel, why do you think my clothes have become too tight for me and no longer fit?""<br><br>That is really funny and was probably part warning for young ladies and part bawdy joke! The later 1857 edit reads differently enough that the bawdy humour was taken from it completely and Rapunzel sounds like a simpering mooncalf rather than the more likely young lady in the 1812 version. Anyway, the living merrily and joyfully bit sounds like a lot of fun!!!<br><br>I'd also like to congratulate the clever British readers who have had the excellent common sense to walk away from a failing empire for a second time in recent history.

I fail to see how we'll be better off with Johnson, Gove, IDS, etc. I don't see how the average British person will be better off.

But this really is only where is starts to get interesting. I don't want to derail the discussion more than necessary, and will try to keep this short and undiplomatic. <br><br>I found the debate difficult to bear due to the abysmal quality of most of the (most) voiced opinions/arguments. The term "Independent United Kingdom", the fact of claiming not to be able to get rid of a layer of politicians, while being in the process of a referendum to do exactly that, and somehow accepting the caricatures of statesmen from an elite pipeline one layer below as god given perhaps makes this point quickly. <br>Of course the other side is not significantly more "professional" about it, though I feel much better about their intentions. One thing I find unforgivable is to equate anti-European with anti-EU (or EU-critical), where you could perfectly well use the simple term "anti-Union" (avoiding the ill advised monopolization of "European Union" - like there could be only one). <br>Still, I think the safest path may not be the straightest nor the most obvious path by now. This one certainly is not the fairest if you look at how the young population voted (or wasn't even allowed to) when most of the economic forecasts (for whatever they are worth) predicted that the largest effects would come to bear 10 years from now. I think all this could have been avoided, perhaps in a mere 10 years by a demographic shift of the sentiment, but it was not to be. Perhaps something can be arranged with Ireland or Scotland. We'll see how things turn out, and it certainly is a good opportunity to straighten a few things out on the continent.<br><br>If you can find yourself in some of that, or just wonder about a non-elite continental perspective I would recommend reading this pro-Brexit rationale from a German perspective. http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fkrautreporter.de%2F1537-zeit-zu-gehen-grossbritannien<br>I very much look forward to next weeks installment.<br>By the way if someone wants to vent steam into the direction of the World Bank, I'll be sitting down with some of the MENA people after the weekend.

It has made me want to tackle more philosophy and I've ended up now trying to chew my way into Kant's Critique, as a prelude to schopenhauer (as recommended via your other blog). <br><br>In some ways Spengler fulfills your criteria of reading stuff that offends, (although the effect will have been softened via your introduction to his ideas): I'm sure I recall that the first time I heard of the Decline was in a Guardian article about 10 years ago. The description made me think "that sounds kind of interesting actually", but the author then huffily dismissed it as reactionary anachronistic nonsense of some kind or other,and I'm ashamed to say I probably just thought "oh well, better not bother with him". <br><br>If a response to your Brexit aside is permitted...I'll certainly be eager to read your post. As I'm sure you are aware Scotland voted entirely to remain by council areas, 62% of the vote overall, but we are set to be dragged out nonetheless. Everyone I know is pretty shell shocked. My wife is Spanish and she is frankly heart broken. She tends to see the whole thing as largely xenophobic, though I don't necessarily agree with that myself, and the feeling of being cut off further from comity with Europe is a very real thing to her. <br><br>I voted remain myself also, but would welcome your analysis of why it could be a good thing a marginal majority of people didn't. I don't think I've every seen you make such a strong statement regarding another country's political decisions BTW.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c1899794985388499784 title="comment permalink">6/24/16, 7:06 AM</a><br><br>

Or perhaps there's something by one of the revolutionaries of the First French Revolution: their results tending to be offensive probably their writings would be closely enough related to qualify and stretching my French would be good in and of itself, or a translation of Mao. I don't really find many ideas to be offensive (though Charles Darwin managed to do a darn good job at one point, but I've already read his pro-racism arguments--someone else might find him useful, and he should be read anyway for his other ideas), most of the time, (and I'm not going to read kiddie erotica for any assignment, no matter how important!) it's more the execution of them that bothers me--the idea of communism is quite pretty, really, it's just that humans are far too messy and complicated to achieve it on any large scale: it seems to work rather well on the very small scale.<br><br>On the subject of old books and home schooled kids, the key is always to talk about it. It is sometimes better to introduce some of those materials before the child can read them alone, so the conversation can happen as you read the book aloud, mid-text. Otherwise, find a good way to talk (my boys are fond of in-van discussion, rather than at home!) and have a talk. Language changes, there's always 'ass' in the Christmas story, if your kids are exposed to a traditional reading annually, and 'gay' in Deck the Halls, as prime examples of word-meaning-shifts that kids naturally meet early on. So a word may have been commonly accepted at one time for one meaning, then later become a slur. It's worth discussing. Huckleberry Finn is great for this, because the moral of the story is so good and so strong. Sure, the ending is neatly contrived and perhaps a bit unsatisfying to us these days, but the kids can easily follow Huck's change in how he feels about Jim.<br>There are some very problematical new books out there. A friend gifted one of my kids an award winning book for Christmas this last year that ends with the kid who is the main character dying in the Holocaust. Which would be well enough, had it been aimed at fourteen-year-olds rather than seven-year-olds! (For those of you not around many seven-year-olds, a good many of them are still afraid of the dark and the monsters under the bed: books where the protagonist dies, horribly or not, tend to cause nightmares.)<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c984142849775060807 title="comment permalink">6/24/16, 10:53 AM</a><br><br>

When that band started to break up and eject it's members, it was end of the world for many pre-teenage girls around Europe. Today, next to nobody cares about that band anymore. I believe that Brexit started same process for European Union. It is like artificially constructed girl band long after it's "best before"-stamp, just waiting to erode one notch farther. EU has been total disaster for anyone below the wealthiest 20 % here in Europe. Same processes that drive popularity of Trump upwards are working here to shift balance of power towards nationalist Right. And not a day too soon. There is no reason to believe that "fear of the Other" is somehow wrong. It may be that those fears are deeply rooted in reality. This dual "either-or"-thinking you have been talking about, you call it binary thinking, it has been hardwired into human nervous system for a reason. Evolution doesn't make mistakes in basic instincts, or the story of said species on Earth would be abysmally short. At least in Germany, where all expression of nationalist pride is strictly shunned and forbidden if it isn't expressed with connection to football, they are realizing that these teddy bear Others from Middle East come with very, very sharp claws and teeth. While in Germany during European Championship game, the long-shunned nationalism which natives expressed had a new flavor in it. There was one spoonful of despair, and other spoonful of awakening. One whole street was closed, and German flag was flied with such a pride with young men that nobody has seen it in Europe for decades. For a random traveller, chance of mood was palbable. They were truly championing their nation, in guise of football.<br><br>If people doesn't share ancestry, bonds by marriage, religion, primary language or cultural norms with each other, it is pure insanity to have trust towards others. Human beings are not gentle, co-operative creatures as a default mode, towards all and everyone. They save their tender feelings for their own, whomever they may be, and outsiders are seen as neutral force or threat. <br><br>This fact has been proven myriad times through history. I am not saying that common identity has to be centered around one said quality like race. It can be religion or even bonds of marriage between groups, which solidify certain level of basic trust between two groups. But John, are you not playing down the part of slow collapse that means fracturing of safety? It leads directly into in-group morality, where every group fights only for it's own. Universal moral ideals of humanism, derived directly from monotheistic worldview anyway, shatter as result. Universalism is offspring of high trust. If you offer your hand and it is bitten every time, only fool would keep on trusting. So why to pretend? Why to pretend that civilized, high-trust modes of behaviour are going to extend into future without abundant energy?<br><br>Maybe Lovecraft was right after all. Maybe all "foreigners" are really monstrous, scary shapes in the dark, to be expelled at all cost. Point is that all these shattered groups are foreign landscapes to each other, as they all are shivering around their campfire of shared identity, in the dark of the night. They all cast monstrous shadows to all the other campfires which are on the range to see them. What Lovecraft missed is that as they are foreign to "us", we are foreign to "them". And when these differing worlds collide, it is scary, alien landscape opening before each other, from both points of view. Then it is only question who has might to stamp his imagined reality over the imagined reality of the other. Is it us or the fish-people of Innsmouth?

When I bought my car for the second time in my life (I drove the first during 20 years), I was surprised by the lack of technological innovation. This car has a few extra filters, but everything else is very similar. My husband says that it is because I asked for no computer on board - for good reason, most of the money he leaves in the repair shops is for the computerised parts of his several cars!

Now obviously I didn't sign up for a course, so I'm in no way obligated to do it, but neither do I have any real reason not to, and it sounded interesting.<br><br>It's hard to know something I'll disagree without having read it first. The book that immediately suggested itself was "The Secret". There's two different (ahem) non-fiction books by two different authors with that title, and I don't know which one it is. Still don't, because it turns out neither one is in.<br><br>So there I was in a section of spiritual and religious related material. It occurred to me that you have probably read many of the books I found around myself, Mr. Greer, and I had the amusing thought that I might unwittingly choose as my "disagreement book" something that you are firmly on board with.<br><br>So what I actually selected was something called "The Pocket Dictionary of New Religious Movements", by Irving Hexham. Advertised on the cover is "Over 400 groups, individuals and ideas clearly and concisely defined". I thought amusedly to myself that as someone who has mostly tended towards rationalism, I ought to find, at a conservative estimate, at least 50 things to firmly disagree with. In reality, I actually only expected to be informed about some things I know little or nothing about, having paid scant attention to them. I found that acceptable as I'm not here at the library to complete your assignment, but to charge my phone, before I finish my daily duties and then go get shalefaced. No expectation of having a mental debating exercise or anything of the kind.<br><br>So, imagine my surprise at the following entry:<br><br>"<b>druids:</b> An ancient pagan religious priesthood found in Celtic lands, including Britain and areas of France. The Romans totally destroyed druidism, with the result that our only knowledge of it comes from Roman sources that describe it as entailing a bloody system of human sacrifice. Since the eighteenth century, various new religious groups have claimed to be druids, but there is no historical evidence that any of them are remotely related to ancient druidism. Today, many "druid" groups seek to perform their rituals at Stonehenge, which was a ruin long before the Celts entered Britain and has no connection with ancient druidism."<br><br>Now, my own knowledge of modern druidry is limited at best. But I have been reading TADR for the last five years. Also, I caught up on the previous blog entries, and even read the material related to the AODA one summer when I got laid off and was looking for a way to fill the time. I don't remember much about it, but didn't Hexham set up a straw druid here? I don't recall where you guys say that you have any kind of a historically verifiable connection to the ancient Celtic druids. Isn't Hexham refuting a claim that you're not even making?<br><br>I don't have much else to say about that entry or about druidry itself, that not being my thing, but I think I should stop reading this book, lest I fill my head with road apples. <br><br>Probably the types of mistaken ideas that circulate about your religion are well known to you, but I thought you should be informed anyway. <br><br>Everyone else: I'm sorry. I usually try to at least read all of you on the rare occasion that I comment, and in fact I'll sometimes go back and read the comments on old posts. It's awesome, you guys add really great stuff to what Mr. Greer says. <br><br>I think next for this assignment I'll try "The Singularity". About 25 years ago I wasted some money on a book called "the next 50 years". It was nothing but technology fantasies run wild with no supporting logic, never mind evidence. It made me angry, so much so in fact that I tore it along the spine and threw the two halves one after the other into the wall. And this was years before I was disabused of the belief in sustained progress.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c2320743263065923647 title="comment permalink">6/24/16, 2:00 PM</a><br><br>

In particular, let me congratulate them for looking past the fear mongering and smear tactics that were aimed at those who wanted to leave.<br><br>The EU started out well enough as a customs union and free trade zone for Western Europe, but morphed into a dysfunctional and increasingly intrusive leviathan state ruled over by an unaccountable and largely parasitic elite. Its no surprise that a great many Brits, Frenchmen, Italians, Swedes, Greeks and others want out.<br><br>I think that one thing that contributed to the outcome was that the crassly manipulative campaign of fear mongering and attempting to tar the "leave" campaign with the sort of guilt-by-association smear tactics that we were discussing on The Other Blog backfired. <br><br>It has been noted that the opponents of British independence tried to use the murder of MP Jo Cox to smear those who wanted to leave the EU by claiming they had "created a climate that contributed to violence" and all of the usual standard-issue rot like that, as well as generate sympathy for their side. It's been noted that while the proponents suspended their campaign for a few days out of respect for the deceased, the establishment continued to engage in blatantly manipulative propaganda by using the death of MP Cox for partisan political advantage. <br><br>Nick Griffin, the former head of the British National Party, wrote a <a href=http://thesaker.is/the-stolenreferendum-how-cameron-co-have-ruthlessly-exploited-the-murder-of-mp-jo-cox-to-save-their-skins-and-the-eu-project/ rel=nofollow>scathing editorial</a> about the attempts by the establishment to exploit Cox's murder for the Vineyard of the Saker, a blog run by a Russian exile living in the US. Whether you like Griffin or not or agree or disagree with his political views (I most definitely do not on both questions), its well worth reading. <br><br>It seems to me that towards the end, people realized just how unscrupulous the establishment's tactics were and how they were trying to play the British people for fools. I also think President Obama's blatant attempt to interfere with the referendum and sway the vote by making thinly veiled threats ended up backfiring as well. Imperial bullying is seldom popular with those who are on the receiving end. It overjoys me to see that all of this backfired in the end and the British people voted to regain their independence.<br><br>Again, my congratulations to the great British people, who so bravely faced up to some of the greatest tyrants in history, including Napoleon and Hitler and saw them fall.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c2045105402604641859 title="comment permalink">6/24/16, 2:07 PM</a><br><br>

What you then find is that language really does determine how you think and how you express yourself.<br><br>Once my Dutch had reached a sufficiently good level, a colleague gave me a whole list of books I might like to read. The titles came from his high school reading list. <br>One of the first books I read was Willem Frederik Hermans' <i> De Donkere Kamer van Damokles </i> (The Darkroom of Damocles). Set in occupied Holland during WWII, the ending absolutely astounded me; it is already a very dark, brooding kind of a story and then things just get so much worse. I had no idea from reading standard English-language literature, that people could have such a black outlook on life. That's not to say that Dutch people are gloomy ordinarily, but from reading the book I realized that deep down they have an unspoken fear about being overrun be it by the Germans in the Second World War, the French in Napoleonic times, the Spanish in the 15th century and ultimately the sea.<br><br>The next book was <i> Turks Fruit </i> (Turkish Delight) by Jan Wolkers. In the England of my youth this would most certainly have been classified as pornography and very graphic it is too! Even so, it was on the high school reading list! The story opens with the main protagonist, Erik, who has taken a fancy to a girl who has just moved into one of the rooms in the same house, draws round his "member" with a pencil on a piece of paper, writes next to it "My penis" and shoves it under the door. Such an act would be seen as sexual harassment at the very least, these days. Anyway, after a catalogue of sexual antics all described in the minutest of detail, a beautiful and very moving love story emerges. Erik, the sexual deviant, wins you over, if not to his particular predilections, at least to see that, rather than a monster, he is another beautiful human being.<br><br>After a series of Dutch literature, a girlfriend recommended I read Alice Walker's <i> The Color Purple. </i> Now, I have never even been to the American South and I am a white heterosexual male, so to find myself inside the mind of an abused black girl who is terrified of all men and finds lesbian love, was about as far away from my world as possible! This book gave me a whole new perspective on life, the vulnerability of women and the abuse of power. <br><br>The last book I shall mention here was another recommendation from a girlfriend: Vladimir Nabokov's <i> Lolita. </i> Which, I am sure everybody reading this knows, follows Humbert Humbert's pursuit of the twelve-year-old Lolita. As horrendous as this sounds, I eventually found myself feeling pity for Humbert. I am not trying to justify paedophilia here, just that Humbert knows that his feelings are wrong but cannot help himself.<br><br>PS On the different tiers in Retrotopia, I am coming round to your way of thinking, also thanks to Ray Wharton. To do so involved me finding out more about the geography of Ohio and quickly seeing that the population density there is much lower than here in Holland. In addition, the counties are similar in size to English counties, rather that the twelve Dutch provinces. Holland has a population density similar to that of New Jersey - the US's most densely populated state. I can certainly imagine that it would not be feasible to have all the counties at the same tier. I do think that, in general, it would be unlikely to go directly from tier 5 to tier 1 for neighbouring tiers.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c7579378735329643640 title="comment permalink">6/24/16, 2:17 PM</a><br><br>

Years ago, in the interest of reading some things I might not agree with, I read a bit of O'Reilly. I forget which book of his I read, but I was very surprised. Being an Irish Catholic, and attending some pretty preppy and Ivy League east coast schools, he has a really sensitive grasp of status and class. At least in those areas, the guy really "gets it." <br><br>Late last night, when I was reading around a bit on the Net, when it became clear the exit vote would prevail, I ran across an article from the Atlantic Monthly magazine, about the vote. I don't know how tongue in cheek the article was, but the author speculated that what it was all about, was this. The people voting to leave are Anglo-Saxons. The people voting to stay are Normans. The Anglo-Saxons voted to leave because for almost 1,000, they have been butt hurt over the Conquest. I suppose over the next few months, several other equally bizarre theories will be floated.<br><br>But another article said not to worry. The TV production of "Game of Thrones," probably won't be affected. Much. Maybe not as high of production values, but still watchable. What a relief. I can sleep at night. :-) Seriously, though, I've never been a fan of either the series, or books. Once I found out that I'd have to keep track of 7 royal houses, well, life's too short.

But if we are to argue honestly, we have to say something about terms of trade - if only (I am trying to put this from the standpoint of my political opponents, the people in the Leave camp, as fairness here requires) that terms of trade are "Nothing to worry about," that the UK can "Negotiate favourable trading arrangements from outside the EU, as Norway already has," something like that. (c) The flier has a map which shows Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey in red, as candidates for membership, and additionally shows Syria and Iraq in orange (with that orange colour left unexplained in the accompanying words). The rest of Europe is in shades of grey. But the grey is not uniform. The grey is quite dark over the Baltics, Byelorussia, and Ukraine (conveying to the incautious the suggestion that Byelorussia and Ukraine are in the same current treaty position as the Baltics). The shading is lighter over western continental Europe, with Portugal virtually disappearing on my screen (while Spain and Italy are duly visible). The oddest thing of all is that while Northern Ireland is correctly visible, Eire disappears altogether, at least on my screen. Was the artist trying to make the prospective voter forget the treaty position of Eire? <br><br>PPS: No, no, no: I GENUINELY did not upload that short YouTube clip.

I am very much looking forward to reading your thoughts on Brexit. I was shocked at the result, really didn't think it would happen.<br><br>Reading assignment #1) I read Turgenev's "Father's And Sons", as we had a copy, I've always loved the Classical Russians and their heavy-on-the-metaphor, kitchen-sink-dramas; and it was short enough to complete in ample time. I was very surprised that within the first few pages, I found myself in completely alien territory simply with the pace and formality of the writing. I had not realized how my brain has changed to a digital processing speed. It took awhile to get into the groove of the slow, singular focus of the story. You have to go slow to catch the clues, metaphor as well as to let the scene and pace of their lives sink in. It was a wholly different mental exercise. Thank You for that!!<br><br>This week's reading assignment: As I've said before, we're in the process of moving and have now cleared out all of our books and tchatches, We're leaving in 1 1/2 weeks, so I may have to hand this on in late. I'm in the camp of commenters who have read dissenting views extensively, so it will be a challenge to find one that can repulse me for more than simply being horrifically poorly written. Even Ayn Rand, I can see where she and her fans coming from. IMHO she's wrong cherry picking scenarios to support her scenario and I often suspect just being a provocateur, but I understand the impetus of their fandom to such scenarios and philosophy. It helps that my father and one of my closest friends were at times in their lives fans and followers.<br> I don't think your proposing this assignment was simply to find a book that repulses us for any reason, but a point of view - expressed in a book, no? I think this would disqualify reading a book we expect will be rubbish - like "50 Shades Of Grey", (just terrible writing) or Ann Coulter, who seems to say anything weirdly provocative to stay in the news, (not likely to be genuine); but an honestly held belief that we disagree with or find grotesque. <br>I'm sure we have a copy of Mein Kamph in our books in the US, but I think it would serve me better to stay away from disagreeable perspectives centered on race and prejudice - as that is the blind spot we are trying to illuminate. It's often best illuminated from the side - a.k.a. from a completely different issue that can be analogous. <br>The only book I can remember throwing away in disgust 1/2 way through was Henry Miller's "Tropic Of Cancer" due to his strong and boorish self puffing authorial voice. He just came across as a self-important azz to me and I couldn't believe so many women were clamoring to bed him as he bloated on. Blech! ((OK so maybe I need to get a copy of it again from the library when we get home.)) Like "Lolita", I found Anais Nin ((short story, "Little Birds)"), very unsettling and squirmy, but beautifully crafted. Definitely put me in the shoes of someone I find abhorrent and expanded my empathy-muscle.<br><br>Cormac McCarthy is one of my favorite writers, IMHO, if you are interested in giving him a go, you might start with his magnum opus: "Blood Meridian". I've read it 4 times to delve deeper, and gotten much out of it each time. Not to delve deeper, but for different odd reasons, I ended up reading "The Road" 3 times. It did get better, I did see the hopefulness in it finally. It IS a good book, but it is not why he is considered a master or one of the most 'important' writers of the 20th Century. "Blood Meridian" is why, so I would offer: go for the gold and read it if you try anything of his. "No Country For Old Men" OTOH: is I think much 'easier' to parse and digest, therefor somewhat more enjoyable and in tune with a traditional Western paperback. A good read :)<br><br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c2879254957613369736 title="comment permalink">6/24/16, 7:50 PM</a><br><br>

It qualifies well for the first homework assignment.<br><br>This is a children's fantasy novel in the style of an extended fairy tale or fable. According to Wikipedia, it was serialized in a magazine in 1868 and published as a book in 1871. When I read it twenty or thirty years ago, a number of things stood out apart from its literary quality, which is pretty good. <br><br>The protagonist is a young boy who is very ill at the opening of the story; the text holds out no hope for him and eventually he expires. The mortality rate of children in that period was such that no young reader would have been shocked or surprised by that situation. The religious value system of the book is interesting because it is saturated by the same late Victorian Christian sensibility as Little Women, in which children are assumed to be innocent and the suffering of innocents is valorized. Yet it is also rather an openly pagan book like The Wind In the Willows; the second most important character in the book is clearly the Goddess of Death, and she is presented as a kindly and sympathetic figure. Finally, the tone of the book and the way the tale is told made it appear to me to be aimed at pre-adolescent readers roughly age nine to twelve, but the complexity of the vocabulary and sentence structure would make it a challenging read for many high school students these days.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c5250300452510990423 title="comment permalink">6/24/16, 7:50 PM</a><br><br>

None of whom know anyone who could have possibly voted Leave, as it would encumber THEM in the immigration line at the airport on their next European holiday! The very NERVE of some people! The pearl clutching and snarls of 'Racist', Xenophobic Idiots!" flying through the blogosphere...And yes the 3 pro-Leave or even moderately dissenting voices have been shot down, shut up, cursed at and expunged from the group of our enlightened, liberal progressive inclusiveness.

The whining this morning is quite repugnant from the remain camp. People claiming they've lost their 'right' to live and work abroad. Young and old complaining that people over a certain age shouldn't vote and that 16 year old should be given the vote. Why not stop there I asked why not euthanise the old and give the vote to 12 year olds? I'm a bit worried some might have taken that seriously... <br><br>With regards to the assignment. Shudder. The first book that comes to mind is the god-awful God Delusion by Richard Dawkins. I can't stand that man.

I can't see how we're going to avoid even further austerity, more neoliberalism and more hollowing out of our infrastructure and economy coupled with more fracking, nuclear power and GM. I sincerely hope I'm misguided. I think That Brexit is only the beginning; my current belief is because Brexit will make little difference except more of the same, I'm expecting a bigger revolt in 5 years time, and I think that's UKIPs longer gameplan and that will give them a genuine chance of election. The 16 million that voted leave, will be very angry if the UK doesn't improve in the way they think it will. Seeing as the Labour Party are disintegrating, and people will be looking to take out their anger at the Tories, UKIP will be in a strong position. go. I happen to like Jeremy Corbyn - but he's not going to win, and will be stabbed in the back at some point from within Labour. A shame because he's a euro sceptic too - but he didn't/couldn't play that card because of his party being divided. Labour will turn into the Neo-Liberal party that Blair created and the Corbynites will go elsewhere, and a large number of the working class of the party will go to UKIP.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c3331662764143230717 title="comment permalink">6/25/16, 3:03 AM</a><br><br>

Penny... dropped.<br><br>So I finally read the above article - should've done sooner as it would have helped me no end understand my own mixed feelings over the last 24 historic hours. It would have been easy to throw a tantrum like many who voted remain, but I instead decided to descend into the murky depths of trying to make sense of it all, instead of just denunciating it all. It's easy to point the finger and scream "Racist!" at the top of my lungs, but harder to try to make sense of it.<br><br>The analogy with the Victorians really helped. Makes sense. If there is no outlet for an element of human expression - 'good' or 'bad' - then it will pent up, and find a more aggressive, violent outlet at some point. That can't be avoided it seems. I'm trying to view the whole thing like I would disease. Suppress and it will come out worse, express and you'll return to greater balance. <br><br>Perhaps it's time that Britain, like many countries, needs to accept that it's got a huge amount of racism, xenophobia, and perhaps most particularly islamophobia. I come from a small city, in an area dominated by white people, with very little racial diversity, and thus know very well how much racism exists in the UK. For those brought up in a multi-racial part of the UK, it may well be shocking to them to hear such racism and/or xenophobia expressed. But then being shocked by it, and 'outlawing' it clearly doesn't make it go away. <br><br>So now that it's out in the open. As it will be soon in the Netherlands, Denmark and France. What now? How do deal with it without violence and hatred? That I have no idea of. But communication and understanding must form the basis of that.<br><br>Looking back into the mirror - It's not lost on me that with a different context - let's say Wales voting to leave the UK - my own xenophobia would come to the front - but because it's socially more acceptable I'd be 'allowed.' So if I'm going to connect with the xenophobia in others, understanding my own, is a good place to start. <br><br>And xenophobia, racism and islamophobia is only one aspect of this whole thing.<br><br>Seems like I need to read Lovelock too!

If Britain had remained in the EU and business continued as normal I think it would have led to a much stronger leave vote in the end as our economy continued to slide into the post peak-oil, neo-liberal abyss. Now that we're out basically anything bad that happens can (and probably will) be attributed to our not being in the EU.<br><br>As is stands the MSM and social media already seem to be preparing the way for another referendum either to cancel this one or to rejoin a few years down the line. I notice the term "Bregret" is already being tossed about and there seems to be a myth already formulating that a lot of the people that voted to leave didn't actually think it would happen and would change their minds if they did it again.<br><br>Aside from an on-line petition for a second referendum there's also, interestingly enough, another for London to declare independence from the UK and rejoin the EU. The North of England (where I live) is increasingly being stereotyped in the same way as the South of the US as being mainly white, poor, uneducated, ignorant of the wider world and more or less flat-out racist. <br><br>I think a lot will depend on if Jeremy Corbyn survives the no-confidence vote already tabled against him for next week. If the Labour party manage to put a "Blairite" centrist back in charge then there's a fair chance the next election in 2020 will be a re-run of Thursday.

The level of acrimony is something I've never seen before. <br><br>The Remainers have been over generalizing about the motives of the Leavers and using guilt by association and every ad hominem known -calling them racists/fascists/UKIP supporters, xenophobes, irrationally fearful, bigots, Nigel Farage fans, Nazis - they tend to use such terms interchangeably. Black campaigners for Leave have been physically attacked by white middle class people who believe they're 'fighting fascism'. <br><br>The Leavers (on the left) have been calling Remainers neoliberal lackeys, anti-democratic, elitist snobs, traitors to the working class, 'so called socialists', bourgeouis sell outs etc. The debate has been and remains in the gutter. <br><br>Friendships are being severed all over the place because of this, families are falling out with each other. It's really unprecedented in my admittedly short, say, 15 years of involvement in politics. <br><br>Interestingly, people I know who have never had the slightest interest in politics are suddenly engaging with it on social media. The combination of Orlando and then Brexit seems to have pushed them into it. I would once have said that's a good thing but understandably they're joining an already toxic conversation and aren't improving it. <br><br>One good thing is that it might just possibly force a long overdue discussion within liberalism and the left about racism, immigration and Islam - the unmentionables. It's starting to come to the attention of the mainstream left that what was once a far left, minority position - No Borders - has become accepted as part of the definition of racism even among people who've never heard of the concept in its pure form and would be utterly opposed to it as a short term goal if they did understand it. Some more mainstream liberals/lefties are starting to notice that they don't quite know how that happened and are not sure of the wisdom of it. <br><br>The suppression of that discussion is, I think, what's behind the utter vitriol. But I fear that this is headed for violence if people can't develop the restraint to step back from the personal attacks. I'm trying to push both sides towards at least having some manners but really I think it's a lost cause. They agree with me, then half an hour later they throw another over-generalized ad hominem out there and the bitterness on the receiving end steps up another invisible notch. And these are former friends and comrades shouting fascist at each other. People are very emotional about it. Half the UK population pretty much calling the other half names. And both sides are guilty of it. The rifts won't heal quickly, if at all. I'm thinking of retirement in eastern Europe.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c5866334431909325026 title="comment permalink">6/25/16, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

They feared that leaving will result in minorities being deported or targeted as scapegoats for austerity or whatever. They also argued that voting Leave was opportunistic and populist rather than principled and that a Leave vote would ‘legitimize’ and strengthen the nationalists, racists and the far right (by which they mean UKIP which is certainly not a fascist party whatever it is). <br><br>‘Legitimize’ is a favourite term for some reason although it’s surprisingly hard to pin down what it really means. I suspect that the underlying idea is that the plebs will suppress their innate racism as long as their leaders make clear that it’s socially unacceptable. <br><br>JMG, I know you point out that many of the elite benefit from current immigration policies and no doubt that’s behind much of this. But I know for a fact that many activists genuinely believe that borders are racist – end of story – and many of them aren’t well paid and don’t really personally benefit from cheap migrant labour. They sincerely feel they’re fighting courageously against fascism and on the side of the persecuted. <br> <br>I think it’s partly a quirk of European history, as in the Nazis, that racism is considered to be the ultimate evil and that's it's mixed up with religious bigotry. (Of course it’s also seen as far right which they actually know is inaccurate but that’s a slightly separate issue.) It also seems to be fed by American cultural imperialism funnily enough. American 'progressive' activists and academics have had quite an influence over here and typically have tended to ignore the utterly different context of racism, nationalism and fascism in Europe as compared to the US.

Dial Press, 1969. In this book, a radical student on a California campus convinces his girlfriend to seduce a college professor. They murder him in a way that embarrasses the college. <br>After reading it, I could not understand why anyone would write a book like this. Professor Wilmess was not doing anything to deserve the attentions of radical students. They apparently just decide to murder him, possibly as a way to destroy the university. <br>Character point of view; If I was convinced that something vast and evil had to be destroyed right now, I might take drastic action like that. OTOH, old as I am, if I was that convinced I might suspect that I did not know the whole story and try to flesh out some details.<br>Author Point of View; Why did he write this? It is a more interesting question than the book itself. I could find no information about author "Paul Rader." There was a New York Times Book Review of the book (by Evan Hill, NYT 22 June 1969, pg BR32) behind a pay wall. The few free viewable lines indicate that the reviewer thought it was a satire, and that Rader had written other books, but I could not find any mention of them online.<br>The name "Paul Rader" was shared by the first 'radio preacher' Christian evangelist. He died in 1938, and among other things wrote a book on the evils of Hollywood called "Big Bug." Its possible that this could be a satire of Big Bug, but I could find no reviews of its content. The other Paul Rader was related to the first one, and is apparently a well-known figure in the Salvation Army, who served as its president from 1994 to 1999 and may still be alive. It seems unlikely that he wrote this book. At least it is not mentioned in his online biographies.<br>My best guess is that "Paul Rader" may be a pseudonym for someone who was raised in a fundamentalist Christian environment, possibly a relative of the Raders or family friend, who is reacting in some way to that social environment. It would be interesting to see how a Salvation Army member would react to the book's content--But then again, I would not wish this one on anybody...<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c3397670586256706597 title="comment permalink">6/25/16, 10:47 AM</a><br><br>

If you find some of your ideas coming back to you, please take that as a compliment! Also, the 'Peak Blighty' referred to by Gill did remind me of Retrotopia. Perhaps that is equivalent to 'Peak Uncle Sam' or 'Peak American Apple Pie', or some such like. I think it would be great if you could address Gill's points from an American perspective, pay wall permitting. Please also excuse the last paragraph, which is a bit of a cop out, simply because not everyone who has been exposed to your way of thinking can handle the idea of the end of 'progress.'<br><br>--<br><br>This essay is a reaction to an article in The Times yesterday by A. A. Gill. <br>In it, he puts the blame for Brexit fairly and squarely at the feet of Little Englanders. The article is behind a pay wall, but to give you a taste, I have extracted one paragraph. <br><br><i>We all know what “getting our country back” means. It’s snorting a line of the most pernicious and debilitating Little English drug, nostalgia. The warm, crumbly, honey-coloured, collective “yesterday” with its fond belief that everything was better back then, that Britain (England, really) is a worse place now than it was at some foggy point in the past where we achieved peak Blighty. It’s the knowledge that the best of us have been and gone, that nothing we can build will be as lovely as a National Trust Georgian country house, no art will be as good as a Turner, no poem as wonderful as If, no writer a touch on Shakespeare or Dickens, nothing will grow as lovely as a cottage garden, no hero greater than Nelson, no politician better than Churchill, no view more throat-catching than the White Cliffs and that we will never manufacture anything as great as a Rolls-Royce or Flying Scotsman again. </i><br><br>It is a nice, fun article and these "Little Englanders" he talks about certainly exist (as I am sure their equivalents exist in every country), but this is only a small part of the story. In addition, at the end of the article, the author undermines his own argument by suggesting that following a victory for leave, the UK will somehow be cut off from everything great about Europe (the Renaissance, baroque, rococo etc.) as if the whole island will be magically towed away to its new mooring off the coast of Maine. So who is the Little Englander now? He even recognises this, hence the attempt to redeem himself with the last sentence about library tickets.<br><br>To my mind, in the run-up to the referendum, the UK was roughly split into three groups: right-wing leave, right-wing remain and left-wing remain. In fact, left-wing leave also existed but the group was small enough that I can afford to ignore it in this analysis.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c3177616297240434092 title="comment permalink">6/25/16, 11:36 AM</a><br><br>

Each of those types in the RWL camp was matched by those in the LWR camp who have a mortgage or who work for an export company etc., who do not like the EU but were worried by the potential impact on their finances. <br><br>RWR is the establishment and all those who, lemming-like, follow the government no matter what. Paradoxically, their antithesis was the combined groups of RWL and LWR. Yes, you read that right, 'combined' since the one thing both agreed about was that they do not like the way that they are being governed. The difference was who they thought was responsible for the poor governance: RWL blamed the EU and LWR blamed the Tories. This gets to the heart of what is happening today and that is disillusionment of the wider populace with the establishment, not just in England, but throughout the Western World.<br><br>On the one hand, this is a crisis of the establishment's own making; following the banking crisis in 2007/8 taxpayers everywhere were held to ransom by, and ultimately obliged to bail out, the fat cats as required by governments. So far so bad, but the mistake they then exacerbated was to let so few banks fail and not to jail those responsible for ripping everyone off by several trillion.<br><br>The EU/ECB made, and continues to make, the exact same errors. The whole of the EU and the eurozone countries in particular, continue to struggle economically. People are migrating through the EU, not because they want to experience life on the other side of the border, but because there are no jobs for them where they come from. Meantime, there is a veritable brain-drain on-going from the ClubMed countries to Germany, the UK and other northern countries. This is economically beneficial for the northern countries but comes at a price of worsening conditions in the south. Without a practical way to transfer wealth from north to south, this problem will only get worse. Meantime, though, the EC only comes with platitudes that things are looking up. In reality they are waiting for a miracle.<br><br>For a case study in how it should have been handled, look no further than Iceland.<br><br>Long before all of that, though, in the UK, Tony Belongs-Behind-Bars Blair deceived parliament into agreeing to attack Saddam Hussein in Iraq. According to polls at the time, the British public opposed this action by an unheard of 83%. Britain's biggest peace-time demonstration ever, totalling three million people, descended on London to persuade the government to back down. Blair ignored all, and the rest, as they say, is history. The point, though, was very clearly made to the British public: that their government was not listening to them and not acting in their best interests.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c4589978809075813865 title="comment permalink">6/25/16, 11:37 AM</a><br><br>

The infamous immigration problems in the UK and other countries started from that point. Apparently nobody within the EC stopped to think about the consequences of introducing so many new and relatively poor countries in one go. The desire of the EC elite to expand the borders as quickly as possible over-rode all other considerations. This includes the latest misadventure of doing the US's and NATO's bidding of pulling the Ukraine out of Russia's orbit. Something similar could be said about the Syrian disaster which has led to the EU being flooded by refugees. This has all been wonderfully mishandled by the EC and, as a point of note, the 'new' countries have been the first to put back their borders and not accept any of these refugees.<br><br>Summarising these points, the British government has not been listening to its citizens and neither has the EC been paying attention to the concerns of the people of the EU. The establishment has lost touch with the populace. Any student of history will tell you that this is a very important marker on the way that leads inexorably to revolution. <br><br>In short, Brexit is just a signpost on the way to the beginning of the end. The elite ignore this at their peril.<br><br>Stepping back now to put this all into a much wider context we can see the underlying issue. Over the last quarter of a millennium, since the start of the Industrial Revolution (which began in England, ironically enough) life in general has been improving, with better health, better housing, longer lifespans etc., etc. It has been 'getting better' for so long now, we all believe that this is normal, that progress is an ever-upward arc. It is not. Progress i.e. 'moving forward' is a circle. We have just completed the upward part of that circle and are currently at the flatish area at the top. The future, I am afraid to have to tell you, is back down along a similar arc. What we are seeing in this vote, Trump and Sanders in the US, Marine Le Pen in France and all the others, is the start of a generalised landscape of increasing troubles throughout the West. <br><br>Is it all doom and gloom, though? In the relatively short term, it does not have to be. Careers can be followed, families raised and fortunes made, but gradually this will get more and more difficult against a backdrop of increasingly restive times.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c1610054052642153789 title="comment permalink">6/25/16, 11:38 AM</a><br><br>

I observed that in the local newspapers they provided a helpful map of the country which displayed which parts voted to stay and which voted to leave. What Blind Freddy could see from that map was that if you were in London, then clearly the majority of people wanted to stay. If you were outside of London, then the majority of people expressed their intentions to leave. What this indicates to Blind Freddy is that the benefits of staying within the EU were to be gained if you were living within the boundaries of London, whilst the costs of staying within the EU were borne by people living outside of the boundaries of London.<br><br>Now, we've often discussed over the years the sheer lack of a national vision and I believe that this referendum vote is expressing that lack of a national vision in the real world.<br><br>And also, the people who are now calling for another referendum in the wake of the result sound to my ears like school children who have lost some game chanting: Best, two of three - just to stay in the game! (That would make for a catchy good blog title too!!!) Hehe.<br><br>My gut feeling is that what they are actually saying is: I've got mine, matey! Who cares about you lot... And I believe that such thoughts are a result of the sort of social policies that we have been pursuing with such abandon over the past couple of decades.<br><br>The thing that gets me about the EU, is that if other countries sit around inflicting pain on member countries, then sooner or later your lucky numbers will turn up, it is only a matter of time.<br><br>Which reminds me that at the Green Wizards meeting yesterday someone asked me whether I believed that fuel would remain cheap into the future. It was a great discussion, and I said that yes, I believe that it will and I then walked them through one of the recent games that went on down here so as to keep fuel prices low for the consumer which has ended up with a less resilient system. They looked a bit sceptical so I didn't quite finish, but what I wanted to add was that if fuel was cheap at the pump, but there was 60% unemployment, then you can still say that fuel is cheap, but you just won't be able to pay for it. And that is how I see the future, where less people are within the circle of wealth. Well, that is the general outcome of the policies that we are pursuing and I believe that the BREXIT result speaks to that level of unhappiness in that community. But the EU is also expressing that predicament on a much bigger basis. Certainly if you were in Greece you'd be feeling it even though fuel was relatively cheap.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c1801867752320913331 title="comment permalink">6/25/16, 5:40 PM</a><br><br>

I guess that I will chip in with a few observations. To me, it all comes down to that damn essay on the reason for the rise of Donald Trump posted by JMG a few weeks ago, an essay that has been much on my mind. This essay may have been in an American context but believe me, this sort of stuff is going on everywhere. Over at http://russia-insider.com/en/british-vote-isnt-against-europe/ri15189 there is a map on how the vote went by area. As you can see, the enclaves of the remain vote were the wealthier regions of Britain, particularly London. If you had money, you voted Remain, if you did not, you voted Out. Virtually salary versus wage earners.<br> Now here is the thing. There is an article called "A portrait of Europe’s white working class" at https://next.ft.com/content/4139381a-f1bb-11e3-a2da-00144feabdc0 and I am willing to bet that these people would have voted for Brexit. They are real communities who know what has been done to them and why. Not for nothing did these people sing 'Ding-Dong-the witch-is-dead' at Margaret Thatcher's funeral.<br> Do the people in the wealthier areas have the equivalent sort of communities? Or mostly shared vested interests. Doubt that? Then consider this - if say Leeds became the financial center of Britain would these people stay in London or would they make the move to Leeds? About 10% of London are from the EU and more are from the rest of England chasing opportunities that they can. They do not care about the rest of Britain. But if you are only talking to each other, you are really only in an echo chamber.<br> This was in some ways, I think, a repeat of the British elections of last year when the Labour party there were nearly annihilated simply because the wealthier parts were only talking to each other and not to anyone in the rest of Britain. An article at http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/election-2015-social-democracy-is-dead.-dont-mourn/16955 has a map showing how Britain voted which is eerily like the map of how the Brexit vote went. Even here in Australia, I noted on the news before the Brexit vote that the only ordinary voters they were interviewing were from Poland or Estonia or Spain who had settled in London. I saw no interviews with people that lived in, say, England. And now those voters who voted Out are being reviled as racists (the trump card?), sewer scum, or ignorant being uneducated. Imaging that! They have been cutting back on education to people for decades and now claim that these people are uneducated!<br> I cannot recommend enough the video embedded in the page at http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2016/06/87726.html which is an interview with Mark Blyth, a Scottish economics professor at Brown University in the US. What he had to say about the Scots rejoining the EU were jolting but at the end of the interview he states what the eventual outcome will be unless change is made. He flat out says that the Hamptons, being low-lying beaches, are not a defensible position!<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c1154353402841129512 title="comment permalink">6/25/16, 6:10 PM</a><br><br>

I see it more as the undermining of authority, of trusting in experts and 'your betters'. The Leave campaign was at least as 'propagandist' as Remain, and with the support of the main agenda-setters in the UK, the tabloid press.<br><br>I was a reluctant Remainer. In other circumstances I can imagine having voted to leave, but I couldn't stomach the campaign's pandering to, or even whipping up of, hostility to immigrants. I was also troubled - as I am still - by the seeming promises being made around immigration and increased spending that Leave's leaders would have no appetite or power to deliver. Already it's "we never said there would be *less* immigration", "it was a mistake to promise to spend extra money on the NHS", "there's no rush to start the exit negotiations" etc.<br><br>The tragedy is that the campaign was won on the pain of the wage class, who have got the dirty end of the stick for the last generation or more, but every indication is they will continue to the get the worst of any bad effects that come from leaving (or from staying, for that matter!). The destruction of the British labour movement - promoted heartily by all of the high profile Leave spokespeople - makes it seem almost inevitable that it will pan out this way.<br><br>I expect the next couple of years to be consumed by lots of effort being poured into negotiations and separation whilst Farage chips away with an escalating anti-immigrant agenda.

Hmmm. I also wonder about a backlash from Brussels to Brexit.<br><br>RE: Reading Assignments:<br>1) Found a book for assignment number two. The opening statement in 'The Adventure of Don Francisco Vasquez de Coronado' by Hammond and Goad (UNM Press, 1938), sets the tone, which galls to no end: "The men of this story came from far-away Spain four hundred years ago, when ONLY Indians lived in the great stretch of country we call the United States and Canada." ('ONLY' capitalized for emphasis). This book is history in story form, geared toward children and youth. <br>2) For assignment number one, finished reading Jules Verne's 'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea’. As with David, by the lake (6/23/16, 5:59 AM) who read Wilkie Collins ‘The Moonstone’ and noted, “…how significantly personal the inter-class relationships were and how the loyalty was reciprocal -- not just retainer to master/mistress/family, but the reverse as well…”, I found similar respectful attitudes true with the narrator and his servant in the book I read. This rather surprised me, but I’m not sure why. I also got the idea that while Verne described ‘Progress’ as inevitable, there seemed to be an almost subversive undercurrent of Nature being the ultimate winner (implied in almost incidental statements about the forces of nature, as well as various narrow escapes).<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c9006112692532350671 title="comment permalink">6/26/16, 7:23 PM</a><br><br>

Among the children, the most popular role-playing game was something called "Nasty," which I'll leave to your imagination, and I won't tell on who did it (hint: every last one of them). The upshot of my odd upbringing was the subconscious perception that Causacian bodies were filthy and disgusting, while those of the Japanese were clean, and it may actually have been true to some extent. The Mormons hide it, while the Buddhist Japanese scrub it down good and air it out.<br><br>I did not manage yet to do your last assignment. I have Don Quixote in Spanish somewhere and will eventually relocate it. I also have "Bagvad Gita" in Indonesian, but in looking it over, it appears to be a modern novel based on the classic, so I went shopping for literature in Indonesia again. I've read quite a bunch of children's books with the hope of translating them into simplified English for my students, to make plenty of easy reading available to them. The problem is that many of them have such violent endings (not Grimm, thank goodness, but grimace-worthy), that they offend my students' sensibilities. Japan is really quite an isolated culture.<br><br>It became clear in Indonesia that I needed to choose a modern-lifestyle sort of novel. (Hard to have a conversation when all you know are animal names, active verbs and a handful of emotional expressions.) So I bought something that translates as "Love Ended Yesterday."

Sitting at that campfire with you are a couple of Innsmouth fish-people, a shoggoth, a night-gaunt, two Tcho-Tchos from the plateau of Leng, and a tentacled horror from R'lyeh.

But they think the referendum itself was racist because it was led by ‘racists’ and ‘fascists’ and stirred up British nationalism and ‘legitimized hatred of immigrants and xenophobia’. They don’t believe that nation states are or can be any more democratic than the EU structures. Plus they see it as turning back the clock which is of course blasphemy. So they’re rioting against the Nazis basically, in their minds. <br><br>They’re opposed to hierarchies within the working class also. In practice, that means they oppose the idea that workers in one country should have more ‘rights’ than those in others. This makes it extremely difficult for them to deny any workers from poorer and more oppressive regions the right to live somewhere freer and wealthier. It's a long standing thread of internationalism within socialism.<br><br>As far as self-determination goes, they don’t recognize the legitimacy of nation states so they don’t support national self determination. If you could organize a global plebiscite open only to workers (as opposed to capitalists) on borders and immigration, they’d accept the results of that as legitimate, probably. In the meantime, they’ll support what they believe to be the objective interests of the entire global working class. Conflicts of interest within that class are, basically, all the fault of capitalism and imperialism anyway so they’ll just skirt over those. Anyone calling attention to those conflicts will be presumed to have suspect motives and denounced as a sower of division. <br><br>Their solution to the problems that they largely pretend don’t exist is that workers, migrant and non-migrant, must all join unions to prevent exploitation and must organize at European level to counter the neoliberalism of the EU. In other words, the solution to a problem causing present suffering is for the victims to create a world that doesn’t yet exist and never has. And of course the victims must overlook any inconvenient divisions within the working class in order to do that. <br><br>Anyone expressing doubts about the immediate chances of European workers managing to organize across what are at ground level massive language and cultural barriers, with nothing resembling the funds available to international finance, is considered to be defeatist. I couldn’t even begin to explain to you how deep the level of insanity goes in that world. <br><br>The mainstream left distances itself from the fringes while in practice being very heavily influenced by them. Ask them to produce a non-racist immigration policy, a non-Islamophobic response to IS activities within Europe and a non-racist explanation of the events of New Year’s Eve in Germany and you’ll see the utter incoherence. It’s ironic that those they, at best, intend to educate, are in reality better Marxists and better intersectionalists than they are.<br><br>Mallow.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c1973399672321668122 title="comment permalink">6/27/16, 2:32 AM</a><br><br>

I read Orwell's "War of the Worlds" for the last assignment. It was interesting to reflect on the author's portrayal of people in panic. Gentlemen were regarded as having the obligation to offer their help to the (poor, helpless) ladies and children, and their religious and political leaders, even in the midst of turmoil. Women were for the most part regarded as a useless drag, with one spirited lady as a counterexample. The novel overall felt surprisingly modern (though it did just sneak in behind the 1900 deadline with a publication date of 1897).<br><br>I am pondering my choice for this week's assignment. There are a lot of things I don't want to read, but they mostly fit into the "ugh, shrug, life's too short, re-shelve!" category rather than the "fling across the room" category. I gather we are not looking just for bad writing, which is a frequent cause of my rejections, but rather a conflict with the author's viewpoint. So we are to identify where the author's going, acknowledge that we don't want to go there, and read on anyways to try to understand how that viewpoint could make sense in some way? I may just default to "Mein Kampf" because I should have read it in its entirety long ago. Then again, I might feast myself on some prosperity gospel literature- that concept really does turn my stomach. Gosh, can't wait.<br><br>Re. Brexit- when I first heard about the shocked and disbelieving reactions of those watching their country radically change around them, I too wondered if someday we in the U.S. would be encountering similar feelings watching our union dissolve. That evening I saw on our local news a young man from the Yes! California campaign, which wants our state to peacefully secede from the U.S., explicitly holding up the Brexit process as a model for proceeding. The tone of the newscast was amused tolerance- "Aren't we a great country? Even these nuts can have their say." I just wonder if one day the tone of both the message and the reaction to it will be markedly different. <br><br>--Heather in CA<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c7488730514269904338 title="comment permalink">6/27/16, 7:26 AM</a><br><br>

The story is that Britain's East Coast had a major pirate problem, and Rome was sucking up Britain's taxes and not returning enough to keep Britain's navy going, probably due to politics inside the Roman government. (For whom Britain was a low priority). So essentially, the admiral mutinied and turned privateer, with his navy keeping the loot from the pirate ships in their own budget. Whether or not he declared himself Imperator, or his troops did (which was what happened with Arthur, if you accept him as a real Roman/British leader) is a moot point. He was in a nasty Catch-22 and did the only thing he could, if you ask me. <br><br>Allectus' victory was a palace coup by the head bean-counter, probably political in nature (a purely local power-play)and probably inevitable. Because, as I said, the entire thing was premature, though there would be other British generals and admirals (to use modern terminology) who did the same thing, and later made it stick. But also, pretty soon the pirates were being invited in and promised land if they'd defend the coast against other pirates. <br><br>I do consider this worth thinking about in our own time, for those inclined to go by historic parallels. Or as the battle cry in TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING was, "No more unfunded mandates!"<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c801571964405750433 title="comment permalink">6/27/16, 12:06 PM</a><br><br>

The campground where we visited friends is populated primarily by low-end white salary class folks who have just enough money to have a parked RV in a crowded park as their summer house. Their reaction to Brexit was horror -- at the US stock market dropping 600 points as a result. Apparently they check the value of their 401ks and suchlike nearly every day. Once I heard that the DJ had been at 18,000 and did the math (it's only a 3 fracking percent drop!) I pointed that out and reminded them about the 1987 drop of a far higher percentage. It shut them up pretty fast. <br><br>Here in Missouri the better name for a similar vote would be on the Remain side: Missouremains.<br><br>For my first assignment I read The Scarlet Letter and am very glad I made that choice. Since Hawthorne was a 19th century man writing about happenings more than 100 years before his time, it had the extra interesting effect of seeing the farther past through the eyes of the past and then through my own eyes.<br><br>Much as I hate the prospect, reading Ann Coulter will have to be my assignment this time. I can't even look at the covers of her books without wanting to do something very mean.

The stupidity of the entire society is greatly exaggerated but our hero is able to make telegraph, fleets of bicycles, and large amounts of electricity with switches. Enough electricity to win a kind of civil war with layers of electric fence. All this is done more or less in secret, and then presto - at the flip of a switch all the electric current a whole town could want. Where does that electricity come from?

Needless to say, after the results came back, there was a proliferation of threads with titles like "Genetic tests are scams". All in all, about half of them got results that were rather different from what they expected. ;)<br><br>As for me, though, I actually am boring. Nearly all my known ancestors are assorted British Isles riffraff, starting with some Puritans and moving on to include Welsh people, Cornish people, Scottish people, Scots-Irish, real Irish, English laborer types, and so on, along with a few Dutch and French people and a Croat who slipped in there somehow. 23andme lists my ancestry as 97.2% Northwestern European, 2.0% Southern European (inc. Balkan), 0.7% unspecified European, &lt;0.1% Native American, &lt;0.1% unknown. That's about as pure as it gets.

More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Space Seeder, that kind of thing is all over the place. If you belong to a minority religious tradition in today's America, you can pretty much count on seeing lots of misinformation being tossed about by self-proclaimed experts who never bother to talk to anybody who actually follows the faith in question. Just one of life's little entertainments...<br><br>Submarine, it's been pointed out that Obama's speech in Britain more or less ordering the British people to shut up and stay in the EU does seem to have been the inflection point at which the Leave vote started to take the lead! <br><br>Hereward, and I can well imagine that in the Netherlands, the whole country would tend toward a single tier. Different locations mean different conditions! <br><br>Lewis, replace "butthurt" with "downtrodden" and you've got one of the major themes of 19th century British radicalism. Funny to see that brought up again!

I certainly agree that Brexit is the beginning of a rough road, but staying in the EU would, I argue, have been an even rougher one. <br><br>Caryn, I'm not going to make it a hard and fast rule, but the general idea is to find something written from a point of view you find hard to imagine any human being actually holding -- and then try to understand why the author holds it.

Now he'll be remembered for something other than that affair with a dead pig. <br><br>Peacegarden, I notice that Ayn Rand seems to be well ahead in the "I Can't Stand This" sweepstakes, with <i>Mein Kampf</i>, <i>The Secret</i>, and Richard Dawkins her only real competition. What can I say? This blog apparently attracts a sensible crowd... ;-)<br><br>David, vicious class prejudice on the part of the affluent against the poor is an immense social fact in today's America, but it's also unmentionable.

Ideally, you would show your best estimates for sea levels in each of the years 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2400 (or something similar), with some discussion of the (inevitably huge) uncertainties, and with maps indicating what at each stage gets left in various jurisdictions - very notably, what gets left in England. Many us would be anxious to proceed beyond vague generalities, such as the banal "East Anglia is doomed" and the banal "Dartmoor is safe." What some of us would really love, though it might be too much to ask of you, would be a comprehensive discussion, comprising some tens of maps, and covering if not all continents, then at any rate Europe "from the Atlantic to the Urals" (in that helpful old phrase of M.S.Gorbachev). Also of special interest would be a detailed map of London, giving some idea of (for instance) what might remain safe in the years when the first tidal surges are starting to wash over Threadneedle Street.

Here are a few more insights from this side of the pond before you make the final draft for your next blog post.<br><br>If anyone does not understand why so many working class people voted for brexit, then watch this you tube clip of this working class black man shoot down a remain supporting white middle class liberal. The look of cognitive dissonance on the liberals face is is something to behold, I’m an surprised his brain didn’t blow up. As his opponent is black he can’t just dismiss him as a racist.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gHLfMXb0Yg<br><br>I live in Newham in the East End of London, which is one of the most diverse boroughs in the country where white people are a minority. I know a number of black and Asian people who have voted for brexit, so this is not just a white racist thing, as it has been portrayed by parts of the media<br><br>I myself am a middle class liberal andI know several white middle class liberals who voted for Brexit like me, because they can see that the EU has screwed up. Saying this I can understand why a lot of people voted remain. There is an aura of idealism surrounding the EU and to be fair it does have an better record on things like Human rights and environmental protection than our tory government. The greatest claim made for the EU is that it has helped to keep the peace. Given the history of the first half of the last century, it is something that has given me real pause for thought. Ten years ago I would have voted to stay in the EU and I would probably have done the same five years ago. The thing that has changed my mind, is seeing the way that the Euro has led to vast swathes of poverty and unemployment in southern Europe. Seeing whole Nations being thrown to the dogs and the rise of far right parties have convinced me that the EU has become a threat to peace in Europe and that we need to get the hell out and get our democracy back.<br><br>The Euro has become a wealth pump for Germany and enabled that country to sell its exports to the rest of Europe at a much cheaper rate than it would have done if it had the Deutsche mark. If Greece had its own currency, then it would have devalued after 2008 making its exports cheaper and German imports more expensive and encouraged a tourist boom in that country. The huge transfer of wealth to Germany has made it the power centre of Europe and left it reluctant to make any reforms that might sort this mess out. This situation is unsustainable and it is going to end up in ruin. I can only thank god our leaders had the wisdom not to adopt the Euro and it is is time to leave the sinking ship. If I thought that the EU was reforming the Euro and on the way to becoming more democratic, I would vote to stay in. Sadly that it not the case. The EU has become a prime example of abstract principles overriding reality. It was a noble dream, but it did not work. <br><br><br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c6283161030266519623 title="comment permalink">6/28/16, 12:21 PM</a><br><br>

Please also note that the politicians on both sides of this debate are vile. Farage is a racist and Boris Johnson has been genetically engineered by monsanto from Bertie Wooster, Satan and Machiavelli. The politicians on the remain side like Cameron and Blair are the muslim murderers and brown people bombers who have devastated Iraq and Afghanistan and Libya. The politicians on both sides have lied like hell. My decision to vote out is based on the principles and the situation we find ourselves in.

For the first assignment, I read Thackeray's Vanity Fair. (Had been in the middle of Nostromo, but turned out that was published a bit this side of 1900.) I never had read anything by Thackeray before, and had had some vague preconception of the book as a dull daunting classic, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it very readable - playful, sarcastic, and narrated with plentiful breaches of the fourth wall. One difference from the modern perspective I almost missed in passing: the casual use of a simile, phrased something like "she held it as the reader has seen a mother holding her dead child to her breast". Today I would not expect that image to be deployed with such an assumption of the readers' shared everyday experience, given the lower infant mortality and the institutionalization of medicine (separating death from daily life) in most Western societies.<br><br><br><br><br>The novel follows our antiheroine Becky Sharp (a fitting name) as she ruthlessly ascends the English class structure through various deceptions and malfeasance; characters rise and fall, but that structure itself is very solid and explicitly defined by fine gradations of class, wealth, career,and family background. Neither the narrator nor the characters make any bones about discussing exactly how much income one can expect from their situation, and whether that will permit an acceptable marriage match. In my modern experience, these considerations indeed continue to exist, but in a rather more nebulous and less openly discussed form. I suspect the late 20th century resource bounty allowed many a greater sense of fluidity and freedom in personal life choices (thus, follow your dreams, and even if they fail you can probably regroup and find a way to make do more or less okay). In the future, probably not so much. Naive optimism has a pretty short half-life in Thackeray's world before being ruthlessly smacked down; when Becky and her husband are cut off from family support they do mostly maintain the lifestyle to which they are accustomed, but only by employing heroic levels of fraud, extortion, and exploitation of their more vulnerable associates.<br><br><br><br>- Grant<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c1376961550167337605 title="comment permalink">6/28/16, 1:21 PM</a><br><br>

So while revolution may be justified from one point of view, there may be other points of view from which the revolutionaries damage their own interests at a fundamental level.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c6915233538859824611 title="comment permalink">6/28/16, 11:34 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_b6373a" id=c5006493693083389468></div><b><a href=https://patriciaormsby.wordpress.com/ rel=nofollow>patriciaormsby</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Commenters are coming up with such great ideas for reprehensible literature here! I realize I am much more likely to sympathize with the protagonist of the harmless little fluff novel I've chosen mostly as a lesson in modern Indonesian, and moreover I'll probably get a vicarious kick out of life in a medium I am physically unable to tolerate. Here in Japan, though, I probably will not find books that are reprehensible enough, even in Japanese, because the Japanese do not like to offend. Not wanting to order a book via the shaky international shipping system, I will seek out reprehensible on-line material, of which there is probably more than enough to constitute a book, given that among the views of the power elite there are those I consider an existential threat. (I think nearly everyone faces such a threat from the elite in one way or another.)<br><br>@Onething, a look at the world through the eyes of a moral Daltonist would be enlightening, especially since you know what is wrong with Ayn Rand. On the other hand, there is a whole world of reprehensible literature out there by unidentified sociopaths, and you might have fun picking out their moral blindspots.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c5006493693083389468 title="comment permalink">6/29/16, 12:09 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_b6373a" id=c2739815072407766222></div><b><a href=https://patriciaormsby.wordpress.com/ rel=nofollow>patriciaormsby</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I just took Kim Arnsten's advice and had a look at Austerity Ecology &amp; the Collapse-Porn Addicts by Leigh Phillips over on Amazon's website. They won't let me read the whole thing of course, but I do get a sampling, and My Goodness! What a steaming pile! She says she is coming from a leftist, environmentalist point of view, but regarding the latter, how in the heck could she misunderstand it as completely as she has! A basic lack of physics education? She's a "science writer"? God help science! In her first chapter, she manages to deride JMG along with just about anyone else prominent in our camp, implying indirectly that they are responsible for deaths of scientists in Mexico at the hands of a radical group she could not directly interview.<br><br>I noticed my response to this was to give her the benefit of the doubt at first, and then start skimming to see if there is any place where she sheds light on how she reached her conclusions, with which she starts her diatribe. My general response was the gag reflex.<br><br>If she were a decent writer, she could present an argument I could stay with, suspending my doubts at some points to try to follow the whole idea and learn what I can. The whole purpose of the book must have been simply a feel-good book for folks who still want to go forward with "progress" despite its increasingly visible flaws, who must be feeling a lot like Custer at Little Bighorn these days.<br><br>I also noticed at Amazon's site that those who had ordered her book also chose lots of good antidotes to it, like "Facing the Anthrocene" and others tkaing on the "crisis of capitalism".<br><br>So it is a real black hole of a book, but I will read through until, gratefully, I am stopped by Amazon who says I've had enough.<br><br>My late Aunt Helen recommended Sarah Palin's book as another real steamer.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c2739815072407766222 title="comment permalink">6/29/16, 1:22 AM</a><br><br>

<div class="avtb a_bbeaeb" id=c7038157290852991550></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/15814119921652251037 rel=nofollow>Alexandra</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I can barely hear myself think for all my liberal, salary-class friends' shocked wailing and hand-wringing over Brexit. Mind you, these are almost all Americans who have never lived in the UK or EU, and have no idea what they are talking about except what they read in the media: that all supporters of Brexit are racists and xenophobes who are too stupid to even understand what they voted for. I'm not really even sure why they have their knickers in such a twist about something they never cared about enough to learn the first thing about it...I guess even they sense that the UK's internal divisions are a prequel to what we may see in the US. Or maybe it's just because it got a mention by John Oliver. <br><br>Well, I actually lived in the EU (Spain) for several years in the '90s. That was before Spain had joined the Euro currency zone, but even back then people were complaining about EU policies. One example: I lived in the most rural and poorest region of Spain and a lot of the complaints had to do with EU agricultural policies--mainly that the decisions about what to subsidize were made by people with no knowledge of the local environment and growing conditions. At roughly the same period I heard of similar complaints coming from the Scottish highlands where they were being told to grow crops instead of livestock. The EU bureaucrats apparently couldn't grasp that there's a reason why certain crops or livestock are traditional in certain areas (i.e., because they work). The subsidies weren't enough to cover the costs and farmers were having to sell their land for a pittance. Oh well, more real estate for the rich to invest in, right? Hooray for progress.<br><br>Sadly, the Spanish government made the decision to join the Euro zone, and you can all see what a boon that was for their economy. All their fears from the '90s came true, and worse.<br><br>So from my point of view, the faultlines in the EU were obvious 25 years ago, and it was a foregone conclusion that it would collapse--the only questions were how long it would take, who would leave first, and how nasty it would get. If the UK can really manage to extricate itself, it may avoid being crushed under the rubble. I am glad to see other nations considering referenda of their own now. The real point of national sovereignty isn't xenophobia--it's that decisions that impact a nation should be taken by those who (a) actually know that nation, and (b) are themselves impacted by the outcome.<br><br>Perhaps it should come as no surprise that those who wanted to Remain in the EU are now calling for a do-over (what's next, best two out of three?): if you're not willing to abide by the votes of your fellow citizens, then you obviously don't believe in democracy anyway.<br><br><a href=in-praise-of-reprehensible.html#c7038157290852991550 title="comment permalink">6/29/16, 9:01 AM</a><br><br>
