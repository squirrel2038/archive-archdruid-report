<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the nineteenth installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator, forced to grapple with the cognitive dissonance between everything he believes about progress and the facts of life in the Lakeland Republic, tries to evade the issue for an evening—and ends up even deeper in perplexity...</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The next day was Saturday, and for a change, I didn’t have anything planned. The marathon sessions of negotiation with President Meeker’s staff, exhausting though they’d been, had taken up less of my time in Toledo than I’d expected; even if I sat on my rump in my room until it was time to catch the train home Wednesday, I’d still get back to Philadelphia with everything taken care of that I’d officially been asked to do. That was comforting—or it should have been. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As it was, I woke up in a foul mood, and things didn’t get any better as I went through my morning routine and then stared at the window, trying to decide what to do with the day. Partly, I was annoyed at the way the evening had gone, annoyed with myself for almost getting into a fight with Melanie Berger, and with her for almost getting into a fight with me. The worst of it, though, was the bizarre logic she’d used to brush aside my concerns about the Lakeland Republic’s survival. Her notion that progress had somehow turned into the enemy of prosperity and the source of most of the world’s problems—I could barely frame the idea in my mind without shaking my head and laughing, it was so obviously wrong. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The difficulty was that I couldn’t come up with a straightforward argument against it. You know the kind of paradox that looks simple and turns out to be diabolically complicated once you start trying to poke holes in it? This was the same sort of thing. I started by trying to come up with a mental list of new technologies that obviously had more benefits than drawbacks, but that turned into a tangled mess, because I’d spent enough time in the private sector to know that most of the costs of any new technology get swept under the rug in one way or another and most of the benefits the public gets told about are basically made up by somebody’s marketing department. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, most of the new technologies that I’d seen hitting the market—bioplastics, veepads, the metanet, and so on—actually offered fewer benefits than the things they replaced, and I knew damn well that the publicly admitted costs weren’t the only ones there were. Technologies come onto the market because somebody thinks they can make a profit off them, period, end of sentence. You can spend your entire life in corporate boardrooms and one thing I can promise you you’ll never hear is someone asking, “But is it actually <i>better</i>?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I tried half a dozen other gambits and got absolutely nowhere. Finally I decided to go for a walk and check out the latest news. I was tired enough after the last few days that I’d slept in late, and it was past ten in the morning before I went out the front door and headed for Kaufer’s News. The day was brisk and blustery, with torn scraps of gray cloud rushing past overhead, and the blue and green Lakeland Republic flag out in front of the Capitol snapped and billowed in a cold wind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There was a crowd around Kaufer’s. I wondered what that meant, until I got close enough to hear the woman who ran it saying, in a loud voice:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Ladies, gentlemen, listen up. I’m out of today’s <i>Blade</i>, but there’s more on the way. No, I don’t know how soon—depends on traffic. Hang on and it’ll be here.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d figured out by the time she started talking that something important must have happened, but I didn’t want to stand there, so I walked the five blocks to the public library. I thought I remembered that they had newspapers, though if the big story was big enough I guessed there might be a line there too. They did, and there was, but there were half a dozen copies of the <i>Blade</i> and one copy each of a dozen daily papers from nearby cities, and they all had the same thing on the top headline. Since I didn’t care which paper I got, it took just a couple of minutes before I got handed a copy of the Cleveland <i>Plain Dealer</i> and settled down on a chair to read the news. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The short version was that the business between Texas and the Confederacy was getting ugly in a hurry. Right around the time Melanie Berger and I were trying not to quarrel, the president of Texas gave a speech in Houston claiming that Confederate oil companies, with Richmond’s covert backing, were using horizontal drilling to poach oil from offshore fields on the Texan side of the treaty line—and he said he had hard data to prove it. The Confederate secretary of energy held a press conference an hour later calling the claims an attempt to cover up Texan mismanagement of offshore oil reserves. President Bulford was right back on the podium fifteen minutes later warning of “consequences” if he didn’t get a satisfactory response; Richmond responded by putting its armed forces on alert. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The <i>Plain Dealer</i> had the sort of detailed situation report you basically have to belong to government to get in the Atlantic Republic. Of course there were photos of President Bulford, his face red and angry under the mandatory Stetson, and Secretary Lyall, with the icy expression that Confederate gentlefolk use the way rattlesnakes use their rattles, to warn you that someone’s about to die. The pages further in, though, gave all kinds of hard data: a map of the treaty line off the Gulf coast with drilling platforms marked in, a sidebar talking about the quarrels over the Gulf boundary before the Treaty of Richmond, one long article about the Texan accusations and the Confederate response, another long article about the troubled history of the Gulf oil fields, a third trying to gauge international reaction. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I read the whole thing carefully, because it wouldn’t take much to turn the situation into a world-class headache for the Atlantic Republic. There were still a few wells pumping in Pennsylvania, but most of the oil that kept things running back home was bought from the Confederacy, and there wasn’t enough spare capacity elsewhere to make up the difference if the Confederate and Texan oilfields were shut in. That meant yet another spike in oil prices, more turmoil on stock markets worldwide, and a messy balance-of-payments problem for the new administration in Philadelphia to deal with. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The most annoying thing about it all, though, was that it brought me right back up against Melanie Berger’s paradox about progress. The one country in North America that had absolutely nothing to lose if the Confederacy and Texas started lobbing ordnance at each other was the Lakeland Republic. While the rest of the continent was going to be flailing around trying to keep their transport networks from coming unglued, the Lakelanders didn’t have to care; their trains, streetcars, canals, horsedrawn buggies, and the rest of it would keep on running. It frankly seemed unfair. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By the time I was finished with the <i>Plain Dealer</i> it was getting on for lunchtime. I found a pleasant little Greek place a couple of blocks past the library, had lunch, and then headed back to the hotel to regroup. Right out front was a kid with a canvas bag of rolled newspapers. He was calling out, “Extra! Latest news on the mess down south!” That sounded worth another buck and a quarter. I had to dig in my wallet for a one, though, and in the process a card went fluttering to the ground. The kid scooped it up and handed it back to me, so I tipped him an extra quarter. The card turned out to be the one the musician handed to me my first day in Toledo, the one advertising Sam Capoferro and His Frogtown Five; I glanced at it, pocketed it, took my paper and headed up to my room. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d seen newsboys shouting “Extra! Extra!” in old vids, but didn’t have a clue what they were yelling about. Now I knew, and I also knew one of the ways that people in the Lakeland Republic got news about fast-breaking stories. The extra issue was a single thick section, all about “the mess down south;” they’d apparently thrown every reporter in town at the story, gotten plenty of quotes from Lakeland officials and assorted experts, not to mention the Confederate and Texan embassies in Toledo, and a couple of stringers down on the Gulf coast. I ended up putting in a good chunk of the afternoon reading and taking notes. Wednesday night I’d be back in Philly, and unless this blew over fast I was going to be in Ellen Montrose’s office Thursday morning and I needed to have proposals ready. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All the while, though, my mind kept circling back around to Berger’s wretched paradox. She’d claim—I could hear her say it—that the Atlantic Republic was being held hostage by its own technologies, that it was less stable and more vulnerable because it chose to run its transport network on imported oil and made itself dependent on complex systems reaching out past its borders. She’d point to that as one more example of the way that progress cost more than it was worth. Absurd as that generalization was, I couldn’t think of a cogent argument to refute it, and that irritated me. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I actually ended up spending the better part of a couple of hours, when I could have been doing something useful, standing at my window staring out at the streetscape and trying to make sense of the whole business. When I finally noticed how much time I’d wasted, I grumbled something I won’t write down, and decided to go out somewhere and chase the circling thoughts out of my head. I thought of Sam Capoferro’s card; a jazz club sounded like a good choice, and with the help of the hotel concierge, I was sitting on a streetcar fifteen minutes later as it rattled its way down toward the waterfront district.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Harbor Club was in a big square brick building with tall windows that spilled lamplight onto the sidewalks. The guy at the door was big and tough enough to double as the bouncer, but he took a good look at the card I handed him, nodded, and waved me past the desk where other patrons were paying the cover charge. The band was tuning up, and people were standing in groups on the dance floor talking and flirting, waiting for things to get started. Me, I got settled on one side of a little two-person table, waited for a waitress, asked about a menu—they had food service, I’d seen coming in, and not just bar snacks—and, on a whim, ordered the same sort of Lakeland-style martini Melanie Berger got the previous night, just gin, vermouth, and an olive. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I honestly had no idea how it would taste. Every martini I’d ever had back home had stuff thrown in to flavor it—cr<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>ème de cacao, crè</span>me de menthe, grenadine syrup, maple syrup, clam juice, carrot juice, butterscotch ice cream, sriracha-flavored mayonnaise, or what have you—and I’d always thought that’s what a martini was: gin or vodka, and anything up to half a dozen sticky things to beat up your taste buds. The drink the waitress set on my table a few minutes later was a different creature entirely. I looked at it and sniffed it, and then took a sip.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was delicious. I blinked, set the glass down for a moment, considered the taste, and then picked it up again and took another sip. It was just as good the second time. I sat back, let the alcohol smooth down the rough edges of my nerves, ordered dinner and waited for the band to start.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meal and music arrived within thirty seconds of each other, and both were just as satisfactory as the drink. The food was tasty in that unobtrusive way that doesn’t call attention to itself. The band was something else again. I’d guessed, the first time I’d heard him on the piano, that Sam Capoferro could play a hell of a jazz number, and he was as good as I’d thought, playing stride piano like a reincarnated Fats Waller. The other players ranged from common or garden variety competent up to really good, and their notes danced and spun on top of Capoferro’s driving rhythms. The playlist was mostly familiar jazz standards, with a couple of pieces I didn’t recognize—if they were new, though, they’d been composed by someone who knew all the nuances of classic jazz, and was more interested in crafting a good tune than in trying to be original.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By the time the first set was over, the bad mood I’d had earlier had packed its bags and caught a train to somewhere else. I was on my second martini by then, which didn’t hurt. The band finished up the last notes of “The Joint is Jumpin’” and the crowd clapped and roared. Half the people on the dance floor headed for tables and the other half clumped up to talk and flirt; a busboy came by and scooped up my empty plate; and maybe five minutes later, I saw a half-familiar face moving through the crowd, pretty clearly looking for somewhere to sit<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<br>
I don’t think he saw me, but he passed close enough that I could call out, “Mr. Vanich.”<br>
<br>
He turned, quick as a cat, and spotted me then. I hadn’t been mistaken—it was the quiet man with the improbably forgettable face and voice. “Good evening, Mr. Carr.”<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You look like you need a seat.” I motioned to the one facing mine.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'> </span></div>
<br>
“Here by yourself?” When I nodded: “Then please, and thank you.” He settled onto the chair; the waitress came over, took his drink order, headed off into the crowd.<br>
<br>
We chatted for a little while about little things, what I’d seen in Toledo and so on, and then I decided to take a calculated risk. “If you don’t mind my asking, what do you do in government?”<br>
“I work for the state department.” He sipped his drink. “Foreign technology assessment—thus I tend to come along when somebody from State or the President’s staff meets a foreign dignitary, since I know what technologies they’re used to using and can translate, so to speak.”<br>
<br>
I gave him a surprised look. “If I’d placed a bet, I’d have lost it. I had you pegged as intelligence.”<br>
<br>
He laughed. “Good, Mr. Carr. Very good. You’re not the only one who’s come to that conclusion, but—” He shrugged. “I look far too much like a spy to make a competent one.”<br>
<br>
I nodded after a moment. “Foreign technology assessment. That’s got to be an interesting gig—tracking the capabilities that other countries have that yours doesn’t.”<br>
<br>
“True.” He sipped his drink—something brown called an Old Fashioned. “But that’s only part of my job. The other part, which is far and away the larger one, is tracking the vulnerabilities they have that we don’t.”<br>
<br>
And there I was, face to face with Berger’s wretched paradox again. I must have looked completely blank for a moment, because Vanich went on. “Almost always nowadays, Mr. Carr, when a country adopts the latest technology, the costs outweigh the benefits—but the costs aren’t necessarily obvious. In many cases they’re not public knowledge at all. One of my main jobs is figuring out what the costs are, where they’re likely to show up, and how heavily they’re likely to strain political, economic, and military institutions.”<br>
<br>
I covered my confusion with another swallow of martini. “Okay,” I said. “But I’m not sure I’d agree with your claim that the costs always outweigh the benefits—” <br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Almost always,” he noted with a bland smile<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<br>
“Okay, almost always. That still seems kind of extreme.”<br>
<br>
“Not at all, Mr. Carr. You’re familiar with the law of diminishing returns, I imagine.”<br>
<br>
“Of course.”<br>
<br>
“That applies to technology as much as it does to anything else.”<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Granted, it applies to individual technologies—” I started, and then saw his look. It was the classic Lakeland you-don’t-get-it look I’d seen so many times before<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<br>
“Not just to individual technologies,” he said. “To technology as a whole, just as it applies to every other human activity.” He indicated my drink. “One martini is a very good thing. Three or four? Still good, but with certain drawbacks. Ten? You’re kissing lampposts and walking on your knees. Twenty? You’re in the hospital, or worse. We agree on that—but to claim that technology is exempt from the law of diminishing returns, it’s as though you insisted that when you’ve already had four martinis, you can have four Manhattans, and then four scotch and sodas, and then four Old Fashioneds, and then four gin and tonics, and you’ll be just fine.”<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I literally couldn’t think of anything to say. A moment later, the band spared me the necessity of coming up with a response, launching into a good lively performance of “All That Meat and No Potatoes.” The waitress came around, and I ordered a third martini and tried, with some success, to lose myself in the music. When that set was over, I changed the subject, and we chatted about something I honestly don’t remember in the least; by the time the third and final set was over, I’d remembered that I’d planned to go to the Atheist Assembly the next morning, said my goodbyes, paid my bill, and headed out onto the street to catch a cab back to the hotel<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
While I waited, Vanich’s words circled in my head: Technology, as a whole, subject to the law of diminishing returns. That couldn’t possibly be true<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<br>
Could it? </div>

The main character of the second book, and in some ways the most important character of the series, is Owen's housemate Jenny Parrish, the English major with the mop of mouse-colored hair; she has, ahem, family in Kingsport, and it just so happens that they're getting ready to celebrate a certain ancient festival...<br><br><a href=#c6854983674440282882 title="comment permalink">6/15/16, 5:22 PM</a><br><br>

For a culture that is fitted to its circumstances, hand in a glove, there isn't much reason for adaptation. Should their preferred circumstances endure they could happily stay the same like a Cretaceous crocodile. But, of course in practice there is generally some degree of wiggle room, or tight spots and such. This is potential for advantageous adaption.<br><br>For a new technology to be beneficial, I think that that is predicated on such ill fittedness. Which could result from at least three situations that come to mind: changing circumstances, changing culture, or jump to different circumstances. These blur into each other in practice.<br><br>For example, the oxidization of the worlds fossilized carbon. Once fossil fuels found a way to 'follow their bliss' I suspect that humans were in a swift stream toward industrialization. Our freedom of will was in play but contending with a strange and powerful change, the circumstances morphed by a fundamental energy imbalance. In this event, a radical chance in circumstance, a radical change in the rules of the game (akin to a piece that can move like a knight or a queen being added to chess) throw delicate balances in politics, culture, and economics wobbled far outside of historic values.<br><br>Here is a perfect place for technology. With such large gaps between traditional ways and the changed balances of technology there was a niche for new technology. Into this niche the industrial revolution flowed.<br><br>Complexity is costly. The vast complexity which our culture managed to finance testifies to how great a change the fossil carbon represented. If energy were as cheap as it once seemed then it could be argued that there would be still much room for progress. With original effects of the fossil carbon oxidization diminishing or reversing I think that that trajectory of progress is playing itself out.<br><br><a href=#c3683949393604215200 title="comment permalink">6/15/16, 5:57 PM</a><br><br>

I started pondering that, and it turns out that it comes to me as an extremely complicated and fraught subject matter--despite the fact that, in many ways, I have evaluated this exact concept in a wide variety of personal choices. (I've thought about this quite a bit in the realm of farming and gardening over the previous seven years, when I started out on my first farming internship.)<br><br>I'll have to think on this question for awhile and look at some of the technologies in my life that I haven't otherwise considered at any real depth.<br><br>Also, I hope you don't mind, but I want to take a moment to thank the readers over the last few weeks who have said kind things about the first issue of <a href=http://intotheruins.com/ rel=nofollow>Into the Ruins</a> here in the comments.

You can spend your entire life in corporate boardrooms and one thing I can promise you you’ll never hear is someone asking, “But is it actually better?” </i><br><br>I work (unfortunately) in IT, and I know that many developers don't necessarily think in this way. Many programmers who are working on new software for example do indeed imagine that they are working on something that will be 'better'. A programmer colleague, for example, is interested in virtual reality, and is working on such a project in his free time. I would say he's motivated equally by profit potential as he is by sheer interest in the technology, and I would imagine this is true for some of those in corporate boardrooms as well, who are often former IT people (Google comes to mind). A lot of Silicon Valley companies are indeed motivated by a desire to 'make the world a better place' (indeed, that very quote is often spoofed by a recent satirical television show about Silicon Valley). <br><br>Incidentally - my colleague suggested that I get into virtual reality as well, and I refused. I'm trying to get away from my involvement in tech, not deeper into it.<br><br>Second point / question:<br><br>You wrote: <i>The playlist was mostly familiar jazz standards, with a couple of pieces I didn’t recognize—if they were new, though, they’d been composed by someone who knew all the nuances of classic jazz, and was more interested in crafting a good tune than in trying to be original. </i><br><br>I'm a hobbyist composer, and I've been wondering quite a bit about 'new' art created in an era of decline. So if the pieces that Carr didn't recognize were indeed new, then it looks like artists aren't really creating anything new, or rather, not new for the sake of it. Rather, they are consolidating traditions begun in the past and working within them. Essentially an artistic version of the mindset you wrote about in the Burke post - find out what actually works, and only make changes based on that!<br><br><a href=#c7565550866405301577 title="comment permalink">6/15/16, 9:52 PM</a><br><br>

Give it fifty years for Lakeland tinkerers to come up with renewable substitutes, though, and I suspect they'll be more common. <br><br>Ben, a war novel set in post-US North America would be interesting, but I probably won't write it -- that takes different interests and literary skill sets than I have.

If we had reached a steady state in population before we discovered fossil fuels, we probably could have gone on to colonize the galaxy with all that energy. Instead, we used it to add about 6 billion people to the population and then used it to leverage about a quarter of all the planet's biomass for human consumption. After we discover infinite energy we will need to promptly discover another 8-16 earths to give us time to learn how to reach a steady state.

I'm loving the Retrotopia series, and find myself waiting impatiently for each new instalment.<br><br>Reading Retrotopia has inspired me to re-read "The Breakdown of Nations" by Leopold Kohr. I'd be surprised, JMG, if you haven't read the book yourself, or at least heard of him - E.F. Schumacher cited him as a major influence in his work.<br><br>Kohr's main thesis is that the primary cause of all forms of social, political, and economic misery is "bigness": if something isn't working any more, chances are it's gotten too big (a variation on the law of diminishing returns, I suppose). The cure is to make things small: to split up the overgrown nation-states, corporations, and other organizations that tend to dominate our modern world. A world of small states won't make everything sweetness and light - there will still be poverty, wars, tyranny, etc. On a national or international scale such things are overwhelming for governments, let alone to the average citizen - but on a small scale they are more comprehensible and manageable.<br><br>One example Kohr cites is that of Germany. As a great power and led by Hitler, Germany's aggression in WWII almost destroyed Western civilization. But if Germany was still broken up into small states, Hitler would at best have taken over Bavaria, and led an otherwise harmless little comic-opera dictatorship until he died or was overthrown.<br><br>Another example is Europe. If Kohr was alive today he would take one look at the European Union and declare that it will never work. The interests of the large member states would dominate (as they do), and eventually either prompt the growth of an even more powerful central bureaucracy to control them (as is happening in Brussels), or with their competing interests destroy the union (as is indeed happening with Brexit). Only by breaking up the large states into their constituent small entities (Wales, Brittany, Normandy, Bavaria, Tuscany, Castile, Gascony, Rhineland, etc., etc.), and allowing them the maximum possible autonomy within a larger federation would it work in the long run.<br><br>Kohr cites a number of other historical examples to illustrate his arguments. His book also has maps to illustrate both successful and unsuccessful state systems or federations.<br><br>Bringing this comment back to Retrotopia, it appears that the Lakeland Republic is keeping things small and manageable, has decentralized almost to the county level, and has instituted the Tier 1-5 system and allowed each region to set its own levels of technology and, by implication, culture. Government and bureaucracy remain small because, as Kohr himself writes, "the only way to reduce the size of government is by reducing the size of the unit to be governed". Problems will arise at the local levels, and more often than not will be solved locally. Beneficial concepts will spread to different regions, and will be adopted where they are appropriate or ignored where they are not. A thousand flowers will bloom.<br><br>Anyways, JMG, I hope you and your other readers find this useful. I'm looking forward to the next chapter!<br><br><a href=#c7230416708003945822 title="comment permalink">6/15/16, 11:26 PM</a><br><br>

The difficult part of brewing, which is the temperature control of the different stages of cooking the malt, has been done for centuries without even thermometers, just knowing empirically the right amount of boiling water to add to the batch. Of course, with a thermometer, things get easier. And I don't think that cooking thermometers will disappear that fast.<br><br>One can get a very good foam without artificial carbonation. To my mind, it is even better for reasons I won't discuss here. Check the micro-breweries around and you'll see.<br><br>And of course low fermentation and temperature controlled fermentations can be achieved with cellars, as our esteemed Archdruid points out. It seems right to say though that the brewing process in a desindustrial age will have to get again in touch with the Seasonal realities... But I am far from thinking that this would hurt the quality of the beer.<br><br>And finally.... "fizzy ice old draft served on CO2" will probably stay a delicacy for the very rich for some time, just because it will be hard to get. Which is fine to me, since to my taste it was never one to start with. I'd get a good dark porter at my cellar temperature, or a good deep blonde chilled in my well instead of such a delicacy (especially if the beer name has "Lite" in it) without a second thought.<br><br>I might be worried at times about the survival of non-linear algebra and general relativity, but never for good mead, beer or wine.

It compared drilling costs from 1990 to the current costs, and what benefit accrued from these new technologies. I spent 6 months on this project, researching nearly every technology and drilling adjunct used in normal offshore operations.<br><br>The upshot was that in 1990, it took fewer people, less equipment, less capital and lower technology than today. The net result of the technology and practices was to provide management a 'comfort level' regarding innate risk factors. In 1990, it took 30 days to move in a rig and drill a well, with concomitant costs. In 2006, it took 45 days at a higher cost (25% higher) to perform essentially the same operations, using real-time data and digital systems. The failure rate (number of dry wells drilled) was improved by 10%.<br><br>Many of the additional expenses were mandated by government bureaucrats (in the name of safety, status monitoring and such), but the change to digital from analog brought out an entire herd of associated costs for both operators and drilling contractors - with little tangible benefit. The 'perceived' benefits were well documented - but never seemed to measure up to their touted economic advantage. It still cost more to drill with the new digital technology, even using inflation adjusted dollars, with only marginal amount of risk averted.<br><br><br>My dryer went out recently. Analog dryers are simple to fix - the thermostat or the heating element or the blower motor - not much else. My current dryer has a digital logic board, safety sensors and many more parts. The function of these new digital replacements is fuzzy to me at best in a device designed to dry damp clothing. The effect of it was to remove my ability to troubleshoot and fix the dryer, and instead call a repair guy, spend more money than with fixing an analog device, and to incur a week of waiting time for digital parts. Still looking for the technology upgrade benefit.<br><br>Luddite? Well, in some cases I am, because it make much more economic sense. And from a social perspective, a slower operating speed means less heat - slowing life down allows for us to enjoy it in a daily, personal way - rather than view it as video clips.<br><br>Just some thoughts after reading this installment...<br><br><a href=#c2669580676614834621 title="comment permalink">6/16/16, 6:04 AM</a><br><br>

The idea of conscious "regression" to a "lower" (perhaps "previous" is a less value-laden term) level of technologies is one that I am very interested in pursuing. Right now, I am quite fortunate to have a secure (relatively speaking) job with a municipal utility, a good paycheck, and a home in a smaller town with a lower cost of living. My wife and I keep our lifestyle modest and live well within our means. Most of our excess income goes toward structural investments in the house/homestead, building a reasonable rainy-day fund, projects and causes we value, and getting the (small) mortgage paid off. (On resource usage, we are hovering around 220 kWh/mo and 2000 gal/mo -- good, but I'm working on further reductions.) It is a step-wise process for us.<br><br>The decentralization inherent in the LR strategy (the county-level tier system) is a valuable concept and one which I wish our society would consider more carefully. It seems that everything we are doing is moving in the other direction, with more centralization of control and direction. A recent story on the impending Brexit vote<br><br>http://www.resilience.org/stories/2016-06-16/why-global-capital-fears-brexit<br><br>raises a number of points which I find relevant to our situation on this side of the Pond. Specifically, the sections speaking to localization, if re-framed from a EU-to-national scope in Europe to a federal-to-state scope here in the US, parallel well in my opinion. In essence, I am coming around to the idea that the US needs to decentralize in order to survive, though perhaps many would see anything other than our current level of federalization as wholesale collapse. (I've been accused of seeking a return to the Articles of Confederation, which were "an obvious failure.") My view is the the resurgence of regional differences (no longer papered over as well by the dwindling benefits of empire) are going to lead to some form of rearrangement anyway. Better a controlled change than an uncontrolled one forced upon us by crisis.<br><br><a href=#c2927542501659815918 title="comment permalink">6/16/16, 7:17 AM</a><br><br>

You create like 50ish randomish variants of a program, and see how well they do on a task. The better a variant does correlates to the likelyhood of its 'genes' being inherited by the next generation. It's basically simulated evolution.<br><br>The prisoners' dilemma is a game theory scenario. Two people are suspected of committing a crime, but are taken in for a lesser charge, for which there is ample evidence. Both are taken to rooms and offered a deal,- turn the other suspect in and go free while the other spends three years in prison, or spend a year in prison themself for the lesser crime.<br><br>This is all from a book on genetic programming, by Melanie Mitchell, btw...<br><br>Long story short, a programming competition was held. Each round consisted of three hypothetical imprisonments against another program, with the fewest total years served at the end of the competition deciding the winner.<br><br>A program called 'tit-for-tat' won. It would not 'rat out' the other prisoner on the first round, and in the next two rounds would tit-for-tat do whatever its frenemy did the previous round.<br><br>This is where genetic programming gets interesting.

However, what is fascinating is that if you train the same genetic algorithm with a small set of opponents, it does substantially better than tit-for-tat,- even if tit-for-tat is one of the opponents.

Now every radio interview I've heard that is via Skype sounds crappy, and every call I've gotten via Skype got dropped somewhere during the call. And the internet connection is sometimes down.

Yes it may sound like higher tech and thus against the concept we're discussing here, but consider these points, which I think add up to making the MP3 files "appropriate tech" - and that's why I think this comment is "on topic":<br><br>* First, whatever you do, convert those cassettes soon, since they self-destruct over time. Also, keep both cassettes and CDs out of direct sunlight, the UV destroys them over time.<br><br>* Conversion to a digital format (whether audio CD or MP3 files etc) has the advantage that it can later be copied, with no further loss of audio quality, onto any new type of digital storage medium as technology changes. And back to analog as needed.<br><br>* You can also convert MP3 files to audio CDs to play in your car device, although I prefer playing the files using a smartphone plugged into the car's AUX input (or an FM modulator) - an old smartphone (that would otherwise be discarded) can be bought for next to nothing, and does not need a "service plan" for this use.<br><br>* CDs of the kind you "burn" yourself only last a decade or so, if stored well. So you'll need to copy them over again later anyway. If you keep them in the car (where it is often rather hot) they'll last even fewer years, so make copies for the car, don't use the 'master' discs.<br><br>* You can store MP3 files on a data CD, and some CD players (including those in some cars) can play those. They too will need copying after some years. But the music you can store on one such disc would take a dozen audio discs, meaning more work, expense, resource use, and storage space.<br><br><br><a href=#c7560584304106223378 title="comment permalink">6/16/16, 9:41 AM</a><br><br>

It did improve, and the character interactions were sometimes quietly funny even when there wasn't much actually happening.<br><br>The concentration on the english gentry, and more specifically, the women of same, meant that the main character and her sisters weren't actually doing very much. There was a lot of partying, gossip and the like, and not much doing useful things. They had servants for that.

The reason it was popular was its reputation for being one of the easiest courses in the catalog. I never took it, because it was obvious even to me then that any nontrivial form of technology assessment must actually be an extremely complex undertaking and no easy course on it could be worthwhile. But now I wish I had at least listened in; I might have a clearer idea of how the current generation of business leaders were trained to do it wrong.<br><br>Calculating the costs or the benefits of any technology in terms that can be compared with one another or with other technologies seems intractably complex. Sometimes a relatively close comparison can be intuitively clear (to some at least) , such as the uncompetitiveness of supersonic jet airlines for business travel. We can surmise that, in an age of limits, the same net-negative economic value will eventually apply to passenger air travel in general when all the costs are accounted for. Maybe it already does. But railroads, for example, are harder to figure.<br> <br>Thoreau's observation that the time saved by riding a train doesn't compensate for the time needed to earn the cost of the ticket does not appear to hold true, today, where I am. But is that only because I'm being overpaid for my own work, and/or because my ticket isn't paying the true price of the ride? In the latter case, I'm likely bearing those externalized costs whether I ride or walk, so it can be an economically rational decision for me to ride even if it's not economically rational to operate the railroad in the first place, or to build it if it didn't already exist. That's a hysteresis of sorts; aka an overshoot.<br><br>In my next Space Bats story (in progress), I address the "no collapse" part of the challenge by exploring the idea of "plateau" technologies, which are technologies whose net benefits relative to their complexity, infrastructure requirements, and material costs are sufficient for them to persist (or to be re-introduced, re-developed, or acquired by trade if locally lost) despite other less or more complex means of doing the same things being known and hypothetically achievable. Kiln-fired ceramics is likely one example. Having already been around a long time is one likely hallmark of plateau technologies, but not necessarily a requirement (nor a guarantee; cuneiform was in use a lot longer than any form of book has been so far, but printed books are the more likely candidate for a plateau information storage technology). Another hallmark is that the present industrial implementation of the technology still uses the same basic processes, albeit in multiplied/automated/scaled-up versions.<br><br>I have my own guesses, but I don't think we're in possession of any "Tech Assmt" methods that can tell us with any certainty whether, for instance, any form of motorized transport, any form of long-distance telecommunications, electric lighting, aircraft, computers, waterworks, firearms, photography, or even artificial satellites are or are not plateau technologies. Comparing steel knives with printed books suggests diminishing returns on technology in general doesn't mean all technologies reach those diminishing returns in the same historical year.<br><br>So, poor Carr will rack his brain searching for definitive refutation of Vanich's point, to no avail. Having failed to find any simple disproof, he might consider looking for simple positive proof of it instead, and he might find that too is hard to come by. It's easy to see which hypothesis is more likely, though. Welcome to uncertainty.<br><br><a href=#c4248056583760766708 title="comment permalink">6/16/16, 11:56 AM</a><br><br>

Not so. Powerful southern Nigerian politicians have interests in Chad oil, and wish the theft to continue. This is where Boko Haram comes in.<br><br>Some years ago there was an election and northern Nigerian politicians formed private armies to contest it.

Thanks for taking the time to continue with this narrative.<br><br>I assume that Mr Carr is going through his own form of a "Peak Technology" initiation ceremony? It is nice that he has many useful, willing and helpful guides to assist him along with that path. One thing that I've noticed with Mr Carr's interactions with his guides is that he tends to view them through a combative lens and he always tends to believe that because they challenge his core assumptions about how the world works, that they rather than he, must somehow be wrong - and it is almost as if they are out to get him. I can almost feel the defensive stance that he is taking time and time again in his dialogue. I see a lot of that in the real world... And that is very unfortunate too. <br><br>As a general observation, he also displays the current social policy that people appear to be rather ungracious in their interactions with other people. I've long suspected that such policies have arisen out of the sort of monetary economy that we live in, where if an interaction doesn't have a dollar value, it is not worth anything, as well as the thoughtless habits of modern communication techniques. I've noticed recently that text messages are more likely to be used nowadays, rather than voice messages, and the vast majority of those miss out on many social niceties. Conan had something to say on that matter...<br><br>Hey, I reckon that diminishing returns is an expression of entropy. And that entropy is an expression of the second law of thermodynamics. I recall you writing about that many years ago and honestly a lot of it went over my head, but I grasped the general concept - which appeared to be entropy will always win and I guess that is how the Universe is. Dunno, that one is complex.<br><br>Thanks again for continuing this enjoyable narrative!

Blasphemer! ;-)<br><br>Trippticket, good! That kind of bit-at-a-time downshifting is a very useful way to get out of the progress racket. I'm not sure how soon <i>Retrotopia</i> will be out in book form, but it's got either five or six episodes left to round out the story, and I plan on getting it to the publisher immediately thereafter. I'll check with him about the probable timeframe, and keep everyone posted. <br><br>Zach, or the term "intelligence" has become a little more specific by 2065...<br><br>Ed, of course we could go with different technologies -- that's one of the reasons I had the young couple with the maser in an earlier episode. The point of the retro theme in this narrative is to point out how much of our present experience is defined by crapification in the name of progress, and to point out that going back to older technologies that cost less and work better, blasphemously heretical as that idea is, remains a viable option. <br><br>David, the next time somebody tells you you're in favor of the Articles of Confederation, you might consider saying, "No, I'm in favor of the Constitution," and show them the tenth amendment. As written, the Constitution defines the US as a federation of states which delegate only a very narrow range of powers to the national government.

Yes, that's one way to think about it. In any society, each new technology that's introduced will bring certain benefits and impose certain costs. These latter include resource costs, which become more difficult to pay as the number of technologies competing for resources goes up, and complexity costs, which rise as the number and pervasiveness of technologies increase. Meanwhile the increment of benefit you get from each new technology tends to decrease, because low-hanging fruit (that is to say, technologies with high benefits and low costs) tend to be developed first. Thus you get to a point of diminishing returns, where each new increment of technology costs more and provides fewer benefits than the one before it; then you get to a point of zero incremental returns, where benefits and costs cancel each other out; and finally you get the point of negative returns, at which each new increment of technology makes things worse. We're well into that latter territory today. <br><br>Bob, Robbins' metaphor is a good one, but debt is again only one part of the picture. Ask people why they support growth and progress and you'll find that most of them have simply bought into the belief that growth is good because it's good and progress must progress because, well, it's progress. <br><br>Myriad, what that suggests to me is that a historical rather than a theoretical approach might be in order. Instead of asking "what characteristics should identify a plateau technology," that is, why not study a whole series of plateau technologies in contrast with non-plateau technologies, and see if there are certain telltale features that distinguish the two classes? <br><br>Sylvia, thank you! I know the feeling; now and then I go through the shelves, put together a stack of books I know I'm not actually going to get to, and sell them at a used book store so that someone else can have the fun of finding them.<br><br>Eric, funny! No, I enjoy the occasional martini -- a vodka martini, relatively dry, with a twist is my fave -- but most of the time I write without the assistance of steaks or mixed drinks. <br><br>Larry, glad to hear it. <br><br>Jdmeth, de gustibus non disputandum est, and all that. What on earth did you drink that tasted that bad, though? Introducing a novice to alcohol should be done gently, using things that taste good to the inexperienced tongue. <br><br>Martin, oil gets stolen all the time in today's world. I had in mind some of the hijinks in the Middle East, but yours is as good an example as any. <br><br>Greg, yes, but I'd suggest -- for reasons mentioned in responding to an earlier commenter -- that it's also true that the project of technological progress is subject to the law of diminishing returns, for reasons not limited to the growth of complexity costs. There are plenty of things that can't be reduced to an equation that are still important realities!<br><br>Cacaogecko, yep. The spread of such techniques is one of the things that gives me hope for the far future.<br><br><a href=#c6362722202328792621 title="comment permalink">6/16/16, 7:13 PM</a><br><br>

He argues that the companies 'knowingly permitted' them to recruit members, raise money and spread propaganda using their web applications. He also 'alleges' that YouTube - and by extension Google, who owns the brand - was giving money to terrorists, by means of sharing revenue from the advertisments added to the published videos.<br><br>The companies of course argue that the accusations are 'without merit', that their terms of use prohibit terrorist recruitment, that they have special teams which search for such potentially dangerous uses and report their findings to the authorities etc. and in any case they <i>cannot be held responsible for the content that the users publish</i>.<br><br>The companies do not dispute the claim that their applications were used as a communication platform by terrorist organisations. But as I see it, the case is not about terrorism: it implicitly acknowledges that there are negative consequences of social media, and seeks to determine who will be burdened with dealing with them.<br><br>MigrantWorker<br><br><a href=#c4241571011503698044 title="comment permalink">6/17/16, 3:13 AM</a><br><br>

I hope no-one will be offended if I recap the law of thermodynamics here. It states that any energy transformation, from one form to an other, means transforming at least part of it in the form of heat.<br><br>It also states that to extract work (i.e. transformations) from heat, one needs to have this heat flow from a hot source to a cold source. If the cold source is "infinite", the process can last for as long as the hot source lasts. <br> <br>The pure beauty of it is that you don't need to know any details about the process at work. Friction is the usual suspect here, since friction is just a lingo meant to say in fewer words "all those complicated little processes that happen to go against what I want to do, and heat the system instead". And while those processes are never easy to describe, because they involve many many interactions of many of the minute parts of the system one is considering, their effect can be summarized on large scales as the second law of thermodynamics.<br><br>Regardless, the second law of thermodynamics in itself doesn't imply diminishing returns.<br><br>The law of diminishing returns needs something more than the three laws of thermodynamics: it needs to take into account that the cold source, and the hot source, are finite. Note that for many thermodynamic applications, this is *not* the case: to study an engine, one usually assumes an infinite amount of heat (i.e. of oil) and an infinite amount of cold (i.e. the atmosphere never changes its temperature). This is a very useful approximation to understand one engine. But not a useful one to understand how a finite system will evolve. <br><br>I have been daydreaming of writing things like that for my kids, "Useful Thermodynamics: a field guide", or something like that... But for some reason it keeps floating in my long lists of "things I'd like to do". But several times I have had the feeling that this blog and the comments here might, one day, bring a spark that will...<br><br>Well, we shall see<br>Those were my two cents (of Euro, while it exists)<br>Seb <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c8392908058448617084 title="comment permalink">6/17/16, 4:54 AM</a><br><br>

He wrote in a very unusual style so as to avoid getting bogged down in the details. A very clever strategy too, which I am able to comprehend but totally unable to replicate using his language (that pretty much answers your homework from two weeks back!). It almost appears to me to read as a form of poetry. But then, perhaps that is a flight of fancy on my part? Dunno. Certainly you could use that mode of thinking and writing to adequately discuss and explain how a complete ecosystem looks when observed from a distance and on high, whilst still addressing many of the complexities of the ecosystem. Mind you, to do so would mean being slammed dunked by Universities and “peers”. Oh, it would be brutal.<br><br>Sorry, I digress. Chapter 7 which discusses Friction is quite a quick read, but it is very deep. It captured the essence of the difficulties I recently had explaining how the performance of the solar power system here cannot be assessed by the potential of the components, but rather how they functioned together, as well as the individual components, in real world conditions. I sometimes suspect that we have been trained from a very early age to break concepts down into ever smaller and more manageable components. That can be a very useful tool, but there are those pesky diminishing returns again... Incidentally, I reckon the second law actually describes the Universes theme music or rather: anthem!!! One of the problems with breaking problems down into ever smaller chunks is that at some point we lose the ability to consider the whole and that is what George Orwell was writing to with the novel 1984.<br><br>Getting back to the concept of friction. The parallels are fascinating. One interesting quote was: "Activity in war is movement in a resistant medium". What a fascinating insight and what I gather he is suggesting is that the goals that you set out and attempt to achieve will inevitably meet resistance (which can apply to any field) which he then goes on to explain can only ever be met (an interesting admission in and of itself - he uses the word mediocre no less) through real world experience. He made some rather interesting remarks about those that rely heavily on theory!<br><br>I believe he also slipped in the thought that one should not let the perfect stand in the way of the good merely because of (his concept of) friction. His time with the Russians is on display there.<br><br>And it was nice that he ended the chapter by discussing tact. The interesting thing was that I do not believe he used that word as we use it today. Instead it was used more as a sort of combination of good judgement and necessary understanding of the consequences of a person’s actions. Whilst, did I also detect an undercurrent of a solid grounding in Stoicism?<br><br>It was nice that he wrote his Modus Operandi in an incremental fashion over a number of years and that it also grew and changed as he did.<br><br>It was rather unfortunate for him that he was completely unaware of germ theory...<br><br>I reckon brooding upon the matter is certainly worth a few brain cells, as he has some very interesting things to say - especially in relation to that particular concept which was the one that stood out the most to me of all of them.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c4519313889285150058 title="comment permalink">6/17/16, 5:03 AM</a><br><br>

The polls show leave ahead and I have a feeling from what I’ve heard on the ground, that the majority for leave could be higher than that indicated in latest polls. I could of course be completely wrong about this. I haven’t got a good word to say about the leave politicians, they’re a pretty nasty bunch, but the remain team have been beyond abysmal. I know they had project fear in the Scottish referendum, but this seems to be project fear on steroids with a tanker load of rocket fuel added for good measure. We’ve been told we that our economy would go down the drain, we would have war and that our pensions and NHS would be cut if we vote leave. They seem to be threatening us and people don’t like that kind of thing. I haven't heard a single positive thing about the EU from the remain camp, which makes me wonder if there is any good reason for staying. It was funny when Barack Obomber, sorry I mean Obama came here and threatened to put us at the back of the queue for a trade deal if we left. That means we will be back of the queue for TTIP, which is the best reason I’ve heard for getting the hell out of the EU. Every neoliberal sociopath in the western elite seems to be wetting themselves about this votes. I think they’re going to need some pretty good incontinence pads come next Friday. This could spell the end of the EU.<br><br>Speaking personally, I want to get out of the EU, because it is fundamentally undemocratic. Friends tell me that they will vote remain, because if we leave, we will be ruled by the tories who are worse than the EU. I agree with them. However I will vote leave because I prefer to have a government I can kick out, to a bunch of Brussel bureaucrats I can do nothing about. You might call this the removal van test of democracy and for all its faults, democracy in this country still passes that test. Having a functioning democracy will be essential if we are to survive the next 50 to a 100 years with some kind of social stability. I am not saying it will work, because we are going to be in for a hard time what with climate change, peak oil etc, but it will give us a better chance. We have a long tradition of democracy in this country which has survived two world wars and a great depression. This is important because democracy is a culture and a way of being in the world and its the way we do things in this country and we have a better chance of surviving if we stick to our traditions.<br><br>The campaign has been suspended for a few days because of the tragic murder of MP Jo Cox, but I think this is unlikely to change the vote<br><br><br><a href=#c6005485368935673040 title="comment permalink">6/17/16, 1:21 PM</a><br><br>

As for the diminishing returns on technologies, remember that every utopian narrative is about the present, and the 2065 of the story is a funhouse mirror through which to see right now.

They don't break things down - they memorize entire things. While I was trying to learn music and dance the way we do in America, by learning the basic building blocks and the rules for assembling them (chords, arpeggios, tendus, pliés) they were teaching songs and dances. I simply couldn't follow them. My brain had to identify constituent parts, categorize them, and make up rules for their sequencing into larger entities. Otherwise I was in a hazy fog with nothing to grasp onto. By breaking things down, I could do things Indonesians could not like Western improvisation or shifting back and forth into other national styles. But Indonesians could memorize and internalize much larger concepts than I possibly could. Artists who had learned a 12-minute piece twenty years ago in school and never performed it since would hear the introduction played on the reyong or bonang and begin playing or dancing it flawlessly from memory. It was quite surreal.<br><br>Eventually I did become better able to let go and just learn by turning off some familiar part of my brain. It was strange because I could not force it at will. It was more like going through the preparatory rituals as a meditation to enter a mild trance state. If done properly, I was still in the hazy fog but whatever came next was always there to grasp onto. If done improperly, I was just trying to think my way through something impossibly complex. If done too well, I would slip into full trance and have no memory of the class or performance at all.

Interesting. You know, I reckon the quantitative scale extrapolates his concept pretty nicely. I'm really at a bit of a loss about how to further expand the concept without getting bogged down into details, so I might give you an idea about how I deal with complex systems here such as the solar power system.<br><br>The solar power system is an inherently complex system because it contains many separate components and has to work under all conditions. By working, I refer to the concept of meeting an arbitrary goal under all conditions. War is a lot like that because the sheer scale of variables which you may or may not control (not controlling is the usual mode by the way) makes for an inherently complex system. I then work backwards from my arbitrary goal (and other people may have differing goals given the exact same circumstances, equipment and situation) and then either: adjust the existing components in the system; add additional components; and/or adjust my own expectations to suit the prevailing conditions. And then the system - which is inherently complex - has to be observed and if the performance drops below the arbitrary goal, then I have to revisit the various choices that I have available to me at that point in time.<br><br>And that is pretty much the decision making process I use to assess most projects here in the real world.<br><br>The thing that I take from that process and the concept of friction is that goals are both arbitrary and that a certain amount of feedback is built into the observation and experience side of the equation. It also does not end up in a binary choice for the observer and so it is more useful for complex systems.<br><br>As I wrote before I was having troubles explaining this without getting bogged down into details.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c4023162870867739150 title="comment permalink">6/18/16, 5:30 AM</a><br><br>

This is probably the most important vote of my life, so it has absorbed my attention<br><br>I wouldn’t be at all surprised if the EU/USA tried to damage the UK economy if we left in order to punish us. However the thought of that makes me more keen to get the hell out of the EU. If I thought that the EU was a voluntary club that we could leave if we wanted to, then I would feel differently about it. It does suit the US empire to have us in the EU and I don’t think that the leave politicians want us to leave the US empire, they still want to be members of NATO etc. After all being in the US empire does reduce our defence costs etc. If the US is sensible, then they will accept that we want more independence and not try to stop us. After all it is better to have willing subjects than unwilling subjects. If Britain had adopted that principle in 1776, you lot over there might still have our Queen on your bank notes. This is a piece of psychology that the remain campaign have forgotten. If you use threats and fear, then people will be unwilling to do what you want them to do. This tactic may work if you’re Hitler or Stalin, but it does not work in a democracy. It reminds me of this man I heard on a radio phone in responding to Obama’s threat to put us at the back of the queue for a trade deal. He said something along the lines of<br><br>“Britain was first the queue when it came to invading Afghanistan, Britain was first in the queue when it came to invading Iraq; if that’s Obama’s attitude, then I’m voting out”.<br><br>I think my reaction is also shaped by our history. We are one of the few countries in Europe that has not been occupied, had a civil war or a dictatorship in the last century, therefore I am not particularly overawed by the EU. If I was Greek and lived in a country that suffered occupation, followed by civil war and the Colonels dictatorship, then I might have looked on the EU as the guarantor of democracy in my country and my attitude might be different. This may explain why the Greeks are conflicted and have not just put two fingers up to Brussels and left.<br><br>The other interesting question is what parliament will do if we vote for Brexit. The majority of MP’s in parliament support remain and the referendum is only advisory and has no power in law. Therefore parliament could decide to vote against leaving the EU. I think that this is more likely to happen if the majority for leave is small. However if they do this, then I think we could be heading for a constitutional crisis, especially if the majority for leave is large. Could be interesting.<br><br>The remain side overlook the fact that the EU is going collapse anyway, the Euro crisis which has plunged southern Europe into poverty makes it unsustainable. The only question is when it will happen and whether that collapse will be peaceful or come about as a result of war. If the EU let the crisis deepen for another 10 years, then the chances are that collapse will come about as a result of war. We have already seen fascists parties like the National front and Golden Dawn increasing in popularity. As some politician once said <br><br>“The first thing you should do if you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging”<br><br>By the way I saw some remain poster that said that Britons aren’t quitters. I am sure that the passengers getting on board the life boats as the Titanic started listing were called quitters.<br><br><br><a href=#c109392288101266571 title="comment permalink">6/18/16, 5:49 AM</a><br><br>

They say that folks who suffer from addiction issues, at root, drink, smoke crack, shoot heroin, pop oxy, smoke cigarettes, because they like the way it makes them feel. Of course, there are certain biochemical issues. Smoking or chewing tobacco literally changes your brain. The noggin, unable to make what to do with nicotine, crossing the brain/blood barrier, makes a chemical receptor, a binder if you will. Now you are well and truly screwed. Because whilst the the binder is constantly produced, nic is not constantly present. Hence craving and withdrawal. The only solution IMO (whether you start with patches or not), a nasty 3 day detox (this can truly, truly suck) and then total abstinence. <br><br>I bring this up because it seems to me that tech has so embedded itself into this culture that it has created binders. Try and go without a car in many, many, neighborhoods, and you are hosed. Try and find a driving route, without GPS, you may be hosed. Maps are getting rarer and rarer. No internet access: how do we download Little Johnny's homework assignments for this week? Screwed.<br><br>So, does this culture have a "technology problem"? I think so. Must we hit "rock bottom"? Perhaps. The Lakeland Republic did, during their civil war. They came out okay, but most certainly chastened from ever taking the first high-tech drink again. <br><br>My personal experience with the diminishing returns of tech. Just yesterday, I had to replace the plugs and wires in my wife's minivan. I put if off for a few months, because I knew it would be a pain in the butt. Now, in the old days, when the standard motor was a straight 6 or a v8 with rear wheel drive, this would be a 20 min operation. But now, it is all FWD or AWD with the engine mounted "sidewinder", the engine compartment shrunk to save on weight, and all sorts of emissions stuff, and elec. do-daddery jammed in there as tightly as possible. So, the front 3 plugs. Not so bad. But the rear three, well, I had to put the van on ramps, wait for the exhaust manifold to cool, and then engage in automotive yoga and contortion. Cylinder 5 was like a one-armed downward facing dog. And it was all by touch, since I couldn't see in the tiny space. This is why I don't wear gloves while turning wrenches.<br><br>So you gain a little mileage on a FWD car and some stability in snow. But if it needs work, normal repairs (an alternator, spark plugs), become either a pain in time and effort, or a serious, serious cost if you take it to the shop. And God help you if your flat screen controller goes wonky. No A/C or radio for you without beaucoup bucks.<br><br><a href=#c3476704432263412619 title="comment permalink">6/18/16, 11:58 AM</a><br><br>

Instead of asking 'what characteristics should identify a plateau technology,' that is, why not study a whole series of plateau technologies in contrast with non-plateau technologies, and see if there are certain telltale features that distinguish the two classes?"<br><br>The problem there is circularity. To identify plateau technologies, we first identify plateau technologies and look for their common characteristics…<br><br>I know you meant something more like "to identify <i>present or recent</i> plateau technologies, we first identify <i>past historical</i> plateau technologies…" but the problem doesn't really go away. A whole host of technologies, from Arabic numerals to printed books to LEDs, are historically relatively recent, very widespread, and not yet tested by the collapse of the cultures originating or adopting them. (Indeed, that's why we're interested in the question, at least for SF purposes even if most of the eventual outcomes are irrelevant to our personal fates.) Many of them have replaced older longer-standing technologies that nonetheless had major drawbacks and/or externalized costs of their own. (Consider torches, oil lamps, candles, incandescent light bulbs…) A fair unbiased comparison between historical and present forms, for plateau status, is a challenge.<br><br>I suspect your suggestion is getting at characteristics like simplicity, resource sustainability, localizable production, longstanding use, and widespread use, all strong indications of resiliency. We start out, <i>a priori</i>, expecting that pottery, steel blades, and sailing vessels are likely candidates for plateau technologies. (At the other extreme, technologies completely dependent upon vanishing non-renewable resources cannot qualify, and frivolous embellishment like powered or Internet-connected versions of things that work perfectly well unpowered and un-Internet-connected is a strong sign that the point of diminishing returns has been passed.) However, resiliency varies separately from value. Circumstances such as displacement or war can put even the simplest and most beneficial technologies out of economic reach, right down to the most basic sanitary facilities (e.g. a hole in the ground). That's no proof that the technology itself is too complex for plateau status. A better test would be whether the technology consistently comes back into use when circumstances stabilize, but as I said this has not been tested for most of the cases we're interested in.<br><br>What I've found with such questions is that they tend to become irreducible in two different ways. The first way is that any given technology's plateau form depends on its context, including infrastructure, available resources, and usage, which depends in turn on other technologies and on the society. The second, partly as a consequence of the first, is that a meaningful assessment requires one to be an expert on, basically, everything.

I've done this again and again for other technologies, often getting into some really fascinating areas in the process, but there's never an ultimate end point. And I also have to consider the usage cases: if the advantage of the modern compound bow's more complex features is in being easier to master rather than in ultimate performance, that could still be a decisive advantage if one expected to equip a large force with the weapon (see also: crossbows), but not if it's for use by a highly trained elite force. But in either case, the whole question could be moot if the actual plateau technology for personal projectile weapons is firearms instead…<br><br>Perception rather than logical deduction wins out, of course, especially when story submission deadlines loom!<br><br><a href=#c1608232131959079237 title="comment permalink">6/18/16, 12:32 PM</a><br><br>

It seemed quite fitting that I was sighting in a 270 Winchester (designed circa 1930) built on a bolt action Paul Mauser would have recognized instantly as being copied from his 1898 design. They haven't really improved on the 270, except at the cost of a lot more powder consumption and recoil and muzzle blast. Nor has the bolt action changed much, although manufacturing tolerances are much better now, as is barrel steel. <br><br>On the other hand, on my truck the check engine light just came on. Is the 2008 model really any better than the 1990 I used to have? Not really, although the gas mileage is better, at the cost of a large increase in complexity (Secondary injection air supply solenoid?) Peak technology in cars was probably with the advent of electronic ignition. I really do not miss ignition points.

The strength of the faith in progress is precisely that it's a blind faith, wholly circular in its logic, and resting entirely on unquestioned and unstated value judgments. There are plenty of rationalizations offered by believers, especially of the "I get to claim everything good progress has done, but don't you dare mention anything bad it's done" variety; once you start trying to reason your way to faith, though, faith is drawing its last few breaths. Carr, as a surrogate for the reader, has to go through the same process of getting out from under blind faith in progress that many readers will go through, and that's why I'm modeling his reactions so closely on those I observe. <br><br>KL Cooke, nah, that's a post-apocalyptic novel of the standard "after a nuclear war" variety -- there have been truckloads of those. I'm looking for fiction set in a world in which industrial civilization declines the way other civilizations have declined, without benefit of apocalypse. <br><br>Jo, thank you for this! It's accounts like yours, of people who have ditched the dubious benefits of progress and discovered that yes, in fact, life really is more fun without the latest technotrash, that make writing this blog easy. <br><br>Cherokee, and that's a reasonable process. My thought is that there might be some kind of simple quantitative shortcut, not to replace the process but to factor into it, that would work out some kind of surrogate for estimating probable friction in advance. I'm not yet sure where to go with it -- all I have at the moment is the idea. Hmm...<br><br>Jasmine, no question, it's going to be a spectacle whatever happens. The question at this point is not whether the EU is going to collapse, but simply how and when -- but those latter points have a lot to say to how much damage is going to happen to Europe in the process. <br><br>Varun, good -- you caught that. I'm not factoring that into this particular story, because I don't want to distract from the core point -- the benefits of deliberate technological regrssion -- by bringing in other issues such as the coming of the deindustrial age. In a real 2065 of the sort I've sketched out, though, maybe half the world will no longer really be part of the global economy. <br><br>William, one of the reasons I expect to see more and more people bailing out of the current institutional arrangements in the US -- public schools, the usual kinds of employment, "health" care, etc. -- is that those have so blatantly turned into a racket meant to soak the ordinary citizen.

Lots of possibilities. <br><br>Myriad, nah, I'm thinking of looking at previous civilizations, identifying the technologies that plateaued in their historical arc, and generalizing from that basis. Any technology invented by our civilization is too recent to be sure of, but that leaves plenty of others, from clay-tablet writing and irrigation canals to windpowered ships and the city-state. No plateau is permanent, but it's not hard to find specific technologies that, once reached, remained in use in essentially the same form for a millennium or more, and that'll do.<br><br><a href=#c6688176118775026009 title="comment permalink">6/19/16, 12:32 AM</a><br><br>

No two oil wells, oil fields, or oil provinces hit peak at exactly the same moment, but if you add it all up, global production of conventional petroleum has a definite peak.

While it may not be exactly about friction, Nassim Taleb's fragile/robust/antifragile metric for risk is very simple and seems like it would apply. His point is that things are unpredictable, so instead of trying to predict effects, for example, you minimize your exposure to negative black swans, and maximize it to positive black swans. <br><br>Large things are complex and fragile, and therefore highly exposed, and not coincidentally, bound to encounter a lot more friction due to the moving parts and the reduced options. Moving 5,000 troops, with all their equipment and supplies, is high friction because it is large and complex, and there are few ways they can move, and fewer ways they can adapt if things go wrong.<br><br>Compare that to an 8-man special forces team. If they experience friction, which is less likely because they have fewer moving parts, they also have more options for adapting. Obviously these two different forces are used in different ways, but you can compare the large, centralized army to one composed of mostly-independent smaller units.<br><br>It seems like assessing a situation in the terms laid out in Antifragile would be an effective way to minimize exposure to friction and maximize optionality when you inevitably encounter it. A salaried employee with debt is fragile. Someone with a half dozen distinct monetizable skills, no debt, and a savings account is at least robust, if not antifragile depending on the skills. If both lose their job, the latter will experience considerably less friction in his life because he has lots of options and less exposure (in is case, debt). <br><br>The same kind of thinking could be applied to a new technology, or anything we call progress. If there is a small, well-understood maximum downside and a large, unknown upside, that would be antifragile, and we'd want to accumulate as many of those opportunities as possible. But if the upside is small and well-defined, while the downside is murky and potentially ruinous, that's fragile and we could avoid such exposures. This line of thinking also fits perfectly with the Burkean conservatism you wrote about a few posts prior.<br><br><a href=#c631718624450973041 title="comment permalink">6/19/16, 8:40 AM</a><br><br>

As a broad summary in chapter 7 he describes what he calls 'structural deepening' in which technologies are developed by elaborating their design, ostensibly to improve performance and overcome constraints. Over time the technologies may improve in performance but they becomes encrusted with systems and subassemblies added on to help them work properly, handle exceptions, extend their range of application and provide redundancy in event of failure (e.g. adding engine control units and emissions control technologies to gasoline engines). The additions may add complexity that becomes a burden. Eventually there comes a time when additions do not add much to performance and a novel principle is needed. But it may not arrive and even if it does it may not easily replace the established technology. The old technology is 'locked in' – because elaborations allow the mature technology to perform better than its nascent rivals, adopting a novel principle may involve changing surrounding structures and organisations (which may not be economically viable) or users may feel threatened by the novel. Arthur calls this adaptation of a locked-in established principle beyond what may be sensible 'adaptive stretch'. <br>The notion of lock-in to inappropriate technologies is found widely in the environmental literature especially in reference to our dependence on carbon-intensive technologies, and in my view goes some way to explain our failure to transition to more sustainable approaches.<br>Chris <br><br><br><a href=#c3572011936909533712 title="comment permalink">6/19/16, 2:34 PM</a><br><br>

Not to save the planet etc, but to have a bit of electrical power for essential purposes if the grid were to go down for more than a few hours. Which seems likely here on a dirt road in Vermont. Sure enough in the 8 years I've had this system there never has been such an outage, so it's been a 100% success! :-) But instead of letting the system sit idle waiting for an emergency, I try and make it do something useful, especially in the sunnier parts of the year.<br><br>So I have 4 solar panels, a total of close to 800 watts of nameplate peak power. That's about 19 kilowatt-hours (KWH) of energy per 24-hour day, about the electrical energy used by a typical American household. But that's only if the sun were to shine brightly all the time, directly perpendicular to the panels. Alas there are things such as nighttime, clouds, etc. But this is June, so you'd expect perhaps 1/4 of that, say 5 KWH per day, which is about how much my household uses in total.<br><br>Last month I finally got hold of a mechanical KWH meter like the utility used to have on the side of the house (before they moved on to so-called "smart meters" which is another example of high-tech that costs way more than its worth). So wired it into the output of my main inverter to see what I am actually getting out of solar power. This time of year I run the refrigerator and two chest freezers on it - one freezer around the clock, and the rest only when the sun shines (with automatic switch-over based on the voltage of the battery bank). This load is probably not enough to fully use up the potential solar power. But my batteries are 8 years old and getting weak, and I don't want them discharged too deeply overnight. Real-world whole-systems friction in action.<br><br>Net result: In the last month I have been getting about ONE KWH per day. About 5% of the nameplate power. The amp-hours going into the battery are more than double that, so the roundtrip efficiency (available power into batteries and back out of batteries and through inverter) is less than 50%, due to inefficiencies in the charge controller, the battery, and the inverter.<br><br>Proponents of grid-tied "net metering" will claim that I could push more energy out to the grid while the sun shines. From a whole-systems perspective, that is only true because there are others who are using air conditioning at that time, which they don't really have to. And the investment in the solar panels would have been better put into insulating those houses better, teaching them to close shades during the day and open windows at night, etc.<br><br><br><a href=#c6358682578891867893 title="comment permalink">6/19/16, 3:38 PM</a><br><br>

Rich as we are now, we can afford to provide food, clothing, transportation, and shelter for the accused awaiting trial, and then for the convicted for terms sometimes as long as the rest of their expected lifespan. They lose only their freedom, while the rest of us pay taxes for their support. But in an age where some of us die due to simple scarcity, when the best lives are still a struggle for survival from one harvest to the next, then this sort of "justice" doesn't look sustainable.<br><br>Instead, wouldn't it make more sense to have the quick, painful, and humiliating sentence of "a day in the stocks" and then get the convicted back to work? Or a week of hard labor on the treadmill, or a year on the galley? Or maybe a short spell in jail, but the only source of food and water is the friends and family outside who think you're worth supporting? Without support, a month in jail might as well be death.<br><br>Children raised in a society of scarcity will grow up to owe a tremendous debt to the adults around them, and as those adults grow elderly, they have a right to expect that debt to be repaid. A young adult who repudiates that debt is imposing more hard labor, and possibly premature death, upon the elders. Thus, young adults must be made to appreciate the seriousness of these obligations. Maybe you only get once chance to decide: leave the village/tribe/clan/whatever, and you'd better be able to make it on your own, because there's no shelter for you where you came from.

The author's argument was not based on economy, so far as I recall, but on the unfairness of the prison system. He pointed out the huge discrepancies in sentencing as one aspect, but also the difference in result. One man might serve his five years without incident; another might be raped repeatedly; another might be killed in fight. I don't think he extended the idea to the type of crimes for which people really need to be isolated from society--murder, violent rape, etc. I also don't recall reading any response to the book. It was one of those that just drop out of sight. Does anyone else recall this book or author, it was out sometime in mid to late 1980s. <br><br>Anyhow, I agree that when times get tougher there will be a reaction against the penal system. The idea of convicts being housed and fed in relative comfort while law abiding people are living on the edge will become a huge issue. On the other hand, correctional officers unions and the private companies that are profiting from high incarceration rates will fight any change.<br><br>I rather wish our narrator had had occasion to sample the courts and criminal justice system in the course of his visit.<br><br><a href=#c7856838880847857155 title="comment permalink">6/19/16, 8:48 PM</a><br><br>

This indignant outcry. Some former dignitary member in India, with rather no skill except their social position. No longer they enjoyed and painfully missed their formerly safe comforts, they so yearningly wished to be pampered with again. JMG calls it entitlement. <br>That entitlement is a great force to resist a voluntary change towards the harsh reality of a more frugal existence. And that’s what we are being confronted with now.<br>I see us all being together in this space of entitlement. Even not all of us are descendants of a maharajah. Still we are in a position of privilege. Hardly on moves away voluntarily. For me its not them and us. I see us all together in this. Clinging to privilege is a natural state. Just natural build in self-interest.<br>While the above one keeps po-faced, unwilling turning away from their entitled privileged, the others are full of misgivings towards them. This reproachful tone I so often hear. In particular I see here plenty of envy, malevolence and jealousy. Guess its mirroring an entitlement of also wanting to be in the position of the privileged.<br><br>Beside that emotional approach I see a force within us, to push towards a privileged position. As a matter of fact, so is our nature. That forces is moving us compulsory. Considering that, makes it unreasonable, to blame the other for it, either or. We can not do anything against that forces.<br>Instead I see, that an inbuilt joy is driving us towards any promising living space, we may be able to inherit it. Anything that is supposed to give us an advantage above our competitors in life. Its natural to overshoot. Its not only the myth of progress, but it’s the reality of our nature. We cannot act otherwise. Being destined for overdoing things. As only the borders of our existence are our limits. But this limits must be reached. Otherwise they cannot be experienced. When we experience however that limits, we do adapt to it. Rather a sensual process than a mental. Survival of the fittest means, we have to feel the limits first, to fit it secondly!<br><br>To me it is not reasonable, to postulate, that this overshoot could have been avoided with reasonable restrain. Afterwards it can. But not in advance! As a mass we do not act that reasonable. Instead we act emotionally instinctive. Like a baby does, when it swallows the sweaty dusty big toe of daddy in his mouth. So it really gets it.<br><br>Well, I admit, then the above mentioned reproachful attitudes are natural too. Coming out of that emotionally instinctive frame we are compulsory bound to. All is limited. Our living space and our capabilities to understand that worlds around us.<br><br><a href=#c122256848029124818 title="comment permalink">6/19/16, 9:30 PM</a><br><br>

I think that there are several classes of diminishing returns, and I will concentrate here on a special one: the case when the resource is potentially unlimited. For example technology, or, in the beautiful metaphor, alcohol. Diminishing returns hit the drinker far before the amount of available alcohol gets into play. What happens is that there is a finite amount of transformation that the human body is able to do per given amount of time. If one was to drink the three glasses of the story each week, there wouldn't be diminishing returns. The problem comes when one wants to increase the rate at which the drinks are consumed. The pertinent physical notion here is power. Power is an amount of energy per second. <br><br>When the power increases, the rate of transformation increases. And it so happens that friction is empirically proportional to velocity in many cases (JMG, I think that this could be one of the rules you are looking for... but I have to think a bit more about this). Therefore, while the total amount of transformation increases, the total amount of energy lost in friction increases too, until a plateau is reached. A good analogy here is an accelerating car. At some point, the friction gets so high that to increase velocity by a little bit costs as much energy as one had to expend accelerating so far. <br><br>For alcohol, it is the same: at some point, the energy lost in friction inside of the liver is so high that the amount of alcohol that is transformed into non-lethal chemicals per second reaches a plateau. <br><br>For technology, complexity means more steps, and each step has to loose, by the second law of thermodynamics, a part of energy in heat. Therefore, the more compound steps, the larger the "friction" and thus the lower the return. The killer here is that our civilization is focused on always increasing the power we use, which is doomed because regardless of the details that thermodynamics doesn't need to know about, increasing the power means increasing the friction, and thus reaching a plateau.<br><br>In this case, diminishing returns seems indeed to be the foster son of Entropy.<br><br>(And I think that using history instead of an abstract theory is a good idea: history gives empirical data, and empirical data wins over theory every time)<br><br>Seb<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c7005711670084862332 title="comment permalink">6/20/16, 2:28 PM</a><br><br>

As already pointed out it is velocity related, increasing with increasing velocity, but it is also subject to the phenomenon of resonance.

Skillful politicians use the resonance to take advantage of diminished resistance to implement changes that would otherwise be unacceptable.

We cook and cool with electricity, but heat domestic water with natural gas. Our PV system, rated at 5.25 kW peak, produced 445 kWh over this period. On a good day, we break 30 kWh; on a cloudy day, maybe only 5 kWh. This system has been in operation since December 2014 (18 months). It does not have battery backup. We also "earned" a $12 credit for allowing our local utility to manage demand by shutting off our A/C for up to an hour at a time. Peak power (hot afternoons) is expensive and probably dirty, so it's good to help smooth it off.<br><br><a href=#c4956803150258441687 title="comment permalink">6/21/16, 3:38 PM</a><br><br>

Probably due to a simple misunderstanding, a conflict between two church members led to one of the members (and his spouse) declining to recognize the existence of the other. I do not know all of the details, but I could see the damage. Once the "shun" began, there was no way to undo it. There was no way to reconcile, or ask forgiveness, because there could be no further communication. There was no way to intervene, because the party giving offense had ceased to exist in the mind of the offended, and so there was nothing to talk about. In an isolated community, to be widely shunned could be fatal. And not necessarily fatal to the one experiencing the shunning, if that person is pushed beyond reason to violence. (Our situation was defused when the shunners chose a new church.) A community needs a mechanism for repentance and forgiveness. It will not apply to all offenses, of course.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c895287505131633432 title="comment permalink">6/21/16, 3:54 PM</a><br><br>

In talking about the law of diminishing returns applied to technology I am not so sure that it is anywhere so simple. I am wondering how much a large part of the diminishing effect is mostly due to people gaming mature systems, which they find harder to do in new systems, as well as unnecessary overheads being imposed on technologies due to financial or political concerns.<br> As a very minor example, the EU wants to phase in lower powered appliances such as toasters, vacuum-cleaners, hair dryers, etc, in order to cut CO2 emissions. Ecodesign they call it. A laudable goal one may say but making newer appliances under-powered means that they have to be used longer to perform the same function as before thus reducing the benefits as well as imposing costs elsewhere. One man was complaining that just to perform the exotic task of toasting bread, that he now had to put it through the toaster three times to get it the same way that once had been enough in an older toaster. Laughable it may seem, until you start to ponder both the front-end costs as well as all the other artificial costs back-loaded onto what should be a relatively simple task.<br> At the moment the trend is to build layers of complexity onto relatively simple gear such as TVs, refrigerators, etc. It is evolving to the point that if it is not connected to the internet, a basic device will refuse to work. This has happened recently with a home control system whose parent company suddenly decided to pull the plug on what was a popular system. Owners suddenly found that their system was totally bricked for good.<br> I think that we are seeing this also with computer operating systems where the idea is to have the actual operating system 'in the cloud'. If you lose your net connection though, your computer suddenly becomes a heavy paperweight. When Windows 10 was introduced recently, update control was taken away from customers - you had no say. When you think about it though, there is no reason why over the next ten, twenty years that Windows will upgrade itself into what is essentially a dumb terminal with all computer programs, all files storage, the operating system all 'in the cloud'. Thus a common computer will have all its robustness and utility at the mercy of external, and uncontrollable elements. This result will not be a result of the technology but simple financial decisions, hence my idea that the diminishing returns are actually artificially imposed.<br><br><a href=#c8333605274837416103 title="comment permalink">6/21/16, 5:12 PM</a><br><br>

No more tinkering, rejetting your own carbs 'cos they don't have carbs, lol. No more reserve fuel valve! <br><br>XL250s and KLR250s were great bikes. The one secret to surviving in traffic is to look a bit like a cop. Just putting a fairing on your bike and wearing a black jacket and a white helmet will do it - but just to be sure, it helps to have taken both MSF courses (the basic one and the advanced one), have put in a ton of miles, and have gotten the crashes out of your system by, uhm, well, crashing. (Geez I was a crazy 20-something.)<br><br>With the economy as bad as it is, I've been wondering: Where are the damn mopeds? I know what a bad economy looks like, I lived through one in the 1970s. A bad economy means tons of bicycles and mopeds and yes, motorcycles. Because the average person doesn't need 1000s of lbs of metal to get around and pick up a dozen eggs and a loaf of bread after work. <br><br>It seems the average citizen has become somewhat alienated from the simple machines we 50-somethings and olders grew up with, and the attitudes about same. I remember my dad teaching me how to find the leak in a bicycle tube in a tub of water, and how to patch the tube, when I was about 8. We were the standard suburban family but we all had bikes, it wasn't just the family car. We were all encouraged to tear around the neighborhood on bikes, and helmets were unknown. Somehow we all survived. When I got older, and as our family fortunes fell, it was something like, "Yeah, you want a bike? Well, you're free to dig around the local junk yard and find parts and build one up" and we did. Whether it was a bike or a skateboard or a moped or what have you, taking it apart and getting your hands greasy just went with the territory. <br><br>That's *so* far in the past now; a different time. Amazingly, my beloved Yamaha SRX-6 that I bought new, would be a 30-year old bike now.<br><br><a href=#c2613401829786721439 title="comment permalink">6/21/16, 5:16 PM</a><br><br>
