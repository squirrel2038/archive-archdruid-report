<div class=MsoNormal>
I got lunch at the little caf<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>é</span>
across the street from the Capitol, and then went to talk to Melanie Berger and a dozen other people from Meeker’s staff. We had a lot of ground to cover and I’d lost two and a half days to the flu, so we buckled down to work and kept at it until we were all good and tired. It was eight o’clock, I think, before we finally broke for dinner and headed for a steak place, and after that I went back to my hotel and slept hard for ten hours straight. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The next morning we were back at it again. Ellen Montrose wanted a draft trade agreement, a draft memorandum on border security, and at least a rough draft of a treaty allowing inland-waterway transport from our territory down the Ohio River to the Mississippi and points south, and she wanted them before her inauguration, so she could hit the ground running once her term began. I figured she also meant to announce them in her inauguration speech and throw the Dem-Reps onto the defensive immediately, so they’d be too busy trying to block her agenda to come up with an agenda of their own. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Lakelanders knew about the proposals—they’d been briefed while my trip was still in the planning stage—and they were willing to meet her halfway, but they had a shopping list of their own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The trade agreement in particular required a lot of finagling, so the Restos wouldn’t shoot it down when it came up for ratification by the legislature, and I had to weigh everything against what Montrose’s people and the legislature in Philadelphia would be willing to tolerate. Fortunately the Lakelanders were just as clear on the political realities as I was; everybody approached the negotiations with “how do we make this work?” as the first priority, and we got a lot done. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By lunchtime we’d gotten the framework of the trade agreement settled—there would be plenty of fiddling once the formal negotiations got started, but the basic arrangements looked good—and the memorandum on border security was a piece of cake, the way it usually is when neither side is looking for an excuse to start a fight. The inland-waterway treaty was another matter. We wanted access to the Mississippi, with an eye toward markets in the Missouri Republic, the Gulf, and points further south; they wanted to be able to ship goods to the Atlantic via the Erie Canal, to keep Qu<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>é</span>bec from getting expansive ideas about transit fees on the St. Lawrence Seaway. In principle, those were both workable, but the details were tenanted with more than the usual quota of devils. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So we got lunch in the dining room downstairs in the Capitol, sat over in a corner, and kept on hashing out details between bites of sandwich and spoonsful of bean soup. Once lunch was over, we trooped back up to the conference room downstairs from Meeker’s office and kept going. The one big question we still had to tackle by that point was how to handle the difference in technology—our tugs and barges rely on high-tech gear that the Lakeland waterways aren’t set up for, and theirs don’t have the equipment our regulations require—and we talked through I don’t know how many different ways to handle that, before finally agreeing that each side’s tugs would stay on their own side of the border,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>their barges would rent portable computer rigs when they were on our side, and our barges would hire extra crew to do the same work on theirs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Once that was out of the way, the rest of it came together quickly enough, but by then the sun was down and we were all pretty tired. It was a Friday night, so the only people left in the Capitol besides us by then were janitors and security guards, and most of the others had someplace or other to go and somebody to meet. In the end, it was just me and Melanie Berger who walked two blocks north to the Indian place we’d been earlier that week. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We got settled in a little booth, ordered drinks and dinner, sat there for a few minutes without saying much. She looked as tired as I felt. Drinks and a basket of onion naan put in an appearance, though, and took the edge off two very long days. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Well, that was a marathon,” Berger said, sipping at something that was supposed to be a martini—I’d never heard of one that just had gin, vermouth, and an olive in it, but I figured it was a local habit. “Still, no regrets.” With a sudden smile: “I bet Fred Vanich that we could get the three agreements roughed out before you left for Philadelphia, and this time I get to collect.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I laughed. “Glad to oblige.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We busied ourselves with the naan for a bit. “You’re leaving Wednesday, right?” she said then. When I nodded:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I admit I’m wondering what you think about—” Her gesture took in the restaurant, the other patrons in their old-fahioned clothing, the streetcar rolling purposefully past on the street outside, the unfinished dome of the Capitol rising above the buildings on the other side of the street. “You’ve been here long enough to get over the initial shock, and I’d be interested in hearing what all this looks like from an outsider’s perspective.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Looking back on it all, it probably would have been more professional to fob her off with a few trivial comments, but I didn’t do that. Partly I was tired enough that I wasn’t thinking clearly, partly I’d been wishing for days that I could talk to someone intelligent about the insight I’d had on the way back from Defiance County, and it probably didn’t help that there was some chemistry between me and Melanie Berger, which seemed to be mutual. So I got stupid and said, “My reaction’s kind of complex.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She motioned for me to go on, but just then the waiter came back with our entrees, noted our empty glasses, and returned promptly from the bar with another round of drinks. I waited until he’d gone sailing smoothly over to another table before continuing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“On the one hand,” I said, “you’ve played a weak hand astonishingly well. No, it’s more than that—you’ve taken what I’d have considered crushing disadvantages and turned them into advantages. I’d be willing to bet that the World Bank and the IMF figured that after a couple of years shut out of global credit markets and foreign trade, you’d crawl on your knees over broken glass to be let back in.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Berger nodded. “I’ve heard that they told President Moffit something like that to his face.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“But you took every lemon they threw at you and made lemonade out of it. No foreign trade? You used that as an opportunity to build up an industrial plant aimed at local markets. No access to credit? You made banking a public utility and launched what looks like a thriving stock market. No technology imports? You rebuilt your economy to use human labor and local resources instead—and it hasn’t escaped my attention how enthusiastic your population is about all three of those moves.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You can hardly blame them,” she said. “Plenty of jobs at decent pay, and banks that pay a decent rate of interest and don’t go belly up—what’s not to like?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m not arguing. And here’s the thing—so far, it’s insulated you from a lot of trouble. This satellite business is a good example.” I gestured with my fork. “The last three days have been a complete mess in the rest of the world. Stock markets are down hard, and everybody from military planners to weather forecasters are trying to figure out what the hell they’re going to do without satellite data. Here? I know exactly how much time Tom Pappas is going to spend worrying about getting by without satellites—” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She burst into laughter. “Just under zero seconds.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“If that,” I said, laughing with her. “And the Toledo stock market had three decent days. I don’t even want to think about how my other investments are doing, but here I made two dollars and fifty cents.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That got me a surprised look. “I didn’t know you had money invested here.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“One share of Mikkelson Industries. It was a good way to see the market in action.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She laughed again. “I’ll have to tell Janice that the next time I see her. She’ll be tickled.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Then:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“But there’s another side to your reaction.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yes, there is.” All of a sudden I wished I didn’t have to go on, but I’d backed myself into a corner good and proper. “The downside is that it can’t last. You’re going one way but the rest of the world is going the other, and all it’s going to take is one round too many of technological innovation out there and you’ll be left twisting in the wind. Right now, what you’ve got looks pretty good compared to what’s on the other side of the borders, but when the global economy finally gets straightened out and the next big wave of innovation and growth hits, what then? Regime change using technologies you can’t counter, maybe, or maybe just the sort of slow collapse that happens to a country that’s tried to stay stuck in the past a little too long.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She was smiling when I finished. “I was wondering if you’d bring that up.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That stopped me cold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>I used a forkful of tandoori chicken as a distraction, then said, “I take it you’ve heard someone else mention it.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Fairly often. When someone from outside gets past the initial shock, and actually thinks about what we’ve done here—and of course quite a few of them never get around to that—that’s usually the next point they bring up.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I considered that. “And I suppose you have an answer for it.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Well, yes.” She jabbed at the palak paneer. “When the global economy finally gets straightened out, when the next big wave of innovation and growth hits. Are you sure those are going to happen?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I put down my fork and stared at her. “It’s got to happen sooner or later.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Why?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I tried to think of something to say, and couldn’t. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The Second Civil War ended thirty-two years ago,” she pointed out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“The Sino-Japanese war was over twenty-seven years ago. Ever since then, economists everywhere outside our borders have been insisting that things would turn up any day now, and they haven’t. You know as well as I do that real global GDP has been flat to negative twenty-six of the last thirty years, and the last decade’s shown zero improvement—quite the contrary. That’s not going to change, either, because every other country in the world is chasing a policy goal that’s actively making things worse.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And that is?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Progress,” she said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Once again, I was left speechless. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Here are some examples.” She held up one finger. “The consumer sector of your economy has been in the tank ever since Partition. Why? Because you’ve got really bad maldistribution of income.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“There’s more to it than that,” I protested. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yes, but that’s the core of it—if consumers don’t have money to spend, they’re not going to be able to buy consumer goods, and your consumer sector is going to suffer accordingly. Why don’t they have money to spend? Because you’ve automated most working class jobs out of existence, and if you want to tell me that technology creates more jobs than it eliminates, you’re going to have to argue with some very hard figures. You’ve got appalling rates of permanent unemployment and underemployment, and yet everybody on your side of the border seems to think that a problem that was caused by automation is going to be solved by even more automation.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She raised a second finger. “That’s one example. Here’s another. As technology gets more complex and interconnected, you’re guaranteed to see more situations where a problem in one system loads costs on other systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Look at the satellite situation—it’s because so many economic sectors rely on satellite technology that that’s going to be such an economic headache. That’s an obvious example, but there are plenty of others; our estimate is that cascading problems driven by excess technological interaction knocked a good eight per cent off global GDP last year, and it’s getting worse, because everybody outside seems to believe that the problems of complexity can only be fixed by adding more complexity. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“A third.” Another finger went up. “Resource costs. The more complex your technology gets, the more it costs to build it, maintain it, power it, and so on. Any time an analysis says otherwise, some of the costs are being pushed under the rug—and that rug’s getting very lumpy nowadays. Direct and indirect resource costs of technology are like a tax on all other economic activity, and since most of what you do with complex tech used to be done in less resource-intensive ways already, the economic return on tech doesn’t make up for the resource costs. Try telling that to a World Bank economist sometime, though—it’s quite entertaining to watch. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And here’s a fourth.” She raised another finger. “Systemic malinvestment. Since each generation of tech costs more on a whole system basis than the one before, tech eats up more and more of your GDP each year, and everything else gets to fight over the scraps. After the Second Civil War, your country and mine were pretty much equally leveled. We put our investment into basic infrastructure; you put yours into high technology. We got rebuilt cities and towns, canals, railways, schools, libraries, and the rest of it. You got a domestic infrastructure so far in decay I’m amazed you put up with it, because the money that could have fixed your roads and bridges and housing stock went down a collection of high tech ratholes instead. Sure, you’ve got the metanet; does that make up for everything you do without?</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I could go on. There was a time when progress meant prosperity, but we passed that point in the late twentieth century, and since then, every further increment of progress has cost more than it’s worth—and yet the ideology stays stuck in place. Until that changes, the global economy isn’t going to straighten out and the next big boom is going to turn into one more bust; it’s not going to change until someone else notices that progress has become the enemy of prosperity.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I was shaking my head by the time she was finished. “With all due respect,” I said, “that’s crazy.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was a clumsy thing to say and I regretted saying it the moment the words were out. “That attitude,” she snapped back, “is why we don’t have to worry about technological innovation and the rest of it. One more round of innovation, one more economic boom and bust, and the rest of the world is going to progress itself straight into the ground.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I opened my mouth to reply, and then shut it again. One more word, and we would have had a quarrel right there in the restaurant, but I wasn’t going to let that happen, and neither was she. So we finished dinner in silence, didn’t get another round of drinks, paid up and went to the door. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She flagged down a taxi. “I’ll have someone contact you Monday,” she said, looking away from me. “Good night.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I wished her a good night, stood there while the clop-clop of the horse faded into the other street noises, and then started walking back to my hotel. The things she’d said chased each other around and around in my mind. None of it made any sort of sense—except that it did, in a bizarre sort of way, and when I tried to tease out the holes in her logic I had a hard time finding any. I figured that I was just too tired, and—let’s be honest—too upset. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Progress as the enemy of prosperity, I thought, shaking my head. What a bizarre idea. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Something very bright streaked across the sky above me, and I looked up. A little uneven shape of brilliant light with a long streaming tail behind it went tumbling across the stars, faster than a jet. As I watched, it broke in two, and then the two pieces disintegrated one after another into sprays of tiny glowing points that flared and went dark. I tried to tell myself that it was just a meteor, but I knew better. </div>

Some voices in the wilderness are pointing out that making a truck driver obsolete with a self-driving truck, then giving him a cheque to replace his lost wages is not actually a healthy thing for anyone, even if the cheque is as big as the wages. I think this is actually more interesting than arguments over who owns the means of production, because it represents the final absurdity of capitalism - the literal replacement of labor with capital. Even someone well-steeped in capitalist ideology can understand that a robot only benefits the robot's masters without a system in place to redistribute the wealth produced by the robot. Furthermore, it acknowledges the social value of work and purpose rather than the crass idea that work is only about getting money to buy needs and wants. I think that these discussions could be construed as progress.<br><br><a href=#c7682562109196314278 title="comment permalink">6/1/16, 5:41 PM</a><br><br>

I think I am a whisper more optimistic on that front, the celent seems to be cracking, but that could cycle back track a few more times before giving out. I know that the progress narrative is still lurking in my sub conscious, not rarely I catch it guiding a story.<br><br>In relation to last weeks homework, I am puttering through The Divine Comedy of Dante. It is difficult reading, I get the feeling that Dante is writing on a lot of different layers, and the sensation of reading him is that of things going over my head and catching things with but the corner of my eye. The thing that has stood out most to me is the fondness that Dante shows for many of the people he encounters in the inferno. Dante even at one point admonishes himself not to question the justice of it when a person he was fond of was found in the 7th circle. I still ain't far into purgatory. The orders of the sins and the punishments have more thought behind them than I can divine from a first reading, sodomites and usurers are right next to each other in the book for violence against the order of nature; though I suspect that both terms cover more territory with better surveyed boundaries that today's usage of them, but that's just a guess based on the feel of the sections. I recollect the comment you made to me about the chain of being and the ancient game of 'everything in its right place' as opposed to the 'victim game' based morality of today. Dante travels through layers of being that do not give a demons trumpet about victims; at one point I though that the question that the Demon how assigned ones place in the inferno was answering would render today as "What is broken in you?" and the punishment reveals the pain of that malfunction, deprived of what we do to hide from it. <br><br>But I don't know all these Italian politicians that seem to fill hell, so there is some meaning where "you just had to know the guy."<br><br><a href=#c4511532231994030685 title="comment permalink">6/1/16, 6:03 PM</a><br><br>

Of course you tend to judge other cultures against your own and tend to be defensive about it. The "modern' world of satellites, etc described seems pretty regimented, with a top down perspective. The other seems to have empowered re-innovators to develop. I did miss a discussion of debt and how it facilitated a techno centric culture on one hand and a "base technology" culture on the other. The implication is that the former created a lot of debt to advance quickly and the latter, took a slower approach. As you have often said, the God of Progress can be quite fickle. In terms of standard of living, both appear to deliver an acceptable one. On the surface, the low growth model would seem to be more sustainable. But is that really true?

Speaking of the ablation cascades to come, did you see the latest news coming out of Russia? The Russians are testing a new model of ABM and ASAT that can be fired from truck mounted launchers, hardened silos and will be carried by the next generation of Russian Navy destroyers. They conducted the latest test of the Nudol ABM/ASAT missile less than a week ago. According to reports, the test was successful.<br><br>A silo launched version of the Nudol will replace the current A-135 ABM system that guards Moscow against ballistic missile attacks. The Nudol can also be fired by the new state-of-the-art S-500 aerospace defense system, which can engage everything from ICBM's to cruise missiles to stealth fighters and bombers. The land based version of the S-500 is mounted on trucks and can be ready to fire within five minutes after the vehicles halt and start setting up. A naval version of the S-500 is under development for the new Leader class destroyers. The truck mounted version of the S-500 is due to start entering service later this year. <br><br>Systems like the Nudol and the S-500 have been developed in response to what the Russians see as an increasingly aggressive and belligerent American foreign policy. I have a feeling that if things continue as they have, its going to end badly, especially since the American Empire is already in serious trouble. This is one of the reasons why I oppose Hillary Clinton.

Suggest that the roots of the problem facing the modern world, which many people admit are caused by "progress", can't be solved with progress, and so many people's minds seem to break down. Not everyone would even agree progress is the cause though: so many people seem to think that it's impossible to claim any connection between it, as if only certain things count. For example, despite the fact it's clear that technology causes climate change, people seem to think the solution is technology.<br><br>Off topic, but to those who're interested in my quest to get rid of my phone, I've had to put it on hold for a while. I'm applying for a job as a class tutor, and they require all applicants have a cell phone. It looks rewarding, pay is good, hours are good, and it has enough flexibility for me to continue with my life, and so I think it's worth keeping my phone a while longer. I'll only be doing the job until I graduate in a year anyway, so it's not too bad.<br><br>I've also noticed a really weird paralogic here though: forcing me to have a phone when it has nothing to do with the job is apparently "proof a phone is useful", while forcing people to have cars is "an unreasonable infringement on freedom by the 1%". This isn't even different people, but the same people. Although I doubt everyone would view being forced to have cars as being inherently unreasonable, amongst upper class liberals in Canada (or at least my part of Canada) not having a car is a badge of honour, so the paralogic makes sense, but it's still fascinating.<br><br><a href=#c3182352981529687760 title="comment permalink">6/1/16, 7:43 PM</a><br><br>

I'm still only 22, so hopefully I'll be able to save enough of my future earnings to spend on things that make me more resilient.<br>I have a friend who, despite agreeing that current society is going downhill, sincerely believes that everything will somehow be suddenly solved even in the lack of abundant fossil fuels by the discovery of technology involving wormholes. He's a very dear friend and I appreciate him, but I just don't understand why he thinks humans using wormholes or other FTL travel is in any way likely...<br>Thanks for keeping me thinking about these issues.

I must admit my internal response hitherto to the more doomier predictions has been to mutter "well, it's never go happen" due to resource constraints. But, of course, it WILL happen to some extent, despite the resource constraints, whilst making every constraint worse than it would have been otherwise.<br><br>And I think this helps to explain why most people don't (and still WON'T) get it - there'll be enough gizmos and 'advances' to be trumpeted, even as we continue our descent.

I can see small examples of countries or communities today doing what they did – Iceland, for example, telling the global financiers to stow it after the 2008 crash. <br><br>Ireland was isolated for a time after it gained independence – through a global Depression, a World War and a post-war boom, Ireland remained neutral and largely agrarian, and so was little affected. It was poor of course, even poorer than it had been under UK rule – as recently as the 1970s, the GDP per capita was lower than Gabon in Central Africa – but it remained a highly literate society, about as healthy as any Western country of the time. Once it got prosperous, a doctor friend of mine the average health went down. <br><br>I’m told that people were very sceptical of over-the-counter stores when they were introduced, as opposed to the old-fashioned kind of store where you simply ask for what you need and the shopkeeper hands it to you. The latter demands that you know what you need, and chat with a man who is also your neighbour; the former demands that you walk through aisles of goods designed to tempt you into buying more. <br><br>In the same way, I heard a radio programme from 1975 talking about something new introduced to Ireland, the “funeral-home,” as opposed to the family laying the recently deceased family member on the kitchen table and holding an all-night wake around them. The announcer described how Irish were resistant to the idea, considering it insulting to the deceased and exploiting the grieving family, turning their most intimate of family affairs into a business. Yet in both cases people adopted them, and people forgot things were once different. <br><br>The globalised modern world caught up with Ireland, and if Retropia were real I wouldn’t be so sanguine about its future. Once it opens up as a market, I’d be worried that companies will move in trying to get people to buy things they don’t need, like the hobbits adopting the machines of Old Sharkey in Lord of the Rings.<br><br><br><a href=#c1393917906440627832 title="comment permalink">6/2/16, 5:35 AM</a><br><br>

So you need a phone. Find the drawer where you put all those old phones you've replaced over the years. Find the oldest one still compatible with modern networks. For Rogers/AT&amp;T, this would be GSM--older TDMA has been phased out and no longer works. Not sure about Verizon/CDMA networks compatibility. For example, I had an old candy bar Nokia 10 years ago that was GSM, but had a monochrome screen, very slow data--as long as it accepts a SIM card, it will work. If you're like me and have donated all your old phones (darn it), then go online on eBay and find one, or raid your friends' and family's drawers. Next time people are oogling their dumb phones, whip yours out, and say "it's awesome, it accepts, makes calls AND texts, and it doesn't destroy my attention/focus/awareness of the world around me" or some such. Lots of people are doing this now. If you don't want to get an old phone, you can still get flips from most major carriers.<br><br><br><a href=#c1327484117512376409 title="comment permalink">6/2/16, 5:50 AM</a><br><br>

The capital of Meriga in <i>Star's Reach</i> is Cincinnati, and at one point in the story you mention that "Hiyo" had become a prosperous place (though I'm wondering why it took over 400 years for Ohioans to decide to re-dig the canals!). Are you suggesting that in the future Ohio might indeed become "the heart of it all" (to quote a tourism slogan that has appeared on our license plates and tourism publications)? Currently, of course, we are mostly a flyover state that normally only gets attention during presidential election years because we are blessed, or cursed, depending on one's point of view, with being THE archetypal swing state.<br><br>And speaking of <i>Star's Reach</i>, have you thought about a sequel, or perhaps even two sequels? I could envision the narrative going in two different directions: one telling the story of Trey's work with Plummer in the Rememberers Guild, and the other, of course, detailing the continued work at Star's Reach by Eleen and Tashel Ban (and of course their developing love interest).

Really liked the speech on the folly of progress as a goal. I wonder if you've ever read "My name is Chellis, and I'm in recovery from Western civilization." It's one of my favorites, along with the Conan books. I read the Conan books as a testosteroned teen and didn't realize how much they would resonate with (maybe help form) my later critique of civilization. The thing I end up wondering, though, is how do we get back to some balance, and is the Lakeland Republic realistic. Don't get me wrong, the society you set up makes sense and seems to address so many issues in a really coherent and thoughtful way, given the place we're at now. But sometimes I think the opposable thumb was just a wrong turn that led us to manipulation (in both the literal and figurative sense) and an adversarial relationship with nature that is simply unsolvable. I wonder if even the "progress" of domestication of plants and animals was too much already. Like a kind of original sin that's impossible to come back from. Maybe it's just a matter of heeding Sting: "When the world is runnin' down, make the best of what's still around."<br><br><a href=#c2796462475506276891 title="comment permalink">6/2/16, 8:02 AM</a><br><br>

Not only is technological progress not likely to occur in the technical age, but in most cases it would not increase real prosperity, nor has it increased real prosperity in the past. This got me thinking of my childhood. We moved to a Grand Old Farm from the suburbs when I was 8. This was a place that had been in a family for several generations but was sold because there were no more offspring to run it. My father was enamored of modern agricultural methods so he set about getting new equipment and building a modern metal building to put it in. At the same time I was exploring the big old barn with a labrinth of grain rooms, hay trolleys, stalls, and feeding hatches. There were special floors stored away to be put out for barn dances, carts and dollys of unknown purpose ( to a kid) all dating from the multicrop agriculture that was prevelent in the Willamette Valley of Oregon before the 1960's. Even the farm house was a wonder of old features from wide flat stairs leading to the canned food storage in the basement, huge covered porch for wood and detached summer kitchen to keep the heat of the wood canning stoves out of the house. As a kid I marveled at the the richness of the life that must have gone on in such a place. Wondering why the new buildings that got put up were so simple , ugly and shoddy in comparison. A few years later we sold this farm and moved to a different one without the old featurs, so I don't know what became of them. But I have never stopped thinking about how "new farming" never lived up to the images in my head of what things must have been like in the wonderous old buildings at their prime.<br><br><a href=#c3838318503177574149 title="comment permalink">6/2/16, 10:34 AM</a><br><br>

He looks at the abandoned infrastructure, the rising poverty, the impacts of a century and more of decline after leaving his comfortable villa in Gaul and his words sound almost exactly like the ones Carr utters about the future of his own home: "amidst failure it is thy way to hope for prosperity: after the pattern of the heavens losses undergone enrich thee. For flaming stars set only to renew their rising; thou seest the moon wane to wax afresh." Everything that has happened is just a temporary setback and progress will resume any day (though less than a generation later… Odoacer). The people who still profit from a belief in the old order find ways to retain that belief... even if it means ignoring their own fates tied to the people who are falling outside of it and are even more determined to do so when that belief is challenged.<br><br>Media too could continue for quite some time and reinforce this. The transition from the internet to the metanet in the story shows that they're already working on downsizing the internet, and if maintaining the metanet and a few automated farms and transport/trade/banking networks is the sole thing that's being focused on, at the expense of infrastructure, resources could probably be stretched for quite some time, and those who can experiencing the world through a veepad can let the screen itself filter out anything that contradicts their expectations. At that point, they’d be living solely through the lives of celebrities, so completely immersed in that world, that they experience it as their own. And as long as the barest protection from the elements and starvation are there, mental stimulation could shut out quite a bit… Even now, many people seem to actually believe that they are living the lives normalized by the internet and television and rarely look up enough to notice the mismatch between image and reality. In the world of Retrotopia, the people who still have access to basic necessities and the basic security of a home and access to the high technology infrastructures of the Atlantic Republic are so caught up in their reinforcing echo chamber that they don’t even have to look at the people who are falling out of prosperity or about the aspects of your own life that are falling into poverty.<br><br>This fixation on the private lives of a privileged through filtered through the channels of media brings to mind a passage from Spengler:<br><br>“Henceforth there are only private histories, private destinies, private ambitions from top to bottom, from the miserable troubles of fellaheen to the dreary feuds of Caesars for the private possession of the world. The formed state passes from nations to bands and retinues of adventurers in whose eyes the population becomes in the end merely a part of the landscape. With the formed state, high history also lays itself down weary to sleep. Man becomes a plant again, adhering to the soil, dumb and enduring.”<br><br>At the beginning of the story Carr sees the first hint of poverty, finds it depressing, and turns on his veepad to hide away from it. The natural tendency of humans to hide away combines with the reinforcing factors of high technology to conceal from the eye anything that can’t be concealed from the mind… leads to a special form of those latter stages… not only is poverty temporary, it’s also abstract… even if you’re the one experiencing it… since all it takes to hide yourself from a shabby studio apartment with peeling paint, an aching belly from mostly synthetic food, and the sound of riots beyond the doors is the flip of a switch… and once the switch is flipped… the private histories of the most prosperous of your society become all you experience. (Until, of course… something happens to disrupt the flow, such as the satellite crisis)<br><br><br><a href=#c7126530040520373189 title="comment permalink">6/2/16, 11:27 AM</a><br><br>

I do have some doubts about the high-tech used 50 years from now. The closest thing I can imagine is something similar to a poor African country. I visited Tanzania and they do have some high-tech toys for the 1% while the streets are full of unemployed people (only men, women have to take care of the house, you know) and the tourists live in high-walled guarded compounds. In that case I don't know how many people outside of the 1% would believe in progress?<br>On a different note, I had a lot of thoughts about your homework but I find it hard to express them. I grew up in a eastern European country and I read a lot of old books from many literary traditions (English, French, Russian). I read them in translations and I realize now how good those translations were! Just try to read great Russian novels in English - they are soulless. I don't know if that is because of cultural differences or the tendency in English today to use small words?<br><br><a href=#c7537941146470237332 title="comment permalink">6/2/16, 2:09 PM</a><br><br>

Pinker is an apologist for Progress of the moral kind, something that is becoming rare. Also of the economic kind, which is not as rare. I think his science is OK for homicides declining and a correlation with Leviathan (centralized govt), but wrong (as in terrible statistical analysis) for total deaths per capita declining and any correlation with his other "causes" (feminization, reason and commerce). Also he does not look at the tradeoffs involved in Progress, all the things that have done harm, even as they may have reduced homicides.

The keys to reaching a critical mass are, first, to get the concept out on a small scale; second, to make sure that the people who think they get it actually understand it, and learn how to counter the usual criticisms; and third, to use pop culture media (such as, oh, just for the sake of an example, a utopian novel) to give the concept as wide a circulation as possible...<br><br>Gwizard43, the next installment will be in two weeks; stay tuned!<br><br>Yves, indeed Québec is there -- an independent nation with a very important role in trade with Europe, since the ports along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts are flooding in 2065 due to rising sea levels. <br><br>Bob, debt is simply a way of managing the abstract tokens we use to shuffle real wealth around. It's not a big deal in 2065, because the massive financial crises that followed the collapse of the United States led to a general shift away from the sort of Ponzi scheme finance the US had been using for decades before that time, and because none of the post-US nations of North America can roll the presses without risking hyperinflation -- their currencies aren't reserve currencies, after all. <br><br>Submarine, yes, and I also saw the US handwaving about how we're going to get something comparable, oh, one of these days. An upcoming post will discuss the appalling state of the US military and the likelihood of a serious military disaster in the decade or so ahead. <br><br>John, funny. If you believe that, I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you. It's a quantum bridge, by the way, so it's got to be a great deal!<br><br>RepubAnon, I hear from people all the time who believe in Progress in exactly the terms that shape Carr's thinking. In 2065, driverless cars are dimly remembered as one of the bizarre Ponzi schemes that sucked up so much investment money in the decade or so before the Second Civil War. As for wars over resources, I've already mentioned the Second Civil War and the Sino-Japanese war, and things are heating up between Texas and the Confederacy -- what more do you want? <br><br>WB Jorgenson, I've watched the same mental meltdown many times! <br><br>Eric, delighted to hear it! <br><br>Curtis, good. Notice that the Indian restaurant is the kind of high-end place that an executive assistant to the President and an important foreign politician would go for dinner. That is to say, the spices can be gotten, but they aren't cheap, and the $10.99 buffet is definitely a thing of the past. <br><br>Mark, to judge by paleoclimatological equivalents, the Lakeland Republic will be prairie, not desert. The big question when it comes to New England is how the shutdown of the Gulf Stream will affect your climate, and as far as I know there's no consensus on that yet. <br><br>Bill, nope -- there are at least six more episodes in the works. The exposition phase is ending, and the dramatic action phase -- most modern utopian narratives fall into these two sections -- is picking up. Stay tuned! If the Lakeland flag and, more to the point, the Lakeland ideas get into circulation in the upper Midwest, or for that matter any other part of the country, I for one will be delighted.<br><br><a href=#c3422126868602641718 title="comment permalink">6/2/16, 8:13 PM</a><br><br>

Granted, a good collection of LPs would cost more and take up more space than an equivalent collection of MP3s, but Bob Marley's worth it, right? ;-)<br><br>Raymond, why, yes, I had exactly that in mind. I trust you'll do your part to get that idea in circulation outside the boundaries of this blog! <br><br>Sheila, thank you. <br><br>Doomstead, historically speaking, it's quite common for societies after massive collective traumas to try to reestablish some equivalent of the precrisis system -- look at the number of European nations (including France) that put a monarch back in power after the Napoleonic wars, for example. Of course the fact that this is a, ahem, <i><b>retro</b></i>topia might suggest another reason why the Lakeland Republic has returned to an older form of government! <br><br>Dan, good. You're catching onto the way I'm handling the symbolic side of the narrative. <br><br>Gary, you're welcome and thank you!<br><br>Nancy, good! It's precisely because it's so late in the day that storytelling -- our species' oldest information processing technology -- is the one option left. "Help me, storyteller, you're my only hope..."<br><br>Josh, I did so some time ago, and the conversation didn't get far. I suspect that the main difficulty here is that Rod, like most of the people at the <i>American Conservative</i>, has a very strong religious dimension to his conservatism. That's perfectly legitimate, of course, and for that matter so do I, but his religion puts a lot of stress on the claim that my religion (and all other religions outside of a very narrow range of Abrahamic faiths, for that matter) is not merely wrong but evil. I don't return the favor, for what it's worth -- the most I would say is that his religion has an unhealthy obsession with being the only option for everyone -- but it's quite an effective barrier to communication. <br><br>Alex, I'm really coming to enjoy the serial form! It makes the process of plotting and storytelling a lot easier when you can do the scenes one at a time, reflect on them, listen to the responses from readers, and then proceed to the next episode. <br><br>Madtom, the Russian systems don't use GPS; Russia has its own satellite geopositioning system, and it also uses a lot of high-powered ground-based radar and the like. All in all -- and this will be going into a future post on the rapid decline of the US military -- the Russians would be far less disrupted by a Kessler syndrome or the like than we would. <br><br>Ed, I'm not planning on a sequel, no. One of the lessons too many writers never get around to learning is when to say, "Okay, this one's done." <br><br>Denmon, you're welcome and thank you.

I find myself in the awkward situation of looking at my portrayal of the F-35 in <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> and thinking, "You know, I gave the plane more credit than it deserves."<br><br>Dorda, I don't have a detailed knowledge of Italian history, but what I've read suggests that Italian politics have been spectacularly complicated since about five minutes after Romulus was born!<br><br>Gregorach, thanks for this! I hear from a lot of people in the IT industry, and I also pay attention to the sordid realities behind the glossy propaganda of progress. <br><br>L, thank you. I encounter people like your friend all the time. I wonder whether it ever occurs to them that "wormholes" is their name for the Second Coming of Chris -- or perhaps for the arrival of the Great Pumpkin! <br><br>Matt, one of the things about modern technofetishism is that it keeps on coming up with more and more absurd technologies, even when I think it's reached the limit. I thought the Bluetooth-enabled toothbrush that texts you stats on your dental care was the outer limits of stupidity. Then a Bluetooth-enabled tampon was announced, and now the Babypod. At this point I'm scratching my head wondering how they're going to manage to come up with anything even more preposterous than that -- but I know they'll manage it. <br><br>Brian, the difficulty with Ireland is that it didn't have laws that require each person and business to cover the costs of all their externalities, and they also didn't have strong trade barriers. The Lakeland Republic has both -- and of course it also exists at a time when grocery stores and funeral parlors elsewhere are going broke due to economic contraction, so their chance of expanding isn't high!<br><br>Renaissance, you're welcome and thank you!<br><br>RPC, no, they're not aware of it, and it won't be discussed in the story, because there are millions of people who aren't yet ready to grapple with the whole arc of decline and fall, but might very easily be able to deal with the concept of scrapping high-end dysfunctional tech. Those readers are the main intended audience of this book. <br><br>Matthias, good! Yes, that's how things will probably work out, but as just noted to RPC, I won't be discussing that in the narrative. <br><br>Don, the Ohio valley is the strategic pivot of North America; whoever controls it controls most of the continent. The Great Lakes region is also very much better suited to come through the Long Descent in something like one piece than most other parts of the continent, through not having to face sea level rise and having plenty of fresh water handy. Those things have kept me thinking hard about Ohio for some years now. No, there won't be a sequel to <i>Star's Reach</i>, unless some publisher offers me an absurdly large advance for it -- I said what I wanted to say with that narrative, and I have a lot of other things I want to write.<br><br><a href=#c2281976356278754174 title="comment permalink">6/3/16, 12:19 AM</a><br><br>

Should you feel inspired to spread it around, don't think that I'll object... ;-)<br><br>Robert, I haven't read Chellis Glendenning's book -- what bits of it were quoted to me didn't inspire interest. Still, I'm glad you found it useful. As for opposable thumbs, agriculture, etc., I'm far from sure that it's useful to go around looking for an equivalent of the Christian concept of original sin. <br><br>Peacegarden, thank you. The conflict between futures is going to be tautened up even further over the next two episodes!<br><br>Shane, I know some people find that to be true! I don't, and so my viewpoint characters generally don't, either. As for steamy scenes, now, now -- remember that this is an all ages blog.

As for satellites and the metanet's dependence on them, I figured the metanet, like the internet, would go for multiple redundancy and the like.

You're paying attention. <br><br>Shane, if you want to create a Lakeland Republic, start with your own life and build from there. Choose a tier, start discarding anything that requires infrastructure that tier doesn't have, and bring in appropriate replacements that work with the simpler infrastructure. That's how it starts!<br><br>Submarine, exactly. We make noise about X, and then the Russians and Chinese build and test it, while our defense industry has its head inserted so far in a biologically improbable orifice that it's digesting its own hair, and is too busy scooping up the graft to get around to building one of X that works. Sooner or later that's going to result in cataclysmic defeat. <br><br>Fudoshindotcom, you and Conan would find plenty of common ground!<br><br><a href=#c5194226852845836276 title="comment permalink">6/3/16, 12:43 AM</a><br><br>

For some time, I resisted the notion, believing that we could begin the "Lakeland transition" -- raising tariffs, reorganizing our industry, giving up our empire, and generally disconnecting ourselves from the global financial and economic system -- w/o having to go through that kind of firestorm (literal in the case of Retrotopia's history, more economic in the case of TLG). However, I am beginning to admit to myself that we cannot progress (sic) along that path unless and until the existing dominant narrative is clearly and definitively debunked by actual experience. And this necessarily includes the military dimension, else there will always be the lingering "we were never defeated in the field" narrative. (Not that there won't be some of that anyway, regardless of facts.)<br><br>Of course, your other main point in this blog has been to start individually where we each are and not wait on world circumstances before acting.

You know how I know? Driving mileage has shot way up, apparently now eclipsing the old peak in 2007. Lots of people are now taking long road trips again, apparently. Obviously the lower gas prices thanks to the oil glut are the biggest factor in that, but the fact that people feel they have money to spend on needlessly driving around enough to beat the old all-time high would indicate that demand destruction isn't as strong as it was from 2007-2014, and oil prices are low for supply-side reasons. <br><br>Of course as we all know, "strong economy" in the 21st century is shorthand for "a large bubble is being blown". Still though, it's remarkable that the Happy Days of American Motoring have become undead, and are now wandering America mindlessly consuming oil again. OOOOOOIIIIIIILLLL!!!<br><br>Here's the NYT article, which comments glowingly about the recent trend. The only downside mentioned is climate change, and it's only mentioned so that it can be dismissed because we're supposed to have a national average of 54.5 mpg by 2025. It quotes some tame intellectual at UC Davis: “[The new efficiency standards] will more than offset the behavioral increase of more driving,” he said. “In 10 years vehicles will be consuming half as much fuel as they do today.” Even if we grant that somehow we can double the real average efficiency of vehicles in under a decade, they don't even consider that it would be better to drive less while still consuming less gasoline per mile.

Although I suspect the average collapse blog reader may turn their nose up at a book about globalized just in time auto manufacturing, there is actually quite a lot of value in the book.<br><br>One thing I found quite interesting is that Saab experimented with a production model where teams of ten or so workers would assemble two cars a day rather than the typical model where each worker would perform the same task over and over again. Although it sounds better to work in a team to perform a complete task rather than just do the same thing over and over again, worker satisfaction did not improve, and neither did productivity or quality.<br><br>What Toyota did, which actually worked, was to make workers responsible for the maintenance of the parts of the manufacturing line that they worked on. If a machine was nearly about to start producing out of spec parts due to wear, it was their job to get it fixed. In contrast, in a Ford plant, a machine operator was not responsible for the machine - if it got so out of tune that it produced out of spec parts it was the production engineer's fault. Quality, job satisfaction and productivity all increased.<br><br>I think the takeaway is that personal ownership of one's work, even if the work is dull and repetitive, is the path to satisfaction, quality and productivity.

So the tweet storming Trump, who says one thing one minute, and denies it or says the exact opposite the next, is us, we are Trump, we really are that unaware and that oblivious.<br>@ valkeeperx,<br>We're close.

We rang the undertaker and a neighbour and didn't have to make ANY other calls. The undertaker came out and did the washing, dressing, layimg out, &amp; placing in an open coffin left on top of the bed he had died in. The neighbour gathered a work crew that quickly put the house &amp; yard to rights, set out the blessed candles, made mountains of ham sandwishes and a river of tea, and let the countryside know the news. The next two days our house was open to all comers, as is traditional, and (as is fitting at the death of an old person who has lived a long full life) there were many tall tales told about him, and much laughter too. perhaps 300 to 400 people would have passwd through our doors in that time coming, saying a prayer at Paddy's bedside &amp; then spemding an hour or a half hour chatting with others over tea.

The wind was strong, the clouds scudded low in the sky and the rain fell. It was the perfect day for the beach. And my wife and I had the beach all to ourselves (or mostly so). It was a huge stretch of coastline and it was a pleasure to walk along and watch the waves roll in driven along on a strong storm. I couldn't help but notice as we walked along the sand whilst the tide retreated, that the most recent storms had been eroding the dunes far higher than I'd ever before seen. Vegetation had dropped from the top of the small dune and sat on the sand at an unusual angle. There was even a set of timber stairs where some of the posts were sitting in mid-air, and some of the drains dumping storm water into the ocean were much higher than the surrounding sand. It was mildly surreal and I wondered if the locals or the local council had even noticed? The local council had thoughtfully erected signs warning of the impending collapse of some of those dunes though. My gut feeling is that they need to dump some rocks on the ocean side of the dune – and quickly.<br><br>On a more positive note, I'm a mostly vegetarian, but we did partake of a few local battered and fried scallops which were very tasty. Yum!<br><br>Thank you very much for the new word too: finagling. Nice one. :-)! Certainly a bit of that gear goes on. I may have mentioned to you that I'm currently reading Michael Lewis's book The Big Short which documents the story and some of the characters behind the shorting of the US property market in the lead up to the home property price crash. And certainly there was a lot of finagling going on.<br><br>The thing is that from my perspective, relying on an asset bubble - which may pop at any moment - to temporarily allow a large disenfranchised and excluded portion of a population to somehow pretend that they are consumers again, but only if they borrow funds, is just so very wrong. And you know what, I walked past a bank this morning that was offering a teaser rate of interest (albeit at a discount of a bit over 1%) on a home loan mortgage. And the teaser rate was compared to a rate - which came with a written warning - which despite reading the fine print several times, I just failed completely to understand what it actually meant.<br><br>I know it is unfashionable to mention such things, but surely, somehow, we could all get to a point where ones labour was honestly rewarded? I dunno. <br><br>Quote: “how do we make this work?” as the first priority - is an expression of co-operation between different groups towards a common goal. Fancy that! I like co-operation as a tool and it certainly gets more done than the unfortunate fixation on individualism that seems to be a rather recent change to our society.<br><br>Also, it is nice to read that Mr Carr is a true believer. That was an enjoyable touch in the narrative. The response from the delightful Melanie makes Mr Carr look not so good. And he missed an opportunity due to his pig headedness too. Well done him. I see plenty of what I call: "Can't be told" going on down here. And in fact, I had to stomp one of those types earlier this week and I won't even recount what a person thoughtlessly said to me on the beach this morning. Is it me or does it seem that people’s ability to communicate complex ideas and concerns appear to be limiting as their exposure and experience with digital media increase? It is a bit 1984, don't you believe?<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c8377200008767472222 title="comment permalink">6/4/16, 3:56 AM</a><br><br>

Even if the current pile of obligations have crashed and burned, the AR would certainly be encouraged to build a new one by future IMF and similar organizations.<br>You have covered the reasons previously of course. Debt is a key part of most imperial wealth pumps. The interesting point is that for the identical transaction, say the sale of government bonds by a country, whether that country is the wealth extractor or the extractee depends pretty much entirely on the county’s ability (or perceived ability) to exert military force over others. Thus, for now - barely, our sales of Treasury Bills or Bonds allows us to extract wealth/tribute, while Greece is in totally the opposite situation.<br><br>I would think that the AR’s pursuit of high tech projects would involve such debt, since I doubt that they be making any of the components for it internally. Very similar to what happened in the recent past where we profited mightily from building power stations and electrical networks for third world countries that did nothing but addict said countries to systems they cannot sustain.<br><br>That being said, I can understand why you would not want to add such an additional issue front and center in Retrotopia, since it would probably detract from the issues that you are covering. Perhaps there will be a place in another story for addressing the black magical powers of this type of token.<br><br><br><a href=#c803757032253916200 title="comment permalink">6/4/16, 4:53 AM</a><br><br>

When I came back with my next water pail, the bugs on the previous row were dead. I'm particularly interested to see if I can control flea beetles with it, as they are very persistent and completely wipe out my ability to grow eggplant, an apparent favorite, but they were on my potatoes yesterday as well. <br><br>An interesting problem occurred at work recently. A woman came in with such a bad case of head lice that workers were wearing shoe covers and full protective gear, which is usually quite unnecessary, but they were literally dropping off her head onto the floor. And after the treatment with the usual poison from the pharmacy, they did not die. Apparently there is now a new, resistant form of head lice, which isn't surprising, is it? A nurse suggested mayonnaise, which she had had to use for her daughter, and some was ordered from the kitchen. I believe that did handle it...but it would have been fun to sprinkle a nice dusting of DE onto her head and watched the movement just stop. There is also a tiny little mite that chickens get and we sprinkle DE on their backs and they are no more.

Certainly not a fan of any religion that is based on a patriarchal deity, guilt, sin, and punishment. Just noting the parallel of knowledge being a wrong turn to manipulation possibly being a wrong turn. <br><br>Do you not agree that there is a relationship between our ability to manipulate our environment and our separation from the cycles of nature? It sure seems to have been a great facilitator of the positive feedback loops of modern civilization. <br><br>I've struggled with the progress issue ever since college, when I graduated with a degree in biochemistry and decided not to pursue that career. My reason could be summed up with the antibiotics issue: the more you put energy into such supposed solutions, the more the bacteria will respond and render them useful at some point. Meanwhile, our natural immune systems have degraded. And then there's all the demands and effects of the technological suite (is that the term you use?) of producing antibiotics. <br><br>I was reading a book about Edison back then and came to the conclusion that invention is the mother of necessity more than the other way around. <br><br>It seems to me that we are almost hard wired to be in a tribal setting and I just wonder if civilization allows us to express our nature, at whatever level.<br><br>Some say that what ever we do is natural, because we came out of nature.

You'd probably wind up blacklisted like a few of my friends if you spoke up like they did about absurdity of needing a mobile phone for your job, especially an allegedly "smart" one. A friend of mine in Japan managed to continue delivery work without a phone (this was ten years ago, I don't know if he has managed to continue, but I still see operational public phones about one/km, so it is likely he could). His company was happy because he was not distracted, playing games on company time, texting while driving, etc. Likewise, I have managed to hang onto an "on-call" sort of translation job by being near my landline at agreed on times. You have to go the extra mile to make sure the work is safely in their hands before you go out, but they are happy with the result. The discrimination in Japan does not seem to be quite as intense as in America, so I am lucky, but it also appears to me that the level of discrimination in Britain has decreased, with fewer rabid attacks on the functionally impaired recently in comment sections, so it may be a phase.<br><br>I would expect the latest research results confirming carcinogenicity of the microwave frequencies involved to produce a backlash at first (Prof. Olle Johanssen in Sweden (Karolinska Institute) appears to have been forced into early retirement as a direct result), but once the hysteria dies down there may be a growing demand for the right not to irradiate oneself and one's family.<br><br><a href=#c2532162550545538853 title="comment permalink">6/5/16, 12:12 AM</a><br><br>

As long as the medical industry makes its profits, who cares about the patients? That is to say, there are very good reasons why over on this side of the pond, where that sort of thinking has gone into overdrive, so many people used alternative health care. <br><br>Shane, I'll agree with you that the Confederacy is likely to become Retrotopia when I read that Southerners are ditching their cars and air conditioners. Mind you, I'd like to see it!<br><br>Cherokee, thank you. Yes, that sounds like a marvelous day at the beach! When my age was still in single digits, we used to go out to the Washington coast, where the water's always icy and the weather is usually gray and damp, and the wind blows off the gray ocean across long gray beaches and low gray dunes into conifers so dark green they look black. To me, that's still the most beautiful place in the world, and my default for a nice day at the beach has nothing to do with sun and scanty clothing. As for digital media -- yep. The internet, for all the yammering about how information-rich it is, is actually profoundly impoverished in terms of information. Lots of data, but very little information. More on this in a future post!<br><br>Doctor W., yes, and indeed that's been hinted at indirectly in talking about the World Bank and IMF trying to push loans on the Lakeland Republic. I won't be front and centering it, because the main focus of the story is elsewhere, but it's going to be referenced a little further on. <br><br>Scotlyn, a refreshingly cold bit of realism. Thank you. <br><br>Phil, exactly. The idea that all or most or much of what's wrong with our decisions here and now can be conveniently credited to something someone did a very long time ago strikes me as an unhelpful evasion. <br><br>Robert, I'm one of the people who reject the idea that human beings are in any way separate from nature. That doesn't mean that everything we do is good or healthy or beneficial -- it's pure mawkish sentimentality to consider nature any of these things, unless you mean to establish a system of values that differs sharply from those popular in the western world just now. (There are Druids who've done that, saying "Nature is good" -- meaning not "nature corresponds to human ideas of goodness" but "we take the ways of nature as the basis for our sense of values.") Nature includes leeches, tapeworms, and bubonic plague; it includes death and decay just as much as life and growth; it embodies the processes that brought our species into being and the processes that will wipe us out in due time. <br><br>Looking for some wrong turn that human beings made presupposes that there's a right and wrong in nature, that we know what it is, and that we have any business passing judgment on the evolutionary history of our species. I reject all those. To my mind, when you start looking for some awful mistake in the distant human past, your thinking is being influenced by the Christian heritage of our culture -- and not for the better. For all we know, after all, our species came into being because Gaia wanted the thermostat nudged up a couple of points, and all our capacities and limitations were given us so we could accomplish that goal!<br><br>Nastarana, heh heh heh. Stay tuned! As for a post about military incompetence, as it happens, that's way up on the stack, due to some details I learned about a short time ago. More on this very soon. <br><br>Ed-M, oh, I'm sure that it's still theoretically possible to avoid the kind of Kessler-syndrome catastrophe I've used as a plot element in <i>Retrotopia</i>. I'm equally sure that the things that could be done won't be done, and the end of the space age will follow in due time.

The thought that Third World countries should act in their own best interests, tell the developed countries to keep their high-tech trinkets, and build their own economies on an intermediate-technology basis is utterly unthinkable to such. <br><br>Cortes, you're welcome and thank you. You're right that I should clarify the point about newspapers -- yes, the newspaper and magazine industry in the Lakeland Republic is diverse and decentralized, with hundreds of independently owned local newspapers and nearly as many competing publishers in the magazine trade; that'll go into the revisions for book publication. As for Bradbury, one of the things that set him apart from a lot of other SF writers -- and especially from most of the current crop -- is that he was willing to ask hard questions about technology.

So simple and yet so profound. That is exactly what it meant once.<br> I thought of those towns in the late 19th century Australia that would pool their resources and raise subscriptions to pave the roads, light the streets with gas lights, build hospitals and schools, etc. It was sort of an unmentioned belief that each generation had a duty to make life better for that following and so you just got on with it and that prosperity would result from these investments to the public good - and it worked!<br> Nowadays we have a breed of politicians that deem their job be to manage people's expectations to accept a lower standard of living as time goes by with more onerous restrictions in our lives but it wasn't always like this. Our society was not always a homage to entropy but was something that was to be grown and made better on a continuous basis.

They wanted your brakes to work, headlights, everything. The sticker was $15 in the 70s, and I used to paint fake ones for $5 - it took careful painting, no brush strokes could show.

Do you not pass judgement on that? <br><br>I consider myself a radical, in the literal sense: getting at the root of the problem. In my farming experience, thistle has been one of the most problematic, because it is so darned prickly and deep rooted. You can yank it out by hand, but that is almost not worth the time because the root is so big and deep. I use a specific tool that reaches a good 8" deep to pull up as much as I can. To relate it to our discussion, I would consider that your analysis goes 4" deep and I would like to go the 8" deep route. Please don't hold me to the math, I'm just spitballing : ) You advocate a return to previous levels of technology, which I think totally gets at the root. I also very much appreciate your promotion of voluntary adoption of various levels of technology, as that provides for liberty and rich experimentation. <br>AND, I am troubled by your repeated assertions that I am "looking for some wrong turn" and that it is a Christian influenced folly. I am pretty sure that these are both not true and suspect that you are responding to perspectives you have experienced that look like what I am saying, but aren't the same, in important ways. Maybe a change of language would help. In permaculture, there is the term "type 1 error". It refers to a decision or a pattern of decisions that set up a disfunctional inertia that is extremely difficult to ameliorate. Commodification of labor resources and natural resources is a good example. I am convinced that the effects of this are severely destructive. It is an abstraction that destroys the spirit of the resources that it is supposedly valuing. So, in terms of the Lakeland Republic, is this not an issue, in your opinion? To get down to it: do you think commodification and managed capitalism are viable options? <br>To put is simply, you advocate for going back to previous, simpler technologies; I advocate for going back even further. We may even be forced to by global events. I have no idea what the coming collapse will look like, but I definitely resonate with the parameters you've outlined. <br><br>I certainly don't think that nature or the universe is good or bad, it just is what it is: mysterious and magical. And from your comments, I extrapolate that you think the word "natural" actually has no meaning. I strongly disagree. Language, as any abstraction, is severely limited. But to, in effect, discount a language concept as having no basis in reality is a mistake, in my opinion. <br>And I don't know how tongue in cheek your reference to Gaia wanting us to raise the temp of the earth was, but I consider any assignment of intentionality to Earth as absurdly anthropomorphic. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c4270932639380069655 title="comment permalink">6/5/16, 2:35 PM</a><br><br>

If there were at least three, the computer would triangulate from the satellites' predicted positions at that time and give you your position down to about 100 meters. Those satellites were not in geostationary orbit, and I don't know if that has changed since, but triangulation would not work, I think, with a line of satellites above the equator. Thus GPS would be vulnerable to the Kessler Syndrome.<br><br>Regarding spices for Indian food, there are only a few such as cinnamon and black pepper that really need a tropical climate. Turmeric grows okay in temperate zones, but if winter temperatures fall below freezing, you have to dig up and store the roots until spring, and the result is you don't get quite as much yellow from them. That would be hothouse, or maybe trading with Texas. This year, I've finally had luck with cumin. It just seems to need a rain-free microclimate and rich soil. So now I am proudly Mexican food-independent right here by Mt. Fuji! I do very well with Thai and Indian food, too, but the trade in turmeric and black pepper will be important.

There is a short mention on his website, https://thecontraryfarmer.wordpress.com/2016/05/31/farewell-dear-gene/. The man could write- In addition to "The Contrary Farmer", his most famous book, he wrote a book about how to make a traditional manure pack for animals confined in winter, "Holy S---", that I read in one sitting, and I'm a town boy with clean hands. He was nearly as prolific as our host-that is just the one that I own.<br><br>Here is a nice sample, from his post "Dancing with the Weeds"<br><br>"Fighting weeds in the beginning of farming was something of an art form and not so back-breaking because many people “made light the task.” In the early Middle Ages, without metal-bladed hoes, the first agriculturists used a forked stick in one hand and a hooked stick (called a weed hook) in the other. The idea was to avoid bending over so much. Advancing across a crop field, the farmer used the forked stick to push down the top of a weed and pin it to the soil surface until, moving forward, he could step on it with one foot while his other foot was holding down the weed he had previously pinned to the ground. That weed he would pull out of the ground by hooking it close to its base with the weed hook in his other hand. Thus he would glide forward: pinning down a weed ahead of him while simultaneously hooking and pulling out the one behind him already pinned down. As he did so, he left the pulled weeds in neat mulch rows for the later harvesters to walk on as they cut the grain. The whole process required practiced skill and an athletic sense of measured balance. Dorothy Hartley wrote in her fascinating book Lost Country Life (1979) that this rhythmical action “was perhaps very like a swinging dance.” To make sure the work did not get too oppressive, the weed dancers were allowed generous noontime breaks for napping, so old medieval records reveal."<br><br><a href=#c3890289197386878375 title="comment permalink">6/6/16, 11:15 AM</a><br><br>

Prisoners do a TON of manufacturing and labor now, from taking airline reservations over the phone to making US military uniforms; do you think the Wehrmacht and the SS were the only soldiers to wear prisoner-made uniforms?

The public is already on board, if you went to prison you must have done something wrong. <br><br>Jon From Virginia - Also, a basic hoe isn't that hard to make. Take any flat rock and sharpen it, and make a hoe. You can also just use a stick with a "base" where it was taken off a larger branch, and make a decent hoe for soft soil. Also, there's always sending the kids out and having them pull weeds. This is why weed pulling, and dish washing, don't bug me now.

That is, to solve the equations for location also requires solving them for time. With four satellites in view, you can solve for latitude, longitude, altitude, and time of day, and the time estimate is VERY accurate. It is so accurate that electric power stations use it to synchronize phasing and switching of the grid flow, and wireless communications networks use it to arbitrate whose turn has come to transmit (and whose to receive), on a millisecond by millisecond basis (so your conversations seem continuous). Some radio broadcast stations synchronize multiple transmitters, so you can travel from one broadcast cell to another without noticing. <br><br>In fact, a 13 MICROsecond glitch in GPS operations took a UK broadcaster off the air.[http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35463347 ...

Moreover, the friend who had me investigate what new pollutant was causing widespread illness in Tokyo in 1996, from which I learned about what the Soviets called "radiowave illness" and that I had been increasingly affected too, was upper class (and it really is a credit to the US that we automatically assumed the ability to be friends), and when push came to shove, phone use had to be rationalized, whereas I had the freedom (and it really is a freedom) to reject it.

In particular, he notes that the Russians have made a conscious effort to learn from their mistakes and from history and it's paid off in Ukraine and Syria. <br><br>Concerning the Russian military campaign in Syria, Lind writes<br><br><i>Operationally, the Russians have shown they can still design a campaign. By 1943/44, they were as competent at the operational level as the Germans. The U.S. remains as operationally incompetent as it always has been. Its campaign plans in Iraq and Syria were hopelessly warped by Washington’s insistence on democracy. As one Marine battalion commander, recently returned from Afghanistan, said at a Boyd Conference, “Talking to a 14th century Afghan villager about the government in Kabul is like talking to your cat about the back side of the moon. You don’t know what it’s like and he doesn’t care.”<br><br>But even with the politics removed, the U.S. military does operational art at the kindergarten level. After the First Gulf War, the U.S. Army preened and said it had shown the Russians it could now do operational art. It looked that way for a couple years, until it came out that the Republican Guard had gotten out of the Kessel largely unscathed. Frank’s “left hook” attack was classic French methodical battle, meaning it was too slow. Schwarzkopf had just one operational decision to make during the whole campaign, to switch the Schwerpunkt to McCaffrey after Frank’s fatal slowness was evident. He failed to make it. In the end, the Iraqis carried out their operational retreat better than the U.S. carried out its operational advance.<br><br>Tactically, Russian tactics are easier to learn and more effective than American tactics. We know that from the Army’s National Training Center; the Soviet-model OPFOR was quite open about it when I visited there.</i><br><br>Lind's observations are mirrored by a former NATO military officer who blogs under the name Shellback. Shellback wrote an op-ed a while back titled "<a href=http://russia-insider.com/en/history/nato-would-probably-lose-war-against-russia/ri1596 rel=nofollow>NATO Would Probably Lose a War Against Russia</a>", which has some very interesting observations.<br><br><a href=#c7724973101865596211 title="comment permalink">6/7/16, 4:57 PM</a><br><br>

If an errant cat toy jams your Roomba, no algorithm is going to get it unstuck. More sophisticated software won't necessarily make people interested in having computers on their faces. A faster computer chip isn't going to bring down the cost of the <a href=https://store.makerbot.com/filament/ rel=nofollow>fairly expensive plastic</a> used by most entry-level 3D printers — nor will it make consumers interested in having a lot of plastic junk lying around the house.<br><br>"So when trying to predict if a new digital product will get better over time, it's helpful to ask whether the big problems are related to a lack of computing power or something else. For example, I'm bullish about self-driving cars because the challenges there mostly are software-related. It seems likely that collecting enough data and throwing enough computing power at it will eventually lead to cars that can drive themselves more safely than could human beings.<br><br>"But a lot of other futuristic gadgets are being held back by physical complexity, consumer inconvenience, or a simple lack of value for consumers.
