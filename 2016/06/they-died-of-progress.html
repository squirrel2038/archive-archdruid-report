<div class=MsoNormal>
I'd intended this week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report </i>to continue the discussion of education that got started two weeks ago, but that’s going to have to wait a bit. As my readers have doubtless learned over the last ten years, whichever muse guides these essays is a lady of very irregular habits, and it happens tolerably often that what she has to say isn’t what I had in mind. This is one of those times. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In last month’s installment of my ongoing <i>Retrotopia</i>
narrative, one of the characters summed up her position in a bit of intellectual heresy that left the viewpoint character flummoxed. Her argument was that progress has become the enemy of prosperity. That’s something you can’t even suggest in today’s society; the response of the viewpoint character— “With all due respect, that’s crazy”—is mild compared to the sort of reactions I’ve routinely fielded whenever I’ve suggested that progress, like everything else in the real world, is subject to the law of diminishing returns. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nonetheless, the unspeakable has become the inescapable in today’s world. It’s become a running joke on the internet that the word “upgrade” inevitably means poorer service, fewer benefits, and more annoyances for those who have to deal with the new and allegedly improved product. The same logic can be applied equally well across the entire landscape of modern technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What’s new, innovative, revolutionary, game-changing, and so on through the usual litany of overheated adjectives, isn’t necessarily an improvement. It can be, and very often is, a disaster. Examples could be drawn from an astonishingly broad range of contemporary sources, but I have a particular set of examples in mind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To make sense of those examples, it’s going to be necessary to talk about military affairs. As with most things in today’s America, the collective conversation of our time provides two and only two acceptable ways to discuss those, and neither of them have anything actually useful to say. The first of them, common among the current crop of American pseudoconservatives, consists of mindless cheerleading; the second, common among the current crop of pseudoliberals all over the industrial world, consists of moralizing platitudes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I don’t particularly want to address the moralizing platitudes just now, other than to say that yes, war is ghastly; no, it’s not going away; and it’s not particularly edifying to watch members of the privileged classes in the countries currently on top of the international order insist piously that war ought to be abandoned forever, just in time to keep their own nations from being displaced from positions they won and kept at gunpoint not that many decades ago. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The cheerleading is another matter, and requires a more detailed analysis. It’s common among the pseudoconservative right these days to insist that the United States is by definition the world’s most powerful nation, with so overwhelming a preponderance of military might that every other nation will inevitably have to bow to our will or get steamrollered. That sort of thinking backstops the mania for foreign intervention that guides neoconservatives such as Hillary Clinton on their merry way, overthrowing governments and destabilizing nations under the fond delusion that the blowback from these little adventures can never actually touch the United States. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In America these days, a great deal of this sort of cheerleading focuses on high-tech weapons systems—inevitably, since so much of contemporary American pop culture has become gizmocentric to the point of self-parody. Visit a website that deals with public affairs from a right-of-center viewpoint, and odds are you’ll find a flurry of articles praising the glories of this or that military technology with the sort of moist-palmed rapture that teenage boys used to direct to girlie-mag centerfolds. The identical attitude can be found in a dizzying array of venues these days, very much including Pentagon press releases and the bombastic speeches of politicians who are safely insulated from the realities of war. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s only one small difficulty here, which is that much of the hardware in question doesn’t work. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The poster child here is the F-35 Lightning II fighter. It so happens that I’ve faced a certain amount of recent embarrassment with regard to this plane, for a curious reason.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Back in 2013 and 2014, when I was writing my novel<i>Twilight’s Last Gleaming</i>, I worked out what I thought was a reasonable estimate of the F-35’s performance in combat against Chinese J-20 and J-31 fighters. That estimate wasn’t exactly in accord with the dewy-eyed accounts just mentioned; the F-35—called the Lardbucket by Air Force pilots in my novel, due to its short range and sluggish performance in the air—came out decidedly second-best, suffering three losses for every two Chinese planes shot down. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As it turns out, though, my guess at the F-35’s performance was far too optimistic. The more data slips past the Scylla of Lockheed’s publicity flacks and the Charybdis of their equal and opposite numbers in the Air Force, the clearer it becomes that the Lardbucket is an utter dog of a plane,
<a href=http://fortune.com/2015/08/14/f-35-joint-strike-fighter/ >so grossly underpowered and so overloaded with poorly functioning gimmickry</a> that nearly every other fighter in current service can outperform it with ease. For example, if the F-35’s stealth features are to work, the plane can only carry <a href=http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/inventions/f35-in-new-dogfight-over-chinese-russian-stealth-fighter-advances/news-story/7bf7e5d14094542ed21119a19572548d>two air-to-air missiles and two bombs</a>—a quarter the firepower of similar planes in other air forces. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Persistent reports, hotly denied by Lockheed and the Pentagon but still not yet disproved by the simple demonstration that would be necessary, claim that the vertical takeoff version of the plane has so little thrust that it can’t even get off the ground with a full fuel tank. Mind you, this embarrassing object is the most expensive military procurement program in history, scheduled to cost the Pentagon some $1.5 trillion by the time purchases are completed. Meanwhile, the Russians and Chinese are fielding fast, heavily armed, maneuverable long-range fighters for a fraction of the F-35’s hefty price tag, and those fighters are going into service while the F-35 lumbers through one production delay after another. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Some of my readers may be wondering if this is simply one bad apple out of an otherwise sound barrel. Not so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Navy has an equal embarrassment on its hands right now, the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), another high-tech, high-priced failure. The LCS costs $37 billion a pop, and has been marketed as the be-all and end-all of coastal warfare craft. If this sounds reminiscent of the praise lavished on the F-35, it should—<a href=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-05/us-navy-spends-37-billion-ship-that-barely-works>and the results are comparable</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Like the F-35, the LCS is packed to the gunwales with high-tech gimmickry that doesn’t work as advertised, and it’s so finicky to run that after a minor maintenance error, one of the few LCSs in service <a href=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-07/damage-extensive-for-crippled-u-s-littoral-ship-in-singapore>has been laid up for five months at a dock in Singapore</a> while technicians try to figure out whether there’s any way to repair it short of towing it back across the Pacific to the shipyard. Meanwhile, the Chinese are fielding a new fleet of fast, heavily armed littoral combat ships for a small fraction of the cost. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Two bad apples? Consider the SBX missile defense system, which was supposed to track incoming ICBMs and knock them out of the sky. <a href=http://graphics.latimes.com/missile-defense/ >It’s a $10 billion dollar flop</a>; none of its array of high-tech gizmos—the flying lasers, the antimissile rockets, the gargantuan seaborne radar—does what it’s supposed to do. Consider the Air Force’s Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECCS), a computer system designed to handle logistics for overseas deployments, which <a href=http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/aerospace/military/the-us-air-force-explains-its-billion-ecss-bonfire>ate a billion dollars and seven years</a> before being cancelled as a complete failure. Consider, for that matter, the Army’s new pixellated camouflage uniform, $5 billion in the making, which had to be scrapped when it turned out that <a href=http://gizmodo.com/5921291/us-armys-pixellated-camo-uniform-is-a-5bil-failure>it sticks out like a sore thumb against every environment on Earth</a>.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I could go on. These programs, and many others, were sold to politicians and public with lavish claims about their ability to perform every imaginable military mission. As it turned out, they were well designed to carry out devastating raids on the US Treasury, and that’s about it. The US military is certainly the most expensive military in the world, and it’s equipped with a gaudier assortment of high-tech trinkets than any other, but it’s not actually that well prepared to carry out its ostensible purpose—that is to say, warfare. The results can be seen with painful clarity in the last three-quarters of a century of US military history. Ask yourself this, dear reader: since the end of the Second World War, how many wars has the United States actually won? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are two factors at work here, and both of them unfold from broader patterns in American society. The first is the descent of the United States into overt kleptocracy on a scale that makes Third World dictators drool with envy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In today’s America, a very large number of government and corporate officials alike overtly treat their positions as opportunities for plunder. Consider the stock-buyback programs that are standard among Fortune 500 corporations these days. The corporation spends its money buying shares of stock to inflate stock prices, boosting the net worth of corporate insiders, who get hige blocks of shares as part of their compensation packages. The expenditure of business funds for the personal benefit of influential insiders used to be prosecuted as embezzlement; now it’s business as usual—and don’t even get me started about the absurd salaries and bonuses currently shoveled into the laps of CEOs and other overpriced office fauna. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On the other side of the coin we have government officials who serve in various positions where they can benefit corporate interests, and then leave their jobs and are hired by the corporations they used to deal with as, ahem, consultants, pulling in very high salaries for very little apparent labor. Corruption? I see no reason to give it any more polite name, and it’s played a major role in providing the US armed forces with fighters that can’t fight, camouflage that doesn’t camouflage, and so on, through the long catalogue of military-procurement failures that have equipped America’s soldiers, sailors, and pilots with embarrassingly substandard gear. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, there’s something else going on here. All the most egregious examples of military-procurement failure in recent years have had something in common: they were supposed to be revolutionary new breakthroughs using exciting new technology, and so on drearily through the most overused rhetoric of our age. The cascading failures of the F-35 can be traced straight to that sort of thinking; its designers apparently believed with all their hearts that every innovation must be an improvement, and so came up with a plane that fails in the most innovative ways you care to imagine. The LCS, the SBX, the ECCS, the pixellated camo uniforms, all fell victim to the same trap—their designers were so busy making them revolutionary that they forgot to make them work. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Compare this with the very different approach of another major power—Russia—and it’s not hard to see the flaws in that dubious logic. The Russian approach to military technology has been evolutionary, not revolutionary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Where the US set out to create an antiballistic missile defense system from scratch, Russia took the incremental approach. They started with the S-300 air defense system, a sturdy piece of Soviet-era equipment designed to shoot down airplanes, cruise missiles, and the like, and built on that foundation in a cautious, step-by-step fashion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The S-300 thus gave way in due time to the S-400, which had a variety of solidly tested incremental improvements, and then to the S-500, scheduled for deployment this year, which adds in the ability to target incoming ballistic missiles in near space. The Russian logic was as straightforward as it was irrefutable: if you want something to destroy lots of very fast objects at high altitude, start with something that can destroy a more modest number of slower objects at lower altitudes, and then tinker carefully from there. That approach works; ours doesn’t. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What makes the American obsession with revolutionary breakthroughs so dysfunctional isn’t just that it so often yields substandard<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> results; it'</span>s that it’s being paid for at the expense of essential military needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Here’s an example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The US Marine Corps has, on paper, a substantial fleet of F/A-18 fighter-bombers—276 of them. In fact, though, <a href=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/17/budget-cuts-leaving-marine-corps-aircraft-grounded.html>less than a third of them can fly</a>. The Marines are so short of spare parts that their mechanics are having to decide which planes to keep airworthy and which ones to strip for parts. The helicopters the Marines use to ferry forces from ship to shore are in the same condition, with 105 of 147 Super Stallion copters more or less permanently grounded. There are plenty of other examples; right now, between high-tech flops that don’t work and working technologies that have been starved of maintenance and spare parts, the US military is in appalling condition</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The exception that proves the rule is the nuclear arm, which has been steadfastly ignoring high-end gimmickry for decades. It turns out, for example, that the launch systems for America’s nuclear-armed ICBMs still use<a href=http://www.geek.com/chips/americas-nuclear-arsenal-still-runs-off-of-8-inch-floppy-discs-1592596/ >8 inch floppy disks to store the launch codes</a>. Those ICBMs, by the way, are Minuteman IIIs, which were introduced in 1970—the missile that was supposed to replace the Minuteman, the MX Peacekeeper, was deployed in the 1980s but turned out to be yet another of the Pentagon’s overpriced white elephants, and was quietly decommissioned between 2003 and 2005. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The other two legs of the so-called nuclear tripod are just as elderly. The Trident nuclear submarine is another 1980s technology, still chugging away sedately at its mission, while the airborne leg still relies on the geriatric B-52, a 1950s design with modest incremental improvements tacked on. There were two attempts to replace the B-52; the B-1, which turned out to be a lousy plane and mostly does ground attack duties these days, and the B-2 stealth bomber, which was so expensive that only 12 of them are in service, and is no longer invisible to state-of-the-art air defense systems. Since nuclear weapons are the one US military asset that must always be ready to function, no matter what, it’s telling that the Pentagon’s planners have quietly allowed old but sturdy technologies to remain in service there—though it’s anyone’s guess how well maintained those technologies are at this point. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That strategy probably won’t be viable in the long term.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Military procurement fraud is as old as war, and overinvestment in the latest fashionable gimmick is tolerably common as far back as historical records reach. Every nation’s political and military establishment has to contend with both, and most manage to keep them within the bounds necessary to ensure national survival. Those nations that don’t restrict them in this manner normally go under, and this mode of failure is particularly common in the declining years of great powers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who’ve read up on the last years of vanished empires—the Austro-Hungarian or Ottoman Empires, Romanov Russia or Habsburg Spain, and so on down the list of history’s obituaries—know the results already: the imperial state reduced to a massive but fragile shell, invincible in appearance but shockingly vulnerable in reality, resting ever more unsteadily on a crumbling foundation of ineffective or broken weapons, decaying or abandoned facilities; a political leadership blithely unaware of the gap between its fantasies of invincibility and the reality of accelerating systemic failure; a high command too busy feathering its own nest and playing political games to notice the widening cracks; and a dwindling corps of servicepeople, overworked, underpaid, and demoralized, who nonetheless keep on struggling to prop up the whole brittle mess until the inevitable disaster sweeps their efforts aside once and for all. </div>
<br>
All this is standard. What’s different in the present situation, though, is the all but universal conviction in American society, from top to bottom, that the lessons being taught so insistently by the F-35 and its fellow embarrassments cannot and must not be learned. Yet another round of innovative, revolutionary, breakthrough technologies is not going to solve America’s military problems, since those problems were caused or worsened by previous rounds of innovative, revolutionary, breakthrough technologies. Nonetheless, that’s the conventional wisdom in today’s United States, and in an embarrassingly large number of its allies—and history offers no encouragement at all to those who want to believe that this can end well. </div>

The jets short take off on the LHDs and then land vertically on said boats. I don't mind product bashing, if it's accurate. I will say I don't read press about the jets, or the US military, because what is reported isn't always true - and by that I mean the good and the bad news isn't always true. I have witnessed some of the things you talk about in your article first hand and it deeply worries me. I have also witnessed times when the people and products you're talking about work 'as advertised' and it is thrilling! I am painting a target on my back here, but I wanted to comment to let you know that I both bristle at your statements, and yet have to agree with many of them. That's difficult to admit. Thanks for the reality check. On the one hand the 'cutting edge of technology' and progress had enough appeal for me to pursue as a career furthering the cause after college. On the other hand, as I get older, and read and absorb more of the idea of diminishing returns and what's in store for us in the future...I wonder how much longer the industry I work in will really last.I wonder how many people will be working harder and longer hours to prove they are worthy of being kept employed to keep enjoying their upper middle class engineer status as the funding dries up for the various programs that are currently underway. This post today was a good reminder to me to keep working on my 'out' plan and refocus on the things that will actually matter for the future. <br>One other thought: I am currently listening to the audio book of Capitol Dames by Cokie Roberts. It's insightful, following the lives, political maneuvers and gopinions of the women whose husbands were involved in ruling the nation right before and during the civil war. The picture that is painted of the national tension, the inability of congress to get along, let alone affect change, the budget issues and social issues of the day are fascinating because I can't help but draw strong parallels to what is going on today. I am encouraged to hear so many stories of brave women who used their position and/or talents to bring good in their local community - I guess times of tribulation can bring out the best in people and spur them to create better ways of doing things (as has been covered in retro-topia). On the other hand, it's a disconcerting because wow, change out a few scenarios and the book could be present day commentary. The book's description of the fear of violence on Lincoln's inauguration day made me immediately wonder how that same day will go in 2017...<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c5438418203156491195 title="comment permalink">6/8/16, 6:24 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, it would be wonderful if there was never war in Taiwan ever again, but the reality - which the Taiwanese people cannot change - is that Taiwan is next to China, and that China has repeatedly threatened military invasion, and given that the People's Republic of China has launched many military attacks against the buffer islands between mainland China and Taiwan, there is every reason to believe that the PRC is entirely sincere about this stated intent. The main reason why the PRC has not launched a full military invasion already is that they know that it would be so costly that it might destabilize their own government. In order to make sure that the cost of an invasion remains too high, the Taiwanese need to invest a lot of resources in their own military. That is why Taiwanese leftists advocate for increasing military spending! (Also, Taiwanese leftists get mad when the United States Government tries to sell the Taiwanese military overpriced junk, and Taiwanese leftists also favor investment in the local arms manufacturing industry). <br><br>I think Lee Kuan Yew once said something like "the only reason why the Tibet is a part of the PRC and Taiwan is not is that the Taiwanese has a better military."<br><br>On the flip side, when I talk to a lot of westerners about this situation (regardless of whether they are 'liberal' or 'conservative') a common reaction is 'but how could Taiwan possibly defend itself against China, China is so big and Taiwan is so small.' Which shows that a lot of the westerners I talk to don't understand the concept of asymmetric warfare. The Taiwanese military don't need to a match for the Chinese military in any kind of absolute sense, they just need to make it excessively difficult for the Chinese military to invade Taiwan. Taiwan is a mountain island, which gives a defending military a huge advantage over an invading military.<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c8801009444141180256 title="comment permalink">6/8/16, 7:26 PM</a><br><br>

No technological wizardry, other than inventing a more energy-dense fuel source can improve their performance will let the technologies perform beyond the fundamental limits of their power sources. Sure, things like better avionics or radar-absorbing coatings or lighter alloys make them a bit better, but it is basically lipstick on a pig. <br><br>This is an excellent, short read:<br><br>http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html<br><br>If you do the math, the Apollo capsule that landed on Earth represented 0.2% of the weight of the vehicle that took off for the moon a couple days prior (of course, that includes left-behind equipment, but a lot of that mass was fuel). For Mars, even if you ignore the change in mass due to the life-support requirements, the mass ratio of Earth return capsule to launch would probably be more like 0.02% - probably if you include life support, 0.005% because the Earth-Mars-Earth vehicle would be pretty heavy.<br><br>I would argue that war has more than a few things in common with space missions - you need to support a group of people doing something energetic and dangerous from far away from your resource base that requires supplies which cannot be furnished in situ. The more energetic and complicated the process of war is, the more supplies needed to be transported to battle - and to use the space analogy, the costs on the launchpad are 100 times the value of what is delivered to orbit/Iraqstanizuela. Sun Tzu said something to this effect - it costs 1 cart of silver in peacetime, and 7 carts in wartime to maintain a military unit or something like that.<br><br>Maybe there's some cosmic justice in this, but it turns out that war carried out with fanatics with AK's, IEDs and suicide bombs is so phenomenally inexpensive compared to drone strikes, tanks and a professional army that the former approach often wins the day. Of course, there is a cost in blood, which is how it perhaps should be. In another (horrifying) example of how hyper-technological war distorts what Conan would say is the natural order of things, one force behind the low official casualty rates from the United States recent military adventures is medical technology.<br><br>Every group of Americans who deliberately goes into combat is shadowed by a sophisticated, petroleum powered medevac system. This is often not a bad thing, as there is a subset of war-related injuries that are very dangerous in the short-term but can be recovered from easily enough with few long-term consequences. Of course, this isn't always the case. Although it's technically impressive that it is often possible to save the life of a 20 year old whose legs and genitals (they never mention those, but they're quite squishy) have been blown off by an IED, well, what would Conan say? There is false accounting in everything that Empire does it seems.<br><br><br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c7799618168566755561 title="comment permalink">6/8/16, 7:35 PM</a><br><br>

It was a report on the budget meetings the top brass at the Navy held with Congress over their bi-annual budget. The Admirals had prepared a budget, but when 9/11 happened they scrapped it and quickly revised a new one appropriate to the new threat.<br><br>I can't find the original article and am remembering only the broadest of factors, Hopefully one of our commenters more adept at military issues can correct me or fill in what I'm skimming over- But from what I recall, the admirals asked Congress for a large number of small, older model, very fast patrol boats to cover our 3 coastlines, a handful of larger ships for longer distance and mostly money to recommission, maintain and spruce up older know-to-be-reliable larger warships, aircraft carriers, etc… They were being practical and going with what the knew worked. Congress denied their request and their total budget went to continued development of the monstrosity you detailed in your essay. The monstrosity would not be ready for another decade. The navy would have no benefit from it for that many years even if it did work as planned. And even if it did work as designed, it was too large and cumbersome to be any kind of effective weapon. The Navy had never wanted it.

The rest had to sit on the runway - shades of Pearl Harbour in '41. The story is at http://fortune.com/2016/04/28/f-35-fails-testing-air-force/<br><br> The new Zumwalt-class destroyer, which has been optimized for stealth in its design, now has questions raised if it would be stable and not capsize in the rough waters of, say, an ocean.

JMG has it right. The Russians and others use a Kaizen approach (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) whereas the west wants dramatic, lucrative Big Projects.<br><br> This next one gets me. The US Navy introduced a Navy Working Uniform that has a blue digital camouflage pattern which means that if a sailor falls in to the water, he will be perfectly camouflaged. That is bad enough but what is unforgivable is that there is so much nylon in the uniforms that in a fire the plastic will melt to the sailor's skin resulting in terrible burns. The article is at http://www.stripes.com/news/navy-says-working-uniforms-are-extremely-flammable-1.200831 but what floored me there was the statement that "The Navy removed its requirement that all uniforms be flame-resistant in 1996". For God's sake, why?<br><br> On a lighter note. The Littoral Combat Ship, as mentioned in this week's essay, has its own problems. The original concept was this ship would have Mission Modules for Anti-submarine warfare, mine hunter, surface warfare, and special warfare missions that could be swapped in and out the hull as needed. After much research I believe that I have discovered the inspiration for this concept.

Lovecraft and Philosophy</i>) has revived my interest in modern philosophers. <br><br>Rob, excellent! There too, though, revolutionary innovations have a habit of falling flat; what makes a winning strategy is uncertainty, not actual novelty, since most of what works in war has been known since Egyptian times. I recently read a very solid book on cavalry in the Napoleonic wars; the author made the point up front that the same principles that govern tank warfare today governed cavalry warfare in Napoleon's time.

One way or another, the experience of military defeat is going to be a shattering blow to the American psyche, and the economic consequences of the collapse of US hegemony will be even more so -- once the US has to get by on its fair share of the world's wealth, after all, all of us will take roughly an eighty per cent pay cut.

I finished Little Women and the Mayan Popol Vuh in the last couple of days. I'm finding the combination of both of those fermenting in my subconscious is having a really profound effect on my imagination, so I decided to continue down the same road by reading Last of the Mohicans along with the Kalevala. <br><br>I appreciate this week's topic and I'm glad you brought it up. I've seen a number of online discussions where US military capabilities are brought up, and the belief in American omnipotence is pretty much universal. I remember a thread on one forum in which the question was asked, "How do other militaries stack up against the United States?" What followed was the usual masturbatory recitation of the number of aircraft carriers et cetera that we have compared to everyone else. Which is about as relevant as the number of heavy cavalry that the French had at the battle of Agincourt. <br><br>The funny thing is, at the time the conversation was being had, the US was currently fighting two wars, in Iraq in Afghanistan, and failing to win both. In other words, there was no reason to have the conversation-- nor is there now. If you want to see how "strong" the US military is, you don't need to go to Wikipedia and look up how many aircraft carriers we have. In the last 50 years, US troops have fought in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Grenada, Lebanon, Panama, Iraq, Somalia, Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq again, Yemen, Sudan, Pakistan, Libya, and Syria, and the results in every case are publicly available.<br><br>In general there are 3 outcomes. Decisive victories have only been against extremely weak enemies (Panama and Grenada). The only partial exception is Iraq under Saddam Hussein. This was also, as far as I know, the only military to engage the US in the kind of World War II set-piece battle it wants to fight. And it's telling that the second time around, Saddam apparently gave his commanders orders to try to hold off the US military long enough to lay the groundwork for the guerrilla war that bogged it down for the next 7-odd years. <br><br>The other two outcomes I see are decisive defeats against apparently weaker opponents (Vietnam, Hezbollah, Somali militias) and, the most common of all, inconclusive disasters that achieve nothing but turning the target nation into a stateless breeding ground for radical Islamists. The latter apparently includes Kosovo, Bill Clinton's signature "humanitarian intervention," according to a recent article in the New York Times. <br><br>But I'm sure we'd trounce the Russians, even though we still haven't defeated the Taliban after 15 years of fighting. After all, we have way more aircraft carriers than they do.<br><br>Another funny thing is-- both liberals and conservatives seem to buy into the myth of American military omnipotence. I recently had a liberal friend tell me, with a straight face, that Trump could "literally be the next Hitler, only with the strongest military in the history of the world." One of the discoveries that I've made by following the "resolving binaries" practice is that this is usually the case-- one reliable way to find the ternary seems to be to figure out what the two existing sides have in common, and then reject that.<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c2325308804390479315 title="comment permalink">6/8/16, 8:04 PM</a><br><br>

When you posted a couple weeks back about flying cars and why we don't have them, you pointed out that the design criteria for cars and planes were opposed in many important ways. You wrote:<br><br>"A flying car is thus by definition going to be mediocre both as a car and as a plane, and due to the added complexities needed to switch from one mode of travel to the other, it’s going to cost so much that for the same price you can get a good car and a good plane, with enough left over to pay hangar rental for quite some time."<br><br>I couldn't help but think about the F-35. While the air force has been trying to ditch the A-10 for years over the objections of the army (because it works!), the brass keeps shoving billions down the F-35 rathole with nothing good to show for it. Progress must be pursued, no matter the costs.<br><br>Meanwhile, my homework assignment has been Gulliver's Travels, as it was on the shelf already but not as long as a Russian classic doorstop. Gulliver's visit to Laputa and Balnibari's academy nailed America's fetishization of innovation half a century before the revolution. In that country, the lives of the peasants were impoverished by the slavish devotion to new ideas - for the sake of new ideas, no matter how ridiculous - on the part of the nation's ruling elite, who lived on an exclusive island floating in the sky. While the elites could crush domestic uprisings - by lowering the floating island onto the uprisers - I couldn't help but wonder how their military would fare against a less "progressive" opponent.<br><br>One last note: when you wrote "The corporation spends its money buying shares of stock to inflate stock prices, boosting the net worth of corporate insiders, who get <b>hige</b> blocks of shares as part of their compensation packages."

I lived with him and my daughter for a short while and got a sample of military thinking. An example, the Army PT at his post in Colorado was so poorly designed that it was wrecking soldier's knees. When SIL described it to a friend who was a Marine the reaction was "that's crazy." When the Marines think your PT is crazy . . . .<br><br>Both SIL and daughter (who was Air Force) were on an assignment that worked 12 hour shifts 5-5. The shifts were rotated every two weeks with a 3 day weekend before the new shift. No one ever had a chance to adapt. I know the DOD funds a lot of research about exercise, metabolism, sleep patterns and so forth. So why on earth do they allow commanders to ignore everything that is learned from that research? I understand that in battle one may need to stay awake for long and unpredictable hours, but the specialty that my family members were in would never be in battle: they were strictly rear support, so what was the point of giving them schedules virtually designed to wreck their health? <br><br>And the camo for the Navy matches the ocean. I'm sorry, if you fall into the ocean don't you want to stand out, and be rescued?

Also, I was actually hoping for a recap on the homework assignment from two weeks ago.<br><br>I, with great distress, read a book written prior to the year 1900, in this case a component book from the bible, Ezekiel. It was disturbing, and it coincidentally deals with warfare, the subject of your post tonight. Consider Ezekiel 9:<br><br>"Go ye through the city after him, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity; slay utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark: and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men that were before the house. And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and smote in the city"<br><br>Such actions from a 21st century perspective are out and out war crimes. Yet, strangely enough, this is still one of the component books of the "Good book". It is hard to surrender the social conditioning of modern civilized time and to view this sort of thing as 'normal'. This is as things were considered normal in yesteryear. Not entirely sure where you were going with this homework thought project??<br><br>Still it reminded me of the infamous 90's gangster film 'Pulp fiction' which quotes from Ezekiel 25-17:<br><br>https://youtu.be/x2WK_eWihdU?t=2s<br><br>Still shocking to modern sensibilities though.<br><br><br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c6013862949970337829 title="comment permalink">6/8/16, 9:26 PM</a><br><br>

Same day service, but not the same quality service as 40 years ago. (Drugs will help with the pain.) Fit is not guaranteed with only three sizes to pick from. <br><br>Service is now focused on the provider and the provider's bottom line, not on providing a lasting set of teeth. After a few years the plastic breaks down and you need a new pair. That is, if you can stand to have the plastic fumes bubbling in your mouth, coloring the taste of everything you try to bite. (If you can bite)<br><br>Products and services are deteriorating all around us. Standards are reworked and schedules are trimmed. Quality is assured in the ads, but not evident in the final product. Stuff is made overseas to “Our exacting specifications,” but you know it's junk, not like the original, once made in a now vacant manufacturing building, upstate or down river in the the Rust Belt. Or it's “Assembled in the USA from parts made in” (See long list of other countries) meaning the workers here added one insignificant do-dad and sealed the box.<br><br>Why can't we get better products made in the USA? Why can't we get better politicians? Why is everything packed with easily broken gizmos and made lighter, cheaply made and crappy.<br><br>When Disney's animators decided to name the anonymous seven dwarves of the fairy tale, the created a list of names to go through.

I am also enjoying the info turning up in the comments. <br><br>So I'm jumping in with two examples from the Seventies for the 'So What Else is New?' portion of this week's discussion.<br><br>I spent 16 of the years 1973-1994 living and working in Scotland's Findhorn Foundation community which was separated from the NATO base RAF Kinloss by eighty acres of barley fields. The RAF crews flew anti-submarine warfare Nimrods built on mid/late Fifties commercial aviation technology. For decades, they more than held their own in NATO competitions with the much more technically sophisticated US AWACS built by Boeing. A constant refrain from the RAF lads was that the Yanks had great gear, but either could not improvise if any of it failed. I gather partial system failures were not too unusual. Thus, the Brits often brought home the winner's cup. They were still doing that in the Nineties when I left. <br><br>In the early Seventies, the Pentagon decided to test NORAD's radar detection systems. They arranged for the Brits to test it. The RAF sent three lumbering, delta wing Vulcan bombers. We used to see them a couple of times a year; ponderous craft reminiscent of Godzilla's avian cousin, Rodan. They were already obsolete, but they not only penetrated the radar shield, they flew all the way to Washington DC undetected until they popped up on radar over the center of the city. Of course, news of that never hit the press, but it was a source of quiet pride for the RAF's officer corps. I heard about it several years later from two officers; one retired, the other still on active duty. <br><br>One last one from the mid-Eighties that hasn't been mentioned yet: the guided missile cruiser, USS Vincennes, that shot down Iran Air Flight 655 in 1988. A couple of years earlier that same ship played an important role in a Tom Clancy thriller. Of course, its technology and crew functioned perfectly on the page, if not for the Iranians a couple of years later. <br><br>If History rhymes rather than repeat itself, then I submit that the Pentagon and the Congressional procurement committees are rhyming in the style of Dr Seuss. I'd have a go but it's late and sleep is by far the sensible option. <br><br>Cheers -- <br><br><br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c6040392044372454755 title="comment permalink">6/8/16, 10:17 PM</a><br><br>

The USA's increasing reliance on the electrical grid in order to do any type of trade has long had me wondering what would happen in the US in an extended grid down scenario, regardless of what caused it. On that note a German friend of mine who has never been to America messaged me today regarding something he'd heard about the USA building FEMA camps. Part of what I said is the following: <br>Most Americans don't know how to grow their own food, or even how to prepare it or store it even if they do grow a few things. They don't know how to live off nature or even talk to each other. But more significantly, 90% of Americans are addicted to at least one substance, whether its cigarettes, alcohol, prescription or illegal drugs. Even if that person is not, one close family member is. So I believe if some "disaster" happened that caused grocery stores to close and water pipes to lose water and drugs to stop being sold, a massive amount of the US population would go willingly to FEMA camps. If they didn't starve it would be because papa can't think without his cigarette or little Timmy needs his asthma inhaler or so and so is hoping they can find their junk in the camp....<br>I think the USA would be near impossible to defeat militaristically. We have some very low tech advantages of geography on our side, though it's not helpful if the USA is the aggressor. But decay from within is happening already....<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c2116680484011541415 title="comment permalink">6/8/16, 11:39 PM</a><br><br>

Hmm, and again hmm. <br><br>Rita, thanks for the data points. Those are great examples. <br><br>Steve, it's certainly been my experience that I get a lot more done by ignoring the latest technology and using old software just as long as it will do the job.

For some reason, though, American popular culture these days is obsessed with revolutionary breakthroughs.

FarFal of "Surviving In Argentina" came to this conclusion also, that while the cities may be bad, the countryside can be far worse. Homesteads get invaded, and there are all sorts of oddballs who "don't play well with others" and I suspect, when the banks are no longer open and CostCo is closed, there will be a lot of rural people shooting each other over a corpsy-tasting poorly stored can of SPAM. Yes, I have no illusions of my doing well in the city or of living any longer than I would in survivalist-land, but I really don't like the dark, misanthropic version of the future the survivalists pine for. <br><br>Maybe small towns are a bit less creepy out where you are, and I don't know (probably don't want to know) what you did to be able to afford a place in the small town you live in. Where I live, to be of the land-owning class, you have to have inherited money or done something like sell used cars or be part of the banking industry to become a land-owner. In other words, your parents got rich screwing people over and left it to you, or you screwed people over and got money. Not made money, or earned money, but "got" money. The result is a lot of really mean people - I've been threatened with being shot over picking up some walnuts lying on the side of the road, in the country.

However these failed systems do not in fact constitute the bulk of the US fighting force. IIRC, the US has 13,000 total combat aircraft, composed of the F-16, F-15, A-10 and such, and this airforce is capable and formidable. I understand similar quality and capability is true of the Naval fleet as well. I understand the Army is in not-so-good shape after fighting unconventional warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan as their recent combat experience and doctrine do not prepare them to fight a comparably equipped regular army, i.e. Russian.<br><br>Reading the tea-leaves of contemporary events (outside of mainstream media of course), one must wonder what is going on. For instance, yesterday 6/7/2016, I stumbled across this:<br> <br>“Numerous reports have now come in to SuperStation95 that an EVACUATION of military families is underway from Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany.  This is usually undertaken ONLY if war is considered "imminent."” See—<br><br>https://www.superstation95.com/index.php/world/1437<br><br>And juxtapose the above with this 6/8/16 essay (15-20 pages by an unidentified poster on theSaker) that presents a case that our gov’t is about to stage a false-flag military attack on Estonia, to be blamed on Russia. A salient snippet reads: “[ex-US-ambassador to Russia] McFaul … doesn’t deny that NATO is aggressively preparing for a war. He openly states that the western governments have declared war on Russia…” The essay also states that Hillary, intentionally or otherwise, telegraphed that a false flag is in the works as she is cited: “Hillary Clinton has already made a statement that “Russian aggression” will take place in Baltic countries.” [no source given]. See-<br><br>http://thesaker.is/michael-mcfaul-we-declared-war-on-russia-what-next-by-scott/<br><br>If our military were in fact composed of the worthless hardware that JMG cites, could we perhaps feel complacent? After all, how much trouble could an ineffective military get us into with a wise enemy? But the above tea-leaves, among others, make me concerned that a real shooting war with Russia is being orchestrated.<br><br>How else might the tea-leaves be read?<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c252995468803809339 title="comment permalink">6/9/16, 1:10 AM</a><br><br>

The teaching is consistent, slowly teaches new skills, and done with a minimum of emotional response. There is no praise given other than an occasional "good" which comes across more as acknowledgment of completion rather than a high level of achievement. There is no progression for a student until they master the current skills. A majority of each class is on foundational basics and mastery of the basics. The entire class is outstandingly good.<br><br>Contrast this with her first ballet school. Owner and the lead teacher both Americans - one lived and taught in a dozen different places, the other never lived anywhere else (Americans all seem to fall into one of these two camps). They taught complex fast paced combinations of movements which occasionally one person could do correctly. Girls turned wrong directions, and arms and legs were at different heights and angles as girls tried to keep up with the frantic pace. After everyone completed an exercise, a paragraph of feedback was given about improvements that could be made. Then rather than repeat the combination with the improvements, they moved on to a new combination right away. <br><br>Both schools send students to compete in a national ballet competition. The Americans get these custom made costumes and publish 25 different Facebook posts leading up to the competition about how awesome they are. The Russians use costumes they have in storage (girls delight in wearing the costume so-and -so wore years before and got first place) and literally do next to no social media. Russians get all top three spots for soloists including top placement for ensemble. The Americans score dead last and blame the judges saying they favor the Russians.<br><br>In passing the Russian teachers say "oh we love it when the Americans come. So funny, so entertaining. We watch and can not believe our eyes. How can anyone do ballet that bad? We wonder." And then they burst out laughing. <br><br>And the Amercian school cost more and demanded more time in the studio.<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c6662650599610286418 title="comment permalink">6/9/16, 2:57 AM</a><br><br>

Bacevich? He's a retired officer in the US Army and after he retired from the military taught history and international relations at Boston University. He's one of the relatively few people who "gets it." Although his focus hasn't been on military technology per se, his writings expose the vulnerabilities of our military overreach and the failures of our nation's post-World War II national security policies (which he calls reliance on the National Security State). His books are well worth your time to read. If you haven't read any of them, I would suggest you start with <i>The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism</i>.<br><br>On another point, you commented that our military isn't "actually that well prepared to carry out its ostensible purpose—that is to say, warfare." When I was growing up, we were always taught that the purpose for a military was to enable the nation to <i>avoid</i> war unless it became clearly and painfully necessary; that our military would be so well-prepared to prevail if called on to fight that nobody would dare mess with it. How far have we strayed from that ideal.<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c7055324863858759484 title="comment permalink">6/9/16, 3:59 AM</a><br><br>

The debacle of the F-35 program reminds me of two things back when I was an officer in the Air Force back in the early to mid 1980s. When the U.S. analyzed a Mig-25 Foxbat that a defecting Soviet pilot flew to Japan in 1976, the engineers were surprised to find how the "fit and finish", and especially the rivets on the exterior, were not polished and smooth - which did not appear to affect performance much, if at all. The other thing I was reminded of was when I presented a speech at Officer Training School, proposing the procurement of the F-20 Tigershark over the F-16 or F-15 fighters, as they were going to be 1/3 the cost. And fighter exercises of NATO versus Warsaw pact planes always were favorable when engaged one-on-one, but not nearly as successful when engaged with the more real-world ratios of 1 on 3 or 1 on 4.<br><br>While I can understand how the F-35 program is such a mess (after all, there's more money to be made in prolonging a problem rather than delivering a solution), but I find the lack of spare parts for existing planes and helicopters quite alarming. If the U.S. actually gets in a real shooting war versus the current staged police actions for political/financial gain, we'll be in serious trouble....<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c5005183427916202245 title="comment permalink">6/9/16, 4:01 AM</a><br><br>

The failure of King Gustavus Adolphus' ultimate weapon in 1627 ought to have taught us and, of course, didn't. I highly recommend an essay by Evan S. Connell called "Gustav's Dreadnought" to add to the point you're making.<br><br>I appreciate what you are saying about the Russian approach to technology, and I expect it's more effective in military matters than in the private sphere, but I'll add a view from the ground, as it were. During my years in ex-Soviet Kyrgyzstan, I learned to view all Russian technology, especially cars, with scorn and frustration. Yes, the cars were easy to repair, since they were simple, but they also needed repair constantly. When my husband, four children, and I were heading to the capital city in a Russian Niva (like a little Jeep), we heard a clunk and found that the brakes had FALLEN OUT into the road. We still had over a hundred miles to go, all downhill, with no brakes. My husband managed to roll into a repair yard on the outskirts of Bishkek by downshifting and turning off the engine -- but this experience was typical until we bought a used German car. I don't speak Russian much -- I learned Kyrgyz -- but I do have a solid vocabulary of Russian names for car parts. If we are considering the greater reliability of tried-and-true technologies, then the Kyrgyz horses and Bactrian camels are infinitely superior. And yet sadly, because of how they had been taught, Kyrgyz farmers would let their grain rot in the field if the village tractor wouldn't work, even with all the horses grazing nearby.<br><br>Did you see that the Vermont Legislature passed a resolution in favor of a steady-state versus a progress-based economy?

However, I must confess that I feel much like Amy Ollie above. I am in a position where I regularly talk to and hear briefings from Navy Acquisition Program Managers and Program Executive Officers (which are just under the Secretariat level) and their feelings about program performance are not nearly as bleak as yours. Now, they are generally motivated to present their programs as positively, but the forum I sit in is a non-attribution, tell-us-how-you-really-feel environment (and they do share many things they wouldn't not want others to know they said).<br><br>I don't have much knowledge of the F-35 (other than Navy PMs are happy it's absorbing John McCain's attention!), but I do know something of LCS, for example, and it is far less expensive than you say. The cost you suggested must be amortizing the R&amp;D costs over the few ships that have been built. The navy is actually rather pleased with the unit cost reductions they have achieved so far. Some do not think it packs enough punch, which is why they are coming out with a Frigate variant that is much better armed. If you want to find a Navy boondoggle, the DDG 1000 is a much better example. It is shaping up to have a $2B unit cost (The DDG 58 class which we are also still building has a unit cost of something like $600M) and has all kinds of new technologies (new in the 80s anyway) and the Navy doesn't really know how to employ it well. They Navy learned a big lesson from that ship which was that we are better off using the evolutionary approach than the revolutionary approach. That is why we are continuing to build more DDG 58 class with incremental improvement. That is also the way we are approaching LCS procurement (buying in blocks, each block having new features introduced instead of all at once as in DDG 1000). <br><br>The SSBN submarines you mentioned are still in service because they haven't yet reached end of life yet. They look nothing like they did when they were built though as they have been modernized many times. They are approaching end of life, which is why we have the Ohio Replacement Program, which is going to suck up a lot of the Navy's budget. They know it will be a must-do, so they are trying to save as much as they can on other programs so we can afford it. <br><br>Finally, I have to emphatically disagree with the culture of corruption, at least below the political appointee level. I just don't see it. Our Navy Acquisition Executive, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research Development and Acquisition strikes me as incorruptible and is always grilling the program managers over getting costs down. Also the program managers I know are all doing everything they can to keep costs down. And believe if or not, the contractors aren't getting very much margin. Our contracts average 12% profit for the contractors. The problem is that these systems are complex and we operate in a huge bureaucracy, which is expensive to feed. <br><br>Just my perspective from the inside. I may be drinking some cool-aide, but not too much I think.<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c1631662154543798044 title="comment permalink">6/9/16, 6:28 AM</a><br><br>

The argument is that increasing technology-progress runs counter to prosperity. However, by thinking intelligently about how to apply technology Russia has created successful advances at a fraction of the cost -- a useless overhead driven by the U.S. arms race, but nevertheless doesn't cripple Russia, it cripples us.<br><br>So apparently it's still possible to continue with progress and allow prosperity, which argues that it may be the problem isn't technology or "progress", but the way it's being implemented by a narrow slice of declining nations. This makes sense: we can probably all imagine an environmentally-minded, sustainable, primitive-seeming sci-fi culture where technology is so advanced it is indistinguishable from magic, and such a thing is probably possible. So if technology can be self-sustainable, can be compatible with happiness, then it's just some technical thing we're doing now that needs to be implemented differently. (at a far lower energy cost, 'natch)<br><br>Of course that may require something like higher morality, refusal to abuse and extract others, so that yes, with low thinking additional technology and power will probably backfire, but our application and intent could be applied to using technology beneficially, even if in all likelihood it will fail us for this civilizational cycle. Just saying, IS progress, higher technology, i.e. application of new knowledge, inherently opposed to happiness or prosperity? Or just to us being idiots right now?<br><br>Won’t matter because nobody’s going to fix anything, but I’m just saying that’s a social choice, not a technical limitation.<br><br>For the technical failures in military and elsewhere, it’s easy: there are no consequences for failure. That’s the whole point of rigging the system, to prevent priviledged insiders from having the risk of competition, and also it's downfall. The downfall for us at the bottom is, so long as the rigging goes on, there are no rewards for success either: they're stolen by the top, as part of the rigging.

There were some very useful concepts woven into it (the concept of “Glek-nas” was particularly resonant with some of the themes we’ve been exploring lately in this blog.) I definitely felt harbingers of early 20th century thought, with the Vril-ya’s political slogan “no happiness without order, no order without authority, no authority without unity” being particularly chilling after some historical perspective, as did the theme of achieving racial superiority through generations of selective breeding. Overall, it felt way ahead of its time, with science fiction tropes, visions of advanced technologies and social institutions that felt much more like products of the ‘20s than the 1870s (the electrically powered mechanical robot servants particularly weren’t something I thought showed up until much later in science fiction). Reading it also put in context huge swaths of some of the more confusing side-tracks in Theosophical literature which borrowed terminology and concepts from this book (now I know where Theosophists got all their talk about ancient Atlantean machines powered by crystals fed with Vril force.). It also shed light on the origin of some of the odd diversions in pop occultism of the early 20th century (such as the attempts to find a material explanation for Nwyfre in electricity, which was kind of that era’s version of late 20th century parapsychology or early 21st century quantum mysticism).<br><br>I think one of the most interesting things to me about the book, though, given that I’d known a little about its influence but never read it, was the difference in tone from what I’d have expected. I was expecting conventional utopian fiction, and it definitely adopts the structure, trappings, and language of a classic utopian novel, but it slowly starts introducing things that make the narrator (and the reader) at first uneasy, and eventually horrified. Upon reading it, I actually think Lytton was deliberately subverting and satirizing the utopian genre (there are even visual elements in it that serve that effect… the Vril-ya wear the wings of angels, but live near the molten core of the earth like devils… which are they?). So it feels to me like he’s taking popular concepts from his culture, such as the emergence of a master race and of a perfect society, and then turning them on their head to show the horror that comes in the complete absence of flaws, and thus remind the reader that flaws in our bodies and societies have a necessity… And so, in his society everyone is happy, everyone is prosperous… but they can’t co-exist with other societies and cultures without exterminating them, they avoid war through the assurance of mutual destruction through their vril-staffs; without struggles or sorrows art and imagination have atrophied; and order is only retained through dictatorship and absolute conformity...<br><br>It feels like he’s attempting to criticize the utopian ideals of the dawning progressive era by highlighting the implications of those ideals, much like a modern author might write a novel about the Singularity that draws attention to the sterility and lifelessness it would bring… I may be projecting my own mind onto the novel, but that’s definitely how I read it. In which case, there’s an irony to the fact that audiences (including Blavatsky) re-interpreted the Vril-ya as saviors, when they were first written as destroyers… and so the book became a self-fulfilling prophecy, with the Vril-over the next century “emerge into sunlight as inevitable destroyers” just like the narrator warned they might one day. <br><br>As for this week’s essay: I don’t know enough about military technology to comment coherently, but I will play with your “how many wars have we won since WWII” question: Don’t you know that we haven’t had a war since WWII? The invention of the atom bomb and the rise of the UN put an end to all wars and we’ve been living in an unprecedented era of perfect peace. There have been a few police actions and peacekeeping missions but war? That’s a thing of the past. ;-).<br><br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c9109571255456902307 title="comment permalink">6/9/16, 8:13 AM</a><br><br>

This succinctly points up the problem - people in general (not necessarily in particular) do not know the difference between good and evil, bitter and sweet, light and darkness.

Answer: NONE. We had a similar heated discussion in the 70's when the question then was whether to replace sturdy fighters such as the Phantom with newer zippier and vastly more expensive designs like the F-15/ The argument was identical to the one involving the B-52 fleet. For a tiny fraction of the money, the older slower but durable Phantoms could be retrofitted with better armament and defense and electronic capabilities and could be kept in service or even kept being manufactured in huge numbers vs a limited number of new untried expensive designs. The B-52 advocates prevailed but the cheap abundant overwhelming numbers of retrofitted fighter fleet argument failed. So now for example, we have in the Navy a few huge Nuclear carriers packed with fabulously expensive limited range fighters who can almost certainly be utterly destroyed by the type of supersonic cruise missiles such as the NATO designated SUNBURN , an amazing weapon in the arsenals of not only Russia but Iran and China. Battleships were proven vulnerable to aircraft in the 1920's but the battle ship lobby prevailed for decades just as the Carrier lobby has prevailed to this day. Despite what the military says, there is almost no way that a carrier group in the confined waters of say the Strait of Hormuz would stand a chance against SUNBURNs which can be launched from any number of platforms in swarms. In a matter of minutes the US could see all its carriers with their aircraft at the bottom of the Persian Gulf. It is all just another illustration of increasing complexity facing diminishing returns. The lesson I thought we learned in Viet Nam by being decisively defeated by a determined foe armed with handheld cheap weapons has been completely forgotten. We lost 50,000 Americans, some of them my friends, for what?<br>They died for what? Nothing. Thats's what. The Military industrial complex still rules supreme. The defense Department used to be called the War Department and was well named. It should revert to its old name or perhaps a more logical name like the Offense Department. The current military is staffed by a relatively small number of relatively low paid and generally lower social strata mercenary soldiers being asked to invade countries posing no risk to our motherland and who are then dumped back home and abandoned, often traumatized, with no marketable skills. They are thanked by empty vapid comments like "Thank you for your service."<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c3577554826734375376 title="comment permalink">6/9/16, 9:29 AM</a><br><br>

As a former mech. eng. and a inept hunter I enjoy firearms. I really like 'sporterized' military rifles; that is military rifles that have been converted to hunting use. A sort of modern version of swords into plowshares. There's some helpful people on there, although they generally poo-poo such conversions as destroying a historical object.<br><br>The belief in high tech military gizmos there is unbelievable. I sort-of want to troll them with your article but god forbid some of them come here and fill your inbox with non-sense. The F-35 fanboys are amazing in their suspension of disbelief. What is so dangerous is their psychological vulnerability. If the US Military was ever to lose against a 'unworthy' foe I think they'd be psychologically crushed and who knows how they'd lash out. I think of the poor Sikhs who were killed in retaliation for 9/11, even though the reason they wear turbans is to contain the hair they can't cut due to Muslim control of their former lands. <br><br>Mike Tyson for all his failings has a great youtube video where he explains the secret of his success: the fear of failure. The fear he had of being beaten was so great that he would train himself beyond the breaking point. It's a great reminder that the key to winning is not wanting to lose.

Apparently the U.S. Defense and Space industrial complex stopped building such engines back in the Space Shuttle days so they lost the path of slow development that the Russians traveled on. They have not even been able to copy the Russian engines because the Titanium Alloys used in the RD-180 require old fashioned metalurgy skills that are lacking in the U.S. and can't be substitued with software or gizmos. One of the U.S. defense contractors offered to build one if the U.S. government would come up with $5 billion in R&amp;D funds and then agree to pay 25 Million dollars per copy sometime in the future. Today they can buy the RD-180 from the Russians for 12 million per copy and the have a record of 100% reliability. The pentagon in one of its rare nods to practicality ( such as the floppy discs) favors the RD-180s because the satelites that they put in to orbit cost one billion dollars each and they can't afford to lose any testing the latest breakthrough product from the U.S. defense industry.<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c3971741187417178471 title="comment permalink">6/9/16, 9:54 AM</a><br><br>

In the ensuing decade and a half this new technology, which promised to eliminate injuries on the part of both cops and perps and to usher in a new era of less-than-deadly interventions has proven to be a lie. The number of civilians injured and killed as a result of the technology is immense, while scared, bully cops feel empowered to Tase people in situations where a previous generation of LEOs would have either talked to the person or decided to employ some level of physical intervention. The deniability of accountability was less present in those types of encounters. As a result of this "miracle" technology people are dead and injured, cops are more divorced from their communities than ever, and a culture of Tase first, ask questions later has matured in a generation of law enforcement officers who are too scared to either talk to their communities and too scared to actually physically intervene when duty calls.

Reading about the latest batch of wonder weapons reminded me of several things. First, even though these weapons and their systems are obscenely expensive, their companies are the lowest bidders. So, we get what we pay for. Second, no nation or nation state in history can remain on a war footing indefinitely and we have been on one since WWII. Third, the supply and support system for much of the equipment in the military is inadequate. <br>I was a telecommunications electronic maintenance technician in the U.S. Marines from '74-'82 and rather than wait months for something as simple as a diode or transistor from supply we often went to local electronics stores.

I was offered a job by a customer to drill holes for the stems of casters in to an aluminum casting that would become part of a medical cart. They were frustrated because all the bids they got from other machine shops were very high. That is because the castings varied in size and the holes had to be right in the center of a little round boss on each corner of the casting. To do this all the other machine shops were proposing that they build a special fixture to the casting in a fancy cnc milling machine then use a digital probe to measure the casting and adapt the machining path to fit each specific casting in real time. What they missed was that the holes had to be accurately centered on each boss, but the spacing between them did not matter. So, on the spot, I bid the job for half the price of the other shops. I took a crate of parts back and gave one to my manual machinist and said " do this the Russian way." He made a little steel bushing to drop over the round boss with a hole in the center just the right size for a drill bit. He then handed to the Vietnamese guy with the drill press, showed him how to use it and in no time the entire crate of parts was done, and they worked perfectly for my customer. Watching the Russian machinist show the Vietnamese fellow how his simple piece of tooling worked, then standing back as the chips flew gave me some insight in to why the US had lost the Vietnam war.<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c5983158847684640188 title="comment permalink">6/9/16, 10:42 AM</a><br><br>

Without undue cynicism, it would seem products which are paid for upon delivery are rushed, but where development cost overruns are possible, they quickly become the primary profit opportunity.<br><br>At thie time I found the advertisement business hillarious, assuming that one does not sell jet fighters by putting up posters in the subway. At that time I was reading a lot of Jerry Pournelle's blogging about how he and his colleagues had engineered various NASA projects. A decade later I sat through the Wharton marketing 101 curriculum. The Marketing approach to product development is that you have three axes; price, product features, and quality. Then you pick one you want to compete on, and on the other two you try for the absolute minimum that your customer will accept. Basically everything Vance Packard worried about in The Waste Makers in 1959 is now doctrine. We don't like others doing it, however, c.f. "Poorly Made in China."<br><br>As nearly as I can tell, there isn't some start date to be pinpointed, really. The origin is probably in the imperfect correspondance between language, ideas, and the physical universe. It's like that joke about what happens when you ask the Army, Navy, Air Force or Marines to "secure" a building. In any given project or situation, there are an infinite number of ways of getting it wrong, and the more stakeholders are brought into the process, the more varied and contradictory ideas about the desired end state they bring with them.<br> <br>I experienced an aspect of this phenomenon myself witht the 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee, which is the first vehicle in our work fleet ever to require a firmware update to correct a vulnerability to malicious hacking. It's also subject to recall due to bad design of the electronic gear shift lever (athough there is currently no fix available.) The electronic shifter is apparently just new because innovation is grand, but the computer is in the car mainly to give you the opportunity to purchase a subscription to satellite radio. <br><br>I understood more when I came across a quote from Peter Coffee, VP for strategic research for Salesforce, "GM has become a data company that sells you a car to create an environment in which a curated merchant community can identify you as a customer and deliver services to you based on knowing where you are and where you're going." <br><br>That also completely redefines what constitutes a "good" car. Basically the glorification of Mammon is now the primary consideration in design. The goal on all the other factors is to be just barely good enough.<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c2254711353104245184 title="comment permalink">6/9/16, 12:17 PM</a><br><br>

I learned of this German word a while ago (probably right here) and it has remained very much at the forefront of my social/cultural awareness ever since -- highly applicable to the burgeoning clusterfrack which is the US military.

We have become a nation of phoneys and twits (my pet names for Smartphone and Twitter addicts) with the attention spans of ADD toddlers. <br><br>Fingerspitzengefühl. Another superb German word denoting the ability to think clearly about many individual complex events and treat them as a whole.

Every year we spend more money on 'fighting cancer' and yet every year more and more people get cancer. The same story goes for diabetes, heart disease, and probably whatever other disease you care to mention. Of course, 'skeptics' will tell me it's because of improved diagnostic techniques, yada yada, but thankfully I know more than enough to smell something iffy. And our entire culture buys into it. More money on research - just has to be the answer to all of our health problems. All the time someone is doing a charity run for yet more cancer research.<br><br>I mean, actually sorting out our lifestyles (even the WHO say pretty much all the major chronic diseases could be prevented be lifestyle changes) - well that could never possibly work could it?! Where's the progress, technology, and innovation in that?! Doing what has worked for thousands of years obviously isn't 'cool' enough.

Here is another example: There are two brothers that live in Wisconsin, The Paulsens, and they specialize in making and competing in black powder artillery. On the way to the 125th Anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg in 1989, they decided to stop at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma. Ft. Sill is the artillery training school for the U.S. Army. After about a week on base, using open sights and black powder against the 'modern' artillery of that time, they left for Gettysburg almost $5000.00 richer. The instructors there could not fathom the idea that their newest wire-guided, computer controlled weapons could be beaten by such "ancient" technology or something not hooked up to a computer.

The issues regarding the F-35 remind me of conversations we had in the ready room back when I was much younger and was the Commander of an F-4 USAF Reserve fighter squadron. At that time, the F-22 Raptor was the next generation jet and it was impressive. Stealth technology, outstanding power to weight, supersonic cruise without the need to stroke the afterburners,etc., etc. Any fighter pilot would love to strap one of those on and go for it.<br>The only problem, and it was a big problem in my estimation, was the cost of the beast. The F-22 ended up costing around $339 Million per aircraft, and operating costs are a mind numbing $68,000 per flight hour. At the same time, an F-15 Strike Eagle cost around $31 Million per aircraft, and costs $42,000 per flight hour. <br>Our contention at the time was, for the price of (1) F-22, you could have almost (11) F-15's, which at that time were the premier fighter of the day.<br>As you have so often pointed out, the decision to go with the Raptor was political, in that a large number of states benefited from its production, and was also the product of our belief that greater technology equals superior results on the battlefield.<br><br><br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c3664255266834811933 title="comment permalink">6/9/16, 2:58 PM</a><br><br>

Women took up magic for good or ill, but no man would except to go to the dark side.)<br><br>Although, thanks to UNM's Medieval Studies Department, I also had the pleasure of being able to watch a movie based on one of those sagas.

In order to rise within any organization today one must have absorbed an entire complex of attitudes that amount to being absolutely loyal to the organization. They must as a matter or course never openly question the organizations work, methods, principals, or goals. <br><br>This selection process is at least half self selection besides of course carried out by the organization. If someone is prone to speak their own mind or is less than happy to go along with any kind of BS they are very unlikely to even want to rise in an organization. The ones who do seek to rise yet give away their skepticism or less than enthusiastic embrace of the organization are soon weeded out. <br><br>This sort of thing is surely as old as civilization but it does go against one of the core ideas that supposedly defines America. Americans are supposed to be, above all people, individuals. However as it turns our Americans are often just as if not more likely to seek the safety, comfort and protection as a member of some group as anyone in the world. <br><br>Combined with the ascendancy of the modern business corporation, which epitomizes or maybe should be said to have developed the structure of modern organizations, we have the prescription for producing the F35. <br><br>Even into the 1950's the 'organization man', the 'company man' was held in some degree of contempt by ordinary citizens. This was a common theme of fiction and even popular movies. Then, somehow, in the 60's the organization man, the corporate man became cool. Not to the hippies but the hippies who were not simply hedonists, which many were, became a joke while the hedonists happily joined the corporate world after their youthful fling at individuality. If the motivation was at first mostly financial soon enough it became deeper. <br><br>I urge everyone to reread Catch 22 or even see the movie again and see it as an allegory about organization men, the Cathcart's Korn's and Minderbinders, then those stuck helplessly in the maw of the organization, which was the army, the Major Major Major's and Daneeka's and the one true individual, Yossarian.<br><br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c3472930718052975508 title="comment permalink">6/9/16, 3:37 PM</a><br><br>

All a rival power would have to do would be to lure the US into launching a major military intervention somewhere far from US soil. wait until we'd committed a large fraction of our available deployable forces there, and then hammer them with massed swarming attacks using less failure-prone technologies than we use. If it was done well, the US would suffer a crushing defeat, and since we'd be in no position to build new carriers, fighter planes, etc. in a hurry, the US government would have to choose between a disadvantageous peace treaty and mutual nuclear annihilation -- a lose/lose situation. <br><br>Alex, I've been saying <a href=../../2007/08/cities-in-deindustrial-future.html rel=nofollow>for years now</a> that a well-chosen city is a very good place to be in hard times. I live in a city of 20,000 people, not a small town, and one of the reasons I chose it is that real estate prices are very cheap here -- my wife and I bought a 4 bedroom Craftsman bungalow, built in 1925, with full basement and a backyard well suited for gardening, for $67,000. (No, I didn't leave out any zeroes, it cost less than many SUVs.) That sort of bargain can be found all through the so-called flyover states, where there are few jobs and the urban population has dropped by half or so since 1970. I'm not sure where you live, but there are many cheaper places to be!<br><br>LunarApprentice, one of the difficulties with reading those tea leaves is that some of the teapots in question are pretty clearly cracked. How many similar claims of imminent war have come from the same sources over the last ten years, say? <br><br>Phil, true enough.

That said, I hope the pro-Brexit side wins. The EU is a profoundly undemocratic monstrosity that's already run half of Europe into the ground and will get to the other half in due time. Like most things, the project of European integration has a point of diminishing returns; the Common Market was arguably a good idea, but beyond that? Not so much.

I've heard people talk about the Trabant auto in, shall we say, colorful terms! The Soviet system paid too much attention to Marx's fantasy-island notions about economics and too little to human nature, and that was one of the results; Soviet weapons systems tended to be better, if only because those who screwed up too badly on those tended to get nice all-expense-paid trips to Siberia for extended periods. Based on what I've heard, post-Soviet Russia seems to have gotten a better grasp on basic product quality -- though I'll accept correction if offered by people who live there or have been there recently. <br><br>John, I'd agree with that if the US were the only country that was likely to start a war. Not so. <br><br>Kyoto, welcome back! Well put -- the question of what progress is, and what does and doesn't count as progress, is going to receive further discussion as we proceed. <br><br>Jose, funny! Many thanks for this. <br><br>Twilight, no argument there at all. The fixation on complexity for its own sake -- cough, cough, Internet of Things, cough, cough -- is a one-way ticket to cascading systems failures. <br><br>Jamie, the thing that interests me is that officers and enlisted personnel in the Navy, as well as other US services, have been posting here and emailing me to let me know that they agree with my assessment. I wonder whether you and the officers you know are spending too much time inside the Beltway bubble, where everything looks bright and shiny, and too little time out in the field, listening to the deck officers and swabbies who actually have to make this stuff work. Certainly the comments I've received suggest that there's a pretty fair disconnect between the world as it appears from a Pentagon desk and the world as it appears from the engine room of a badly designed warship!<br><br>Wendy, sure thing. All you have to do is start helping to build it, beginning now. <br><br>Escape, very likely, yes -- Americans since the Second World War seem to have lost any capacity to imagine the future. I wonder if that's because at some level, we know that this country may not have one. <br><br>RPC, that's a step in the right direction. Still, I'd be more impressed if the Air Force decided to simply upgrade the A-10, or go to an off-the-shelf option such as the Super Tucano -- both of which would save money and build on a successful airframe rather than buying one more pig in a poke. <br><br>Professor D., a great deal depends on how one defines "progress." The incremental approach embraced by the Russians is to my mind less a matter of progress than of adaptation -- nobody's marching boldly into the future, they're just tinkering with existing machines to fit the changing requirements of the battlefield. In the same way, there might be quite a bit of modification to the Lakeland Republic's streetcars over the years ahead -- not "progress," simply responding to the needs of customers and to changes in the available technologies. <br><br>A lot of what gives the mythology of progress its glamor is the deliberate identification of progress with any kind of change whatsoever. If the US were to scrap the F-35 and replace it with a larger fleet of simpler, cheaper planes, each designed to fill one of the necessary niches, you can bet your bottom dollar that someone will label that "progress," too!<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c1200897959198776011 title="comment permalink">6/9/16, 6:59 PM</a><br><br>

It was seen as particularly barbaric because it gave rise to Glek-nas, or "eternal strife-rot" which was equated to the final years of the Roman Republic or the French Reign of Terror, and was the state of tyranny and anarchy that rose up when a Koom-posh failed. So Glek-nas involves the periods of revolutionary violence, demagoguery, and Caesarism that have been a major theme here of late, and was an analysis extremely reminiscent of the observations Spengler would make 50 years later. Of course... The Vril-ya's answer was to establish an eternal state of totalitarianism under the leadership of the Tur, in which people were happy and society was stable due to absolute compliance and agreement. It felt to me like he was warning the reader that absolute perfection in society would mean getting rid of difference and dissent and abandoning personal liberty and therefore might not be as desirable as one might think... The irony is that over the course of the next century half the world ran off and tried that experiment anyway... And rather than bringing them closer to perfection, it led to Glek-nas all on its own.<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c936649117283829175 title="comment permalink">6/9/16, 8:37 PM</a><br><br>

I do a variant of the same thing -- when a new technology shows up, I ask myself, "Is there actually any unmet need in my life that this thing can fill?" The answer is almost always no, and I spend the money on books instead. ;-)<br><br>Eric, good. I took <i>The Coming Race</i> as a satire, and I recall several other authors who discussed it and read it the same way -- Bulwer-Lytton was an old-fashioned and distinctly Burkean conservative, and put a scathing criticism of Rousseau's educational theory into <i>Zanoni</i>, so a sustained parody of utopian thinking would have been right up his alley. <br><br>Over the Hill, yep. The US military is still, despite gestures in other directions, constantly gearing up to fight the Second World War all over again -- AirLand Battle Doctrine (or whatever they're calling its latest iteration) is pronounced "Blitzkrieg" in German -- which is why they've had their backsides handed to them over and over again. As a rule, when avoiding blame becomes more important than winning wars, military defeat and collapse are not far off. <br><br>Milind, thanks for this! That fixation on an imaginary future is of course just as common here in the US as it is in India, but it takes different forms. Many thanks for the links; I'll make time to read them shortly. <br><br>PG, possibly, but I prefer reading to listening -- do you happen to know if there's a transcript available? <br><br>Isaac, I'll take that as a compliment. I've had an industrial metal band record an album based on <i>The Long Descent</i>, and a dance company do a very elegant performance piece based on <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i>, but yours is the first folk band to pick up some of my ideas and run with them. Thank you!<br><br>Anthony, I hadn't even heard of that one. Thank you! As for the Meriga Project, I've got the raw material for a first book -- simply haven't had time yet to put it together and get things under way. If you'd like to write a short story or novella, I can't promise that there'll be a second anthology but if there is one you'll be in the running; if you want to write a novel, on the other hand, there's no need to wait -- there's at least one novel set in the <i>Star's Reach</i> universe under way, and I'm delighted. <br><br>Librarian, funny. The space bats would probably giggle hypersonically and go fluttering off to Neptune, where the locals are less absurd. <br><br>Joshua, yeah, I know. A lot of the old Whole Earth Catalog brigade ended up cashing in their ideals and becoming cheerleaders for ecocidal technologies the moment the Reagan revolution made that fashionable; Stewart Brand's pimping for the nuclear and GMO industries is par for the course. I used to read each issue of <i>Coevolution Quarterly</i> eagerly, as a guide to how we could build a better, greener future; these days, those memories are bleak ones. <br><br>SV Koho, I hear the same thing from pretty much all the vets that I know. I have to wonder sometimes if the people inside the Beltway who are responsible for all this have any idea just how much bitterness and contempt they've earned from the people who served this country and then got dumped in the trash. <br><br>Stuart, agreed. When the US finally loses a war -- not just "fails to win" one, but has its backside handed to it and has to accept the terms of a disadvantageous peace -- this whole country is going to have a world-class nervous breakdown, and the frankly fetishistic obsession with high-tech toys is only going to contribute to that. <br><br>Clay, the fact that the US can no longer build a working rocket engine is a very good measure of just how far in decline we are.<br><br>GW, that's an excellent point.<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c549686976334860992 title="comment permalink">6/9/16, 10:31 PM</a><br><br>

When the Russians first went in, there were articles all over the US foreign-affairs media -- not the mass media, which is a waste of oxygen, but magazines such as <i>The National Interest</i> and <i>Foreign Policy</i> -- insisting that there was no way they could maintain an effective operational tempo or have a serious impact on the battlefield. The world promptly learned otherwise, and I've been told by US servicepeople that the US air force can't sustain the kind of optemp the Russians did even for a week, much less for months at a time. Clearly Russia today is not the Soviet Union of 1960; nor, to judge by the success of Chinese diesel-electric submarines at popping up in the middle of US naval maneuvers, are the Chinese behind the times at all. I'd suggest that it would be prudent to act as though the other side's hardware can do most of what it's supposed to do, rather than find that out the hard way.<br><br>Fred, another day, another scandal.

Regarding the Russian's use of pencils in space, there's several posts and a video going around the Internet dedicated to defending the waste of millions of American dollars on developing that pen. The whole point of the video boils down to NASA was afraid the carbon from the pencils would get into the air filters and cause a fire in the pure oxygen atmosphere of the space capsule. My only comment is always "the Russians didn't use pure oxygen...they weren't that stupid." That tends to shut down the conversation quickly, though I wonder how many other defenders of progress will come up with similar things over other stupid technologies?<br><br>I got stuck in a car dealership for two hours this week waiting for not one, but three, recall-related repairs on our car to be completed and got "treated" to non-stop political coverage on a wall-filling tv.

Of six people who engaged in this conversation, three aren't voting this November and the other three are voting for Trump. It should be pointed out that two of these three were non-white for those who believe the media. I kept my mouth shut other than asking why. One older Latino man summed up the beliefs of them all "because he's not bought and paid for like the others...he says what he actually believes."<br><br>I was also bullied mercilessly in a conversation about Hillary Clinton by rabid supporters who apparently think a woman can't be a feminist if she points out the blatant hypocrisy of anyone wearing a $13000 coat while giving a speech on income inequality.

I have three mates who served through that. One was on a ship that was bombed, the bomb ended up in the forward heads (Toilets) after passing through a missile system. The bomb did not go off, guess where the bomb was made? USA. If all the bombs that hit Royal Navy ships had exploded the recapture of the Falklands would have failed, as the task force was close to the minimum number of ships needed for the job. Another mate was on one of the carriers, he's sure they got hit by a torpedo (same day as the Argentinian cruiser General Belgrano was sunk) which did not explode (or do so properly). The carrier in question had to go in for below the water line repairs for several weeks after the return to the UK, but the story has always been denied officially. USA technology again, as the Argentinian submarine was Ex US Navy, as were its torpedos. The third mates ship came through unscathed if you were wondering. On the other hand sometimes weapons out perform their expectations. The Harrier aircraft originally designed for ground attack on the cold war front line in central Europe, turned out to be a capable naval carrier air superiority fighter, fighting in the middle of a south Atlantic winter, who knew! I'm not trying to do down USA tech in this comment compared with UK tech, its just that they are the examples I have from people who were there. I have enough friends and relatives that are Ex military or defence industries to know that UK military procurement suffers just as much from panglossian thinking as the USA's.<br><br>Best regards JMG<br>Philip Hardy<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c4721950748185842665 title="comment permalink">6/10/16, 4:38 AM</a><br><br>

The human condition on the other hand is a whole other matter. Such matters as you wrote about this week were covered quite thoroughly in Sun Tzu's treatise on The Art of War, who was quite forthright on the subject, so clearly you are in good company! His tale about the Prince who set aside his armies in order to contemplate philosophy was a solid object lesson and one that was not lost on me. The tale concludes that the prince was eventually over run, by another neighbouring and more war like prince, looking for an easy victory.<br><br>I mentioned to you that I was reading Michael Lewis's most excellent book: "The Big Short". No doubt, you have read it too. One thing that struck me upon reading that book was that there was a time of delay between one event happening and then the consequences occurring. That level of inertia (do you reckon that is the correct term?) is interesting and it speaks much about the sort of resilience that is part of the many systems we have supporting us in developed countries. Eventually, the sort of smoke and mirrors used to produce that inertia fail and the ugly truth gets shown. I reckon your essay this week touches on those matters.<br><br>As I read your essay, I had a feeling that that sort of rubbish going on that you describe is a smoke and mirror attempt to maintain business as usual.

Nevertheless I feel strangely compelled to explain why I disagree with you and will be voting to remain. All the negatives about the EU are agreed with. I also agree that the EU is going to fragment soon - but I disagree with you about the size of that "soon" and I consider that to be important. <br><br>In a limited, nature-conservation, clean air and beaches, kind of way, the EU *has* improved the UK's quality of life. If we leave, there will be precious few checks on the government desire to rip the place up and return to us to a state of spoiled grubbiness – redefined as “vigorous and entrepreneurial” – and anything that stands in the way will be sneered at as “red tape” and “a burden on business”.

The first day of class he had us read the intro chapter to the text book. Then he said "Put it back in the basket under your desk. We won't be opening it again this year." He taught western civ through the lens of military conquest. He had a theory of a superweapon, a weapon or tactic that undermined the enemy and exploited their weaknesses. The Phalanx, Roman Legion, Mongolian short bow, Viking longship, and English longbow come to mind.<br><br>Then I took his current events class. Again, he dumped the textbook. Really the class should have been called Soviet American relations. When we examined SDI (star wars) in the light of the previous class, it became clear that artillery always defeats armor. The mongolian bow could pierce a breast plate, the trebuchet break a castle wall, etc. So equip one warhead out of ten on a MIRV (say an SS18) with chaff, and you defeat a radar based targeting system.

I woke up to find that my brain had clearly been processing upon your essay - you are a bad influence as I love my solid sleep and resent it being disturbed! ;-)! - and the insight is so obvious as to be, well obvious... Blind Freddy to the rescue again!<br><br>The process that you describe is much like the gambler who won the lottery in the past and yet can't shake the feeling that someday soon they'll win again, if only they keep gambling. All of the techniques you described in the essay were a form of speculation (in the financial meaning of that word) where the powers that be gamble everything on the hope of making another big technological game changing break through.<br><br>Now in the real world, in which I live, you also describe the alternative strategy of investment (i.e. incremental returns and slow changes) on technological developments. I tend to favour investment over speculation and I really annoy other people by living my life with that strategy in mind. It really does annoy some people, you would be amazed.<br><br>You see, I know that the gambler can only ever win once, and then they have to walk away and do something different, otherwise, eventually they'll lose. Technology and science simply suffer from the same boring old diminishing returns that we all have to deal with. That's life. If I was twelve years old, I'd probably say: Too bad, so sad, dude.<br><br>Yet, we live in a world where the gamblers have their time in the sun and the powers that be are calling the shots, and to me those shots look an awful lot like: Roll the dice again, matey!<br><br>It is very uncomfortable for me to watch such things in practice, but I hear that story told over and over again.

I just read a book called "Home Fires", which is about life in the villages of Britain, during WWII. The book has an extensive bibliography, in the back.

You'll probably find that most of what your looking for can be found under:<br><br>"United States -- Social Life and Customs -- 19th Century"<br>"Great Britain -- Social Life and Customs -- 19th Century"<br><br>You could also ask your librarian if they have any books on "How to do research."

It was published in the 1860s, although the economics and fashions described are those of about 50 years previous. It is set in the English Midlands. <br><br>Historical details that differ from the 21st century include attitudes toward saving money, the "dame school" (mentioned in passing), and the abreviated and confused religious beliefs held by persons who are sincere and illiterate.<br><br>I'm going to describe a different observation, the absence of competition.<br><br>Silas Marner is a linen weaver by trade. He goes to a client (a local spinner) and collects a bag of yarn that she has spun. He walks home with the load, sets up his loom and (over the next days) weaves linen fabric from her yarn. When the fabric is complete, it goes back in his pack and he walks back to his client. She gets fabric, and he is paid in gold or silver coins, and sometimes food.<br><br>There is never any mention of a second weaver. (I am also curious if Silas ever weaves wool. Maybe that is not locally produced) In modern America, the idea of a single source for anything is surprising, or at least frightening (the dreaded "Monopoly").<br><br>After some thought, and a few calculations, I have determined that Silas has a "natural" monopoly. The only transportation available is by foot, or by animal power. Thus, moving the yarn or the finished cloth is done on foot, and the further away the client, the more time a weaver will spend on pickup and delivery, effectively reducing his pay/day. <br><br>The "back of the envelope" suggests that there would be enough small farms (and therefore spinning farm wives and farm daughters) in a 3 mile radius to keep Silas busy for 6 days a week, weaving approximately 20 yards of 36" wide cloth per spinner. Under these conditions, new clothing or bedding will be an occasional thing, with mending, darning, and patching done carefully to prolong the life of the fabric.<br><br>If, for some reason Silas wants to expand his business, he will need to be willing to walk more than an hour each way, taking even more time and energy away from his weaving.<br><br>In short, there was life and industry before UPS and FedEx.<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c6862601664490547162 title="comment permalink">6/11/16, 10:51 AM</a><br><br>

I suppose that's what tends to happen when you try typing when you are dead tired and not thinking too clearly...<br><br>It seems to me that while Bulwer-Lytton was calling into question the belief of his contemporaries (still very widespread) that industrial democracy is the height of human perfection, he was also pointing out that attempts to create a utopian society in the real world are bound to end in tears and that the logical outcome of such an endeavor is a totalitarian nightmare. As you pointed out, there actually were attempts in the 20th century to impose a utopian vision on the rest of the world, first by the Marxists and then by the National Socialists. The results were positively horrific and led to a state of depravity, barbarism and degeneration not unlike the Vril-Ya's concept of a Glek-Nas.<br><br>Perhaps one of the lessons to take away is that there is no ideal form of governance, only forms of governance that are better or less well suited for a particular set of circumstances. When it comes to democracy, Oswald Spengler pointed out that democracy is the form of government that tends to arise as a civilization hits its high point. <br><br>But circumstances change. Eventually democracies decay and are replaced by other systems of government that are better suited to the realities of a declining civilization whose people have lost the ability to govern themselves, while the crises faced by the civilization get worse and worse and require strong leadership. This is where Caesarism and the return of authoritarianism come into play. Eventually, those authoritarian regimes decay in turn and are replaced by the emerging barbarian warbands and kingdoms that topple the dying civilization and sow the seeds for the next civilization to follow and thus the cycle starts again.<br><br>@ JMG:<br><br>Sounds like I need to go back and re-read The Coming Race and some of his other books.<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c7933249237723792099 title="comment permalink">6/11/16, 2:06 PM</a><br><br>

Our consensus, as expressed in my own advance directive, is this:<br><br>1) Who decided when enough is enough? Answer: the patient, if still able to give informed consent. Ethically, nobody else. If not able, and if there us nothing on file or any family member empowered to make those decisions, things get very nasty. But leave the decisions in anybody else's hands, and that way lies hubris and disaster.<br><br>2) What makes it time to say enough is enough? If the interventions don't fix the problem, but only prolong the agony.<br><br>3) Okay - so the patient is broke. I take it Medicaid is paying for his care. That they are too generous with it is a surprise, and probably a misallocation of their resources, and for them to correct in the next discussion of where to put their funds; I won't argue. But to make the patient's economic status the whipped cream on the strawberries of your argument strikes a sour note with me.<br><br>Full disclosure: I am 77 and just has some expensive procedures to fix a crippling problem. The intent was and is to restore me to functional independence. Economically, I could have paid for it myself but am glad the insurance came through. Already I am less of a burden on others than before the procedure, and intend to be not-a-burden in the near future. But this was a clear cut case of a fixable problem. I do have an advance directive on file and think it will be followed when worse comes to worst. <br><br>I will say no more, having no desire to start a flame war.

Check out http://bayoakomolafe.net/#up Such as this piece http://bayoakomolafe.net/project/the-dot-on-my-forehead-how-we-understand-the-crisis-is-part-of-the-crisis/ "I dedicated my waking moments to connecting dot to painful dot. With every line drawn to complete this picture of despair, the need for urgency was more and more obvious. All the reports agreed with me: if we continue down this line of unfettered consumerism, of trickle-down economics, of championing neoliberal techno-utopic capitalist narratives of always-impending happiness, our children will have no world to walk on or play in. Africa would be a continent of plastic bottles and old Sony television boxes Germany thinks is outdated. My daughter, Alethea, would most likely grow up in a barbaric world, its id finally released from whatever moral moorings currently hold it in place. A Cthulhucene in all its glory.<br><br>However, as I connect the dots and negotiate what it means to respond to a world in crisis, and how we are already a part of the world that we desperately seek to understand, to fix, and to transcend, I realize that I have missed a dot. The one on my forehead. The one wrapped in my blind spot. The one that is entangled with our way of figuring crisis and co-producing the world. It is an easy spot to miss: in connecting the dots, we often invest the emergent picture with an externalized fixity it doesn’t have. We remove ourselves from the equation and pretend to be observers just observing pre-existing things.<br><br>What I call attention to is the last dot: us. Our way of seeing. Our ways of touching – and how the effects of seeing this way have perpetuated a white architecture of responsiveness. An uncontested gentrification of political action. I am saying that Cthulhu’s tentacles have infiltrated our eyes, blinding us to other spaces of power, keeping us in the anaesthetic hallways of protest-making and advocacy.<br><br>This is not to say making protest and ‘standing up’ to a ‘system’ that touches us in harmful ways is not worthy of our attention. How we respond to crisis depends on the specificity of the context that evokes a response. The point is that the very particularity of the frame excludes other responses from mattering, making other possibilities meaningless and unintelligible. This is all worth struggling with: knowledge and justice are just as embodied and entangled and connected as we suppose the world ‘outside’ is. Drawing charged lines from neoliberal capitalism to ecological devastation to the Ebola virus and psychopathology and to the surge of prosperity gospel in Africa will always be inadequate until we account for the epistemologies, the ways of knowing and seeing, that are complicit in their materialization."<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c2681864415172326467 title="comment permalink">6/12/16, 7:39 AM</a><br><br>

I feel like that is one place where we fail. I know I was a coward. She was so desperate to believe she could get better. That I didn't have the heart to tell her that that wasn't realistic.

In dense forest, in jungle, in urban environments, 100 yards is a long distance. I believe the idea was inspired by the M1 Carbine and some of the German light/high capacity/relatively small bore/select-fire weapons. <br><br>Of course much of warfare isn't in jungles, or dense urban terrain, and a rifle that can shoot accurately over longer distances is a plus. A good example of how both types are needed is the scout-sniper team of sniper and spotter. The sniper will have a bolt-action rifle most typically, while the spotter will have an assault rifle. Sometimes the sniper will have an accurized rifle of the "semi-assault" type like an HK 91. <br><br>Interestingly, the AR-15 has not only been holding its own in "high power" rifle competition, which is shot over fairly long distances, but is becoming the rifle of choice. This is because bullets with fairly good ballistic coefficient is available now, shooters are more aware now of how to match barrel twist rate with bullet weight and length, and the smaller-caliber ammunition used in an AR is cheaper. The rifle itself is easier and cheaper to accurize. <br><br>That being said, in target shooting, all the rifle has to deliver downrange is a hole in paper. In actual fighting, a long-distance shooter is much better served by having a .308, 7mm-.308, or some such in their hands. But if you had to have ONE gun...<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c7951888852520440828 title="comment permalink">6/14/16, 7:30 AM</a><br><br>

According to Xenakis, Crisis War is the defining point in the 80-year historical cycle, and is fought from the bottom up with something like total enthusiasm. It happens when the people have simply had enough and lash out at whatever they see (or can be deluded into seeing) as the cause of their misery. The last Crisis War the US fought was WW II. Another one is due, although there is a non-zero probability that we might act like rational adults for once and work through the crisis without fighting. Sound like something JMG has been saying?<br><br>A non-crisis war is any other war. It's started by the political leadership and ended by them. Both sides don't have to be the same kind of war. For example, WW I was a Crisis War for Eastern Europe, and a political war for Western Europe. Western Europe's Crisis War was WW II. Vietnam was a Crisis War for North Vietnam, and a political war for the United States.<br><br>This thing about military hardware is pretty standard; I see the same thing discussed in a military science fiction forum I frequent with examples from the last three hundred years of warfare. <br><br>@Tom Schmidt<br><br>You might want to note that the 70s are the beginning of the Unraveling period in the 80-year historical cycle as applied to the United States. This is when the lessons learned in the last Crisis and applied in the last High (Stability, Austerity) get forgotten. History does repeat; you just have to have the right history book to see the patterns.<br><br>@Tat Loo<br><br>Revisionist history is wonderful. The Germans were fighting a war on at least four fronts, three of which were being fought with the Americans and British. The fourth was being fought against the Russians. That doesn't mean that the Russian contribution was unimportant, it simply means that it was not the single most important factor.<br><br>WW II was a crisis war for Germany, it was not a Crisis War for Russia. Russia's previous Crisis War period lasted from the Russian Revolution through the end of WW I; WW II is too soon to have another Crisis War. Stalin would very probably have sat our WW II happily if Germany had not invaded.<br><br>@Clay Dennis<br><br>The US space effort is a strange beast, with the Republican congress trying to kill NASA with continuous budget cuts. A long time ago they decided to farm out launches to private industry. Elon Musk is one of the people who stepped up, and it appears that he's actually on target to deliver a reusable launch vehicle.

The Persian Gulf is a shallow sea that was dry land during the last Glacial Maximum. It has completely different heat absorption characteristics from the deep ocean.

For a mounted weapon, on a tripod, or solidly on a ship or vehicle a fully automatic weapon is quite accurate. Hand held weapons are another matter.

Full auto is much more difficult, and really only worth while at close range.<br><br>Historically, the 8 round semi-auto M1 did quite well versus the Mauser in the second World War.

There are always the spray &amp; pray types, but someone with minor training (8 hours) can hit targets reliably at over 300 yards with the AR15 rifles, and experts routinely hit at 600 yards. The style of rifle is preferred due to the ammunition being easy to carry and has limited recoil, so small people can comfortably and accurately fire it. Hunting humans is quite different from hunting Rhinos or armored cars, where a large round is required.

However, potential is not the actuality because of a whole number of factors and I reckon Clausewitz spoke to that variance.<br><br>I reckon there is something in our current cultural mindset that wants to ignore the concept of "friction". I don't personally enjoy the luxury to indulge that particular conceit. And I also wonder whether Clausewitz’s time as a POW led him to that harsh reality?

We came up with the nearest Walmart (bless you, Walmart), the UNM SUB (right off Central avenue, and open access to all major campus buildings as long as you're not causing problems), the Senior Center, and two university-area eateries that offer little cups of water for the taking and don't ask question. And the local food co-op. One of the eateries and the co-op will also let you refill an empty water bottle from their machine for free, as long as it's of a modest size. Bring in a half gallon jug and they sure will charge you - less than $0.50. Other than that, it's buy a bottle at the drugstore or the nearest restaurant. <br><br>I'm wondering how many other people could say the same for where they live. <br><br>And BTW, I carry water in the car. If I see someone panhandling and can do it, I'll offer them a bottle of water.

And as long as you have good enough health to walk a few blocks you can always stay hydrated. But this being the US, of course we have people who can barely walk, people who are mentally ill, people who certainly look homeless. And getting water is hard - so they panhandle to buy that $1 teeny bottle of water. I remember once waiting for the bus at a stop that happened to be near the front of a mini-mart, and there was a gal begging in the doorway. I asked her if she was begging so she could buy water, and she vigorously nodded her head Yes. I had a larger than smallest size bottle of water I'd only drank half of, and handed it to her and she chugged it right down. <br><br>Handing out bottles of water to panhandlers is always nice, also Q-tips, sox and undies, clean t-shirts, etc. <br><br>Think of what you'd need if you were living on the street. <br><br>Glenn - we'd all rather have an FN-FAL but those get spendy.

If current defense contract trends continue, the entire Defense Dept. budget for weapons procurement will buy One airplane, one ship, one missile, which we will be assured are "super duper". Right now the British found out their multi-million dollar destroyers will not operate in the Persian Gulf, because the Contractor convinced them that the turbine engines' heat exchangers should be sized for British home waters (ie. cold water). Saved a lot of money for the Contractor after the contract had been awarded. The fact is that Defense Contracts have become fiscal policy. The work is situated in politically power states. Once the money has been appropriated, no one seems to care if the damn thing works. Nobody in the military speaks up, because they want that nice cushy job with the same contractor down the road. And a failed item mean another appropriation the make something that might work. Another trend is to combine engineering, design and manufacturing into one pre-paid contract and make fewer and fewer units and spend more money on design and engineering, so mis-spending and technical failure are more easily hidden.<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c3640695758802562250 title="comment permalink">6/15/16, 2:04 PM</a><br><br>

When it first came about it underwent a very creative burst with lots of variety as the different artists explored its possibilities to the edges of the musical space defined by the form's limitations. (the limitations of trance music - it's narrow tempo range, particular rhythms, typical baseline patterns etc. define it's musical form.) As that space was explored to the edges, it then crystallised into it's style - the phase where the only novelty available is to produce variations on the style's theme.<br><br>I'd say it finished crystallised into it's style in the early 2000's. "Stopped evolving" would depend if you define "evolution" as the phase of maximum creative expansion or you'd define the continued exploration of variations on those established themes as evolution."<br><br>That's about as close to "notional space" and "performance phase" as you can get. :)<br><br><a href=they-died-of-progress.html#c4582211180164605002 title="comment permalink">7/8/16, 9:14 AM</a><br><br>
