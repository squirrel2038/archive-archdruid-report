The outcome of last week’s vote concerning Britain’s membership in the European Union has set off<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>anguished cries and handwaving across much of the internet and the mass media. The unexpected defeat of the pro-EU camp, though, has important lessons to offer, and not just for those of my readers who live in Britain; the core issues underlying the Brexit referendum are also massive realities in many other countries right now, and will likely play a very large role—quite probably a decisive one—in this year’s presidential race here in the United States. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course part of the outcome has to be put down to the really quite impressive incompetence of the Remain campaign. The first rule of political campaigning is that if something isn’t working, it’s time to try something else, but apparently that never occurred to anybody on the pro-EU side. From the beginning of the campaign to its end, very nearly the only coherent arguments that came out the mouths of Remain supporters were threats about this or that awful thing that was going to happen if Britain left the EU. Weeks before the election, as a result, faux headlines yelling BREXIT WILL GIVE YOU CANCER, EXPERTS WARN and the like had already become a common topic of internet humor. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was bad enough—when the central theme of your campaign becomes a punch line, you’re doing something wrong—but there was another point that everyone in the pro-EU camp seems to have missed. Soon-to-be-former Prime Minister David Cameron spent much of the campaign insisting that if Britain left the EU, there would be harsh budget cuts in the National Health Service and other programs that benefit ordinary Britons. The difficulty here was of course that Cameron’s government had already inflicted harsh budget cuts in the National Health Service and other programs that benefit ordinary Britons, and showed every sign of doing more of the same—and “Brexit Will Do What We’re Doing Anyway” somehow didn’t have the clout that Cameron apparently expected it to have. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
More generally, Remain supporters never got around to offering positive reasons for Britain’s EU membership that would convince those who weren’t already on their side. Instead, they simply insisted that “any thinking person” would vote Remain, and anyone who disagreed had to be a xenophobic Nazi moron. Their behavior in the wake of defeat has by and large been the same, alternating between furious statements that the 52% of Britons who voted to leave the EU must all be drooling fascist bigots, and the plaintive insistence that people couldn’t possibly have intended to vote the way they did, and can we please have the vote all over again? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Absent from the entire Remain repertory, before as well as after the vote, was any sense that the question of continued EU membership for Britain involved substantive issues about which it was possible to have reasoned disagreement. It should have been obvious that telling people that their concerns don’t matter, and berating them with schoolyard insults when they demur, was not going to convince them to change their vote. That this was not obvious to the pro-EU camp, and shows little evidence of becoming any more obvious even in the wake of defeat, hints that the issues in question are things that the pro-EU camp is utterly unwilling to see discussed at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I suggest that this is exactly what’s going on, and a glance back across the last century or so of British political history may help point out the unspoken realities behind the shouting. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A hundred years ago, two parties dominated the British political landscape: the Conservatives (aka Tories) and the Liberals. Both parties were run by and for the affluent. While a series of electoral reform bills over the course of the nineteenth century brought more and more British men into the electorate—British women got the vote in two stages, with wealthy women over 30 admitted to the electorate in 1918 and all adult women in 1929—both parties readily learned the trick of dangling meaningless favors in front of the poor to get them to vote in the interest of their soi-disant betters. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The rise of the Independent Labour Movement, the forerunner of the Labour Party, was a masterly counterstroke to this kind of political gamesmanship. Instead of letting themselves be led about by the nose for the benefit of the affluent minority, the ILM and then the Labour Party put the interests of working people and the poor at the forefront of their agenda, and refused to be bought off with scraps from the tables of the rich. By 1945, as a direct result, the Liberal party had been reduced to irrelevance and the Labour Party became one of the two major parties in British politics. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In Britain as well as America, the pendulum started swinging the other way in the last quarter of the century. The triumph of Margaret Thatcher in the 1978 general election had the same role there as Ronald Reagan’s victory in 1980 did over here: a new, more aggressive conservatism took up the Left’s rhetoric of class warfare with a vengeance and inverted it, ushering in an era in which the rich rebelled against the poor. The Labour Party under Tony Blair, in turn, responded to that shift the same way that the Democrats did under Bill Clinton: both parties quietly dropped their previous commitments to the working class and the poor, and focused instead on issues that appealed to affluent liberals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They gambled that the working class and the poor would keep voting for them out of habit and misplaced loyalty—and over the short term, that gamble paid off. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The result in both countries was a political climate in which the only policies up for discussion were those that favored the interests of the affluent at the expense of the working classes and the poor. That point has been muddied so often, and in so many highly imaginative ways, that it’s probably necessary to detail it here. Rising real estate prices, for example, benefit those who own real estate, since their properties end up worth more, but it penalizes those who must rent their homes, since they have to pay more of their income for rent. Similarly, cutting social-welfare benefits for the disabled favors those who pay taxes at the expense of those who need those benefits to survive. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the same way, encouraging unrestricted immigration into a country that already has millions of people permanently out of work, and encouraging the offshoring of industrial jobs so that the jobless are left to compete for an ever-shrinking pool of jobs, benefit the affluent at the expense of everyone else. The law of supply and demand applies to labor just as it does to everything else:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>increase the supply of workers and decrease the demand for their services, and wages will be driven down. The affluent benefit from this, since they pay less for the services they want, but the working poor and the jobless are harmed by it, since they receive less income if they can find jobs at all. It’s standard for this straightforward logic to be obfuscated by claims that immigration benefits the economy as a whole—but who receives the bulk of the benefits, and who carries most of the costs?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s not something anybody in British or American public life has been willing to discuss for the last thirty years. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The problem with this kind of government of the affluent, by the affluent, and for the affluent was outlined in uncompromising detail many years ago in the pages of Arnold Toynbee’s monumental <i>A Study of History</i>. Societies in decline, he pointed out, schism into two unequal parts: a dominant minority that monopolizes the political system and its payoffs, and an internal proletariat that carries most of the costs of the existing order of things and is denied access to most of its benefits. As the schism develops, the dominant minority loses track of the fundamental law of politics—the masses will only remain loyal to their leaders if the leaders remain loyal to them—and the internal proletariat responds by rejecting not only the dominant minority’s leadership but its values and ideals as well. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The enduring symbol of the resulting disconnect is the famous Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, where the last three French kings before the Revolution secluded themselves from an increasingly troubled and impoverished nation in order to gaze admiringly at their own resplendent reflections. While Marie Antoinette apparently never said the famous sentence attributed to her—“Let them eat cake”—the cluelessness about the realities of life outside the Hall of Mirrors that utterance suggests was certainly present as France stumbled toward ruin, and a growing number of ordinary Frenchmen and Frenchwomen turned their backs on their supposed leaders and went looking for new options.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s what has happened in Britain in recent decades, and the last few elections show it. In the general election of 2010, voters blindsided pollsters and pundits alike by flocking to the Liberal Democratic party, until then a fringe party. That was an obvious demand for change, and if the Lib-Dems had stuck to their guns, it might have resulted in the eclipse of the Labour party within a few more years, but the Lib-Dems chose instead to cash in their ideals and form a coalition with the Tories. In the 2015 general election, as a direct result, the Lib-Dems were flung back out onto the fringes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
2015 had an even more significant result, though. In an attempt to head off the UK Independence Party (UKIP), another fringe party showing worrisome gains, Tory PM David Cameron pledged that if his party won, the UK would hold a referendum on EU membership. Polls claimed that Parliament would again be split three ways between Conservatives, Lib-Dems, and Labour. The pollsters and the pundits were blindsided again; apparently a good many people who claimed they were going to vote for Labour or the Lib-Dems got into the privacy of the voting booth and cast their vote for their local Tory instead. Why? Thursday’s vote suggests that it was precisely because they wanted a chance to say no to the EU. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Fast forward to the Brexit campaign. In polite society in today’s Britain, any attempt to point out the massive problems with allowing unrestricted immigration onto an already overcrowded island, which can’t provide adequate jobs, housing, or social services for the people it’s got already, is dismissed out of hand as racism. Thus it’s not surprising that quite a few Britons, many of them nominally Labour voters, mumbled the approved sound bites in public and voted for Brexit in private—and again, the pollsters and the pundits were blindsided. That’s one of the downsides of the schism between the dominant minority and the internal proletariat; once the dominant minority loses the loyalty of the masses by failing to deal with the needs of those outside the circles of affluence and privilege, sullen outward conformity and secret revolt replace the mutual trust that’s needed to make a society function. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The EU, in turn, made a perfect target for disaffected voters among the working class and the poor because it’s entirely a creature of the same consensus of the affluent as the Labour party after Tony Blair and the Democratic Party after Bill Clinton. Its economic policies are guided from top to bottom by the neoliberal economics that came into power with Thatcher and Reagan; its unwavering support of unrestricted immigration and capital movement is calculated to force down wages and move jobs away from countries such as Britain; its subsidies inevitably end up in the pockets of big corporations and the well-to-do, while its regulatory burdens land heaviest on small businesses and local economies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This isn’t particularly hard find out—in fact, it takes an effort to avoid noticing it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Listen to people bemoaning the consequences of Brexit in the latest reports from the British media, and you’ll hear a long list of privileges mostly relevant to the affluent that the speakers worry will be taken from them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Aside from a few fringe figures, those who voted for it generally aren’t talking, since they’ve learned from bitter experience that they’ll simply be shouted down with the usual shopworn accusations of racism et al..<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If they were willing to talk, though, I suspect you’d hear a long list of burdens that have mostly landed on the ordinary working people so many of the affluent so obviously despise. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably necessary to note here that of course there are racists and xenophobes who voted for Brexit. Equally, there are people who have copulated with dead pigs who voted for Remain—I’m sure my British readers can name at least one—but that doesn’t mean that everyone who voted for Remain has copulated with a dead pig.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nor, crucially, does it prove that necrosuophiliac cravings are the only possible reason to vote for Remain. One common way to define hate speech is “the use of a demeaning and derogatory stereotype to describe every member of a group.” By that definition, the people who insist that everyone who voted for Brexit is a bigoted moron are engaged in hate speech—and it’s a source of bleak amusement to watch people who are normally quick to denounce hate speech indulging in it to their heart’s desire in this one case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s look deeper, though. There are, in fact, a significant number of poor and working-class Britons who hold deeply prejudiced attitudes toward foreign immigrants. Why? A large part of the reason is the fact that the affluent, for decades now, have equated racial tolerance with exactly those policies of unrestricted immigration that have plunged millions of the British working class into destitution and misery. In the same way, a great many poor and working class Britons couldn’t care less about the environment, and a large part of the reason is that the terms of debate about environmental issues have been defined so that the lifestyles of the affluent are never open to discussion, and the costs of environmental protection cascade down the social ladder while the benefits flow up. As Toynbee noted, when society splits into a dominant minority and an internal proletariat, the masses reject not only the leadership but also the ideals and values of their self-proclaimed betters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It happens tolerably often that some of those ideals and values really are important, but when they’ve been used over and over again to justify the policies of the privileged, the masses can’t afford to care. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those Britons who are insisting that the majority doesn’t matter, and their country must stay in the EU no matter what the voters think, have clearly not thought through the implications of last Thursday’s election. Party loyalties have become very fluid just now, and the same 52% of British voters that passed the Brexit referendum could quite readily, with equal disdain for the tender sensibilities of the privileged minority, put a UKIP majority into the House of Commons and send Nigel Farage straight to 10 Downing Stree. If the British establishment succeeds in convincing the working classes and the poor that voting for UKIP is the only way they can make their voices heard, that’s what will happen. It’s a very unwise move, after all, to antagonize people who have nothing to lose. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, a very similar revolt is under way in the United States, with Donald Trump as the beneficiary. As I noted in <a href=../../2016/01/donald-trump-and-politics-of-resentment.html>an earlier post here</a>, Trump’s meteoric rise from long-shot fringe candidate to Republican nominee was fueled entirely by his willingness to put himself in opposition to the consensus of the affluent described earlier. Where all the acceptable candidates were on board with the neoliberal economics and neoconservative politics of the last thirty years—lavish handouts for the rich, punitive austerity for the poor, malign neglect of our infrastructure at home and a monomaniacal pursuit of military confrontation overseas—he broke with that, and the more stridently the pundits and politicians denounced him, the more states he won and the faster his poll numbers rose. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At this point he’s doing the sensible thing, biding his time, preparing for the general election, and floating the occasional trial balloon to see how various arguments against Hillary Clinton will be received. I expect the kind of all-out war that flattened his Republican rivals to begin around the first of September. Nor is Hillary Clinton particularly well positioned to face such an onslaught. It’s not merely that she’s dogged by embarrassingly detailed allegations of corruption on a scale that would be considered unusually florid in a Third World kleptocracy, nor is it simply that her career as Secretary of State was notable mostly for a cascade of foreign policy disasters from which she seems to have learned nothing. It’s not even that on most economic, political, and military issues, Hillary Clinton is well to the right of Donald Trump, advocating positions indistinguishable from those of George W. Bush—you know, the guy the Democrats claimed to hate not too many years back. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No, what makes a Trump victory in November considerably more likely than not is that Clinton has cast herself as the candidate of the status quo. All the positions she’s taken amount to the continued pursuit of policies that, in the United States as in Britain, have benefited the affluent at the expense of everyone else. That was a safe choice back when her husband was President, and both parties were competing mostly over which one could do a better job of comforting the comfortable and afflicting the already afflicted. It’s not a safe choice now, when Trump has thrown away the covert rulebook of modern American politics, and is offering, to people who’ve gotten the short end of the stick for more than thirty years, a set of policy changes that could actually improve their lives. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course that’s not what the politicians, the pundits, and the officially respectable thinkers of today’s consensus of the affluent are willing to talk about. The same dreary rhetoric applied to the pro-Brexit majority in Britain is thus being applied to Trump voters here in the United States. “Racist,” “fascist,” “moron”—all the shopworn, sneering tropes that the privileged use to dismiss the concerns of the rest of the population of today’s America are present and accounted for. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The passion with which these words are being flung about just now should not be underestimated. I had an old friend hang up on me in midsentence because I expressed a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton; we haven’t spoken since, and I have no idea if we ever will. Other people I know have had comparable experiences when they tried to discuss the upcoming election in terms more nuanced than today’s conventional wisdom is willing to permit. One of the most powerful and most unmentionable forces in American public life—class prejudice—pervades the shouting matches that result. To side with Clinton is to identify yourself with the privileged, the “good people,” the affluent circles gazing admiringly at themselves in the Hall of Mirrors. To speak of Trump in any terms other than cheap schoolboy insults, or even to hint that Trump’s supporters might be motivated by concerns other than racism and sheer stupidity, is to be flung unceremoniously outside the gates where the canaille are beginning to gather. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It has apparently not occurred to those who parade up and down the Hall of Mirrors that there are many more people outside those gates than there are within. It has seemingly not entered their darkest dreams that shouting down an inconvenient point of view, and flinging insults at anyone who pauses to consider it, is not an effective way of convincing anyone not already on their side. Maybe the outcome of the Brexit vote will be enough to jar America’s chattering classes out of their stupor, and force them to notice that the people who’ve been hurt by the policies they prefer have finally lost patience with the endless droning insistence that no other policies are thinkable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Maybe—but I doubt it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Outside the Hall of Mirrors, the sky is black with birds coming home to roost. Some of them have already settled on the rooftops of London. More of them are hovering above an assortment of European capitals, and many more are wheeling above the marble domes and pediments of Washington DC. When they land, their impact will shake the world. </div>

If you do the math, the prices and rents that these places command (and I'm not talking about places like London, San Francisco, Vancouver, DC, I just mean any semi-prosperous coastal town) could be used to purchase absurd amounts of real things. For instance, an average Canadian uses about $1200 worth of oil a year (at present prices), which in any of the cities one can expect to find a job in, is at best two months rent and often closer to one. If you make the assumption that most of us in the LTG community make that oil is a master resource, you see both the absurdity and the importance of oil - Canada has a GDP of $52000 based on a consumption of $2000-2500 (natgas, ore, oil, coal) worth of primary resources.<br><br>If you believe the generally accepted narrative that renewables will let us keep on going the way we have been, but energy will become more expensive as a result, then it stands to reason that a person who can afford to live in a desirable suburb or urban center will be relatively less affected by energy prices as a result (or food prices or what have you). I'm a good example of this, I spend far more on rent than I do on energy, whereas the opposite is true for people living in more rural parts of the same province. I can see the lack of concern for the notion that a carbon tax or whatever - after all, if you pay $1000 in rent and $40 for power and $0 for gas (directly), what do price increases mean for you?<br><br>I also notice that on my facebook, which is mostly populated by educated late-20s/early 30's types, the ones who are doing really well for themselves almost always work for the government. Having had some contact with that world, it's not one you'll be accepted into without the usual mannerisms, shibboleths and family backgrounds - in other words, immigrants not welcome. In a certain sense, I can imagine them as the courtiers at Versailles - the complex is the size it is for a reason after all.<br><br>Up here in Canada, the government is spending a fortune on climate change - if they burnt the money on an altar int might work by slowing down the economy - but instead it goes to fund the lifestyles of those in academia and industry that are smart and connected enough to capture it.<br><br><a href=#c7718779842525018322 title="comment permalink">6/29/16, 4:24 PM</a><br><br>

Watching the results last week was enjoyable because of the rejection of the globalism of the elites and the open immigration that floods the lower end of the labor force. It is unfortunate that it gets framed as racism, as I believe people should be free to move. Unfortunately, the lack of movement from the affluent countries to the third world does not level out those moving from third world to the affluent and the fact that there are only so many jobs in a culture. Britain did what it needed to do to remain in some semblance Britain. Hopefully, the US will have a similar result, though the ride will be extremely uncomfortable whichever way November turns.<br><br><a href=#c4050922562103766608 title="comment permalink">6/29/16, 4:27 PM</a><br><br>

He is, so far as I can tell, openly racists, remarkably uniformed, and utterly in love with his own version of the universe; a universe in which he reigns as the smartest, strongest, and bestest. Secretary Clinton is clearly committed to supporting the policies that enrich her class, but Mr. Trump seems equally committed to supporting the policies that enrich himself.<br><br>To me this election isn't so much about a class war between the privileged and the proletariat. It is, given that the only two options being offered by the ruling class are two world class thieves who have spent their<br>entire professional lives deeply embedded in the corruption of the US's political / military / capitalist system, simply the election one would expect in a society that is far, far down the road of decline. The only real debate is which of the two, Secretary Clinton or Mr. Trump, will accelerate that decline the most.<br><br>The cry of Mr. Trump's proletariat isn't “WE WANT FAIRNESS”, or “JUSTICE”, or “LIBERTY”. It is “WE WANT OURS”. They call out for the open oppression of the “others”, of marginalizing anyone who isn't “US”, for cranking up Jim Crow, beating back the rights of women, and forcing “God's rules” on the ungodly. The privileged have betrayed western society, but those who have been betrayed don't seem to have much to offer as an alternative.<br><br>Mr. Trump, after all, didn't hijack the Republican party. He simply pulled the cover off of the policies and attitudes the Republicans have pursued and displayed since Ronald Reagan conned his way into the White House. More likely western society with its pretend-democracy, bankrupted fundamentalist “morality”, and dedication to nothing but greed, has simply run its course. The chaos surrounding the British vote to leave the UN, (though I think the vote itself, and the outcome, was completely justified) and that surrounding the circus that has become the hallmark of all US “elections”, are symptoms; the convulsions of a fatally ill patient in the final hours.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c6471543058041801206 title="comment permalink">6/29/16, 5:32 PM</a><br><br>

I would say that Trump is doing something similar - I'm not optimistic about his motives, I don't think he's going to fix much, but he's taking charge at a time when there is no apparent leadership and things are clearly going wrong, but at least he's charging the hill, and if we get up there, at least we can shoot back".<br><br><a href=#c6052597406146021207 title="comment permalink">6/29/16, 6:19 PM</a><br><br>

The dualist narrative I've encountered over the last decade or so since I first got online has forced me to discard behaviour I recognised in myself, once I saw it in others.<br><br>I think of it as The Three 'A's. Aspergers, Alcohol and Anger management. The people yelling "Moron" are afflicted by one or more of these.<br><br>I managed to discard one of the three. It wasn't alcohol :)<br><br>Anyway, Corbyn is an interesting case. He wasn't calling for a straightforward acceptance of the EU. The EU has had some benefits too, such as the Human Rights Act, and the Working Time Directive, which limited the number of hours workers could be forced to work. It has also functioned reasonably effectively as a means of redirecting wealth towards poorer areas of Europe. I live in Merseyside, England, which benefitted from EU grants far more than it's citizens gave through their taxes. Corbyn's stance was that the EU wasn't perfect, that ordinary working people were right to have a grievence, and that the best way to reform it was from within. He's far from a fringe figure. Yet his nuance was interpreted as ambivalence, and used to reassert establishment control.<br><br><br><a href=#c5040085209599789699 title="comment permalink">6/29/16, 6:28 PM</a><br><br>

Using generalities and insults will never be a good substitute for actual policy critique, but I think we have to look at what immigration means, not only as a policy, but as a buzzword in people's minds.<br><br>Two nights ago, a car in front of a mosque was firebombed in Perth, Western Australia, where I live and the fire-bombers spray-painted F*** ISLAM on the wall. Are they representative of Australian society? Not totally, but yet this sums up to my mind, a sentiment that is strong here, and has it's biggest outlet in the debate around immigration. There is a selective blindness to many people's view of what immigration means. A colour blindness. The majority of immigrants to Perth are from the United Kingdom, Ireland and South Africa. It is a rare thing that anyone complains about these predominantly white people coming and taking our jobs. That ire is focused on people from the Middle east and Africa. I think it is undeniable that this has played a part in the Brexit campaign. Not just a small one either. <br><br>And as for Trump, I personally do not think he is a moron, but I do think he is racist. He may be offering a change of pace, but his remarks about the "Mexican" judge, and Mexicans in general are telling. Yet he has a lot of support from the Hispanic community probably because it seems like they've been shafted for years by the establishment and here is this pseudo-straight talker offering a a new vision (and who, I think, would turn his back on any promises he makes the second it is in his interest to do so). I also think, that if it weren't for the potential of government checks and balances, he could well grow into a fascist ruler. Sealing off borders on religious grounds and monitoring Islamic people internally would be a good start. This mixed with the run-of-the-mill American exceptionalism that always pervades American politics, and his extremely high opinion of himself could be disastrous. Which is not to say that the previous years have been better, but I think if you want a man to bring the dissolution of the union that you have mentioned so frequently, he may be your man.<br><br>I appreciate your attempt to flesh out these debates and infuse them with actual facts, but I just can't look at Brexit or Donald Trump without seeing the tide of racism being on the rise. And my fear also is that it will now affect how Europeans view each other again. Even in the eighties and nineties, French and English still had this old rivalry and tossed bitter stereotypes at each other. With so many of Europe's youth mingling and working and playing together I really think this has done wonders for creating international friendship and removing the animosity. It would be a shame for this trend to go backwards on account of Europe splitting.<br><br><a href=#c8956990311435324811 title="comment permalink">6/29/16, 6:28 PM</a><br><br>

I think ANY characterization of Trump as wanting to implement policy "enforcing the immigration laws, pulling out of trade treaties, and putting obstacles in the way of offshoring jobs," is incomplete. Trump is a metaphor. He MIGHT (if elected) enforce immigration laws, pull out of trade agreements, put obstacles in the way of offshoring jobs. He might not (if elected). More likely, he'd make some symbolic moves (try to pass legslation to build a bigger wall between the USA and Mexico etc). <br><br>But, who really knows? As it stands, based on who he was before now, he certainly does't seem to stand for much. <br><br>Reading my twitter feed today, I note an article that points out that Trump's campaign includes pro-trade lobbyists. <br><br>https://theintercept.com/2016/06/29/trump-team-tpp/<br><br>Amazing!<br><br>If this fact is in fact a fact it could only be bolstered by the writer's claim that Trump has a history of saying whatever the hell he wants to say with no regard to whether he believes what he's saying or not: Trump, the writer asserts, "has a very long history of changing his positions, including taking diametrically opposing views on abortion, immigration, Israel policy, and the minimum wage." <br><br>The upshot? Trump plays the game better than any of the others. No doubt in my mind. He knows how to win this and he might just...and, maybe that should be the discussion, since no one, as far as I can see, seems to be making any headway towards dealing with trade, immigration and global markets.<br><br>I think what we are faced with is a world in which these things might be out of our control. In which those who control technology are the ones who control everybody else. It should go without saying that those, in this argument, are the ones who control the levers of the media. That, in a nutshell, is what drives the frustration people feel (myself included) with the "status quo." <br><br>Thus, I don't know that there could possibly be a coherent meaning to attribute to the why of people voting for Brexit or Trump, other than frustration (real or perceived) at being rendered invisible and powerless. Those things stand for something else. They are ephemeral. They barely have any meaning at all!<br><br><a href=#c7573992138233097726 title="comment permalink">6/29/16, 6:31 PM</a><br><br>

He defends these policies in the name of "Democracy" and "Free Trade", just like our senile elites do and he has a very condescending attitude towards what he calls "parochial sovereignty", just like present day liberals do.<br><br>Toynbee was very much a part of the liberal establishment of his day and its very interesting to see what the practical results of the policies he was promoting have been nearly a century later.

Trump is basically a facade of a self-made billionare. What's been coming out about his finances shows he's inflated his net worth tremendously. He still hasn't released his tax returns, and WaPo thinks that one reason is that all the charitable contributions he's said he's made over the years don't exist. If he gets into the White House, either he's going to be a loose canon or the bureaucracy will run him around.<br><br>I see Clinton as a one-term president, for the simple reason that if Sanders has the brains God gave a rutabaga, he'll be building a grass-roots organization that will be able to make some realistic proposals for the way forward. Hopefully, he'll listen to the pain points that Trump has his thumb on and do something about it - as of right now he's talking to a completely different demographic about completely different issues.<br><br>Clinton doesn't have to run a competent campaign, whatever that means.

I live in deep Trump country, "Make America Great Again" signs have been appearing on roadsides for months. One candidate for the State house in an extremely white and conservative corner of the state actually translated this into the words everyone really hear in their heads, and put up campaign billboards for himself with happy caucasian faces that said "Make America White Again." But the strongest Trump supporters are NOT the poor around here. They are the rural middle class, the old families, the landlords and slumlords, the business owners, those who live comfortably on their government and pension payments here in the "Check Republic" (that's a pun, note the spelling). <br><br>So all these statistics showing that Trump's voters are less well educated and less affluent I think are ignoring important covariation. Trump's voters are the same people the Republicans have been courting with their "Southern Strategy" for decades. They are the same people who would have been Dixiecrats in the 1950s and 1960s. These voters occur nationwide, of course, as the Republicans have discovered to their everlasting glee. They are NOT the disaffected former wage class. They are the same old small town and rural conservatives they have always been. Again, they are the rural middle class. <br><br>But here is the thing: The rural middle class is less well educated than the urban middle class. And they make less money than the urban middle class. It's cheaper to live out here, $50K is a quite comfortable middle class household income, but would leave you in a squalid hovel in most urban areas. And since you don't neek $100K to survive, you don't need advanced degrees to make a living wage. Really, when I say "rural," I actually mean the exurbs and outer newer suburbs, the formerly rural areas that are now feeders and bedrooms for urban areas, and retirement places for those who despise Florida and Arizona (i.e. sensible people). So if you take the average middle class person in Trump country, they are less well educated and lower income than the average middle class person in Hillary/Bernie country. But they are NOT "poorer." <br><br>Again, I live in deep Trump Country in a truly rural area beyond the exurbs. Trump's base here is not people who lost their jobs to globalization. It is the same old same old of conservative middle aged and older folks as has always been the "Republican Base," the same people who got Reagan elected (demographically, not literally, of course). Trump just has them motivated with his code words and dog whistles, and their voter turnout and enthusiasm have skyrocketed. <br><br>There's also not yet much evidence that Trump is going anywhere farther than where he already is. I just checked the most recent 17 polls on the national election on RealClearPolitics, every single one shows Clinton leading by between 1 and 12%, a margin that has increased in recent months. There's no evidence yet that he is catching on beyond the base. <br><br>Though he doesn't necessarily agree entirely with my thesis, here's another voice from Tennessee about Trump (abundant profanity, because that is the way we talk around here):<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsqKyv86pEY<br><br><a href=#c5426570993979674615 title="comment permalink">6/29/16, 7:17 PM</a><br><br>

Apparently they have extremely high standards for naturalization. Two girls were turned down for refusing to participate in a required swimming class because it was coed. A young man was turned down for refusing to shake hands with a female teacher; others for not greeting passersby on the street. While it is certainly possible that the standards are applied unfairly, (and it is pretty clear that these cases probably involve Muslims) an issue the article did not address, the overall message seems to be "if you want to be Swiss, you must act Swiss."<br><br>Before immigration from the EU became an issue the UK had been absorbing large numbers of immigrants from former colonies--Pakistanis and Indians, Jamaicans, Africans, Hong Kong Chinese and so forth. Of course these immigrants came with the advantage of having learned some English and of being familiar with British customs, holidays, sports, literature and so forth. There is still resentment, but I think it is of a different quality than being asked to accept Poles, Ukrainians, etc. <br><br>Quantities matter also.

All I've been saying since it started, and I'm amazed how often it's shouted down, is "It's not all racism." I find it hard to believe the majority of British adults are so racist they would vote against their own interests merely to spite brown people.

What I mean is that by polarizing everything into a linear political spectrum, we can't have dichotomies, or hold a point of view that conflicts with itself. It's either one sphere or the other. If we contradict ourselves in anyway we are automatically labeled as hypocrites. It has occurred to me self contradiction is essential to philosophy and to spiritual growth, the places we cover ourselves- Where we can peel the layers back and discover something new. Maybe a dichotomy is a better mirror than a mirror; our glass mirrors only show us as we are. Then are prone to shatter. Dichotomies at least have a second set of wings to try. You might say these are the birds who now are coming home to roost. <br><br>It seems to me the election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is to abstract a thing to grasp in daily life.

One of them anticipated a phrase in tonight's essay, and both of them together sum up one of its theses pretty well, in my humble opinion. The first one should appeal to all those defecting establishment Republicans too!<br><br><b>Clinton 2016: Don't Rock the Handbasket!</b><br><br><b>Trump 2016: Bad Idea, But What Have You Got to Lose?</b><br><br>However, it appears to me that Trump has so far been erring in a way you've been warning us about since 2008: relying too much on abstractions, the more abstract elements of a campaign (specifically, media news coverage and social media), while neglecting the physical components (such as offices containing lists of supporters and people who can get those supporters to knock on doors and drive seniors to polling places). On that level, Clinton has been out-building Trump organizationally by orders of magnitude. Maybe that's a temporary condition, or maybe that old fashioned stuff is irrelevant given the political landscape you've laid out. But unless Trump's present "biding his time" includes an awful lot of very fast work in that area, and without expecting much help from the experienced establishment Republican minions who are best at it, I have to see it as a huge (or "yuuge") and potentially crippling disadvantage. People can believe what they believe in whatever numbers, but in the end they have to pull the levers or push the buttons.<br><br>Sure, if all those Clinton phone bankers and door knockers were only saying things that infuriate a majority of Americans they'd be worse than useless. But they're not; they're adapting. They've co-opted Sanders talking points about student loan debt, stronger labor unions, and a higher minimum wage, among other things. Now that both presumptive nominees are promising things the working class wants (even though no one believes they will happen), status quo party demographics (which favor Clinton) loom larger.<br><br><a href=#c8645442295435212905 title="comment permalink">6/29/16, 8:50 PM</a><br><br>

In the run-up to the Australian Federal Election, there has been an unusually frequent number of comments about the "inadvisability" of voting for minor parties and independent candidates, from both the major parties and media commentators alike. The campaign to 'vote small party and independent' is all over the social media. And, it's only gotten more intense since the Brexit result. The only response to this, that the major party candidates seem capable of, is to mouth the timeworn meme that a vote for anyone but them, is "wasted" and that a 'hung-parliament' will result in "chaos". That and the usual "sledging" of non-major-party candidates and independents (particularly Nick Xenophon), who look like doing well.

When the dominant elite succeeds in alienating the internal proletariat completely, something like that's the usual result. <br><br>Aunteater, and which party has more of them in its pocket. <br><br>Mark, what makes you think that the next round of candidates will be any better? For all you or I know, if Trump is defeated this time around, the next guy to succeed in rallying the masses will be fond of armbands and jackboots. <br><br>Justin, I think I know the guy the Onion interviewed! <br><br>Paul, er, the EU is effective at redirecting wealth toward the poor parts of Europe? In what alternate universe is this? The Eurozone is a wealth pump that benefits Germany and a few other northern countries at the expense of the Mediterranean countries -- Greece, Italy, and Spain in particular have been bled dry. <br><br>Dau, I think you're missing my point. The fact that some opponents of mass immigration are racists does not mean that racism is the only reason why people might be concerned about mass immigration -- and in Britain in particular, huge numbers of people have solid economic reasons to object to a process that drives down wages. <br><br>John, of course. "But Trump's a racist!" serves the same role in this discussion that all the handwaving about the benefits of the internet did when I pointed out that the survival of the internet depends on its ability to pay its own costs -- a way of dodging an acutely uncomfortable issue. <br><br>Jason, obviously I disagree. Whether or not Trump's statements mean anything, the way that voters have ignored the pundits and flocked to him means a great deal, as I've tried to point out. <br><br>Bill, Japan's policies are extremely sensible. The faster they get their population down, the more likely something more or less like Japan is to survive into the next century. <br><br>Rich_P, true enough. The desperate are rarely if ever interested in nuances. <br><br>Allexis, I've heard the same thing from a number of British readers of mine who vote Labour. If the politicians and pundits want to see Mr. Farage become Prime Minister, they're going about it the right way. <br><br>Submarine, good. Toynbee was a member of the Royal Institute for International Affairs, the British affiliate of the Council on Foreign Relations; his ideas have in large part guided the Anglo-American establishment for three quarters of a century -- and I think it's crucial to see his book as a reaction against Spengler, an attempt to defend the plutocratic-democratic state against Spengler's criticism.

All the while this has been sold to the population as a welfare safety net, but what most people don't tend to realise is that the fat cats who eat the tokens, want 2% of the balance every year and they don't tend to realise that there may be a slight difference between hedge funds and pension funds.

That may be the reason I can understand the implications of the Brexit and the confusion surrounding the rise of Donald Trump.

(Maybe we ought to try getting together like many others here are doing.)<br><br>I share your impression that Japan is at least heading in a better direction than most places, but has a very long way to go. Also, their reasons for rejecting massive immigration and reducing their population have little if anything to do with rational future planning. Raising kids takes loads of money, so they just can't afford them, but even more than Americans, they believe in technology. As times get more and more desperate, I think they are likely to ignore the problems technology has created and turn to it as a last hope. Farmland is being lost at a terrible rate, and there are all kinds of structural impediments to participation in agriculture. If they continue in their current direction, they are likely to turn to someone like Monsanto for solutions and really screw up their remaining farmland. And for us? Well, I guess it will be pass the popcorn, Bill. It would be a shame to waste such a spectacular without any good friends around to share it with!<br><br>I also get the impression that 99% of the Japanese have no idea what the significance of the Brexit vote really was, even the international and relatively socially aware.<br><br><a href=#c3656545490628997632 title="comment permalink">6/29/16, 10:15 PM</a><br><br>

As far as I can tell progressives only really know two political stories: Hitler and the Civil Rights Movement. Talk to them about how Trump is more comparable to Andrew Jackson and they will just talk about how AJ owned slaves. This is the self-professed urban intellectual class as well, just full of cookie cutter narratives that fit worse every day. <br><br>The biggest irony of the past few years politically is that progressives want to wage ideological war on rural white men, while inviting over people whose cultures are openly intolerant and hostile to democracy, secularism and progressivism itself. <br><br>For context, I was Nader voter only a decade ago. Most of the people I talked to disagreed with me but it was a low hostility conversation. Now I can't have an honest conversation with almost all of my friends - once any of my ideas resemble thought crime... it's the same reaction I see from a lot of the normally thoughtful people on this blog.

Like I said, I agree there is a lot more to this than racism, and calling all the "leavers" racists is wrong. And unhelpful. But there is a growing fear in Europe of what is happening, and a lot of the blame is being passed to the outsiders, the "new Europeans." I actually agree with everything you said, the "left" is no better and in the US, there are few Democrats as hawkish as Hillary and in a position to act on her hwkish desires, and there is no denying that there are economic factors, and sovereignty issues at play in the Brexit decision, when it comes to being a part of a trading bloc like the EU. It's just that unfortunately, I feel much of it is framed in terms of us versus them, with the "them" very much being poor, eastern Europeans, Africans or folks from the Middle East. It is the degree to which racism is a part of it all that we don't agree on. Other than that, it is as usual a great synopsis of current events.<br><br><a href=#c6680198890729629241 title="comment permalink">6/29/16, 10:47 PM</a><br><br>

This certainly contributed to their win but increasingly it looks like they ran a detailed and targeted campaign which focused only on winnable marginal seats. This is demonstrated by the police investigations into the sums spent in 30 seats by the Tories (we have spending limits in the UK). Safe Tory seats were pretty much ignored by the Tory campaign machine.<br><br>I think that the failure of the remain camp was threefold. Firstly as you point out we were fighting an uphill struggle against a disaffected working class who wanted to stick two fingers up at Westminster - a standard protest vote and one that a lot of people are regretting (nose bitten clean off). <br><br>Secondly, the only offering from the elite classes to the working classes is an aspiration to become middle class, i.e. not to be who they are any more. This also translates to: if you are working class, you are worthless. <br><br>Finally, there is a lot to be said about the magic in the campaigns. The ritualistic mantra of 'taking control' from the leave campaign was far more powerful than any intellectual argument the remainers had.<br><br><a href=#c5527256155292923243 title="comment permalink">6/29/16, 11:14 PM</a><br><br>

If this can't shake the elites out of their senility, nothing can. Instead they've gone for doubling down and playing a blame game which is liable to tear the current parliament apart and leave UKIP thinking all their Christmases have come at once. (The most likely mechanism at this point is that, with the parliamentary Labour party doing its best to oust a leader strongly supported by the *actual* Labour party, the Tories will force a general election on the assumption that this will gift them the election and provide a mandate for their new leader. If that leader is pro-Brexit, they might just get away with it.) At this point, I'm not even sure which is worse.<br><br>I voted Leave, basically on the principle that the dynamics you've sketched out above will have a worse fallout the longer they're left to fester, and despite being very tempted to spoil the ballot. Since I run in today's elite circles it's fair to say I haven't been very open about this fact - it's fair to say I'd be willing to spend the ten hours on explanation if I thought any of my peers would understand at the end of it, but instead I find myself walking the line of how far I can criticise the EU without starting a full-blown feud. Fun times.<br><br>For anybody wondering: if Britain joins the European Economic Area, the migration laws will be pretty much exactly as they are now. If it doesn't, the government will still be hard-pressed to limit immigration; it's important to remember that migration may be encouraged for elitist reasons but it's also part of a typical periphery-core direction of movement in declining civilisations. If Britain becomes an authoritarian isolationist state, yeah, that might make some difference, because nobody will want to live here.<br><br><a href=#c49285323746133098 title="comment permalink">6/29/16, 11:58 PM</a><br><br>

That didn't stop him from racking up one victory after another. The point that's been missed is that he's only alienating the <i>affluent</i> electorate, and that's not ultimately a big enough sector of the voting public to matter. <br><br>Bill, here in Cumberland, the Trump campaign headquarters is in the poor part of town, and Trump yard signs are all over the neighborhoods where the poor live. The South may be atypical -- here in the rust belt, Trump has a great deal of support from the poor, and not just the white poor, by the way.<br><br>Rita, and you'll notice the Swiss seem to be doing tolerably well these days...<br><br>Ben, yes, I've heard all the same things. Gah. <br><br>Kevin, thank you. I'm trying to point and laugh at our current crop of underdressed emperors as loudly as I can!<br><br>Pygmycory, nope. As far as I know, no study exploring that possibility has been able to get funding, and I suspect none ever will. Lacking that, we have to go by historical experience and those rules of political economy that seem to work more often than not, such as the law of supply and demand. <br><br>Jes, I disagree. It's very easy to apply that kind of cynicism to democratic systems, but I'd argue that it's simplistic. Of course democracies are corrupt and subject to manipulation -- they always have been and always will be -- but they can, as in this case, reflect the opinions of that fraction of the people who take an interest in politics, and doing so is a good way to have a slightly less abusive kind of government than the alternatives. I'm with Winston Churchill on this one: "Democracy is the worst system of government, except for all the others." <br><br>W.B., no argument there. The spit-slinging frenzy on the part of the pundits and the privileged that followed the Brexit vote was the closest political equivalent to a two-year-old's tantrum I've seen in a tolerably long time. <br><br>Fedd27, I don't disagree. You'll notice that I put maybe one post a month into politics, and the others head in different directions. <br><br>Dale, thank you!<br><br>Nastarana, I'm definitely considering a Bernie write-in or a Green Party vote this year. I consider Trump a less disastrous choice than Clinton, but you'll notice that this is very lukewarm praise -- and since I expect him to win at a walk, I might as well put my vote to use helping to boost one of the alternatives. <br><br>W.B., congratulations! That's a big step -- a declaration of independence from one of the great time-wasters of our era. I'm sorry to say that at the moment my livelihood depends on having more access than I can get from the local library system, or I'd never have gotten home internet service in the first place. (I was a very late adopter, and not an enthusiastic one.) <br><br>Unknown Deborah, of course. Enforcing the immigration laws and using executive orders to, say, penalize companies that offshore jobs in terms of access to government contracts, would be a good start, though. <br><br>John the P., I ain't arguing!<br><br>John C., I'm not surprised you got that kind of reaction. Class prejudice runs very deep in American public life. <br><br>Gwizard43, of course things could go messily wrong -- and in fact they probably will. The point I want to make is that the affluent classes can no longer count on being able to get whatever they want at the expense of everyone else, and the sooner that's grasped, the better.<br><br><a href=#c665817914282079279 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 12:34 AM</a><br><br>

I regret to inform you that my country has gone stark raving mad in the wake of this referendum. Yesterday I saw images of young people marching around outside the houses of parliament demanding their right to demand their rights be curtailed. I’ve heard spluttering attacks on the idea of democracy, calls to charge with treason those who want to retain sovereignty and – my favourite – a narrow-shouldered and bespectacled university student calling for ‘pre-emptive’ attacks on working class white males (one can only imagine the carnage). <br><br>I wrote a blog post a few days before the referendum was held outlining why I considered voting Leave would be an ethical choice – the one that held out the possibility for doing the least damage in a bad situation. I made sure to be very careful with how I framed my argument, because Project Fear was in full swing and people in the Remain camp were calling anyone who disagreed with them a racist or a bigot. Before I put it out to the world I dithered for a moment – slightly fearful of the consequences. But then I reminded myself that we live in a democracy where free speech is valued, and so I pressed it. The screen button on Blogger that reads ‘Publish’ in this case might as well have read ‘Commit Social Suicide and Run For Cover’. <br><br>In the days that followed I got a few good and thoughtful comments from regular readers (many of whom will be present here) but it wasn’t until it ended up being shared of social media that the haters started coming forth. And boy did they come forth. I can confirm that all the regular bulling names have been hurled my way, and then some. Of course this is all water off a duck’s back when it’s anonymous people that you don’t know, but when long-term friends and even relatives started using them I began to feel taken aback. “Democracy wasn’t invented so that people like you could abuse it,” snarled someone whose funeral I shall now probably not attend. “You have no empathy for the little people like me,” wailed a boutique-owner who enjoys several exotic holidays every year. I tried to repel their accusation but they just hammered on with the same illogic and it wasn’t long before I realised I was dealing with straw zombies. You can hit ‘em and destroy ‘em but they just keep coming.<br><br>At the same time I got a couple of private messages from grateful people who said I had influenced the way they had voted but begged me not to let on to anyone. <br><br>End of Part 1<br><br><a href=#c5760743856508890878 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 1:13 AM</a><br><br>

At least one of my eyebrows was raised to see people from the Transition Network movement (“Local, self-sufficient, optimistic”) sharing the same basic position as Goldman Sachs and billionaire vulture fund financier George Soros (who now writes for The Guardian). And it was a masterstroke of foot-shootery on the part of the Remain campaign to wheel out multi-millionaire footballer David Beckham the day before the polls opened in the hope of trying to persuade the ‘little people’ to vote against their natural instincts – certainly an own goal in this case.<br><br>In the aftermath, apart from all the groupthink and the two minutes’ hating going on, there’s the emergent phenomenon of conspicuous grieving. I know of people who held a ‘grief party’ where they held hands and shed tears over the fact that a giant and undemocratic neoliberal superstate will no longer have so much influence over their lives. “Who will care for the planet now?” wailed a Greenpeace poster. Others are wearing safety pins in their lapels to ‘reassure’ immigrants that they personally are not racists (which is an unexamined narrative: 2/3 of Leave voters cited constitutional and democratic considerations to have been more important than immigration, and many naturalised immigrants voted Leave too).<br><br>Another narrative that is being heavily promoted at present is that older voters have ‘stolen the future’ of younger ones. This despite the fact that only about 3 in every 10 people under 25 actually bothered to cast their vote, contrasted with a much higher turnout for older voters (who, one might argue, have lived long enough to realise Project Fear was just that). Many over 50 said they would ‘crawl through minefields’ to get a chance to throw a rotten tomato at David Cameron and the EU. Young voters in London (who were being counted on to swing it), by contrast, didn’t want to go out in the rain. It is the latter group who are now demanding a second referendum.<br><br>My takeaway from this is that people don’t like to have a mirror held up to them. I have always been concerned that one of the main unknowns in any collapse situation is the way our fellow citizens will behave. If this Brexit vote is anything to go by we should probably be more worried about this point. I’m grateful at least to know whom I can trust not to freak out at the drop of a pin. That, at least, is something positive that has come of this.<br><br><a href=#c4154080254394444999 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 1:13 AM</a><br><br>

My colleagues are well-educated young engineers used to travelling every month, who never have to worry about unemployment, lead the metropolitan hipster lifestyle, have generous pension benefits, and are all married to foreigners. While they are not exactly part of the elite, they definitely profit from the current arrangements. And they could not fathom the referendum results.<br><br>They of course said the predictable things: that such a small majority should not be enough for such an important decision, that since the Leavers were mostly uneducated, and the Remainers well-educated, education level should somehow be taken into account. That the Leave arguments were all lies (on which I do not really disagree, but that is not really the point).<br><br>And that now most people have regretted their vote anyway, so Britain should have a new referendum and forget about the whole thing once Remain wins. <br><br>As an uneducated immigrant son of uneducated parents who have seen their meager prospects worsen substantially over the past 20 years or so, it all sounded very arrogant and blindsided indeed.<br><br>And as you write, I kept my mouth shut.

For three quarters of a century we have been seeking to re-order our society according to commercial precepts. And now we can see the results as they come in. Consider.<br> We no longer have citizens but consumers. Our spirituality (not to be confused with religion) has been replaced with materialism. We no longer seek community fellowships but fill them with commercially-packaged games which often come down to watching a bunch of millionaires play a ball-game between themselves.<br> Regular full-time jobs with future prospects has been replaced with zero-hour contracts and ad-hoc worker placements. This ranges from near the top to all the way down deep into the labour pool. Know another name for contract workers? Mercenaries.<br> Communities have been shredded with no thought as to the implications for the people there. Margaret Thatcher herself insisted that there was no such thing as society. It has become a sort of Social Darwinism with those left out abandoned but still watched - and policed!<br> In summation, all those bonds that gave our life meaning have been cut and what we have in place has not proven worthwhile. Not even close.<br> All the experts that came out for Remain - the economist, the politicians, the soldiers - had all proven themselves highly flawed in both their thinking and their judgment over the years but had not realised it themselves. What is worse, many of them were either responsible for how our society is being shaped or demanding an intensification of it.<br> People like Obama thought that they could directly threaten the British people thug-life style with dire retaliation. It did not work in 1940 and it sure as hell did not work in 2016.<br> It may be that we are in for dark times but as they say - it is only in the dark of night that you can see the stars.<br><br><a href=#c7762658514238526301 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 1:22 AM</a><br><br>

My guess as to the most likely cause of catastrophe, though, is that Clinton orders air strikes on Syrian government targets, and Russian antiaircraft systems respond by shooting down US planes. Clinton throws a tantrum and orders an all-out air assault on Russian assets in Syria, and the Russians respond by scrambling scores of fighters to take on the US planes, and targeting the US carrier group(s) in the eastern Mediterranean with hypersonic missiles. Thirty minutes later, the bubble of American military invincibility has been popped, and away we go. It could happen somewhere else, but Clinton's cheerleading for regime change in Syria makes that look like the most likely place for conflict. <br><br>Abelardsnazz, "maybe we live in a self-referential bubble..." Oh, if only their equivalents in the US could have that moment of insight!<br><br>Greenish, it might just be that you put different weights on the variables. As with the issue of Brexit, the US election is one in which it's possible to have reasoned disagreement as to the best choice -- though you'll find few people who will admit that! <br><br>Stephen, I know, I know, it's a dreadful habit of mine. ;-)<br><br>Jason B, you say that like it's a bad thing. <br><br>Myriad, Trump didn't have much of a ground game in the run for the nomination, and he still swept past vastly better funded and organized candidates. My guess is that he's counting on the same effect this time, and I don't think he's mistaken to do so. The ground game matters most in a contest between candidates who don't actually differ that much on the issues; when the voters are worked up about issues that are central to the campaign, campaign organization is a lot less important. What Trump needs to do to win this election is to convince the wage class in the flyover states that he can do something about the malign neglect that's been inflicted on them for the last forty years. That won't take organization -- it'll take stump speeches and viral publicity, which he's extremely good at. But we'll see...<br><br>Bootstrapper, hmm! I hope the third parties and the independent candidates do well. Anything that'll shake the grip of the consensus of the affluent is a good thing.<br><br>Cherokee, I hope the cup of tea helped.

That's dramatic, and if it keeps happening, it will send global climate into completely unfamiliar territory. <br><br>Wendy, that's a useful attitude to have. <br><br>Ursachi, you're in a very different situation from Britain's, of course, and I can well see that the EU would make a lot more sense from where you stand. If it can be reformed in some way that would deal with its cascading problems, that would be welcome -- but it doesn't exactly give me hope to watch so many EU officials insisting that change is not an option. <br><br>Sheila, you're welcome and thank you. I grew up in the south Seattle suburbs and lived in Seattle until I couldn't stand it any longer; "chewed up and spit out" is an understatement. The city I knew and loved is a festering corpse, with an assortment of overpaid tech flacks as maggots-in-chief. <br><br>Jason, you might consider learning what the word "fascist" means, as you're misusing it. <a href=../../2014/02/fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html rel=nofollow>This post</a> might be a good place to start. <br><br>Roland, yes, I saw that.

It's a great source of information about how the socially liberal part of the elite thinks. Of course, during these elections, he's all in for Hillary Clinton.

Or "Bernie bros don't signal a leftward shift: Political affiliations are tribal, not policy-based." I guess that this kind of thought is what is driving Clinton to appeal to young voters by looking 'cool' and hipster. But the best one was when he shared an article (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/opinion/sunday/when-did-optimism-become-uncool.html?smid=tw-share) that argued that, since everything is going fine in America and in the world, the rise of candidates that say that it isn't is not understandable.

The print version is in process -- the publisher and I have settled contract terms and the signed contract will be in the mail shortly -- and I'll post detailed info here once it's available. <br><br>David, 52% of those who cared enough to vote voted for Brexit, and as I recall, quite a few more people voted in this election than in the last general election, so as mandates go, it's considerable. <br><br>Unknown, I know.

As I suggested in the post, though, I tend to think that the framing is an effect rather than a cause. <br><br>Ien, thank you. <br><br>Stuart, certainly those were important.

It's a real mess, and none of the likely outcomes are particularly pleasant. Still, keep in mind that independent nations can, and many do, pass laws limiting immigration, and those laws work. Did you see the discussions earlier about Swiss and Japanese immigration policy? Neither of those nations are authoritarian isolationist states, and neither one admits many immigrants. <br><br>Yahoo2, to my mind that's an overly simplistic view.

Stick to your guns -- I'm coming to think that people defending the consensus of the affluent these days are so frantic and angry because they themselves no longer quite believe in the slogans they're mouthing. We're approaching an inflection point of quite some importance, when old narratives get tossed aside because the gap between the world they imagine and the one we actually inhabit has gotten too wide; on the far side, things will look very different indeed. <br><br>DiSc, and it may happen in the Netherlands, or so I hear. <br><br>Kevin, thanks for that final image!

With the exception of some Ethno-Religious minorities' "well dodgy" use of proxy votes deliberate fraud in elections in Britain is almost unknown. Under the current paper and pencil voting system rigging an election would require the complicity of thousands of volunteer vote counters and hundreds of election officers. One likely result of the Brexit vote will probably be calls for a "more modern" electronic voting system. After all, "It's the Current Year!"

You can't point to the grossly inflated profits of the banks and the multinationals and wealth of the cities without being accused of being anti business and progress.

I would love to be able to point out the good points of immigration, alongside the bad points, in a way to improve it for everybody. But you can't even try to start a conversation that mentions the bad points without having to declare you are not a racist. And you know you will still be accused of it nevertheless, for having the temerity to speak up. So many of us do not. Leaving only the extremes to argue their minority viewpoints.<br><br>This is the true danger of the situation.

All-inclusive, open to committed technocrats from any planet, there is never any voting or apparent need to decide contentious issues in a democratically accountable way, and everyone's skills locate them in a place where they are valued, and also sustained without having to argue terms and conditions.

Of course there are some strong reactions - many Remainers think there will be numerous and severe consequences to Brexit, a view I don't particularly share. And those who call for a second referendum can justifiably be accused of being sore losers, as long as we recognise that the Brexit campaign would (and DID, when Farage thought he was going lose) make the same demand if the boot was on the other foot.<br><br>The fact is there are many Remainers, affluent and otherwise, who would agree with you 100% about the way the working classes have suffered under globalisation, and who have fought (or at least voted against) the succession of right-wing governments that attacked the labour movement, privatised the NHS, cut benefits for disabled people, dismantled social housing and so on. <br><br>And here's the context I think you are missing (although it may be implicit in your Whigs and Tories review): Euroscepticism isn't something new - it's been grinding on as an issue for decades now, and through that whole time its chief proponents have been those who are most enthusiastic about attacking the labour movement, privatising the NHS etc. etc.<br><br>The upshot is that, for the Remainers I have spoken to, the response is much more nuanced, despite the disappointment and anger they feel. They are more likely to see many Brexit voters as duped or conned, rather than moronic. It may be patronising but, given the charlatans running the Brexit campaign (and their actions since the vote) it's hardly irrational, and it doesn't constitute class hatred. <br><br>This may be a key difference with Trump, by the way. Politically he is something of an unknown quantity.

Trump steamrolled over his Republican opposition in narrowly focused, highly partisan affairs that attracted rather few voters, even from within party ranks.

Not being a British citizen I was not able to vote, but would have voted to Leave given the opportunity.<br><br>Both Leave and Remain slogans had no effect on me. I had my answer long before the campaigning even started. I saw how Greece was treated a year ago, and to me it showed that EU is <i>a dangerous company to hang out with</i>. Thinking of it now, I don't recall this particular point ever being made in media of record; I wonder how many people think along similar lines, unnoticed.<br><br>The idea of a second referendum is beyond ridiculous. For the 43 years that the UK was part of the EU it has managed to negotiate for itself a number of exceptions, preferential treatments etc. on a thinly veiled threat (i.e. promise) that <i>if you impose yourselves too much on us, then we may leave</i>. Now it has an opportunity to keep that promise - and it wants to say instead that <i>no, it's just us talking</i>. Then why would it still keep the special treatments? Again, I do not recall a similar line of reasoning mentioned in the media.<br><br>The Scottish politicians are now making noises about a second Scottish independence referendum, pointing out that Scotland has voted almost 2 to 1 in favor of Remaining. I say let them vote, and let them leave if that's how the vote turns out. I'd rather have a friendly neighbor that a housemate with a grudge.<br><br>And on a more personal level, Poles are now being harassed. Slogans to the effect that Poles are unwelcome were painted on a Polish shop and a Polish community centre, and also printed on a homemade leaflet which was then distributed in a certain village. Now <i>this</i> is reported widely by the media. Funny how similar things were not newsworthy before the referendum. Frankly, they shouldn't be newsworthy at all - when a native population of 60+ million and an immigrant group of 1 million interact, there's bound to be some friction somewhere sometime. That does not make us victims, and we don't like being portrayed as such.<br><br>MigrantWorker<br><br><a href=#c92245772082090813 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 3:26 AM</a><br><br>

Revolution eats its children. I saw the news of ceaucescu's impromptu execution shortly beforely leaving the USA permanently in late 1989. I got to Germany 14 months later, using England as a between stop to get an EU passport. <br><br>Two famous songs by German bands reflected zeitgeist, wind of change(film gorkypark) and freiheit(freedom, freedom it's the only thing that counts). Decades later former Eastern Europe is an economic, political, military colony of Germany with mass emigration. Nato expansion, risnig nationalism, dictatorial regimes show a phase of democracy reached by weimar Germany. Ukraine is way past that phase, a central african basket case. The ideals in video for wind of change, 'we could be all brothers', were misused by the elites to push their profit agenda as far as it could go geographically. Various articles now ask what will result out of this. Could the wealthy manipulate the agenda somehow to gain the upper hand even when EU disintegrates? Perhaps we could get a trade breakdown and severe recession in even core countries like germany, france, holland, england, scandinavia leading to extremist takeovers, nazi type purges, civil war in europe. Freedom is a coin with two sides. Free to do what? New car with a roadmap to nwhere. Sociopaths have a tendency to grab stearing wheel. Ideology of monied elites, racist crazies are both unwelcome. Golden rule has few adherents during a revolution. Where does one stop. After nazi takeover revenge was taken and blood flowed. Hitler finally put out the word to stop. Pol Pot was more thorough, permanent revolution. Robespierre lost own head. Of course in the end hitler only stopped internal murders as they were germans. Foreign killings had yet to start. Left wingers like mao, pol pot, lenin , stalin based killings on ideology, not blood lines. Everyone has their own mentl illness. Unleashing a flood dam washes away good with bad all at once. Civil war atmosphere building up the more change is blocked. If Trump wins lots will happen. If he loses the dam will burst more violently later. Europe luckily can break apart in pieces gradually. This should hinder cold war with Russia at least and TTIP. American revolution helped french revolution. Now maybe Europeans help Americans revolt.

In fact, it might even occur before she is sworn in or even elected if the people itching for a military confrontation in Syria (including the 51 so-called "diplomats") think she might lose the election. I think the scenario you describe is quite plausible. America's puffery over Russia severely underestimates the true capacities of that country and its peoples.<br><br>What I am curious about is what do you think happens after "the bubble of American military invincibility has been popped"?<br><br>My main reason for opposing a Clinton presidency is I fear what might happen on the mainland in an all-out war since some of the elites seem to think they are invincible. On the other hand, if America's ability to throw its weight around were curtailed without invoking MAD, it might ironically provide a real reason to vote the old harpy in.<br><br>So sad, BTW, to hear of Seattle's fate!

I hear many 'Brexiteers' saying how they felt they couldn't speak out for fear of ridicule, but the reverse was also true. Certainly my local pub had so many loud 'Brexiteers' that it was the 'Remainians' who were quietly huddled in the corner to avoid having to wipe the saliva-spray from their foreheads.<br><br>I thought the campaigning was pretty atrocious on both sides - I was convinced by the end that Cameron must have been a closet Brexiteer, his performance was so lacklustre. <br><br>Anyway, I had a lot of people explaining why they were voting whichever way they did, whilst nodding sagely and saying that I 'couldn't possibly comment'. Most of the Outers who I spoke too will be disappointed, because their reasons for voting as they did will not be met. In fact, both sides are going to be disappointed by the outcome in the long run. <br><br>From my small, unscientific sample of the voters, I could discern a few strands of support for Brexit. Some clearly were concerned about issues of 'sovereignty' and red tape and the democratic deficit. Some just wanted to 'stick it to the establishment'. Some felt pushed out of economic chances by EU migration. And some, frankly, were just out and out racists, xenophobes, and misanthropes.<br><br>Some I've spoken to since have said they voted 'leave' to register a protest, because they thought Brexit would never win, and that they are now horrified at what they had done.<br><br>I was particularly disturbed on the day, because a lot of people came to the polling station saying 'I want to vote with a pen because it says on Facebook that the polling booths only have pencils because our votes will be rubbed out if we vote to leave'. Such uncritical acceptance of that sort of conspiracy theory betrays not only flawed analytical skills, but a profound ignorance of how the whole system is staffed, organised and policed. So much for informed decision-making.<br><br>This latest wave of violence against minorities is also a worrying sign. It's as though the old far-right groups have been emboldened by the vote, taking it as 'permission' to return to their street-fighting ways. To hear of schools being leafletted with 'kick out the Polish vermin' bills, attacks on mosques and community centres etc is worrying. And the rhetoric going with it: 'We won the vote, so **** off back home now'. My first thoughts were 'Merry Krystalnacht, Nigel'.<br><br>So, all round, bit of a humpty-dumpty watershed. The parliamentary Labour party isn't helping either, leaving the only alternative rallying point for the working classes out of commission for the duration, but that's their own mess to sort out, now. <br><br>But anyone thinking they've 'stuck it to the establishment' will be sorely disappointed. Boris may be a shoe-in, or maybe not, but don't imagine this Anglo-Saxon, middle-aged, Eton-educated male is anything but the establishment having a bad-hair day. I never thought the day would arrive when I'd have to utter the words 'I think I prefer Theresa May'!<br><br>And talking of Borises, I can imagine who else is rubbing his hands with glee....<br><br><a href=#c265862712274648327 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 4:34 AM</a><br><br>

I think for me the most interesting aspect is the mutiny that has happened in the Labour Party against its (left wing) leader Jeremy Corbyn. 200 odd members of the parliamentary labour party have voted in a vote of no confidence. Only 40 odd didn’t. These represent the ‘blarites’ or right wing element of the Labour party. They didn’t have to do this to launch a leadership campaign against him. They did it for maximum damage. The need Corbyn to resign, or he will be a contender in the contest that undoubtedly he will win. It should be remembered that he was voted in by the party membership with a majority that even Tony Blair couldn’t muster. He wasn’t elected on image, but on policies. He alone stood in front of members and offered an anti neoliberalism option. All the other contenders avoided commitment to answers or offered more of the status quo. If any one of them had mirrored his policies they would have been elected more than likely. If he wins, it will give him the chance to overhaul rules on selection of labour candidates for constituencies, allowing them to be deselected, which is not permitted at present. Either that, or they will have to resign on mass. Furthermore, the current leadership contender Angela Eagle, voted in favour of the Iraq war and bombing Syria recently. The Blairites couldn’t find a single candidate who didn’t vote in favour of the war.

I think now that a week has past - and I've been able to get back to a more normal life, and away from the news and Facebook, I too am now finding my peace of mind return, and with that clarity.<br><br>Firstly though I'm sorry that you voicing a different opinion on Clinton has potentially led to the loss of an old friend, that's very sad. I'm hoping that your old friend will regain his/her maturity. Though from the Brexit I'm now fully aware of how divided and bitter people - including families and old friendships - can become as a result of politics. That's been a stark realisation which has and will take some time to process. This is the biggest political event of my life so far and I have much to reflect upon - in order to learn before the next Big One.<br><br>I wouldn't disagree with a single point above in your post. 100% agreement from me. My take on all this can be summed up as, round one to UKIP. As you say the Remain campaign was beyond dire and entirely reminiscent of the Scotland ref. - surely that should've taught them that fear, fear, fear alongside promising more of the same, doesn't work anymore? You've highlighted on this blog however more than a few times the senility of our ruling elites. And as someone highlights above - Scotland voting to leave, doesn't make them any more internationalist than the rest of the country - it just spells the end of the UK the coming future. <br><br>Have you seen the news today that Boris is not going to run and Michael Gove is? I think that Boris is keeping himself for later down the line, and perhaps has realised that whoever does exercise article 50, may well realise that it's a 'poisoned chalice' as it's being called. <br><br>My opinion is that UKIP are the real winners here and I expect them to be making a serious case for government in 5 years time. I think in the election this year, if there is one, they will gain a serious amount of votes, largely from Labour, but not enough yet to make much impact. What happens if they could get a referendum on Proportional Representation - that would lead to the perfect situation for them to take office in 5 years time. I expect to see a PM Farage in the future. Labour, with their coup against Corbyn seem destined to go back to being New Labour, and that will be the end of them. They'll never win like that again. Corbyn is sufficiently anti-establishment and anti-EU that he could still work out, if they gave him some proper media training and a better campaign manager. <br><br>What Brexit has shown to me is that there is a lot of finger pointing going on by all aspects of society, the privileged and the non-priveleged. But then when a civilisation is slowly collapsing, I guess it's to be expected, as no-one wants to point their finger at the real 'enemy.' My only concern about Brexit is that I think it will speed up the hollowing out of our economy and infrastructure, now that the Tories will have even more allowance to push their neo-lib/neo-con agenda. For all its ills, the EU did protect against some of the measures that the British gov want to take. I'm expecting more fracking, more nuclear power plants, more GM, the end of the NHS, higher unemployment etc. Now for those working class who are already suffering, then they'll justifiably say it was all going to happen anyway. Though those leavers who now think that everything is going to get better I can't see that as being likely. It even looks like immigration won't change much...<br><br><a href=#c5153158995132506919 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 6:14 AM</a><br><br>

If Mexicans voted Republican would the Obama Administration open the floodgates? Nope. It is all about political power at the expense of the people. Similarly with Republican elitists: they support H1B immigration due to business profits. The result is a quid pro quo real politik. Ordinary people, on the other hand, are losing middle class jobs, having been exported or being impacted by too much supply of labor, suffering and dying from imported diseases, and being taxed to pay for immigrant welfare services. It just happens that Mexicans provide the bulk of illegal immigrants. Democrats have violated the rule of law, as even the USSC has noted, letting illegals camp out in sanctuary cities and commit crimes. How many times have we read of an illegal, tenth time caught, who was let go and murdered or raped someone? Legal immigrants that fail to assimilate? Again, for politics, not the good of the USA. One the other hand, it is arrogant, isn't it, that progressives do not see that we are burning the last economic fumes, thinking we can have it all, and that there is plenty of resources to deal with the 'plight' of immigrants. <br><br>Proud to see that the Brits actually voted Brexit. Horrified to hear of EU elite wanting to create an Army, belittle the thinking of ordinary people, and seek to install a tecnocracy.

For the first time I wasn't looking forward to reading The Archdruid Report today, because I knew it would make me feel uncomfortable. That's why I read it anyway. I've read your work for many years and following that have read Toynbee (lots) and Spengler (a little).I agree with the thrust of their ideas and your ideas of a long, ragged descent, but it feels very strange when history sharpens to a focus and you realise that /you/ are a member of the dominant minority, and it is /your/ values that are being rejected by the internal proletariat. I find myself watching with awe and thinking 'so this is how it actually feels.' I guess this is a feeling I'm going to get used too. <br><br>As other commentators have mentioned, what happens next is chilling. Either Brexit never happens or is watered down to the point of irrelevance, which will lead to a ferocious outpouring of anger, or the economic consequences will be significant leading to hardship across society, with a following outpouring of anger. The stage is set for a genuine demagogue, either Farage or someone else. Brexit was a blank screen upon which people could project their fear, their rage, their hopes. It is almost impossible to meet those demands. <br><br>Our political class has fallen to bits. Senility and denial rule the airwaves. It is not a pleasant feeling.<br><br>Finally Toynbee said this: "the true hall-mark of the proletarian is neither poverty nor humble birth, but a consciousness - and the resentment that this consciousness inspires - of being disinherited from his ancestral place in society." We are all proletarians now.<br><br><a href=#c206633814508346703 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 6:25 AM</a><br><br>

If undocumented immigrants were suddenly unable to find jobs here, and unable to collect government benefits, they would have little choice but to "self deport". Whether or not their US Citizen children remain in the US would be a family decision; the risk of "breaking up families" was one which was cast when they crossed the border illegally. (Does no one lament the "breaking up of families" when a man just trying to meet supply with demand goes to jail for selling a little weed? Broken families are an occupational hazard for all illegal enterprises, as well as military service.) <br><br>Without an easily exploited undocumented work force, employers would not be forced to choose between providing illegal employment and corporate survival. Their goods, whether lettuce, landscaping, or bricklaying, would rise in cost, either assuming a larger share of the economy, or declining in consumption. We can adjust. At some point, young US citizens may learn the virtue of uncomfortable labor. (In the 1970s, I stooped (literally) to pick cucumbers as a teenager, and I was proud of my sweat.) And, not seeing that as a good long-term career, I mastered electrical engineering. (Even then, it seemed like a strategy to make the Dark Ages just a little less dark for myself and my friends. As JMG said up the comments a bit, I've been expecting this crisis for all of my adult life.)<br><br>Putin promised/threatened to restore Russia to "the Dictatorship of the Law". http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2012/02/28-putin-law-partlett<br><br>I'm not saying that I'd vote for Putin, or even that he's lived up to his promises of 4 years ago, but as campaign slogans go, I like THAT one! <br><br>As we've seen over the last week, "uncertainty" is bad for business.

This cycle actually moved me to formally join the party, my first time doing such a thing. In one exchange I had recently, the other party pointed out that with the current dynamics of our two-party system, it is never a good time to make the leap to a third-party alternative, to which I responded that in that case we might as do it now, as there isn't a worse time either. I will be interested to see if the Libertarians and Greens poll significantly higher than their historical numbers as the season progresses. Perhaps even take an electoral vote or two (possibly in one of the states which allocate by district).<br><br>And that Trump for President sign is still along the roadside on my drive into work. I believe the polls have Clinton leading in WI, but I am not so sure that her hold is all that solid outside of the deep blue of Dane County (i.e. Madison) and perhaps Milwaukee. We shall see. I must admit that I fear the foreign policy implications of a Clinton presidency and the very possible <i>TLG</i>-like results.

You can replace it with Oogyboogymanism. <br><br>Because, what do you call it when: the planet continues to be denuded of its natural resources; global population continues to rise along with sea level; global temperatures spikes;<br><br>And, on the domestic front: police continue to terrorize mainly poor people and people of color; the populace grows increasingly dissatisfied; the government spies on those people; unemployment numbers skyrocket; and all the while neither of the primary political parties presidential candidates see any of this as their problem. <br><br>Instead, they are concerned with a) immigrants from our neighboring country b) terrorists from their cousin religion six thousand miles away c) trade agreements that benefit or harm big business d) laws that protect the smattering few American workers who remain (I am so far from convinced that Trump gives a crap about American workers). <br><br>It seems to me we are at the tipping point of global catastrophe and of world war. Trump and Clinton are two sides of the same coin. I called that coin fascism, but is there any need to define it? It just is! I claim the candidacies are meaningless because neither has any intention of dealing with the problems laid out in your blog, or those I mention above. They are too busy fomenting war...trying to win at all costs.. I cannot imagine seeing either candidate any other way. <br><br>The idea that Trump supporters are ignoring the pundits seems off, too. I imagine on Fox News, it's beat HRC at all costs, while on CNN, it's that evil Trump and maybe HRC IS a bit slimy. He gets a lot of airtime. He's bashed in the newspapers nonstop. So, while I hear what you're saying about Trumpees ignoring what the consensus tells them to do, they are also paying heed and playing along. <br><br>They have chosen to vote for the boogy man because, well, I'm still not quite convinced its for any other reason than they are frustrated with the status quo and really xenophobic.

But I do believe he will massively increase our national deficit while steeply reducing taxes on the affluent- after all, he has stated that he "loves debt: (!!)and will somehow find a way to borrow more money while "hair-cutting" our extant government debt. <br><br>The only reason to support this man at all, is because the alternative is so loathsome, and is a proven supporter of the policies that have destroyed the population of this country. I really don't believe he will be the least bit disruptive, but will fall right into line behind his Wall Street paymasters, to whom he is already signalling fealty. <br><br>Whoever prevails, this country probably too far along the road it set out on in the early 70s, when we ended the gold standard so we could more easily tell ourselves lies about our money and our true financial condition by inflation and debt creation.

They are literally terrified and in contempt of real democracy, hence all the immediate calls to throw the Referendum result under the bus along with the large population they've already chucked there. <br><br>I have these discussions on Facebook with well meaning people who are so brainwashed by the tactics of the Media and PR industry, that they mistake a sustained and organised smear campaign for an accurate portrayal of Corbyn and what he has done in the past year or so and what he represents. It's quite frightening to see this machine in action, yet Corbyn continues to evoke spontaneous rallies of 1000s of people in support of his leadership, while the Parliamentary Party, most of whom voted in favour of large scale cuts and austerity, insist he must go. <br><br>Unlike Trump, whom I would never vote for, and unlike even Sanders, who had no intention of reigning in US Global Militarism, Corbyn has an unimpeachable 30 year track record of principled fighting for the interests of ordinary citizens in the UK.

I had an idea about what I think is a missing part of the explanation for the emotiveness of the racism charge. It comes from the myth of progress. The past is seen as the dark place where people were limited in where they lived, who they met, what ideas they encountered - where everything was mono cultural, mono religious and so people were xenophobic and closed minded.<br><br>So, for example, those voting leave were often accused of nostalgia – of wanting to go back to a rose-tinted past that was less open to the world. So the ‘racists’ are seen as sinning against Progress, not just some rational system of ethics.<br><br>And xenophobia is seen as the instinctive condition of humanity and instincts are highly suspect because they belong to our caveman past (they just ignore xenophilia for this purpose) and our sort of biological selves. <br><br>Those shouting racism indiscriminately also often reject the idea of resource limits. So they’ll say that Britain can support any number of people if only technology was used better, or if only the economic and political system were different. So for them the idea of limiting freedom of movement is part of a bigger rejection of the value of limits. History is seen as moving in the direction of ever fewer limits and more freedom.<br> <br>And, part of it might be to do with identity. In The Past people are seen as having narrow parochial senses of identity. All of history is conflated into a kind of Dark Age/Middle Ages feudalism. So the direction of history is seen as being towards an ever expanding sense of identity. <br><br>New Age ideas of identifying with all of humanity, or all of life on earth, above all other identities, often come in here. This kind of constant expansion and removal of barriers/ boundaries to one’s identity is understood to be Love. It’s kind of a mix up of what might be spiritual realities with material and social realities. An imposition of heaven onto earth. So anyone who limits their sense of identity, even only in certain contexts, is seen as representing Hate. <br><br>I often see the idea that difference must not become division. Ostensibly this is for the rational reason that division weakens the working class. But the emotions of it tell me it goes deeper than that. It’s like a theological monotheistic thing – God as One, reality seen as a Unity, is heaven, and God as multiplicity, division, limit, is hell, is a prison. Like Carcer. Although it’s odd that the allegedly unified past is seen as hell. I’m not sure I’ve quite worked this out! <br><br>On the bright side, some respected people within the relatively small Left Leave campaign in the UK are coming out to say basically that the wage class were right all this time, we were wrong, they’re owed an apology. Some are even producing nice statistical evidence and graphs to prove it. They’re still largely saying that the solution is to create a strong trade union movement rather than put limits on immigration but it’s a good sign. <br><br>I’m considering stepping right out of political involvement. I’ve been denounced and placed in the Farage camp. Given that people are openly speculating about whether killing Farage would be like going back in time to kill baby Hitler, I really think it’s headed for violence at some scale out there. At the least, there are those who would take it upon themselves to make sure I lost my job. I’d blame it on my inability to be Gandhi-like in changing the political narrative, and that’s certainly something I haven’t got yet, but I’m watching far more politically skilled people being lined up for the firing squad so it may be only partly that. Getting out of the way of what’s coming might be the only sensible thing to do right now. Sorry for the long post! <br><br>Mallow.<br><br><a href=#c1115895410106181044 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 7:07 AM</a><br><br>

At this juncture, the only people who can invest in stocks are the elites due to currency arbitrage and HFT - they have everyone's pensions and will use them. This is likely to be the straw that breaks the camels back for the upper middle classes, specifically the Boomers.<br><br>The thing is, collapse is baked into the cake at this point - stocks, bonds, hedge funds etc along with massive government debt have pretty well been in the cake pan and risen quite high at this point. Looking at the energy industry, we are seeing the crushing of the infrastructure in oil, coal and mining in general due to the masses being unable to buy anything other than necessities - when mortgages begin to be walked away from due to no work the ranks of 'nothing to lose' will balloon.<br><br>The truth is, that the .01% live in enclaves already, insulated from us commoners. These enclaves abound in the Beltway and around London, and California and Seattle and many other places. They aren't in Wales or in Scotland or in Nebraska or Oklahoma - there are areas around these .01% enclaves where the .5% supporters live as well, along with large numbers of the 99% who are on the dole. It is a volatile mix.<br><br>Even rural has it's obvious issues. My taxes went from $80/yr to $400/yr since I built a permanent dwelling on the property. If I had purchased two RV's then they could not tax me for them, other than registration for the vehicles. Thus government has mandated (intentionally of not) what will happen at the farm. You can see this in the burgeoning RV park industry here in Texas, where they fill-up as fast as you build them due to the excessively high property taxes in this state. Why pay mortgage of $100/mn and taxes of $600-800/mn when you can rent a space in a VERY NICE RV park for $350/mn and no taxes? <br><br>There are now over 15 of these RV parks on the route to my farm, and there were 3 of them 5 years ago...<br><br>My QUESTION IS: How can one ferret out the psychopaths and sociopaths (the 'empathy-free' that comprise the political class) in order for things to function without eventually breaking down in this same fashion? Disputes will still happen, even little wars - but how do you reign in the aberrations who seem to always lead us into foolishness?<br><br>Balkanization would seem to be preferable and doable for most large nations (China excepted, as they are on a different historical path). Democracy that is small enough to hold governance accountable (minimizing bureaucrats and maximizing self-reliance) may be able to function.

As far as I am concerned this is the most insightful analysis I have read on Brexit and current trends.<br><br>So true. The article and referenced austerity measures reminded me of a past workplace. I was a pilot/manager for a speciality air service. My boss (owner) felt we should be getting more 'happy efforts' from the pilots. We were all paid salary which remained the same year round, despite drop off in revenues during the winter. We had benefits, profit sharing, and a method for pension investments. It provided stability for all, we had no turnover in staff, and the customers appreciated seeing the same faces. We were very succesful and profitable. Profitable!! Anyway, one day he gave everyone a letter stating how he was contemplating base pay and mileage for our pay structure, (piece work). It was a return to the past, big time. Now, I always liked incentive pay because it rewarded the go-getters, which I was proudly one. However, it also promoted pushing weather, risky decision making, and more work for fewer people. Crashes. I remember wincing when I read the letter, knowing full well what would happen.<br><br>Only one pilot went to the owner and complained personally...spoke his objections. (He was a long-time friend) He was pissed. Several contacted me with a request to intercede on their behalf, (which I did). But instead of lighting a fire of motivation to keep mileage pay just on paper, it had the opposite effect. The 'little things' stopped being done. When the weather turned tough pilots just turned around to base. If they were asked to divert and pick up additional passengers at another location, suddenly the weather was dodgy, or the water was too rough to land, etc. In short, it simply had the opposite effect in all ways. What was most pervasive was the silence. In the past there would be open discussion and constructive ideas shared about daily operations and future plans. There was engagement. When trust was broken everyone retreated to their own agenda. When before we had almost no staff turnover, over the next few years all pilots except one left and moved on. The company is now a hollow shell of its former past, (20 years later). The owner is the only pilot left, with one part-timer. His family works in the office and the hangar. One bookkeeper remains from a once vibrant office staff. When the exodus started we had 30+ staff. Now, there are just 3 working, with one being part-time. They no longer receive applications or resumes from pilots. (We used to get hundreds per year). A few years after I left damage was done to an aircraft through hard landings. The owner decided the best way to find out what happened was administering a 'lie detector test' to find the culprit. (Honest to God). It got worse from then on. (Yes, pilots actually took the test, but they quit soon after). They never did find out 'who' damaged the aircraft, because there wasn't one person to find. It was simply the result of using the wrong machine for the job, which the owner would not admit. As he was never wrong, staff no longer bothered trying to contribute insights about daily operations. They just went through the motions, and eventually gave up.<br><br>The main result has been that after moving on everyone has done better over the long term. Everyone. Occasionally we get together over coffee or drinks and share some laughs about the owner. I'm sure it is similar in the political arena with political insiders. Afterall, google 'Sarah Palin Jokes' and you are informed there are 450,000 results.<br><br><a href=#c8516378042595136297 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 7:47 AM</a><br><br>

Only the smallest percentage of my Progressive friends have any respect for Clinton and no trust at all. Of course a label like 'Progressive" is not simple or black &amp; white. Everybody has their list of priorities and level of devotion to them. Many will vote for Clinton out of fear of Trump. Some are desperately trying to convince themselves that she is not that bad. the level of shrillness from that corner grows louder everyday. Just for example, she negotiated the TPP, but now she says she doesn't know what says(?!), ergo "Look! It's ok!She's come out against it! Trump moved her left!" The rest know a calculating,lying, criminal when they see one. Even if she had a sincere epiphany, few people would believe her. This election will come down to individual balances between fear and hope (cutting both directions.) I fear that if Trump can act halfway sane, or yet another brush fire starts that Clinton can't ignore, we get Trump. If Trump grossly insults enough people we get Clinton. Hard to say if Trump would really be the worst candidate, though. He's an idiot and a buffoon. People say "Clinton can get things done," maybe Trump's saving grace is that he wont be able to. I'm voting Green. If I can't save the nation I can at least preserve my own sense of integrity.<br><br><a href=#c8803895453900783630 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 8:00 AM</a><br><br>

Same day that we woke up with Brexit win news, I watched in TV a bad TV film. The stroyline was: A low-middle class man in his 40s needs easy money and starts working for a gang. when he realizes that he is putting at risk his family and own life, he tries to resign his job, but...As one of his pals says: "You can't simply renounce to this job. They use you until you are worn out"<br><br>Another cliché in film noir is the stereotypical "advice" (=threat) from gangster boss to bad minions or extorted victims: "If you keep on misbeheaving...your children/wife/store would be in trouble?<br>I don't believe so much in synchronicity, buy maye there is a joking goblin within TV programming.<br>EUrocrats has been beheaving in Brexit matter as have been doing it previously: bullying, scaring and contempting their rivals.<br>Oh, what a pity! This time gangster strategies have not worked. I a am in SCHADENFREUDE mood...I like that german word, and I like more even to use it when I think in Mrs. Merkel and german banksters gang. <br>From my position as citizen of a "brusselissed" country as one of the members of PIGS, I envy that damn Brits. I dislike Farage's anglo-British chauvinism (I symphatize quite more with Scottish patriots...) but UKIP jingoism is the lesser of two evils.<br>No one represesntative party in my country has proposed a referendum as happened in UK. It's sacrilege even to the "communist" Podemos party (they are too busy proposing subsidies for everybody and PC hysteria these leftists for worrying about low and middle class economic decay, thanks to Brussels imperative welfare cuttings).).<br>Yesterday I heard on radio that our sleepy prime minister or "president" had adviced british brexiters that they must be shoulder to shoulder within EU, following Spain's example. "through good times and bad times".<br>Yeah! Nice shot, Mr. Rajoy!<br>What a joke! Our neocon version of politics are a tireless source of deadpan jokes.<br>UK and Spain dismantled their big factories a long time ago, but british have a good portion of financial banking cake. Oh, UK also is a bigger militar power than pathetic spanish Army, a nuclear power by itself. If drunkards and hooligans are scared by Brexit or by "advices"(threats) to UK sovreignty...they should easily find another beach cleaner and cheaper that spanish ones.<br>Oh, oh, I'm afraid that after second elections in 6 months, there won't be a new and strong government in the short term, so we are seeing Marmot Day repetition.

They then cut to clips of Trump's recent economic speech, and you know what? As much as I hate to admit it because I detest the man, he's the only politician I've heard talking about the economy in years who made any sense.<br><br>Regarding the poster above who asked about proof jobs have been lost and wages have declined, even without the impact of outsourcing, many businesses in Alabama where I'm from have hired illegal labor at just above slave wages for years instead of employees. These businesses range from cleaning services to restaurants to agricultural processors and farmers. One occasionally gets busted and gets slapped on the wrist and goes right back to it. Many companies that hire U.S. workers now only take on "independent contractors" so they don't have to pay benefits or taxes and pay lower salaries to boot.<br><br><a href=#c1558191363816479618 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 8:03 AM</a><br><br>

Before the referendum happened, I could express my frustrations with multinational governments like the EU, and my hopes that Greece, Britain, or someone would make the first move and step away, and that viewpoint would be met with either agreement or indifference. Now, I’m afraid that if I say how I REALLY feel to anyone but a few close friends, It’ll be like I got caught goose-stepping down main street. (And yet, those same people who are talking about how terrible it is that this happened… are still talking about the problems of neoliberalism, etcetera… despite condemning one of the first concrete attempts at dismantling it…). It’s been absolutely perplexing to watch, and it’s also made it very difficult to know how to talk to people who I’ve agreed with on most political issues for decades. You’ve pointed out the possibilities of a complete repolarization in global politics, and it looks like it’s happening... and this time I’m finally learning what it feels like to be firmly on the “wrong” side of a political hot-button issue within a community of people I usually agree with… and zipping my mouth shut at the cries of “selfish gits,” “I hope they burn,” and so on… The cognitive dissonance really confuses me, I’m guessing that it’s entirely because the proposal came from the conservative parties, and so it turned into a left/right issue… or something. I really hope I can make it through this crazy year without finally losing close, long-standing friendships (as seems to have happened with you recently) but it’s definitely required mastering the art of biting my tongue…<br><br>One other aspect of the conversation worth brief comment: I’ve been noticing the initial stirrings of the backlash against the environmental movement that you hinted at here. If that becomes mainstream, it would be huge… Despite all the problems with environmentalism as it currently exists, it has had a history of producing some things that have made our predicament slightly less bad than it could be… While CO2 is still wreaking havoc on our atmosphere, emissions regulations have at least made air breathable and taken us away from the days when pollution was so rampant that it gave us the peppered moth story that graces science textbooks to this day, and innovations such as the public lands system of national parks and forests have made small steps towards keeping at least some landmass safe from exploitation and development (and of course even that led to a militia occupation that ended in a shootout earlier last year). None of that is enough to keep civilization toppling consequences from coming about, but a public opinion backlash that not only barred further work towards sustainability (as happened in the 1980s) but rolled back on the modest regulations and protections that survived the ‘80s at a crucial time like the one we’re living in now seems like it would be a huge development… one that would make an already bleak situation even worse. How long could something like that last, and how much more damage could it do than what’s already being done? Would it be one last hurrah for the ethos of industrialism? Or would it be something more complete and long lasting, of the sort that would prevent the emergence of a more sustainable society to emerge in some future time, and force a reassessment of our species’ chances?

Her main qualification was overseeing, as Treasurer, the shift of millions of dollars in state pension funds from retirees (in the form of COLAs) to Wall Street (in the form of Hedge Fund fees). The State is run by politicians who have a (D) after their name, but have progressed further down the road to "necrosuophiliac cravings" than most. The entire state Democratic Party apparatus lined up solidly for Ms. Clinton, but Sanders won 54-46. More tellingly, the late Robert Healey got 22% of the vote for Governor in 2014. He'd been a longtime gadfly, and previously nearly won the Lt. Governorship on a platform of eliminating the office. In his race for Governor, he spent a grand total of $37. Meanwhile, our legislature just passed a budget with per capita spending of $8,900. Next door Massachusetts, which has better public services and better schools, spends $5,400 per capita. <br>I'm trying to figure a path to collapse to Lakeland, where I grew up.

While I would never ask you (or anyone else) to tell me how (or if) to vote, I am curious about your claim that "on most economic, political, and military issues, Hillary Clinton is well to the right of Donald Trump." Can you be a little more specific? I am not challenging your accuracy, just hoping to be further educated by another point of view. I realize Clinton is no FDR, and that the Democratic party is mostly a twisted parody of what it once was (or tried to be), but Trump has expressed some pretty far-right foreign policy ideas, seems to have some genuine objections to the First Amendment as it is currently written and enforced, and seems to truly dislike people who are not white males (I would argue that someone willing to pretend to hold these values is, to some extent, indistinguishable fro the real deal).

I have a theory about why there is a temporary spike in people who think they identify with the elites inside the palace: the "education" system. I've noticed that in the Brexit vote, a huge number of young voters decided to remain, probably because they are in some way connected to the education system, and therefore consider themselves part of the "educated" elite above the ignorant masses, not knowing that their very participation in the education system is an act of exploitation by the elites toward them (or at least that's what it is in the USA.) I underwent this shift myself to a certain extent. The young who are still in school fancy themselves part of the educated elites on the path to "good jobs", until they get out and find themselves competing for the lowest wage jobs but somehow still accountable to pay back six figures of debt; it is only then that those with enough sense to see what is gong on realize that they were never part of the liberal elite but were really just taken for a ride by them and their entire education experience was one huge financial transaction, the cost of which could have gotten them a house or something else more useful. I think that this shift in consciousness has started for a few of us but will take a lot longer, since the first reaction for people emerging on the other end of this is still to blame the evil Republicans. Give it ten, twenty years though, and I think the vast majority of today's young trendies and social justice warriors will transform into the very same angry, populist, anti-education blue collar workers they despise so much today, once they realize that the entire basis for their identification with the elites was one big scam.<br><br><a href=#c2205930242650184409 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 9:30 AM</a><br><br>

What's more, the elderly people feel that they are completely useless for the society despite having years of hard earned experience and wisdom. The retort to any advice is usually like, "My life, my choice, so you don't interfere." or, "I am educated, so I don't need any advice.".<br><br>Of course there is the typical teenage rebellion, but this one seems to continue well past the late 20s.

The politicians we've got at the moment might not worry too much about *their* opinions, but they will still listen to the pet economists who tell them that cutting immigration is a bad thing, and I'd be surprised to see the Tories or Labour make more than friendly noises towards it while they still, clearly, fail to recognise the threat that UKIP poses - regardless of whatever deal is made with the EU, since a good chunk of migrants to the UK comes from outside it. I'm also taking into account things like the Syrian refugee crisis; such situations are liable to become more common and it's very difficult to keep people out if they're desperate and determined enough.<br><br>For immigration to drop sharply would take at the least a very determined government, in opposition to the entirety of the media, about half the population and almost the entirety of the current elite which, senile it may be, isn't quite doddery enough to give up power yet. The EU referendum was only a very narrow win for Brexit which may yet be reversed or, more likely, reversed in all but name if we join the EEA, and I don't think the disillusioned half of the population - lacking any advantage *but* numbers - is in a position to enact any kind of popular revolution; the details of the UK voting system would make it very difficult for UKIP to sweep the board even with a relative landslide, given the remaining entrenchment of Labour in some areas and - more so - the Tories in others. The Tories might actually have more luck cutting immigration sharply if they really tried, but in any case I think it's unlikely. A slow drop over the next couple of decades? Perhaps. A dramatic cut within the next five years? Not so much.<br><br>I'd be very surprised to see a true authoritarian regime come to power in the near future. It's not that we aren't in a bad enough state - we're not in the right *kind* of bad state (though I may be speaking from my own privileged position of life in Scotland).

I'm afraid that I'm about to lose a longtime friend for a similar reason, namely, that he's a yuppie social climber and I'm too poor for his narrow, precious tastes. Last weekend I had to skip a bachelor party that he was hosting for a friend of ours on the gentrified Baltimore waterfront, in part because I wasn't sure I could afford the travel expenses on top of the bills I have coming due. He didn't seem to take it too well, and I don't know how many clashes over my relative poverty and his flashy affluence we can sustain. I'm actually extremely fortunate compared to many of the homeless and unemployed (I'm often one or both), so if I can't keep up with these people to their satisfaction, I hate to think of how hopeless, say, the generationally poor are before them. <br><br>This fellow inadvertently offered a neat vignette of his own sheltered, clueless privilege over the weekend when he posted a series of photos on Facebook under the hashtag #yachtlife. He probably assumes that he's safely surrounded by other affluent people, or maybe that the objections of the poors don't count. He knows full well that my own circumstances have deteriorated quite badly since graduation, so there's definitely some arrogance at play. If he talked to the people I've met on farm crews in the Willamette Valley (in towns roughly as poor as Cumberland), he'd be floored by how poor and backwards they are. Cottage Grove and McMinnville are not towns where a prep can expect to get his way by strutting around like he owns the place. Their citizens would admire him for having rented a yacht. It's different around Philadelphia, and that's one of the things about Philly that I miss least. <br><br>The yuppie project needs to be brought to an end and its vectors bodily driven into the forested shadows, as they were during the Great Depression. In other words, it's time to make American tactful again.<br><br><a href=#c2029291845606654776 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 11:23 AM</a><br><br>

Though I'm not one of the elite - indeed I've been busy collapsing early to avoid the rush, partly on your good advice, mainly though out of necessity - I have long believed that European unity was the best guard against the teetering balance of power between nation states which led to the European catastrophe of 1914-89, two world wars, genocide and the division of the continent between rival outside powers, one totalitarian. <br><br>Now I see that the neoliberal, debt-deflationary policies of the EU are actually stoking conflict, but I had hoped that the coming crisis might just possibly lead to reform and that Britain might be part of that process. Perhaps Brexit will now shock the senile Euro-elites to their senses - but I rather doubt it. <br><br>With regard to immigration control and racism, it seems to me that the left equates the two because border control privileges 'old-stock' citizens over newcomers. Clearly this is true, but it ignores the extent to which moral concepts such as anti-racism and human rights have purchase only insofar as there is an effective state committed to enforcing some kind of justice, however imperfect. No use protesting that my human rights are being abused if I live in Syria or Somalia. Yet for a state to be effective it must control its borders, or else it risks being overrun by invaders or repudiated by its own people(s) - which seems to be happening now to the European superstate. <br><br>Personally I like multicultural city life, I married an African migrant, my daughter is mixed-race. I volunteer at a night shelter for destitute refugees and migrants. But I do this because I see hospitality to the stranger and the destitute as a moral obligation, a Christian work of mercy, not because I believe that the state can realistically abolish borders.<br><br>Thank you for your perceptive American comment on UK/European affairs.

Now we can stop paying the Queen of England subsidies because of her farms " ( for those that ,like the person I was talking to, don't get what I'm saying, the Queen of England is the biggest landowner of the European Union and thus , it receives the biggest individual share of the European Agricultural Policy subsidies. A fact I keep in the pocket for the inevitable times some German comes to acuse the southern peoples of Europe of being lazy and of being leeching the other Europeans ... ;) ), so you can see I do not have much of love for the EU. But, regardless of my leanings and of agreeing with your reading of the events, I wanted to focus on the reactions of the oficial pundits ( and not only ) around UK and Europe, that have been frankly pathetic and something between a child's tantrum and a "burn the heretic" cry ... ( I have even heard someone saying that this was 1649 and Cromwell all over again and that we would have a Charles II in some years in the future . I assume British readers will understand quite well what is the threat here )<br><br>While I can't talk exactly about how stuff is in the UK, that got in the EEC in 1973, I am old enough to have witnessed my own country entry in the then EEC in 1986 and I have seen with my own eyes the not so subtle changes that were introduced in the education of toddlers. First of all , it was stated in no uncertain terms that history before the EEC was to be taught in very broad ( and IMHO completely wrong ) brushes to general students and second, and most importantly, the story of the EEC/EC/EU was to be taught in terms that can only be called a theogony:<br><br>In the beggining, the peoples of Europe lived in primitive political arragements called nations and warred incessantly against each other. Then after a particularly destructive war, there were some iluminated souls that decided that the only way of stopping this was to make a border free commercial union. That union, because it was all good and nice, atracted more members and then the obvious next step would be ( or ended up being, depending of this being before or after 1992 ) a political union to end all wars.

EU is Progress , Progress is God and denying the EU evergrowth is denying God, and we know what in this corner of the world they like to do to people that deny the oficial religion ...<br><br>And that probably explains the reactions of most people around the EU talking heads: most of them are young enough to have been indoctrinated fully in this idea of the growth of EU being something akin to the laws of nature and they are genuinely shocked to see something that for them is akin to see water flowing up and can only see the people that are against it as residues of the brutish old peoples of Europe that lived in primitive nations and warred incessantly against each other ( hence the ubiquous "racist", "nazi" and "fascist" insults being thrown around: because only a pre WW II jerk could want not not be in the EU ) and that alone is probably enough to explain the rather inflamed tones that, say, Juncker has been adressing the British since Sunday ( or the rather infatile proposal to remove English as a official language of the EU, like if English was not a official language of other EU member... )<br><br>Note, I'm not telling that there are not some cold calculating heads behind all of this ( I , for myself, fully expect that the UK elite will try to stall things for some years and call other referendum when enough old people dies to turn the result around ), but I think this is a good example of what the well born people do when their Progress idol gets slapped in the face by the unwashed.

A third of this population (855,000) have Swiss citizenship. Four fifths of persons with a migration background are themselves immigrants (first generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens), whereas one fifth were born in Switzerland (second generation foreigners, Swiss citizens since birth and naturalised Swiss citizens).

[Source; http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/07/blank/key/04.html]<br><br>It is precisely because of such facts, that the SVP (Swiss People's Party) has increased its appeal amongst the rural and working class - which is another example of global Trumpism. In comparison to Trump, the father of this party (Blocher) is also a billionaire industrialist who also owns a major media outlet. <br><br>Even HuffPo (sorry no other good english sources) did a piece comparing Blocher to Trump - http://www.huffingtonpost.com/global-risk-insights/switzerland-trump-christoph-blocher-_b_9517190.html<br><br>Both Blocher and the SVP have long complained that the political class does not heed the will of the people and that said will (via referenda) should be the first and last arbiter of legislation.

Obviously these two are intertwined, but it seems likely that in addition to the wounds that the working class has suffered under neoliberalism they have also subconsciously absorbed a stunted doomer worldview. Even though they are spoon-fed 24-7 that the sparkly future is coming and will make them all as rich and glamorous as the Kardashians or Lebron James they are beginning to realize that it is a downhill road and they are being rolled down the hill first. This is why the two very different groups that are against both "Remain" and Hillary are the downtrodden working class and the intellectual doomer/revolutionary crowd. Both groups believe that the civilization they know is on a downhill slide and big change is good, or kicking the elites down the hill first to create a softer landing is also good. This is what is striking about people that I know without exception, those who believe the status quo can continue are aghast at Trump or Bernie or Brexit and those who think the world is going to heck in a hand-basket are glad for anything that upsets the dominant paradigm.<br><br><a href=#c4484488043329810612 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 2:33 PM</a><br><br>

There is just so much to say here. I hope you don't mind me doing so. I'll post it in two parts.<br><br>You make some good points (as ever) about the dangers of a divided society, but it is always difficult trying to understand another culture from the outside. This is one of the main reasons I like reading your blog: it helps me understand the US beyond the mainstream headlines we see. As a UK resident, I do feel you've used too many broad brush strokes in this latest article. There are some important nuances missed and also some outright omissions in your narrative which are essential to understanding the situation.<br><br>First off, I would urge you to read this: https://flipchartfairytales.wordpress.com/2016/06/28/looking-behind-the-brexit-anger/ <br><br>The leave vote was won not only by poorer, ex-industrial, Labour voting areas, but also by large swathes of non-metropolitan Tory voting England, some of which are pretty affluent on the whole. What unites these very different groups is a push-back against the economic AND social changes of the past 30-40 years. The pithy slogan 'take back control' held an emotional appeal to turn the clock back that the Remain camp couldn't counter effectively, however implausible it might be to implement in the manner that the Leave campaign suggested would be possible, and without perhaps breaking up the UK in the process.<br><br>Stirring this emotional soup is an overwhelmingly (sometimes viciously) right-wing press, perfectly able to promote snobbery and consumerism, while also demonising 'the other' (whoever that might be, but frequently immigrants) and hating anything at all to do with Europe. UK governments tremble at their malign power in a way that the EU simply didn't, as Rupert Murdoch succinctly pointed out in an oft repeated quote.<br><br>Immigration simply wasn't a major issue in the UK pre-2004. What changed was the expansion of the EU eastward that year to take in former Soviet bloc countries, and the decision of the New Labour government not to put in temporary restrictions on migration from these countries as most others in the EU did. The result was a massive net influx over the following years, mainly Polish, who had very limited options of where else to go. This was a terrible error of judgement on the part of the UK government. (But it's worth noting that approximately half of our net immigration is non-EU; we already have 'control' which we choose not to apply.)<br><br>This influx exacerbated what was already an old problem: lack of affordable housing. The early 80s saw council housing sold off and not replaced, because government decided the market would see to it. The market didn't, because there was more profit in not doing so. Similarly, public services struggled post 2008 when austerity politics decided it was only the financial system that could be rescued, despite us having our own currency and central bank.<br><br>But I think it is doubtful the Leave vote have won without the intervention of ex-mayor of London, Boris Johnson. He is the only UK politician referred to on first name terms by the media, and is disarmingly charismatic in a buffoonish fashion. His decision to support Leave was crucial in its appeal to voters who find other politicians a turn off. <br><br>That said, it has long been known that he covets the job of prime minister and some suspected that his conversion might not be altogether genuine. With his usual rhetorical flourish in the final TV debate he declared last Thursday would be 'independence day'. A week later, his prime ministerial ambitions lie in tatters at the hands of fellow campaigner Michael Gove, but the suspicion remains that he never really wanted to win, that he never wanted the poisoned chalice that a Leave victory has now ensured the job will be. Theresa May at least stands half a chance of sailing those choppy waters, having quietly been in the Remain camp.<br><br>(continues in next comment)<br><br><a href=#c6761147822449159950 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 3:00 PM</a><br><br>

They may yet rise again.<br><br>They were plenty on the Remain side (such as the Greens) who campaigned on a 'remain and reform' platform, recognising that serious problems within the EU need addressing. This was the Labour leader's position also, if not many of his mutinous Blair-era MPs. Certainly my vote was not on the basis of contentment with the status quo - far from it - but because I figure that trade and close cooperation in the single market are surer ways to preserve peace and stability in Europe than the alternative. The history of Europe is a very bloody one.<br><br>I get frustrated with heated and unjustified rhetoric, whichever side it comes from.

There are two significant jet streams in each hemisphere: the stronger polar jet, which meanders through temperate latitudes and is what we usually think of as the jet stream, and the weaker subtropical jet, which goes through tropical and subtropical latitudes. The subtropical jets can be pushed all the way to the equator by tropical high pressure systems. If this happened in both hemispheres simultaneously at the same longitude, both subtropical jets can temporarily link up, and this is a mechanism for air exchange between the hemispheres.<br><br>What happened is that two of the more alarmist bloggers misidentified the subtropical jets as the polar jets, and thought that the polar jets had merged, which would be truly insane. One of them is actually a grad student and should have known better, but then again I'm an atmospheric science grad student who just barely scraped through the relevant meteorology class this past semester. The reason I barely passed is that my research is on aerosols and atmospheric chemistry, and like all fields these days we're balkanized, so that aerosol people rarely know much about meteorology.

Namely, there appears to be a small negative impact on lower-skilled native workers, though usually not a non-measureable effect on the average wage. Some studies find this effect, others don't. There also appears to be upward pressure on housing prices that puts pressure on local people for quite a while after an immigration boom. However, that aspect is poorly studied if at all.<br><br>This suggests to me that <br><br>a)it is possible JMG may be overstating his case somewhat<br><br>b)confounding factors are confusing matters<br><br>c)conventional pundits are ignoring the evidence for an effect because they don't care about low-wage workers<br><br>d)most of these studies were done in decent economic times. There may be a larger effect during depressions. This is becoming less of a factor now than it was, just because anything done using data post 2008 was done in less-than ideal times.<br><br>e)rises in housing costs may be a significant way in which immigration affects less-wealthy people. This also matches my personal experience growing up in and leaving Vancouver.<br><br>My best guess is that there is a small effect on low wage workers that is hard to detect due to confounding factors such as automation and offshoring of jobs that are causing major worsening of the labor market for non-elite workers. Rising housing costs are usually ignored in these studies. If they are factored in, you might get a much more obvious impact.<br><br>Here's the best article I found:<br><br>http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/09-013_15702a45-fbc3-44d7-be52-477123ee58d0.pdf<br><br>One of the articles Matt pointed to is very relevant.<br><br>http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Documents/workingpapers/2015/swp574.pdf<br><br><br><br><a href=#c1598755217027298786 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 3:22 PM</a><br><br>

Not much surprises me any more, but if this was true ( and not just a gimmick to appease the Saudi's) than we are further down the path of elite senility than I thought. I am not sure if these people are so clueless that they don't know the Russians are parked in Syria with a small air force and several Battalions of S-400 anti-aircraft missile batteries. Do they think Putin parked what are widely regarded as the most advanced and effective anti-aircraft system in the world ( until the S-500 is deployed) , at Assads doorstep to fend off attacks from the ISS air force. Did they miss the message of the Russian Cruise missiles launched from previously unknown trawlers in the Caspian to accurately hit targets over a thousand miles away. They are either clueless or they have drunk too deeply of the American Exceptionalism Koolaid and think we can defeat them as easily as the Libyans. <br><br>I think that with this kind of thinking coming out of the State department, which is the area of government the Hillary has had the most influence on, there can be no doubt which of the candidates poses the most geopolitical danger.<br><br><a href=#c8761905696569239841 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 3:40 PM</a><br><br>

(On a side note, I think this counts as my offensive reading assignment for this month.) Apparently Spain is now a “model for Europe”, and how did they accomplish this miracle, this “dream liberalization program”? By depressing wages, mass layoffs (on top of their already massive unemployment), and “more flexible” work hours (read: more work hours). The Spanish government are trying to cope with a collapsed economy by deliberately collapsing it even further—since they can’t devalue their currency, they've devalued their labor instead. (This is all portrayed in glowing terms and contrasted with those silly whiny Greeks who can’t get their act together.)<br><br>Granted, that was written over a year ago, but if that is the “model” economy that EU member nations outside the German core are supposed to look forward to, I’d say Brexit is just the tip of the iceberg.<br><br><a href=#c7811320959625194726 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 5:16 PM</a><br><br>

Still, I can tell you exactly how voting is done in the Lakeland Republic: printed paper ballots marked by the voter in ink, hand counted twice over by volunteer poll workers, and subject to public recount in the event any question is raised. That's how we did things here when democracy more or less worked, after all. <br><br>DiSc, well, you know your country a lot better than I do. I had simply read that one of your main Euroskeptic politicians was calling for a referendum. <br><br>Scotlyn, that's hilarious, in a wry sort of way. I'll have to try to find that. <br><br>Robert, oh, granted. When you cast a vote, you never know if it's going to end up helping you or not. All I addressed in my post was what the forgotten Britons were trying to do, not what they will or won't achieve. <br><br>SunErgoSum, no argument. If you ever come over to this side of the pond, I can show you some former industrial cities that will look agonizingly familiar to you -- and you already know how our politics and yours mirror one another. <br><br>Scotlyn, hmm! The Federation is a useful metaphor, provided one challenges the core assumptions of the fiction -- and notes that the Prime Directive, like so many contemporary ideals, is purely window dressing. As for barbarism, you, me, and Conan...<br><br>Sébastien, thank you for asking! Twilight's Last Gleaming can be bought <a href=http://www.karnacbooks.com/product/twilights-last-gleaming/34386/ rel=nofollow>from the publisher here</a>, with free worldwide delivery -- and yes, they take Euros. <br><br>Yossi, it's going to take a long time and a lot of hard work before any issue in today's world can expect a fair and intelligent debate. One of those things...<br><br>Matt, of course there are more dimensions than the one I spelled out! The thing I wanted to bring up is that a very, very large issue was being dodged by many of those (not all, but many) who supported remaining in the EU.<br><br>Ursachi, the weird thing is that the identical self-defeating approach pervades modern politics. Nobody ever presents a positive vision any more. It's always a choice between a miserable business-as-usual and something even worse.

A great many people in the Remain side tried (and are still trying) to confuse the two. <br><br>MigrantWorker, thank you.

If you can put through a comment marked "not for posting" with your email address, I'll be able to contact you if your story is selected. <br><br>Patricia, I'm pretty sure the US would respond by threatening nuclear war. From there, everything depends on moment-by-moment decisions on the part of the heads of state and their militaries. In my novel <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i>, nuclear war was avoided after three terrifying days on the brink, but the consequences of US defeat (in this case, by China in a proxy war in East Africa) led to severe civil unrest, economic and social collapse, a runaway constitutional convention and the dissolution of the US. That's not the only outcome, though I think it was a plausible one in the terms sketched out in the novel. <br><br>Tony, oh, granted -- again, the issue I was trying to raise was why so many people voted for Brexit, not whether they would get what they expected. <br><br>John, and that's the big question. If Germany does try to maintain the Eurozone by force, it's going to find out why counterinsurgency warfare sucks, and the long term consequences will almost certainly be very, very grim. On the other hand, by many accounts the German military is barely able to function these days, so any such attempt might end with a humiliating defeat. (There's a near-future thriller for you: Germany responds to Italeave by sending in the troops, only to have the Bundeswehr defeated on the plains of northern Italy by a hastily assembled popular army using light trucks for transport and shoulder-mounted antitank and antiaircraft weapons supplied by, ahem, I'm sure I couldn't say which un-Germanophile major power...) <br><br>Jason, I look forward to the first of a long series of annual conferences of the Association of Civilizational Dysfunction Analysts (ACDA), perhaps in some pleasant Cornish tourist spot! <br><br>Hereward, thank you! That earns tonight's gold star with tumtum leaves, as well as a good laugh. <br><br>Bill, the polls I've read show that Trump does very poorly among African-American voters and better than Clinton among other minorities. See <a href="" rel=nofollow>the poll cited earlier</a> for an example -- if you scroll down about two thirds of the way, you'll find these words: "Clinton continues to hold a wide lead among blacks. Trump leads among whites <i>and other minority voters</i>." (Emphasis added.) That's far from the first poll I've seen that has made that observation, by the way. <br><br>Averagejoe, I'm impressed by Corbyn. One of the best ways to assess a person, in my experience, is to find out who his or her enemies are, and the Blairite "New Labour" MPs are people I'd be honored to have as enemies -- so I'm definitely on Corbyn's side, at least as a distant well-wisher. If he wins the party election -- and I gather his support among Labour party members remains undiminished -- I hope he can clean house at Westminster and get a backbench that supports the same things that Labour's constituents support, rather than pursuing the consensus of the affluent. <br><br>Alex, no argument there. I'm thinking of one of the many funny articles about the referendum in the <a href=http://www.dailymash.co.uk rel=nofollow>Daily Mash</a>, demanding that Brexit voters sit down and contemplate the fact that <a href=http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/politics/politics-headlines/you-have-made-this-man-happy-20160624109755 rel=nofollow>they made Nigel Farage very, very happy</a>.<br><br><a href=#c1921249921393584651 title="comment permalink">6/30/16, 11:40 PM</a><br><br>

I see it tolerably often also -- I write like an academic but look like an aging hippie in clothes from secondhand stores, so it's always entertaining to watch certain people do a doubletake and completely redefine me the first time they actually meet me. <br><br>Andrew, excellent! That moment of self-knowledge, when you find yourself in the middle of the narrative -- and not necessarily in the place you'd have chosen to find yourself -- is a crucial one. <br><br>Lathechuck, exactly. The rule of law is crucial for any sort of stable society, and it's especially important today, when everybody thinks they ought to be able to ignore it when that suits their purposes. <br><br>David, good for you. I hope it works out well. <br><br>Alex, exactly. It's useful to remember that all this is just a temporary flurry of incidents in the course of the Long Descent. <br><br>Jason, why do you want to lump all those things together into a single word? Split them out, find the fissures and fractures between them, and there's a good chance that you can direct your efforts toward one or another and, through hard work, make things actively better. The world's many problems have no single solution, and of course some things aren't problems at all but predicaments, and thus have no solutions at all -- but there are always better and worse adaptations. Choose something and get to work on it; that's the only antidote to despair. <br><br>North Coast, I certainly don't consider Trump a good person or a trustworthy one, and I think I've made amply clear that he was never my first choice. All I'm saying is that he's probably going to win, because his opponent has tied herself to the sinking ship of business as usual, and that this might be a good thing, because his opponent is arguably a good deal worse than he is. <br><br>Martin, I'll have to read much more about British politics before I venture any kind of detailed discussion of the bar fight going on in the Labour Party just now. As I mentioned in an earlier comment, I respect Corbyn a great deal, and one reason is that the MPs who are trying to unseat him are people I'd be proud to have as enemies. Anyone who's hated so much by such people must have many good qualities!<br><br>LatheChuck, I'm frankly not enough of a meteorologist to be sure of what I'm seeing. <br><br>.Mallow, that may well be a large part of it, and that suggests in turn some of the ways it might be undercut. By all means lie low; more roundabout methods of shaping the dialogue may be needed for a while. <br><br>Robert, Ivan, and Nancy, many thanks for the links! <br><br>234567, I don't think it's all that useful to assume that some identifiable set of people (e.g., "sociopaths") are to blame. Human beings will never achieve a system of government that is better than they are, and quite frankly, there's a sociopath in all of us. (One of the reasons I don't find that kind of labeling useful is that it can assist people in distracting themselves from their own dubious actions.) We are what we are, and that being the case, the best we can do is take something that seems to work and try to adapt it in ways that will make it work a little better -- we hope. <br><br>Friction Shift, no doubt they'll try. That's one of the reasons I consider Nigel Farage a likely prime minister in the future, because if the elites refuse to do what the voters tell them to do, the voters will do whatever it takes to make that happen.<br><br><a href=#c2765846323676241296 title="comment permalink">7/1/16, 12:20 AM</a><br><br>

Back almost 20 years ago, I got to have intensive training exercises with BW units in Germany at large scale. I was a private at this time, serving one year as a volunteer in the french armed forces in Germany. I remember having noticed some kind of real laid-back attitude from german officers and rank and file as well. Besides, their stuff was superior to ours by and large. It's not that they lacked discipline but they weren't committed to operations. I've then been discussing the issue with some junior officers from my batallion and they said to me the Bundeswehr has no capability, moral or technical whatsoever to launch any overseas operations. For historical reasons, they somehow lack the motivation for it. Moreover, it seems that without the sheer U.S. manpower in Germany, the german armed forces could barely withstand any conventional warfare invasion. I quit the army long ago but I kept some contact. The situation seems to have worsened beyond the Rhine regarding military capacity. My mind is that the German military is plagued by the same defects that plague the US's only on a smaller scale. Note that the situation of french military is not better, though.<br><br><a href=#c2039593028704567887 title="comment permalink">7/1/16, 2:34 AM</a><br><br>

I'm in one of those funny positions in life where I got to take part in the Brexit vote and can also vote in the US election. I voted leave. And I can add to the chorus of people who are not about to tell people about it. The only people I can tell are my partner and my Mom, both of whom are not British, but also not European. I'm frightened of telling anyone, quite honestly as I know I will lose friendships over this. I had lunch earlier this week with several friends who work in the City and I just let them assume I voted for Remain. The hatred of the upper classes/professional finance class to those who voted Exit is amazing. Absolutely it has been like the mask has been ripped off and I get to see the Lizard underneath (yes - I watched too much 1980s TV). <br><br>I've noted to some of my more lefty friends that supporting a non-democratic government just because they do what you like (at the moment) is a surefire recipe for long-term disaster. We have to be able to make the arguments and run the politics for good working conditions and environmental protections in our own country. They don't want to have to fight. But these things are natural rights - these are rights fought for and won. And all the better to have people in the country agreeing that this is how they want to live. JMG, as you noted, the UK had done it before. Lordy, lord. Generalisation alert: The left is filled with bloodless weenies who would rather depend on faceless non-elected technocrats because they get what they want without having to work hard for it. But what happens when those technocrats decide to run things a different way? The PIIGS can tell you...<br><br><a href=#c7036993012191098889 title="comment permalink">7/1/16, 2:36 AM</a><br><br>

A new political party emerges that, miraculously, promotes the politics that you personally favour. Let's call the party 'MyFlavour' Party. Miraculously, 'MyFlavour' Party proves moderately popular. It gains some MPs and also MEPs. Other European countries also have the 'MyFlavour' Party which gains popularity europe-wide, but not so much that it could take over from the established parties. But they also send quite a few MEPs to Brussels and europe-wide alliances are forged. Then there is the economic crisis of 2008. 'MyFlavour' Party makes all the right noises and starts winning some general elections all over Europe, also in your country. 'MyFlavour' Party holds a substantial amount of power within the institution of the EU.<br>Would you complain about the EU, being a power-grapping entity, entrenched in an harmful ideology?<br><br>Jason Heppenstall<br><br>You have specialist knowledge on the EU monetary policy. You should, if you have not already, write to the First Minister of Scotland and voice your concerns. She might well need in the coming months. You should consider that as you patriotic duty. And, I am not facetious.<br><br>For all those UK voters who used the EU- referendum as a protest vote for the lack of localism:<br><br> Alan Banks, multimillionaire sponsor of UKIP stated that he is setting up a new party to replace UKIP. Nigel Farage is not welcome. (Guardian 29 June 2016, OMG I am tremling so much typing – guardian - that I nearly spilled my instant bought from Morrisons). <br><br>My bet is that Farage will be blamed for the nastier parts of the leave campaign. Anyhow, the purpose of this new party is to unite the Leave movement and take over as official opposition to the ruling Conservative Party. When I last had a cursory look at the UKIP Wales manifesto, giving more power to local structures, such as town councils, was promised. So, here is an immense opportunity to join a brand new, ambitious political party and shape their manifesto to your liking.<br><br><a href=#c1693192917784710168 title="comment permalink">7/1/16, 4:33 AM</a><br><br>

The wording of that quote you cite is unclear; they might be saying ((Trump leads among whites)+(Trump leads among other minorities)) or (Trump leads among (whites+other minorities)). Considering latinos are generally a small portion of the sample in these polls, and hence have a very large sampling error if you try to look at them in isolation, I suspect it is the latter. <br><br>As for Rasmussen showing Trump up +4, three other polls released on the same day show him down by -4, -4, and -10. In 2012 Rasmussen statistically turned out to be biassed about +5 in the Republican direction compared to actual voting results. There's a lot of variation in how pollsters reach their respondents and what "likely voter" model they use, and they each tend to have a particular systemic bias. And the "likely voter" model for 2016 might have especially big problems, considering the large number of people frustrated that either Sanders is NOT their party's nominee or that Trump IS their nominee. It is really unclear whether Trump has drawn in more or fewer general election voters than he has alienated.

I lived for 60 years in the far west and mountain states, and I am not aware that Nate Silver has ever even been there. Polling analysis is only as good as the underlying data. I know I simply don't answer the phone if I don't know the identity of the caller, and I wonder how many others make themselves inaccessible. My feeling or instinct or sense of things, as the TeeVee heads like to say, is that western states which voted for Sanders in the primary won't vote for Hillary in the general. The Hillary coalition is essentially limousine liberals, the salaried nomenklatura, and some but not all minorities, not enough to carry states in the west all by itself. Please note that conservatives are not staying home this year. Also note that Native Americans, a significant presence in states like OR and WA, were for Bernie. I think that former Gov. Johnson has an opportunity here if he has the sense to play to his natural base and not be distracted by invitations to the Foreign Relations Council and the like. Given the high levels of dislike for both of the presumed nominees, and we have hardly yet seen the revelations which will undoubtedly be rolled out by each side about their opponents, a third party victory in one or more states is, I believe, a distinct possibility which could throw this election into the House. <br><br>I also note that the former governor supports a non-interventionist foreign policy, including in the ME, which ought to appeal to a war weary American public. I suspect that much might depend on the competence and willingness to not go for the bland of the third parties this year.<br><br><a href=#c4290967264895301431 title="comment permalink">7/1/16, 7:34 AM</a><br><br>

Poles: without free movement, they would be stuck in Poland begging for some international corporate investor to come and pay them even worse wages. Capital can already cross the border freely, if workers get the same right, that is emancipatory, not oppressing.<br><br>Why this split in policies? This can easily be explained by looking at the composition of the European Parliament over the years (the EP has limited power, but it does mirror the composition of the national Parliaments and governments quite closely, so it's useful data and easier to consult). Ever since it exists, the conservative/centrist alliance has been the largest fraction, with the social democratic fraction as runner up, and together they usually have a majority. So that's how Europe votes and which parties and policies they support. And that is reflected in the policies the EU has implemented over the years: about 2/3 neoliberal with 1/3 social democrat elements. A political institution is a tool, and this tool has been used for the goals of those in power.<br><br>Therefore, without the EU, European policies wouldn't be any less neoliberal. In fact, they probably would be more neoliberal since smaller entities have to compete more harshly for the favours of capital. The EU already has slapped corporate giants like Google and Microsoft with fines. Do you think that's an option for, say, Slovakia or Portugal?<br><br>So the most productive strategy to change the status quo is to obtain power in the EU and use it as a tool, for goals that can't be realized as isolated country.<br><br>Lastly, the association of xenophobia with the leave camp shouldn't be so casually brushed off as a rhetorical device used by the remain camp. The leave camp's elite enthusiastically employed anti-immigrant sentiment in their platform. While I agree that there are large disenfranchised population groups who are understandably protesting against the status quo, that does not mean that we should let an elite blame foreigners (be it immigrants or EU) for everything, because that will not improve the situation, only make it worse (and conveniently direct attention away from the elite in power). Already racist violence has peaked after the referendum: regardless of whether their frustration is justified or not, too many people are taking it as permission to get violent already. I cannot in good conscience overlook that.<br><br>-Mox<br><br><a href=#c2672098455639900074 title="comment permalink">7/1/16, 9:43 AM</a><br><br>

I think the underlying motivation behind the descent is the belief that through doing so the ego can preserve itself through sustaining the delusion of control. The delusion shatters at the moment when it becomes too painfully impossible to ignore that That Which Must Be Controlled has a life and consciousness of its own and will not merely react mechanically to the manipulations levelled at in a way that supports the agenda of the manipulator (examples range all the way from Gaia herself to voters who voted in their own interest rather than acting in accordance with the narratives they were being fed), and that as I said earlier the standard ego repair procedure is to degenerate into further delusions of one's own innate superiority, which is what all that screaming about racist idiot xenophobic nazi f***tards is supposed to accomplish.<br><br>It doesn't work, of course, and given that it is the realization that the Other has a life and consciousness of its own that shatters the delusion, I'd say that goes a long way to explain why the history of thought in what is arguably the most dysfynctional, abstract and control-obsessed civilization in recorded history can be neatly summarized as the "war against consciousness".<br><br>As you said, culturally here we are.

The majority I know who voted out are well educated intelligent people, many of whom spent time teasing out truth from lies, from both sides of the debate and made their decision.<br><br>Yes a minority of racists and bigots jumped on the leave bandwagon, but that is no where near the whole story despite what the MSM would like to portray.<br><br>I have a few interesting points to make, many leavers were less bothered about numbers of immigrants and more about the fact there is no control of who can emigrate based on skill sets and criminal records from within the EU. But many were worried that so many countries within the EU are in effect "bankrupt" and the whole thing looks set to implode in the near future.<br>There was also much concern about the waste of money within the EU system for example 300 mil a year to move back and forth between strasburg and brussels as no one can agree to keep it in one place.<br><br>Many older people I have spoken to felt they were betrayed in the 70's and they voted for a basic trade agreement NOTHING ELSE and the rest had been inflicted on them by lying politicians. There was a genuine feeling of "putting things right" for their kids and grandkids, which is ironic given the media portrayal of youngsters feeling betrayed by the older generation.<br><br>The mainstream parties in the UK had long used the EU as "the big bad" to blame stuff on, like not being able to cut tax on power bills or remove tax on womens sanitary products (mens razers being tax free oddly, how is shaving more essential than them?

It's not as if there was some grand conspiracy to cover up the fact that Walmart was basically forcing its' suppliers to offshore jobs to countries with cheaper labor and lax environmental regulations. I remember reading about this trend in the early nineties in the tiny local paper of the Appalachian town I grew up in.<br><br>Then there is NAFTA. A friend of mine runs what passes for a large cattle operation in the region of Appalachia that I previously mentioned. He has repeatedly told me that it was all but impossible to find a farmer any where in the country that was opposed to NAFTA when it was being considered. According to him, they were all convinced they were going to get rich selling agricultural goods to Mexico. He also says that it wasn't hard to find information that suggested the most likely result of burying all the small farmers in Mexico with cheap corn from the US was a massive immigration push to the north. <br><br>Finally, I don't understand how exactly Trump is any meaningful way different from any other politician of the last forty plus years. As far as I can tell, he selling the same fairy dust--unending prosperity and growth--that practically every major party politician in the world has been peddling for the last century. Again going back to the area where I grew up in Appalachia, Trump has been telling anyone who will listen that if elected he will personally revive the Central Appalachian coal industry. How exactly he plans to do this is apparently a mystery, as he never gives any particulars. Yet, his promises are dead on arrival unless he has some magical powers that allow him to alter the geology of the region (the best coal seams were mined years ago and what's left can't be mined profitably).<br><br><a href=#c6754533817526174361 title="comment permalink">7/1/16, 12:32 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, there is this groundswell of revolt from 'the working class' who are finding their communities utterly transformed by the influx of immigrants, both from the poor countries of Eastern Europe, but also from the earlier influx into this over-crowded little island from the former colonies.<br><br>However, the main force for Brexit at the top is from extreme neo-liberal right-wingers; both politicians and the ultra-rich free-marketeers who are financing UKIP. There have been lots of false promises that leaving the EU will 'free up' £350m per week, which, instead of going to Brussels, they would use to support our National Health Service. As soon as the vote was over they admitted that the £350 was a lie and in fact many of those pressing for Brexit want to privatise the NHS. Of course the interesting outcome is going to occur when 'the masses' realise that their neo-liberal 'partners' have cheated them and that their lives are going to be made even harder.<br><br>Yes, the EU has become a neo-liberal organisation, but that influence has very largely come from post-Thatcher London. Continental Europe has traditionally been much more socially cohesive and community minded with relatively high taxation. It is the influence of Thatcher/Reaganism which has changed it, so it is a bit unfair for Britons to blame that on the EU.<br><br><a href=#c2609471646764040633 title="comment permalink">7/1/16, 1:15 PM</a><br><br>

He is explicitly on record for being an enemy of democracy (even before the Greek show started). It is long overdue that he is let go. Before he became chief enforcer of the exterior, he held the post for the interior, and was instrumental in coining the term "Stasi 2.0".

At the same time it came with concentration of power in higher echelons, which were naturally targeted by all sort of competing elites - leading to a huge mess, and gridlock when addressing issues such as Greek vs German competitiveness, or Germany's unflinching devotion to export at all costs (helped along as much by internal elites as by Anglo "free market" influence - much to the chagrin of France).<br><br>The German armed forces are another interesting story, for which I can recommend https://defense-and-freedom.blogspot.fr (small wars journal author, ex-airforce, economic background), or the translated buzz around "Armee im Aufbruch: Zur Gedankenwelt junger Offiziere in den Kampftruppen der Bundeswehr" (the title is in marked contrast to much of the discussion).

This is possibly the most succinct statement possible of the condescending attitude towards Leave voters.<br><br>Second, before Poland entered the EU, a considerable part of the German population was worried about "swarms" of cheap Polish labourers. Germany and several other EU members negotiated a gradual opening of the labour market to the new EU members, and by the time the transition period was over and the labour market was completely free, Poland was doing so well that in fact some Germans now prefer working in Poland. Labour preferred to immediately and completely open the UK labour market to the new members.<br><br>Now to the question I have. The UK has been in deep economic trouble since 2008, with unskilled labour taking the hardest hits, as far as I know. Nevertheless, large numbers of refugees camp at Calais, constantly trying to cross the Channel by all means possible. Also, as far as I know, Eastern European migrants still prefer working in the UK to working in Germany or other relatively well-off EU members. The minimum hourly wage in the UK (as far as I could find out), is GBP 7,50 and therefore (at least until Brexit) considerably higher than in Germany. I seem to be missing some piece of the puzzle. How does the economic pain and high unemployment in the UK combine with a labour market that is so attractive to immigrants?

For everyone considering not voting this year, I recommend finding the independent, third party, or write-in candidate you think best represents what you actually want in a president, and vote for that. Then you are using democracy to express your right to choose, rather than opting out of democracy altogether.

China is still perceived as an enemy, and hence there is anti-Chinese sentiment as well. There is more to it.

As I noted in the post, the people on top of the pyramid can only expect loyalty to those below them if they extend loyalty <i>to</i> those below them. That's been forgotten by the affluent in recent decades, and the results are not going to be pretty. <br><br>Dandy, I'm inclined to agree. <br><br>Bill, a valid point. <br><br>Spanish Fly, the thought of a rewrite of de Sade as "120 Days of EU" is charming in the extreme! Thank you. <br><br>Rebecca, the contrast between establishment talking heads indulging in namecalling and Trump talking about substantive issues is one we're likely to see over and over again. I wonder if the talking heads will ever figure out that they're quite literally recruiting new Trump voters every time they do that. <br><br>Eric, that's why I think the class issue is the elephant in the room. Everybody's willing to talk about the problems of globalization, sure, but not when it's a matter of what globalization is doing to those ruddy <i>peasants</i> in England's or America's rust belt. The issue with environmental protection is similar -- have you noticed that every significant policy being pushed by the mainstream greens imposes costs on the working classes and funnels benefits to the affluent? I'll be doing a post on this down the road a bit. <br><br>Matt, thanks for the correction. I seem to have been misinformed. <br><br>Peter VE, making a living is always the challenge in moving to the Rust Belt. If you can figure out how to parlay your architectural skills into a career that doesn't depend on locality, that's probably your best bet. I hope it works out!<br><br>Bob, sure. Try <a href=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/trumps-foreign-policy-america-first-hillarys-america-last-16800 rel=nofollow>this essay</a> from the moderate-right magazine <i>The National Interest</i>, which compares the foreign and military policy stances of the two presumptive candidates. It's rather aggressively pro-Trump -- <i>The National Interest</i> has no time for neocons like Clinton -- but the points it makes are by and large valid. <br><br>Donald, artists and writers who go for the large markets live or die by the voice of the conventional wisdom, which as already noted, favors the influence of the affluent. For such people, to go against the consensus is to commit professional suicide -- they could kiss off publishing contracts with big London book firms, recording or distribution with the big names, etc. One of the reasons I publish with small and medium presses is that I prefer the independence that gives me; another reason, of course, is that by and large the big boys won't touch the ideas I discuss with a ten-foot pole.<br><br><a href=#c6733390492813615063 title="comment permalink">7/1/16, 9:30 PM</a><br><br>

It's a lethal blindness to the hard-earned lessons of the past, and will be paid for in blood.<br><br>Onething, nah, not the values that the affluent actually hold -- what the poor and working classes reject are the values the affluent claim to hold, such as racial tolerance and environmentalism, because those values are consistently used as excuses to dump more costs onto the lower rungs of the social ladder and send more benefits to the higher rungs.<br><br>Ramaraj, I don't expect to see it end well at all. China and India both need to expand their domestic markets for their manufactures, and yet both countries are bringing in automation, which causes jobs to be lost and thus contracts the domestic markets. Until something shakes the grip of the myth of progress on the minds of the people in charge, that sort of babbling idiocy is inevitable.<br><br>Lewis, I won't argue.<br><br>Brian, good to hear. One of the few things that could head off a real mess just now is if a significant fraction of the affluent extracted their heads from a certain biologically unlikely orifice and noticed that the rest of the population has just about lost patience with being treated like dirt by their soi-disant betters.<br><br>Troy, can you get me a link for Tyson's rant? I'm rubbing my hands together with glee, contemplating a post...<br><br>Golocyte, if somebody occupies the middle ground (other than fascists), there isn't an unoccupied middle ground for them to exploit, now is there? Of course it's always possible for ordinary politicians to move into that space; it's when they don't that the folks with armbands and jackboots get power.<br><br>Lucretia, I did indeed. It's been heartening to see a few voices of reason!<br><br>Chloe, well, we'll see. It's actually quite easy to keep even desperate and determined people from engaging in mass migration: you require proof of legal residency in order to get a job or receive any social benefits, any employer that hires illegal migrants gets slapped with crippling fines, and migrants who are caught are promptly deported. Since there are many different places migrants can go, those countries that enforce such policies will be largely left alone.<br><br>Andrew, I used to get that kind of guff quite often before I got a couple of books in print -- once you're a published writer, even if you don't make a lot of money, a lot of status-conscious people back down.

Schoolyard taunts, temper tantrums, and the kneejerk vilification of anybody who disagrees with even the smallest detail of their version of the conventional wisdom do not impress anyone who hasn't drunk their koolaid.

Of course the situation is more complex than I can fit into a single essay, even a longish one, but what I've heard from other readers in Britain leads me to think that the point made in the essay is more or less correct. <br><br>Grebulocities, many thanks. I'll know better than to pay attention to certain bloggers in the future. <br><br>Clay, exactly. That dissenting letter from the State Department is basically advocating a shooting war between the US and Russia.

Drop me a comment marked not for posting with your current email address, and we can proceed!<br><br>Gaianne, got it -- you're in. <br><br>Mark, er, FDR was an incredibly divisive figure in his time; a very large number of Americans hated his guts. Being divisive was crucial then and it's crucial now, because the people who currently hold power are adept at calling on people to "unite" on terms that favor the status quo. Refusing to unite with them, and giving the rest of the population a voice of their own, was essential to FDR's achievement. Will Trump do that?

Two (approximate) quotes: "I used to think economics was really boring; now it reads like science fiction. Anything can happen!" and "Dystopian stories about the future are really just expressing the anxieties of the present, so, yeah, I think we're in big trouble." If you Google "The Mandibles", you'll see that it's getting a lot of attention, both in the US and the UK. The US defaults on its government debt, and consequences ensue.<br><br>I think the title (which is just the surname of the featured family) is a hoot! For anyone unfamiliar with anatomy, your "mandible" is your lower jawbone. It's what you use for talking, and for eating, and I suppose both of these activities are important to the book. Maybe the author could have named them "The Craniums", but then they would have had to behave differently, using a different part of their anatomy instead.<br><br>(Almost entirely off-topic: I put up a head of red cabbage as two quarts of sauerkraut a couple of weeks ago, and have learned to love the results. It's nutritious food preservation with neither the processing energy of canning nor the preserving energy of refrigeration. Might be important some day.)<br><br><br><a href=#c6789441295066515905 title="comment permalink">7/2/16, 4:01 AM</a><br><br>

It is possible that Trump will tap into the anti-globalist, working class vote in MI, OH, PA, WI and flip them. But for the Chicago Machine, he would have a shot at IL. HRC will win Cook County and East St Louis. She will most likely lose all other counties in IL. Downstate she will take a shellacing. Mitsubishi just closed in Bloomington.

I think that this really drives left of center people apoplectic, the idea that going through a holocaust, Khmer Rouge, gulag, famine, world war, Depression, dictatorship, disappearances, etc. is a necessary experience of "coming of age", as evidenced by the results in the West, the US in particular, of having all the generations after WW II living in relative peace &amp; prosperity. The results are not encouraging.

It's kind of sad to see the left floundering as it is, unable to connect with the working and lower middle classes. Of course both you and I know what exactly the reasons ARE for their floundering!<br><br>On Brexit - like you, I do believe it's more than just a fear of immigration (one that was ginned up by the scandalous Murdoch press; after the Murdoch emails scandals, why is that scoundrel still in business in that country???) and I'm not sure fear has anything to do with it. More like compassion fatigue for the immigrants; the feeling is, "Look, we can't take care of our own, why should we continue to let a limitless, unrestricted swarm in? THe ones we got are hardly doing us any good, statistics to the contrary." And it's true all over Europe.<br><br>And who will I vote for POTUS in the general election? Certainly not Hillary and definitely not Trump. She may yet be undone by her emails: USAG Loretta Lynch has decided to affirm however the FBI decides to pursue this, or not. And Donald? I don't trust him as far as I can throw him. I just have this ugly feeling that after being elected he's going to weltch on <b>all</b> his promises to the working and lower middle classes and align his decisions with the Washington Consensus policies. <br><br>PS On last week's assignment, I have a few to pick from.

I concur with grebulocities comment above. The "unprecedented" cross equatorial flow isn't. Google cross equatorial flow and you'll find papers with illustrious names such as Hoskins, Wheeler, Yang, kiladis... etc on precedents going back decades (That is, the papers go back decades. The precedents no doubt go back millions of years) Warning: The papers tend to be pretty dense, and most seem to have some sort of sleep-inducing enchantment on them. IMHO, sensationalist blogs like the one referenced are feeding right into the hands of the deniers, as their inaccuracies are revealed and more level-headed types are ignored. I do have to admit I agree with the bloggers in part, though. Personally, I think climate change is a severe enough predicament that all this stuff about Brexit and the u.s. election is fleas arguing over control of their patch of a feverish, convulsing dog. And yes, the jets streams (particularly in the north) are showing behavior outside what has passed for normal in recent history.

Look at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7IqQqZuYkE" rel=nofollow>recent speech in New Hampshire</a>, where he brings up many of the same topics you have. When it comes to substance, Trump completely blows Hillary out of the water, in no small part because Hillary has nothing to offer ordinary Americans but four to eight more years of the same ruinous policies that have devastated the American economy and destroyed the lives of huge numbers of people in America and around the world. If you listen to his recent speeches, it’s pretty obvious that Trump is not the ignorant no-nothing that his enemies in the Dempublican and Republicrat parties like to claim he is, but a very smart and well informed leader.<br><br>He discusses the destruction of the wage class and how the policies of the last few decades have taken power out of the hands of workers and put it in the hands of giant corporations and wealthy special interest groups. He points out the devastating effect that the last Clinton administrations policies has had on the wage class, thanks to NAFTA, the WTO and other neoliberal economic policies and institutions implemented by Slick Willie and his cronies and continued unabated during all four terms of the Dubyobama administration. He even notes how the average incomes of American workers has been going down, thanks to neoliberal economic policies.<br><br>He also emphasizes that he not against foreign trade or in favor of isolationism, but that trade deals need to protect the interests of the American people and America’s economy and industrial base, not further pad the bank accounts of the transnational elites.<br><br>Oh, and here is a retired Secret Service agent who was one of Bill Clinton’s former bodyguards <a href=http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/07/01/exclusive-soft-intimidation-secret-service-agent-says-bill-clintons-loretta-lynch-summit-fits-pattern-silencing-threats/ rel=nofollow>discussing what he thinks was really going on</a> during that private meeting between Slick Willie and Loretta Lynch. Suffice to say I would not be in the least bit surprised if his assessment turns out to be right on the money, especially given the long and sordid history of the Clintons.

Voter registration rules vary from state to state. Some states make it very convenient to vote. Some make it difficult. California is in the middle. If you stay put, registering and voting is pretty convenient but if you move a lot, it's not.<br><br>Here are the basic requirements as I understand them. I hope this isn't Too Long; Didn't Read, but I want to be comprehensive. Anybody not in CA can skip this.<br><br>1. In order to vote, you have to be registered. In some states, you can register to vote on election day. Not in California. You have to be already registered something like a month (from memory; I didn't look it up) in advance.<br><br>2. When you register, besides your name and address, the application will ask you whether you want to be registered with a particular political party, and whether you want to be a permanent absentee voter. See below 5 and 6 for the consequences of filling out the form one way or the other. You can get the form at the DMV, and probably at some local government office, and sometimes there are people out on the street registering voters.<br><br>3. If you move to a new address, you are supposed to register again at your new address. If you do not, the registrar will send your election information to your old address. You might also have problems casting your ballot.<br><br>4. If you don't vote in the general election every four years, or maybe it's if you miss two general elections in a row, you may get purged from the rolls and have to register again.<br><br>5. If you asked to be a permanent absentee voter, you will get a blank ballot in the mail for all elections you are eligible to vote in. To vote absentee, you fill out the ballot at home and either mail it in, or drop it off at a polling place on election day. If you only want to vote absentee once in awhile, (like if you know you will be out of town on election day) you can request an absentee ballot just for that election, but you have make the request in advance so they have time to mail it to you. There's no downside to being permanent absentee so I am registered that way even though the polling place is one block from where I live.<br><br>6. If you stated a party preference when you registered, you will automatically receive primary ballots with that party's candidates on them as well as the nonpartisan offices and propositions. If you don't state a party preference, you will be registered as No Party Preference and your primary ballot will not list any party's candidates. That is the general rule--only voters who stated a party preference when they registered get to vote in that party's primary--but there is an exception. <br><br>Each party sets its own rules about who gets to vote in their primaries. Most of the California parties only allow their own registered members to vote in primaries. The Democrats allowed NPPs to vote in the recent primary, but the law says that if you weren't a registered Democrat, you had to ask in advance for the Democratic ballot. If you were registered NPP and just showed up on election day wanting to vote in a primary you were SOL. My county's registrar of voters mailed out a letter to me and all the NPP voters about two months before the primary. It included a form to fill out and mail in if I wanted the Democratic ballot. I read the letter, filled out the request (less than five minutes), mailed it, and the registrar mailed me the Democratic primary ballot. You may have gotten a letter like that and thought it was junk mail, or maybe your county registrar isn't as efficient as mine.<br><br>7. IIRC, the race question on the form has a Decline to State choice on it. It's not the census; they have no legal authority to make you answer.<br><br><a href=#c5112052309098654954 title="comment permalink">7/2/16, 9:42 PM</a><br><br>

When the conventional wisdom insists that anyone who objects to unrestricted immigration is a racist, and a lot of people have good reason to object to unrestricted immigration, yes, some of them are going to adopt racist ideas -- or will simply direct some of their ire at the immigrants as well as the politicians who let them in. <br><br>Sébastien, I get the impression that once the US collapses, as it will, Europe will be ripe for the plucking.

That's a pragmatic objection, by the way: the only thing having my policies adopted by the EU would do is to guarantee that when the EU collapses, as it will, my policies will be dismissed for many decades to come. <br><br>Nigwil, many thanks for the link! What a classic bit of privileged sniveling...<br><br>Bedroom-Magick, I've always tended to think that the Scots enthusiasm for the EU is driven by the hope of using the EU as a counterweight to England, as -- for good and sufficient historical reasons -- no self-respecting Scot trusts the English as far as they could throw Balmoral Castle. <br><br>Bill, it's certainly a strange time. The point I wanted to make by way of the poll, though, is that Trump is well within striking range of Clinton at this point, and his support isn't as lily-white as the media likes to claim. (I'd expect to see a lot of support coming his way from Asian-Americans and from Hispanic Americans who immigrated legally, or whose families have been here for several generations -- both of these groups tend to conservatism.) But again, we'll see what actually happens. <br><br>Phil H., I wonder if the RAF will be honest when they discover what an overpriced piece of junk they've just purchased. <br><br>Ben, funny! Yep -- and it was an even better bit of gallows humor that the victim was watching a Harry Potter movie when his car accelerated straight under a semi trailer and decapitated him.

I wonder how much a certain corporation had to fork over this time...<br><br>Unknown Mox, nonetheless, there's a significant difference between a government you can vote out of office and a supranational bureaucracy that is subject to no checks and no balances. The backlash against neoliberalism has much more access to the levers of power in a nation that has control of its own destiny than in a nation that's subject to edicts from Brussels against which there is no appeal.<br><br>Submarine, yes, I've been watching that. Really, whatever happens at this point is red meat for the Trump campaign; if there's an indictment, that's going to be a massive problem for Clinton, and if not, Trump's people can insist that there's a coverup. <br><br>Christophe, you're welcome and thank you. If someone is willing to come here and express an opinion in a courteous manner, I figure it's worth a few minutes of my time to respond accordingly. <br><br>Bob, I've heard of it -- I hope it wakes some people up. <br><br>Alison, thank you for the report from the trenches! I hope that you and the other people who were feeling cheerful that morning will put the lesson to good use, and make yourselves heard over and over again in the corridors of political power. <br><br>Robert, so? The thing that makes Trump a magnet for the disaffected is that he's nearly the only person in politics who's thrown aside the neoliberal consensus that's ground so many wage earning Americans into the ground. You don't have to like him, or believe that his supporters are innocent victims, to recognize that his campaign marks a sea change in American politics. <br><br>Superpeasant, not so fast. The EU has been mandating the neoliberal policies most responsible for the destitution of the British working class -- free movement of people and capital -- and, as already noted, most benefits of EU membership go to the affluent while most of the costs land hardest on working people and the poor. That makes rejecting the EU a reasonable move for the masses who voted for it. Some rich Tories supported it, others opposed it, and the majority of the affluent were (and remain) staunch supporters of the EU; the bulk of the votes that pushed Brexit past the finish line came precisely from those working class people whose interests have been treated as irrelevant by a three-party consensus in Westminster. As for climate change denial, I'll be talking in an upcoming post on how and why the environmental movement destroyed itself by becoming a shill for the interests of the affluent. More on this as we proceed...<br><br>Kevin, Musk has figured out that the best way to make money in today's America is to figure out every possible way to batten on government subsidies while selling stockholders and the public on an assortment of glossy fantasies borrowed from old science fiction magazines. It's a shrewd move, and I expect people to start piling messianic fantasies on Musk as things go more and more obviously pear-shaped.<br><br>Latefall, many thanks for the data points!<br><br>Varun, since the British have had more experience with wealth pumps than anybody else, it doesn't surprise me at all that they would be first to object when the business end of the wealth pump gets turned on them!<br><br><a href=#c3396183929511564903 title="comment permalink">7/2/16, 11:16 PM</a><br><br>

Some fanciful, some real.<br>I took the warnings of dire financial consequences and shrugged them off - yes we might be worse off as a whole but I have begun to have an unhealthy dislike for bankers, multinationals (even though I'm employed by one) and assume that even the experts are in their employ. Project Fear was so continuous that I almost became insensitive to it. <br>I'd just finished reading Rob O'Grady's "150 Strong" and of course all your Retrotopia posts and concluded that letting government creep further away from those that it governs is a bad thing. Perhaps we can turn it round. We at least stand a chance whilst we can still change the government. Maybe I'm still being naive.<br><br>Part of me wants the EU collapse entirely. Even though I'm not ready for it to. I was disappointed the Greeks capitulated last year. Perhaps Brexit will be the start of the collapse. Looking at it I half expect the vote to be ignored and we will Remain despite the outcome.<br><br>Anyhow I guess the point of this comment is to thank you for your insights, to acknowledge that you and others like you have influenced my thinking (such as it is) and to say how much I'm enjoying Retrotopia and look forward each Wednesday to the next instalment.

Having voted Leave, and having probably 80% of my friends and acquaintances (at least, the ones I know from university or from an affluent background) voting Remain and insisting on talking about it in the manner you described above, this blog provided an important mental counterbalance for me to the incessant talk of how terrible everything would be that took place for about the first week after the vote.<br><br>The most egregious example I saw was an acquaintance posting on Facebook that anyone who voted leave should unfriend him and then hang themselves. I did neither, since I believe that maintaining friendship with those who disagree with you is perfectly viable, though I admit that next time I see him, I shall be more wary of him than the previous times...<br><br>I posted a post of my own addressed generally to Remainers to the effect that I understood where they were coming from but would they mind treating the point of view of the Leavers with a bit more respect, phrased in the most gracious way I could think of (and my Sun sign is Libra), and I still got someone telling me they were p-ed off at me and that I was incredibly misguided for sharing the pro-Leave articles I'd been sharing before the referendum...<br><br>In any case, the thing for the UK to do now is to look to the future. I find that life after the referendum has not in fact been a catastrophe and has been rather approximately the same as life before the referendum, and I continue to believe that exiting the EU now on peaceful terms is the best choice for the UK's future. Hopefully the politicians will keep to the result of the referendum once the new Tory leader is selected- if they don't, I wouldn't expect the next attempt of the working class to make themselves heard to be quite so peaceful...<br><br>Thanks once again,<br>L.<br><br><a href=#c3321986476932947189 title="comment permalink">7/3/16, 9:19 AM</a><br><br>

People here haven't got a clue - they just think that everyone that voted leave, are thick, ignorant and racist. They can't even flirt with the idea that there may be other reasons. The arrogance and ignorance from London is astounding. It shouldn't be because I lived here for 5 years, but then it's taken a couple of years away to really realise what a different place it is. And what is it about Londoners that makes them think they can lecture others about stuff they haven't got a clue about?! <br><br>It's ironic because I left my hometown to go to London in my early twenties and thought I was leaving behind the 'small village, small mind'.

Donald Trump has written several books. I went to the library and read a few of them--being a teen in the nineties means I'm much more familiar with Hillary Clinton than Mr. Trump, as I don't watch tv. (I have, in fact, attended a Church service that Mrs. Clinton was at: most dull sermon ever.)<br>Back in the nineties, before his tv show, Mr. Trump wrote that he wanted to be President. Twenty years ago. In fact, digging into it a bit, apparently he was involved in the Reform Party's 2000 Presidential nomination process as a candidate for a brief time.<br>So why do people keep thinking he doesn't mean to be President? That he's running as some sort of foil for Mrs. Clinton? He's been a nomination candidate before. He's written about wanting to be President. He doesn't get credit for at least twenty years of watching his time and making his plan?<br>Probably that much discussed phone call was some sort of friendly heads up that Mr. Trump was running, (Mr. Clinton and Mr. Trump being golfing buddies) as the Clintons would presumably know what dirt Mr. Trump has on them, and could then make an educated choice as to whether they wanted it dragged out or not.<br><br><a href=#c85054544113928124 title="comment permalink">7/3/16, 12:44 PM</a><br><br>

The same goes for articles, speeches, op-ed pieces or similar. There are some exceptions: a retired politician etc. might very well have the time to write his or her own book.

I haven't yet done more than glance at the stack of stories; there were fewer entries for this competition than the last few -- not surprising, since it had so challenging a requirement! -- and if I don't have enough good stories without yours, I'll consider it. Otherwise, we'll see if it fits the requirements for the next contest; on the other hand, if you'd rather, you can forward it to <i>Into the Ruins</i> and see what Joel thinks of it. <br><br>Zach, what that shows is that the EU is no better than the current UK government; it's possible for the Brits to vote out their government, while there's no way for the citizens of EU countries to vote out the EU...<br><br>Gabriela, if all the EU has left to offer is fear, it's doomed. Fear of war will soon be balanced by fear of EU officialdom. <br><br>Alex, exactly. As I noted in last week's post, every social action has an equal and opposite reaction, and romantic racial nationalism is already emerging in response to the current liberal party line. <br><br>Rod, thank you! I hope they read it. <br><br>Jessi, I'd definitely encourage my readers to vote for the candidate they prefer, and ignore the apparatchiks who insist that a vote for anything outside the two party system is "wasted." Abraham Lincoln was a third party candidate -- the Democrats and the Whigs were the two established parties in 1860. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, it could be a Dewey Defeats Truman moment in several senses. I've heard from a lot of people -- close to three digits at this point -- who plan to vote for Trump but aren't telling any of their friends that fact, and I doubt they'd tell a pollster, either. But we'll see...<br><br>Hubertus, exactly. Our one hope is that the revolution could still happen by way of the ballot box, rather than roadside bombs and domestic insurgency. <br><br>William, Trump has deliberately flouted the canons of political correctness -- it's one of the ways he's signaling to the masses that he's on their side. Is it a cynical stirring of the pot? Quite possibly. You're right that Clinton's best shot at the presidency would have been to adopt Sanders' rhetoric of change; instead, she's cozying up to her fellow neoconservatives. If I were Trump's campaign manager I'd be drooling over the prospect of using Robert Kagan's endorsement of Clinton to paint Clinton as a clueless militarist itching to send American soldiers off to the Middle East to die; with a major foreign policy journal already publishing articles talking about Clinton's <a href=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-roots-hillarys-infatuation-war-16787 rel=nofollow>infatuation with war</a>, it'd be a slam-dunk. <br><br>David, it's not just you.

What interests me about him, and what makes me think he's most likely our next president, is that he's been willing to speak the unspeakable, and talk about the world in terms that reflect the experience of ordinary Americans. Whatever Trump himself does, that genie is not going back into the bottle. <br><br>Me etc., yes, half a dozen other people have already pointed that out. Your friend is quite right, of course, that the US will collapse in a lot less than 400 years, which is why, in Trey sunna Gwen's time, the collapse is a distant memory. <br><br>Submarine, Trump is a very clever man. Notice how he's gone from a nomination strategy aimed at targeting and flattening each of his potential rivals to a general election strategy aimed at defining himself as the only alternative to a hopelessly unsatisfactory business as usual. I'm sure the attack-dog stuff will come into play -- as I suggested in my post, I expect that beginning in early September -- but he's leading in by making a positive case for himself that will appeal to a very large number of American voters. That's not something Clinton seems to be able to do, and I suspect it's going to cost her heavily. <br><br>Unknown in Oz, do they call that a "hung parliament" down under? A British friend of mine commented in 2010, when the general election returned a parliament with no party in the majority, that the only way she'd accept a hung parliament is if it involved a public hanging. ;-)<br><br>Mr. Plod, thanks for the link! There definitely seems to be a trend...<br><br>Kevin, and as Kenneth Boulding said, the only people who believe in limitless growth on a finite planet are madmen and economists.<br><br>Hubertus, and how many of those miles were driven on safe testing tracks? <br><br>Jon, you're welcome and thank you! The next post will be an installment of the Retrotopia narrative, I promise. <br><br>Phil, thank you! That's a very cogent essay -- I bet the author gets pelted with insults by his peers. <br><br>David, exactly. The future we actually face is one that has been defined out of existence by the conventional wisdom of our time. <br><br>Herbert, interesting. Yes, he's started to notice -- but it hasn't occurred to him that the prosperity of the "creative class" has been paid for by the immiseration of everyone else, and that the changes that have to be made include a lot of things he and his affluent friends aren't going to like one bit. <br><br>Nancy, as I've mentioned before, to my mind debt is a symptom rather than a cause. It's simply a way of managing the tokens we use to distribute real wealth, and the dysfunction of our debt-based token system is a consequence of the broader dysfunction of our relationship to the real, i.e., natural world. <br><br>Hubertus, are they suicidal, or are they voting to harm someone else's interests rather than their own?<br><br><a href=#c3433031413448298263 title="comment permalink">7/3/16, 10:49 PM</a><br><br>

If he sweeps the election, and uses that mandate to push through the reforms he's proposed, there won't be someone to come after him; the GOP will be remade in his image -- you will never be able to unsee the mental picture of an elephant with the Donald's hair, will you? ;-) -- and the Dems, once they crawl out of the crater left behind by Clinton's political hopes, will remake themselves in Sanders' image. That's what happened to both parties after FDR, you know.<br><br>L, thank you! I wonder, is it time for someone in Britain to set up a moderated internet forum for Leave voters to share such stories and remind one another that it's not just them, their Remain friends really are acting like complete prats? It would have to be thoroughly moderated, as in nothing gets posted without moderator approval, because you'd face a world-class pratstorm otherwise.<br><br>Owen, ahem. And where are they going to get all the electricity, to say nothing of the vast amounts of lithium, to replace gasoline cars with electric cars? Ain't gonna happen. Musk has simply figured out that he can gorge at the public trough by pretending to offer a solution. <br><br>Alex, that doesn't surprise me at all. I gather that Londoners have some similarity to New Yorkers, who have a similar reputation here...<br><br>Owen, I could definitely see a post-UK Scotland and a post-EU France reestablishing the Auld Alliance! <br><br>Troy, many thanks. I used my search engine fu and managed to find a couple of articles with screen shots of the original twit -- er, tweet. I think I now have exhibit A for a post about how a scientific education produces people who are incompetent at politics -- a point that could have been learned a long time ago by watching the cascading failures of climate change activism. Stay tuned...<br><br>Varun, convincing the wage class that environmentalism isn't simply one more excuse for giving to the rich and taking from the poor -- that's a tall order, and it may take generations. More on this in a later post. <br><br>BoysMom, I'm quite certain it's because people are trying to convince themselves that he isn't really running -- because it's started to sink in that if he is really running, he's got a very good shot at the White House. It's been entertaining to me to watch the number of evasions people will go into to try to run away from the thought of President Trump.<br><br>Kfish, I'm sure that's exactly what she was expecting. The thing is, she said the unacceptable -- she pointed out that the Leave campaign won, and won fairly, by making a better case to the majority of the voters -- and a lot of Remain voters will never forgive her for that. (On the other hand, I bet she does really well in the next general election.)<br><br><a href=#c7472489573972441160 title="comment permalink">7/3/16, 11:19 PM</a><br><br>

In the heyday of coal mining in that area, the population in this area increased dramatically. Although, jobs were available, the majority of people were not particularly affluent.<br><br>When the large industries and manufacturers started to disappear, the people lost their main provider of jobs and these jobs were not replaced locally. Large numbers of people were settled in communities with their family obligations. Home ownership in the UK is high and house prices rose drastically at the end of the 1990s. Moving from a deprived area, where houses are worth less to a an area that profited from the service economy with high house prices is difficult. The rental market has never been attractive and has also become very expensive. Many council houses were sold off by local authorities in the 1990s.<br>The benefit system for unemployed people is not flexible and does not give enough security to families to take up temporary or insecure work and move around at the same time.<br><br>The UK economy is mainly about services now. The service jobs are in finance (high pay) to hotel, cleaning offices and care work (low pay). The low end service jobs don't pay enough to sustain a family plus rent/mortgage and for the earner to even live in very modest accommodation while working away.I never heard of any government schemes that would help working class people to take up temporary low end service jobs without losing their economic security. Even, if people take up low paid jobs locally, they would find it hard to make ends meet without tax credits from the state (which have been constantly curtailed by the current government in the name of austerity).<br><br>There are plenty low end service jobs and European immigrants are better placed to take advantage of that, either because they are young without families to support, because they are prepared to live in more cramped accommodation or because they can leave their children at home with grandparents without losing their place in their home country. <br><br>If anyone knows better, please correct me.<br><br><a href=#c6353930497705668979 title="comment permalink">7/4/16, 3:29 AM</a><br><br>

It is nice to know that it has been debunked by credible people. Fortunately the scientist who introduced the concept appears to be in error - as noted by several commenters here. <br><br>However, the story itself is interesting as it appears to have gained momentum and has displayed one of the problems with science itself. That problem is: a lack of a code of ethics.<br><br>As a member of the public and not a member of the scientific community it is a quite difficult problem to be faced with alarming pronouncements such as that one about the jet stream, from what appear to be credible sources, only to discover that pronouncement may in fact be hyperbole and puff - or in error!<br><br>The problem for the public then becomes one of the perception of credibility within the scientific community itself and I reckon this is a very thorny issue that the scientific community are unwilling or unable to grapple with. You see, sometimes perception can be treated as reality by us humans. I mean historically you could look at witch hunts and trials and see that perception problem in action.<br><br>On an altogether different note, we had a federal election down here over the weekend with a rather unusual result. A number of independents have gained seats in the House of Representatives (no small feat in itself) and the results for the Senate (which is state based) have yet to be released but by all accounts appear to be rather diverse. The governments down here appear to be very unused to minority governments, they also appear to dislike compromise and co-operation and the eventual results will be quite interesting. Any bills have to be passed through both houses of parliament before then getting royal ascent and becoming law.<br><br>You may not be aware, but voting is compulsory down here for the population and there is a big turn out on the election day. I wonder whether we may yet discover how little the politicians shape our day to day life as they render themselves ineffective? I don’t really know the answer to that question, but we may yet find out!<br><br>Interesting times.<br><br>PS: I hope that you and all your US readers have a lovely 4th July celebration!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c5080782337998877045 title="comment permalink">7/4/16, 4:47 AM</a><br><br>

This is understandable—otherwise, how is the story deindustrial at all? On the other hand, a slow regionally variable decline (aka long descent) is exactly the kind of scenario JMG has always anticipated and focused on, and we still describe it as a collapse. So when is it not a collapse? Perhaps when it's instead a deliberate dismantling, ahead of immediate necessity.

During the 1920s-1950s, when abortion was illegal in every state, many middle class women knew (or could find out) which local doctor would perform abortions and keep his mouth shut, and they went to him. I know this both through general reading and family history.<br><br>The women who did not have access to medical abortion when it was illegal were the poor and unmarried girls from "good families" who didn't want to face the consequences of telling their parents that they were pregnant. The choices for the married poor were risk your life or have an additional child to feed and clothe. The choices for the single girls were risk your life or drop out of school, go to a home for unwed mothers and give the baby up to a closed adoption. The Florence Crittenden Home for unwed mothers was still operating when I was in high school.<br><br>These days the majority of abortions are performed on married women. The stigma on unwed motherhood has largely disappeared. You can credit or blame feminism for some of that. But poor women do want abortions sometimes, and they ought to be able to have them without risking their lives, just like the middle and upper classes. I don't see that as an elitist position. It is part of the general campaign of Second Wave Feminism to give every woman control over her own sex life, just like men.<br><br><a href=#c3114686179933033378 title="comment permalink">7/4/16, 5:29 PM</a><br><br>

Such a party MIGHT have taken off if, say, Woodrow Wilson had not simultaneously re-aligned the Democratic Party circa 1912, and cemented his leadership and his party's new alignments by successfully navigating the several crises of WWI.<br><br>In my view, the main problem to overcome is that America does not generate such personalities as Wilson, TR, or William Jennings Bryan anymore. Sorry to say that the septuagenarian Sanders hasn't the energy or the time to re-align a party like the Democrats, so dependent as they are on cash flows from the winners of the neoliberal world order.<br><br><br><a href=#c598339874152236596 title="comment permalink">7/5/16, 3:50 PM</a><br><br>

We might have reached the point identified by Joseph Tainter where our standard way of solving the problems we face – i.e. investing in organizational and technical complexity – is yielding diminishing returns. As a consequence, more and more of our complex economic, technical, political and social systems are showings signs of stress, or even early signs of failure. As our capacity to invest in further complexity continues to get eroded by energy-related and other biophysical constraints, we should expect more stress to develop across the board, potentially leading to some sort of systemic breakdown and forced simplification. The growing popular revolts against globalisation, the EU, or multiculturalism are signs that Western societies are already struggling to uphold their level of complexity and are subject to strong forces that are pulling towards a break down to a lower complexity level (i.e. localized economies, national governance, homogeneous societies, etc.). <br>Overall, the Brexit vote and the way people have reacted to it is a good example of the way the stories we tell ourselves get to obscure what is really at play and at stake, i.e. the stories we choose to ignore.<br>https://paularbair.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/brexit-the-populist-surge-and-the-crisis-of-complexity/<br><br><br><a href=#c4424097192113961041 title="comment permalink">7/6/16, 5:02 AM</a><br><br>

Maybe that narrative fits the US situation better.<br><br>With a narrow margin of victory on such an important national decision, whichever side lost was going to feel hurt and angry by it: that's human nature. Farage had made a point of saying in advance that a narrow victory for remain would not be the end of the story and that he was ready to fight on if needs be. Not stipulating a minimum necessary margin for victory in the referendum legislation was probably a mistake, but I agree that trying to change the rules after the event would be an act of highly destructive bad faith. Only if there was a clear and sustained shift in public opinion could this result really be questioned, and that seems unlikely before the triggering of article 50.<br><br>Here's a piece of anecdotal evidence about 'polite society' which may interest you: my partner works in IT (for Hewlett Packard in Bracknell, Berkshire - relatively affluent southern England in London's commuter belt) and most of his office co-workers were vociferously pro-leave in such a way that he felt it unwise to express an opinion to the contrary. These are not the economically oppressed by any means; they work reasonably long hours but receive a well above average salary for it. Their motivation has far more to do with nationalist sentiment (I'm not saying this in itself is good or bad, but it's not always well-informed), stoked by anti-EU/anti-migrant rhetoric in most of the UK press over many years. As an aside, I find it interesting how this kind of rhetoric hasn't had the same impact in Scotland or Northern Ireland.<br><br>While I concur with the general thrust of your criticisms of neoliberalism and the inevitability of a pushback, the EU has mostly not imposed this on an unwilling UK. Rather, the UK has helped push the EU in this direction. Thatcher got the ball rolling in the 1980s with privatisation of public services, relaxing financial regulation and oversight, crushing the unions and heavy industry. She was out of power before the EU in its current form even existed. <br><br>(continues in separate comment...)<br><br><a href=#c1750174806295455799 title="comment permalink">7/6/16, 6:39 AM</a><br><br>

They clambered merrily on the privatisation bandwagon, embraced the accounting trick of PFI, boasted of the light-touch regulation of banking, allowed HMRC to be taken over by the big accountancy firms, let zero-hours contracts proliferate and didn't address the lack of social housing. This is all a failure of our own parliament, not the EU.<br><br>And the housing is not a side issue, but a fundamental part of people's discontent in Britain today. While not enacting temporary EU immigration restrictions in the middle part of the last decade was certainly a mistake, the focus on the numbers coming here since then has diverted attention from this long-term failure of successive governments. Merely treating the symptom will not cure the malaise. <br><br>You wrote '...which can't provide adequate jobs, housing, or social services...', when it would be more accurate to say '...which has chosen not to provide...' those things. That is the crux of it. We have a tax gap of around £120billion per year. We have pumped £375billion of QE into the financial system, with more likely to follow. Government has the tools to provide jobs and investment in things that will benefit society and reduce inequality, but this is simply not in the Tories DNA. <br><br>One final point to note: the polls were not 'blindsided' - many were pointing to a Leave victory in the week or two before the vote.<br><br>I do want to emphasise that I find your writing consistently interesting and thought-provoking, and I respect your integrity as a writer, despite my disagreement with you here. I've never felt the need to reply at such length before, but the topic is one of great interest to me. <br><br>My hope now is that we can save the better aspects of EU legislation and finally address our many homegrown problems. My fear is that the exact opposite happens in a period of extreme economic uncertainty, that we become even more of a tax haven, and that Scotland's departure leaves us with a permanent right-wing 'Cowardly State' (to quote one Richard Murphy).

This is extremely helpful to me. Thank you. Very few people understand or even agree with the fact that significant technological progress has been at a standstill for many years. <br><br>I have seen this phenomenon directly, working as a scientist in R&amp;D in a few fields for 12 years, followed by work as a patent attorney in a variety of fields for another 20 years. Other older patent attorneys with a long time perspective that I have talked to have the same opinion. The real good (helpful inventions that improved our lives based on an improved, deeper understanding of reality) were mostly played out 50 to 100 years ago.<br><br>We live in reality that is understood by progressively more detailed theories of reality. It is not true that earlier science is superceded and made irrelevant by later science. Newtonian physics (and basic 100 year old chemistry) are useful and used to understand and intelligently interact with reality MOST of the time, even now. Later advances do NOT throw out or make irrelevant the earlier more basic science, but instead provide explanations and modalities of action for how to handle the 1% of instances where the old theories do not work. Gradually, we see the earliest theories used for the majority of intelligent interactions with reality, then later theories used for a small proportion of outliers, then the most recent advances needed and actually used to handle the rare cases where earlier theories do not work. This is the real fact of your notational space in how we are doing with applications of discoveries in reality. The space of understandable reality based on science HAS gotten smaller. The facts of science discovery and technology application over the years (as evidenced in the patent field) clearly show that your definition and use of notational space in the arts, clearly applies to science.<br><br>The golden age of science is over. Most patents in recent years (particulalry compared to 50-100 years ago are merely tricks to make people pay more for old technology dressed up in new packages (particularly seen in pharmaceuticals), or (particularly in the computer science area) new ways to trick and fool people and take away their privacy and money and time. <br><br>Of course, there are exceptions, particularly in the cancer therapy field, but generally we need to be honest and decide what technology we really need and avoid the nonsense of contrived advances, which more often than not serve the 0.01% and hurt the common man. Most of the important (ie. litigated) recent "advances," (the "internet of things" comes to mind) and new inventions for fooling the internet user serve the wealthy, connected and international enterprise but should be avoided by those who truly want a better life. That seems to be your main message. I recently walked away from my successful K-street patent law firm (which I founded about 10 years ago) because I am so disgusted with how the patent system is mostly used to control, fool and cajole people out of their money, without offering anything helpful in return. The age of basic discovery is mostly over and the age of consolidation (independent self-reliant communities generate everything they need, using no-cost technology and local energy/materials) is commencing....<br>I really am surprised by the quality of comments posted here and would like to meet others.<br><br><a href=#c7253867669626855629 title="comment permalink">7/9/16, 1:41 AM</a><br><br>

A major sportswear retailer opens a warehouse on the site of a disused coal mine that had been closed years ago, and which put thousands out of work. What seems like a fresh start soon turned sour when the retailer's employment practices emerged. A Dickensian workhouse culture emerged with pay and conditions that were so appalling that most local people couldn't actually afford to live on what they were paying. The result? Some eighty percent of the workforce were brought in from abroad, mostly from Eastern Europe, because they were the only ones who would accept such conditions.<br><br>This is a typical example of something that causes such anger and such rage amongst working class people in the UK and no amount of schoolyard insults against them will mitigate against that; and I'm afraid that until we actually start discussing these root causes of our problems both here and across the Atlantic, then I fear civil unrest and something much, much worse.<br><br><a href=#c6753641305438237553 title="comment permalink">8/6/16, 3:16 PM</a><br><br>
