<div class=MsoNormal>
It's been a little more than a year now since I started the narrative that wrapped up last week. The two weeks that Peter Carr spent in the Lakeland Republic in late November of 2065 ended up covering a little more ground than I’d originally intended, and of course the vagaries of politics and culture in the twilight years of the American century got their share of attention on this blog. Now that the story’s told and the manuscript is getting its final revisions before heading off to the publisher, I want to talk a bit about exactly what I was trying to do by taking an imaginary person to an imaginary place where things work better than they do here and now. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Part of it, of course, was an attempt to sketch out in detail the practical implications of a point I’ve been exploring on this blog for a good while now. Most people in today’s industrial society believe, or think they believe, in progress: they believe, that is, that human history has a built-in bias that infallibly moves it from worse things to better things over time. These days, that belief in progress most often attaches itself to the increasing complexification of technology, and you get the touching faith in the imminence of a <i>Star Trek</i> future that allows so many people these days to keep slogging through the wretchedly unsatisfactory and steadily worsening conditions of the present. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Faith does not depend on evidence. If that statement needs any further proof, you can get it by watching the way people respond to technological failure. Most of us these days know perfectly well that every software “upgrade” these days has more bugs and fewer useful features than what it replaced, and every round of “new and improved” products hawked by the media and shoveled onto store shelves is more shoddily made, more loaded with unwanted side effects, and less satisfactory than the last round. Somehow, though, a good many of the people who witness this reality, day in and day out, still manage to insist that the future is, or at least ought to be, a paradise propped up by perfectly functioning machines. That the rising tide of technological failure might be something other than an accidental roadbump on the way to utopia—that it might be trying to tell us something that, by and large we don’t want to hear—has not yet entered our society’s darkest dream. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It so happens that in very many cases, older, simpler, sturdier technologies work better, producing more satisfactory outcomes and fewer negative side effects, than their modern high-tech equivalents. After most of two years taking apart the modern mythology of progress in a series of posts that became my book <i>After Progress: Reason and Religion at the End of the Industrial Age</i>, and most of another year doing the more pragmatic posts that are being turned into a forthcoming book tentatively titled <i>The Retro Future</i>, I decided that the best way to pursue the exploration further was to imagine a society very much like ours that had actually noticed the declining quality of technology, and adjusted public policies accordingly. That was the genesis of <i>Retrotopia</i>: the attempt to show, by means of the toolkit of narrative fiction, that deliberate technological regression as public policy didn’t amount to a return to the caves—quite the contrary, it meant a return to things that actually work. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The form that this exploration took, though, was shaped in important ways by an earlier venture of the same kind, Ernest Callenbach’s <i>Ecotopia</i>. I don’t know how many of my readers realize just how dramatic a change in utopian literature was marked by Callenbach’s solidly written tale. From the days of Thomas More’s novel <i>Utopia</i>, which gave the genre its name, utopian literature worked with the contrast between the world as it is and an ideal world as imagined by the author, without any connection between the two outside of the gimmick, however worked, that got a viewpoint character from one to the other. More’s Utopia was a critique of the England of Henry VIII, but there was never any suggestion on More’s part that England might be expected to turn into Utopia one of these days, and nearly all the utopian tales that followed his embraced the same approach. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With William Morris, things began to shift. Morris was a socialist, and thus believed devoutly that the world could in fact turn into something much better than it was; during the years that his commitment to socialism was at its height, he penned a utopian tale, <i>News from Nowhere</i>, which was set in a future England long after Victorian capitalism had gone gurgling down history’s sewer pipe. (Later on, in the pages of his tremendous fantasy novel <i>The Well at the World’s End</i>, he wove a subtle but pervasive critique of the socialist views he’d championed—socialism appears there in the stark and terrible symbolic form of the Dry Tree—but that’s a subject for a different post entirely.)</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<i>News From Nowhere</i> was quite the controversial book in its day, not least because the socialist future Morris imagined was green, agrarian, and entirely free of the mechanized regimentation of humanity that played such a huge role in the Marxist imagination then as now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, the historical thread that linked Morris’ utopia to the present was very thin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The story was set far off in the future, and Morris skimmed lightly over the process that led from the dark Satanic mills of Victorian England to the green and pleasant land of his imagined socialist England. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was where Callenbach took hold of the utopian narrative, and hammered it into a completely new shape. <i>Ecotopia</i> was set barely a quarter century in Callenbach’s own future. In his vision, the states of Washington, Oregon, and the northern two-thirds of California had broken away from the United States in 1980, and the usual visitor—journalist William Weston, from what’s left of the United States—came to pay the usual visit in 1999. Over the nineteen years between independence and Weston’s visit, the new nation of Ecotopia had entirely reshaped itself in the image of the <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i>, adopting the technologies, customs, and worldview that San Francisco-area eco-radicals of the 1970s dreamed of establishing, and here and there actually adopted in their own lives. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It really is a tour de force. One measure of its impact is that to this day, when you ask people on the leftward end of things to imagine an ideal future that isn’t just a lightly scrubbed version of the present, dollars will get you organic free range doughnuts that what you’ll hear is some version or other of the Ecotopian future: wind turbines and solar panels, organic farms everywhere, and everyone voluntarily embracing the social customs and attitudes of the San Francisco-area avant-garde circa 1975 in perfect lockstep. While I was writing <i>Retrotopia</i>, until some of my readers got the hang of the fact that I don’t crowdsource my fiction, I fielded any number of comments and emails insisting that I really ought to incorporate this or that or the other aspect of the Ecotopian future into my narrative. I didn’t take offense at that; it was pretty clear to me that for a lot of people nowadays, <i>Ecotopia</i> is literally the only alternative to the status quo that they can imagine. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We’ll get to the broader implications of that last point in a moment. Just now, I want to talk about why I didn’t write a mildly retro version of <i>Ecotopia</i>. I could have; it would have been easy and, frankly, quite entertaining to do that. I’ve imagined more than once writing a tale about somebody from our world who, via some bit of science-fictionish handwaving, is transported to an alternate America in which Ronald Reagan lost the 1980 election, the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant underwent a full-scale Fukushima Daiichi meltdown with tens of thousands of casualties, and the United States had accordingly gone careening ahead toward the sustainable future we almost adopted. I may still write that story someday, but that wasn’t what I chose to do this time around. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Partly, of course, that was because Ernest Callenbach was there already forty years ago. Partly, though, it’s because not all the assumptions that undergirded <i>Ecotopia</i> have worn well in the decades since he wrote. It’s become painfully clear that renewable energy sources, valuable and necessary though they are, can’t simply be dropped into place as a replacement for fossil fuels; huge changes in energy use, embracing issues of energy concentration and accessibility as well as sheer quantity, will have to be made as fossil fuels run out and we have to make do with the enduring power sources of sun, wind, water, and muscle. It’s also become clear, painfully or amusingly as the case may be, that the notions that Sausalito intellectuals thought would save the world back in the 1970s—communal living, casual pansexuality, and the like—had downsides and drawbacks that nobody had gotten around to noticing yet, and weren’t necessarily as liberating and transformative as they seemed at the time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<i>Ecotopia</i> also fell headlong into both of the standard pitfalls of the contemporary liberal imagination. The first of these is the belief that a perfect society can be attained if we can just abolish diversity of ideas and opinions, and get everyone to believe what the affluent liberal intelligentsia think they ought to believe. That’s why I put ongoing controversies between conservative and restorationist blocs into the story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s also, on another level, why I put in repeated references to religious diversity—thus there are people running for public office in the Lakeland Republic who end an oath of office with “So help me Jesus my Lord and Savior,” just as there are military officers there who spend every Sunday at the Greek Orthodox cathedral in Toledo, and politicians who attend the Atheist Assembly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second pitfall, which follows from the first, is the belief that since you can’t get “those people” to have the ideas and opinions you think they ought to have, the proper response is to hole up in a self-referential echo chamber from which all unacceptable views are excluded. <i>Ecotopia</i>
assumes implicitly that the United States, and by inference the rest of the world’s nations as well, are utterly irredeemable; the nation of Ecotopia thus barricades itself inside its borders and goes its green and merry way, and the climax of the story comes when William Weston decides to stay in Ecotopia and become one of the good people. (He had a significant other back home in the USA, by the way; what she thought of his decision to dump her for a San Francisco hippie chick is nowhere mentioned.)</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We’ll be discussing both those pitfalls at length in future posts, not least because they bid fair to exert a massive influence on contemporary politics, especially but not only in the United States. The point I’d like to make here, though, is just how deep the latter habit runs through the liberal end of our collective imagination. I’m thinking here of another powerful and morally problematic work of fiction to come out of the same era, Ursula K. LeGuin’s haunting story “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas.” The core of the story is that there’s a splendid city, Omelas; its splendor depends on the infliction of suffering on one helpless person; now and again, people get upset by this, and leave the city. It’s stunningly well written but evades a crucial question: does walking away do anything to change the situation, or does it just let the ones who walk away from Omelas feel morally superior? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was one of the reasons why the conclusion of <i>Retrotopia</i>
didn’t feature Peter Carr chucking his Atlantic Republic passport and moving in with Melanie Berger. Instead, he caught the train back home, having committed himself to the challenge of trying to move his own country in the direction that the Lakeland Republic has already taken, in the full knowledge that he might not succeed. I had the entire last scene in mind from the beginning of the project, partly as a deliberate challenge to that aspect of <i>Ecotopia</i>, partly because that sort of leap into uncertainty seems much more relevant to our present predicament. We don’t know, any more than Carr did, what lies behind the clouds that hide the future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of course the primary difference between <i>Ecotopia</i> and
<i>Retrotopia</i> was that my narrative was meant to explore a very different approach from Callenbach’s. He was trying to propose a new, avant-garde, cutting-edge future—it’s often forgotten that the kind of thing Callenbach was talking about really was seen as the next great wave of progress in the 1970s, before the current fad for schizoid withdrawal into a cybernetic Neverland took that title away from it in the 1980s. I’m trying to explore the possibility that going back to what worked is a better idea than plunging forward along a trajectory that leads to no place any sane human being would want to go. He was talking about innovation, while I’m talking about <i>retrovation</i>: the strategy of using the past as a resource for problem-solving in the present. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Retrovation used to be utterly unthinkable in modern industrial societies. At the moment, it’s making the transition from utterly unthinkable to unspeakably heretical—thus another term for it I introduced in a post a while back, <a href=../../2015/11/the-heresy-of-technological-choice.html>the heresy of technological choice</a>—but a lot of people still can’t get their minds around it at all. When I’ve proposed steampunk technology as one model for the future, I’ve inevitably fielded a flurry of comments insisting that you can’t possibly have Victorian technology without child labor and oppressive gender politics—and of course while I was writing <i>Retrotopia</i>, quite a few readers assumed as a matter of course that the tier system in the Lakeland Republic governed every detail of daily life, so that you weren’t allowed to have anything belonging to a post-1830 technological suite if you lived in a tier one county. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Not so. The word I’ve coined for the strategy under discussion, retrovation, is obviously backformed from “retro” + “innovation,” but it’s also “re-trove-ation,” re-finding, rediscovery: an active process of searching through the many options the past provides, not a passive acceptance of some bygone time as a package deal. That’s the strategy the Lakeland Republic puts to use in my narrative, and those of my readers who know their way around the backwaters and odd corners of history may find it entertaining to figure out the sources from which I lifted this or that detail of Retrotopian daily life. The rhetoric of progress, by contrast, rejects that possibility, relies on a very dubious logic that lumps “the past” together as a single thing, and insists that wanting any of it amounts to wanting all of it, with the worst features inevitably highlighted. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve long since lost track of the number of times I’ve been told that rejecting the latest new, shiny, and dysfunctional technology, in favor of an older technology that works, is tantamount to cheerleading for infant mortality, or slavery, or living in caves, or what have you. I’ve sometimes thought that it might be entertaining to turn that around—“if you won’t use a cell phone, you must be in favor of bringing back a balanced global climate!”—or simply taking it in directions a little more absurd than it’s gone already—“if you prefer rail travel to air travel, why, you might as well just restart the Punic Wars!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In either case, the point that might be made is the silliness of the progress-worshippers’ insistence that the past, or the present, or for that matter the future, is an all-or-nothing deal. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s also why, to return to my narrative for a moment, I made a point of showing that the sexual mores of people in the Lakeland Republic didn’t correspond to how people behaved at some point in the past—or, more to the point, the mythical notion of how people behaved in the past that’s been circulated by certain pseudoconservatives in recent decades. Thus industrial magnate Janice Mikkelson is a lesbian with a lovely wife, Peter Carr happens to see two young men who’ve just gotten married on their way to their honeymoon, and when Peter and Melanie go out for dinner and an opera, the evening ends in her bedroom. I know that was uncomfortable for the social and religious conservatives among my readers, but it had to be there, for two reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On the one hand, as a moderate Burkean conservative, I see absolutely no justification for imposing legal restraints on what consenting adults do in the privacy of their own bedrooms, or for that matter in that dimension of the public sphere that pertains to marriage licenses—and, after all, this is my utopia and I’ll permit what I want to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the other hand, just as I put devoutly religious people into the story to discomfit the sort of doctrinaire liberals who believe that nobody should follow traditional religious teachings, I put married gay and lesbian people into the story to discomfit the sort of doctrinaire conservatives who believe that nobody should follow contemporary sexual mores. In both cases, the point I hoped to make is that the Lakeland Republic, with its policy of retrovation and its relative comfort with a diversity of ideas and lifestyles, hasn’t gone “backward,” or for that matter “forward,” but off in a direction all its own—a direction that can’t be defined in terms of the monomaniacally linear fixations of the worshippers of progress. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And of course that’s the crucial point, the most important thing that I hope my readers got out of the narrative. At the heart of most of the modern world’s insoluble problems is the faith-based claim that human history is a straight line with no branches or meanders, leading onward and upward from the caves to the stars, and that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>every software upgrade, every new and improved product on the shelves, every lurch “forward”—however that conveniently floppy word happens to be defined from day to day by marketing flacks and politicians—therefore must lead toward that imaginary destination. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That blind and increasingly untenable faith, I’ve come to think, is the central reason why the only future different from the present that most people can imagine these days, if it’s not Ecotopia, is either a rehash of the past in every detail or some kind of nightmare dystopia. These days, as often as not, that even extends to science fiction, once our society’s most effervescent cauldron of novel futures. While writing an essay on the genre for a new magazine of science fiction and fantasy, <a href=http://www.mythicmag.com/ >Mythic</a>, it occurred to me—and not for the first time—how few recent works of science fiction seem to be able to portray a future society that isn’t either a straight-line extrapolation from the present, complete with all its most parochial features, a carbon-copy rehash of some specific society of the past, or a smoking wasteland. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Not all that many decades ago, SF authors routinely spun future societies as radically different from ours as ours is from, say, the ancient Maya, but such visions are rare now. I don’t think that’s accidental.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To borrow a metaphor from <i>Retrotopia</i>, when you’ve driven down a blind alley and are sitting there with your bumper pressed against a brick wall, the only way forward starts by backing up—but if you’ve been convinced by your society’s core ideological commitments that “backing up” can only mean returning whole hog to the imaginary, awful past from which the ersatz messiah of progress is supposed to save us, you’re stuck. There you sit, pushing uselessly on the pedal, hearing the engine labor and rattle, and watching the gas gauge move steadily toward that unwelcome letter E; it’s no surprise that after a while, the idea of a street leading somewhere else starts to seem distinctly unreal. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Other futures are possible. <i>Retrotopia</i> isn’t the only option, though I have to say it strikes me as a much more pleasant choice than what we’ve got now, and retrovation isn’t the only tool we need to get us out of that blind alley, though I suspect it’s more useful than a good many of the more popular items in our contemporary toolkit. Still, time will tell—and if my narrative irritates some of my readers enough to get them working on their own, radically different visions of a future that breaks free of the blind alley of linear progress, all the better. </div>

Unfortunately I can think of no historical examples where such was the case in the western experience. The Abrahamic religions in virtually all their manifestations are relentlessly oppressive in their views of sexuality. It's easy to imagine a secular jew or a liberal Christian accepting such relationships, but it's inconceivable that such a person could swear an oath to Jesus as her lord and savior. I fully understand that adopting older technologies does not imply that the adopters must accept child labor, slavery or the 16 hour work day, but that old time religion precludes the tolerance of non hetero normative relationships and I suspect it always will.<br><br><a href=#c8372012876370277384 title="comment permalink">9/21/16, 8:17 PM</a><br><br>

While reading Ecotopia I kept thinking about how condescending many of the ecotopians would be to people who didn't fit in right to their society, I'm sure I'd get a decent amount of that there even though I share a decent percentage of their values, i just don't share that personality type.<br><br>I can't fault Callenbach for being too unrealistic about the potential for renewable energy, as it was still early on in the game for those technologies in the 70s, but I was struck by his over-idealized view of human nature. I guess that's pretty common in utopias, Callenbach doesn't do it as extreme as some (such B.F. Skinner's Walden Two), but I still kept thinking of ways that his systems wouldn't work as advertised as i was reading. Then there's the matter of how the Ecotopian culture evolved to the point that it did in just 25 years. I can't imagine the culture of a whole country (even a new one) changing that fast, I mean maybee some of the subcultures within it, but not the whole society to the extent that it had in Ecotopia. On those measures, I'd say Retrotopia does a much better job, its the most realistic utopian scenario that I've ever heard of.<br><br><a href=#c5183247938109440541 title="comment permalink">9/21/16, 8:18 PM</a><br><br>

I will say that I have definitely run into the idea a few times now that if you prefer some aspect of the past--a technology, specific ways of living, what have you--it must mean that you prefer all things about that past. Of course, the person making this claim doesn't actually mean <i>all</i> things (as you illustrate with your imagined absurd responses) but generally a few bad things plucked out of that era. It actually makes sense, of course; if the only way you think about the past is as a contrast of bad against the good of the present or future, the main things you're going to allow yourself to notice about the past are whatever aspects of it were bad, and you're generally going to focus on the examples that are used to contrast the bad of the past against the equivalent good of the future.<br><br>I wonder if this is also part of the trouble with imagining different futures? We're not really taught about the past as its own unique time. What little information we receive about the past is generally provided as a contrast against the future. The focus is about how things were worse than now, or different than now, or about some element of the past that fits into a narrative that progresses to some element of our present. It's kind of like how kids tend to view their teachers not as separate human beings with all their own wants, desires, inner and outer lives and so on, but simply as their teacher. They only conceive of their teach within the context of <i>them</i>. We only conceive of the past within the context of now. Anything that can't be fit into that context gets ignored or dismissed, which means that probably the vast majority of the past gets ignored or dismissed.<br><br>Joel<br><br>P.S. A new <a href=http://figurationpress.com/litterfall/ rel=nofollow>Litterfall</a> post went up on Monday, within which I consider the time and monetary debts we create for ourselves when trying to live a standard American lifestyle, and why ditching that lifestyle leads to better living.

Have you read Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time? Her utopian society is filled with disagreement and controversy, and as a result she works very hard putting in place rituals for handling, not stifling, internal conflict. It came out in 1976, but it is very much a sixties/counterculture kind of utopia. I don't know why it is rarely part of these discussions - probably the best piece of imaginative fiction to come out of that period. Totally laissez faire on the question of sexuality, very interesting take on gender issues and personal freedom generally. Much livelier and more engaging read, if you'll forgive me, than Retrotopia.

Microsoft went past that point a long time ago -- the fact that they couldn't get people to go for Windows 10 when they gave it away for free was just a little indicative; Apple, in my experience, has reached diminishing returns but not negative ones; and Linux is still actually upgrading. Give it a while; my guess is that, since it doesn't really have the incentive to keep pushing dysfunctional software the way Microsoft does, is that it will mature to a nice stable system that'll remain in use with minor tinkerings as long as current computer technology is around. <br><br>Lorenzo, thank you. I do my best to have fun. <br><br>Jay, it's always amusing to me to watch people outside the Abrahamic religions accept those religions' inaccurate claim to be unchanging. Fifty years ago it was unthinkable to most devout Protestant Christians that divorce would ever be acceptable; now it's accepted as a matter of course in most denominations. Give same sex relationships another fifty years and most denominations will have come to terms with them the same way they came to terms with divorce, and interracial marriage, and a very, very long list of other things that used to be hot buttons and are now no big deal. Meanwhile other things that weren't seen as moral issues at all have become major concerns. That's natural and healthy -- if a religion is the framework through which a group of people relate to one or more deities, as I'd define it, it's going to adapt over time -- and it's entertaining to watch some believers in the Abrahamic religions, and some enemies of those religions, trying valiantly to insist that this doesn't take place at all.<br><br>Ozark, no argument there. The notion that people will behave like angels if only they can be made to hold the right opinions runs very deep, though I think many of us are finally outgrowing it. <br><br>Marxmarv, Ann Arbor probably has a university again, but the universities had to be rebuilt basically from scratch after the Second Civil War, and they're much smaller than they used to be -- this is covered in the revised version of the story.

Part of the fun of this was it had a very simple yet highly randomised method of creating planets for the Travellers to visit. To be honest I probably spent more time trying to figure out rationales for things like "why are 6 billion people living on a small planetoid with a very thin atmosphere and no water'" than actually playing the game. However one of the numbers used to describe the planet represented technological level. As I recall the present day was Tech Level 7 while the SF future went all the way up to 15 (or F as the game used a curious hexadecimal notation). More interesting to me though were the Technological levels below 7 as I was very much of the Spacemen get stuck in the Middle Ages frame of mind. <br>One of the difficulties was coming up with low tech planets that didn't match cultures to technology. It was always a temptation to have everyone on a Tech 3 planet having buckles on their hats and a cavalier or puritan outlook, while Tech 4 was ever in danger of becoming a Victorian melodrama. Don't get me started on Tech 2 and loathly ladies and gallant knights.<br>It seems there is something very hard wired into the Western psyche that equates technologies and cultures.

I much enjoyed your Retrotopia series. I find the bouts of fiction on your blog tackle the issues you bring to light in refreshingly different ways. They offer a framework in which to hang the more technical posts, making them easier to remember - which shouldn't surprise me, human beings being the storytelling mammal and all that.<br><br><br>Secondly, Have you head of SENS by any chance? They are at the head of an initiative to repair "the damage done by ageing to human beings". The main focus seems to be the preventing of some diseases that become far more prevalent in old age (such as Alzheimer, hearing loss, age-related macular degeneration and so on). The side effect would be that clearing the damage that causes these dysfunctions would 'set back the clock' on the age of the body as a whole, so to say.<br><br>So I've been trying to find the catch. I've managed to do so in most 'transhumanist' technologies; nuclear fusion and the like. There's always groups of people making money, or making sure they keep their jobs, or -something- along those lines. Also some logical fault; 99% of the time relating to where the energy to do something would come from (molecular nano-assembly comes to mind).<br><br>What fascinates me is that there are some other seemingly non-senescent large vertebrates out there, such as crocodiles. There is precedent in nature, be it in cold-blooded animals... and many plants.<br><br>Warm-blooded animals tend to age more rapidly, but the speed can vary wildly between species - naked mole-rats versus mice, for example. Or humans and apes. But even within our own species, some people look a lot better at 80 than others... My personal theory is that the rate of ageing is determined by the thoroughness of the cell's repair mechanisms. People who have variants that repair the cells more fully will 'age' more slowly, as will people who damage their cells less - lifestyle choices, no smoking, less stress and the like.<br><br>The SENS group doesn't seem to require any gimmick either, since the technologies they claim they need are already all in place. Part of the research has, amazingly, already been successfully completed (some complex stuff involving mitochondrial DNA), the organization is a non-profit, and the guy who started it all has invested millions of his own inheritance into it. He even says he finds the term 'transhumanism' both distasteful and illogical, but he'll take support wherever he can get it. I can't find the catch in this one, I'm wondering if maybe you can.<br><br>Now it's not that it would matter much in the long run, since disease, starvation or injury would still take someone like that out. It won't solve the energy crisis, or the environmental once, and in a declining society I doubt any non-ageing individual could manage to live much longer than 100 years.<br><br>So my apologies if you don't have time for this, or simply do not find it to be interesting. But since it's a topic that has fascinated mankind since the myth of Gilgamesh, I can't help but be intrigued... Perhaps biotechnology has some (hopefully not too nasty) surprises in store for us before the infrastructure it requires collapses, and it peters out...<br><br><a href=#c7463324195093502093 title="comment permalink">9/22/16, 2:06 AM</a><br><br>

Most everybody uses those two words interchangeably and believe they mean the same thing. You do touch on this a bit by identifying the meaningless complexity of modern technology but I would suggest that it would be very helpful if you could expand on that notion. We've become trapped in a baroque illusion of innovative new devices and ideas and haven't made any progress in decades at the least, really centuries depending on the technology.

Greer<br><br>I had two issues with the future presented in Retrotopa, and both were the reason why you wrote the story: religion and sex.<br><br>Our sexual habits derive from an industrial society that provides the tools needed for their existence. Without cheap preservatives, antibiotics and contraceptives it's impossible to sustain the modern sexual behaviour. Sex is dangerous. The ancients had<br>their reasons when they imposed their taboos and those taboos are valid retrovations <br>when the penalties for progressive sexual behaviour are aids and siphylis. Maybe Lakelanders know how to craft preservatives even with unreliable rubber supplies, and with scarce oil rubber will be unreliable as you will be forced to rely upon brazillan, congolese and malayan trees. Antibiotics probably are useless in the sixties and contraceptives, with all their health risks, may be despised by a society born from a rebellion against Better Living Thru Chemistry.<br><br>The second issue is religion. Toynbee demonstrates that all societies are born around a religious revelation and grow around that cult, like the western civilization growing around the Catholic Church or the ancient civilizations growing around their mystery cults. Lakeland deals well with the material issues of retrovation, and also with the cultural ones, but it lacks the religious cultists from which the revelation of the new way of life, the method of dealing with reality that actually works, would come. And that, in my opinion, is needed because one can't fight and defeat a religion like the idolatry of progress without another religion and that religion should be stronger than the religion being defeated, it should have more actual religious experiences (that's easy considering how far from the spirits the idolatry of progress is). Lakeland lacked that, and it seemed to me to be lower elements of reality influencing higher elements of reality (economy and resources controlling culture). Where is the religious cult in the heart of the new society? Is there an inner club, like a freemasonry, where the true religion of Lakeland is taught? Or is Lakeland a very temporary arrangement, doomed to fail soon, because it lacks a spirit animating it? Or is it too early and as time passes and the lakelanders learn more and more things that worked they will rediscover things like sainthood, astrology, alchemy and evocation? Of course, the need for religious cultists does not imply<br>the need for christian puritanic fire-and-brimstone churches or bomb-throwing muslim jihadists. The religions revelations might as well be something like the Santa Muerte or something based on the teachings of Budda. But whatever the cult is it will bring taboos and will try to enforce for the glory of God and the ordering of society based <br>on the divine structure of the universe as perceived by the cultists.<br><br>Sorry for the bad english.<br><br><a href=#c7525396148825679795 title="comment permalink">9/22/16, 5:15 AM</a><br><br>

Work is a necessary and rewarding condition of life. By exploiting this very fact in various sinister ways, those committed to a capitalist worldview distort the meaning and goal of work. Instead of using technology to assist in creating and maintaining a healthy society, technology is turned into an aimless goal in itself. A perpetual motion machine if you will.<br><br>Working to provide the necessities of life with ones fellows, in my experience, is the ultimate goal of life. Working with well made tools to achieve these ends is the measure of progress. The question that needs to be asked is does the tool need to be "improved" to complete the task at hand.<br><br>I much simpler life awaits us all.<br><br><a href=#c8243381379959706441 title="comment permalink">9/22/16, 6:03 AM</a><br><br>

From the 1880s on bicycles were the original transportation revolution and if they had gotten 50 more years to become the entrenched mode of transportation the adoption of automobiles probably would have been less universal. So I just have to ask why they didn't even really make an appearance in the Lakeland Republic? On decent roads, even gravel ones, a person in decent shape can out pace a horse on a bicycle and with specialized cargo bikes they can haul as much as a single horse, although not as much as a cart. Also the upkeep and maintenance is much less and the time to be ready for a journey is almost nil. As someone who has had both horses and bikes I know which one I would choose in a future without cars.<br><br><a href=#c3643583272054203562 title="comment permalink">9/22/16, 6:24 AM</a><br><br>

It finally dawned on me that being the ambassador to Lakeland is one of the worst places to accomplish that. He’s way too far out of the loop. Lakeland is a good place to get ideas, but a lot of change happens at informal gatherings - dinners, parties, other events, and if you aren’t there, you don’t have the leverage. Carr will be a day’s travel away from where things get decided in the Atlantic Republic, and unless they put in something useful, like a fiber optic cable between Pittsburgh (or wherever the capital is) and Toledo, he’s not going to have the high-bandwidth communications that would be needed to be effective at that distance.<br><br>@brian floyd<br><br>That “unity of belief” thing doesn’t strike me as strange at all.

The way our minds are shaped to allow groups to unify around myths and to maintain social stability by defending the myths is a fascinating subject. First we can't comprehend ideas that challenge the accepted myth. Then when we understand them, we are instinctively opposed. And then... usually some people adopt the new ideas fragmenting the old social order and leaving intellectual feuds that take generations to be forgotten.

However, I need some advice on how to do this.<br>I see three different obstacles or three different trains of thought/belief in the Religion of Progress that any aspiring Carr has to deal with (first within himself):<br>1. Those like Pinker and Rossling who claim that Progress is right on schedule, violence is declining, population is stabilizing, wealth inequality is declining, literacy is on the rise, people are getting out of poverty, having more opportunities and a longer, healthier lifespan, and all the rich need to do is fly less airplanes to stabilize climate change. Pinker's book is not as quick to read as this video to watch by Rossling, which I hope you can comment on and help me debunk:https://vimeo.com/79878808. He did not mention peak oil, or any of the problems of the first world with unemployment, loss of community, loss of connection with the divine, loss of artistic autonomy at work, etc. This view is mostly held by salaried and investment class people, but also seemingly the rural and sometimes urban poor in the third world.<br>2. The view promulgated by the producers of the film Thrive, and people like Catherine Austin-Fitts, who claim that everything is not fine, but would be fine if only the Cabal that controls the world would be exposed, peak oil and climate change are part of their nefarious conspiracy to enforce scarcity on everyone else, and we need to stop the govt from their covert spending of over ten trillion dollars on a covert space program, give it over to private firms, and do a "debt for equity swap". Can you explain this "debt for equity swap"? And can you help me quickly debunk it and the covert space program conspiracy? This view is also mostly held by investment class, but also by some working class, like the local butcher here in rural Missouri.<br>3. The view of much of the working class in the developed countries that everything would be fine if we went back to the fifties or whatever era retrotopia. This is just a less sophisticated view than the one you are promoting, namely that the past is a resource to pick and choose from, as opposed to copied wholesale. My Amish neighbor, who welded an oil press for me, espouses this view. It is somewhat myopic in that it fully embraces industrialization, but does not look at its dark side (unlike the people of Omelas, who are well aware of it) because it happens mostly somewhere else, and the connections to what happens at home are not seen (the Amish do have some safeguards for this though, with the prohibition of using power tools and electricity at home, and not owning cars, but they use them at work and employ people to drive them).<br><br>I sometimes feel like this is a hopeless task, to convince enough people to try de-industrialization (or limited scale industrialization) on a national or even bio-regional scale. Which makes me want to walk away from Omelas, not to feel morally superior, but to have a chance to try a new approach with less interference from the mainstream culture. This approach has much evolutionary theory and history to recommend it.

A friend of mine just embarked on a project to recreate vintage style 2-man crosscut saws for use on trail work. Apparently the old ones are rusted out or have been turned in to art in casual dining restaurants, and the new ones availible are simulcrums of the real working saws of old. Across from me is a shop that rebuilds old motorcycles from the 1950's ( not a technology I would choose to bring back) as an alternative to plasticy new ones. Young people are making cast iron pans, axes and forgotten garden tools. I think that there is a growing awareness that many old ways of doing things are better or more satisfying. But, it still all runs aground when it comes ot cell phones and internet connectivity.

There are definitely some things with negative returns that get developed in Linux. The thing is that technological choice isn't considered a heresy in Linux, so everyone who doesn't like something that gets developed just doesn't use it, and there's lots of official support to make choosing something "older" easy. <br><br>The other thing is that the vast majority of important parts commonly used in Linux systems actually got to a point where further "development" wasn't helpful, and the developers were smart enough to stop changing things, so they're basically the same as they were ten, twenty, or thirty years ago. New updates still come out for these things, but mostly that's just a matter of writing in support for new technologies, which usually means finding ways around the latest round of hardware "innovation" so that the old software still works (I'm looking at you, UEFI). <br><br>Most Linux users are just as much believers in Progress as anyone else, so it's interesting to speculate on why Linux avoids the usual pitfalls. I think one reason is that the culture of Linux sees using older systems for fun as a badge of pride, so even younger Linux users--me, for example--have experience with how older systems work and don't see them in boogey man terms. Another reason is that the GNU approach to software has a built-in focus on encouraging dissensus and active choice, so anything new has to contend with older alternatives in a Darwinian environment, rather than being accepted as better automatically.<br><br><a href=#c7697111225552534081 title="comment permalink">9/22/16, 9:04 AM</a><br><br>

I doubt you're in much of a mind to change anything during the fixup for publication as a book, but I'd like to suggest something anyway, with respect. <br><br>Throughout this book I was bothered by the question of who Peter Carr is writing to. He's writing this as a first person narrative, and he's writing at some point after the events he describes. But who is the narrative addressed to, and when is he writing it? I came to the conclusion that he ought to be addressing it to the new government of the Atlantic Republic. He's writing it on the train; the narrative ends as he settles into his seat and presumably opens whatever writing device he uses, to begin the task of bringing up his notes and framing his memorandum. This report is, in itself, the first step in his newly adopted project to serve and assist his own nation by helping to bring it to its senses. Clearly there are some things in here that wouldn't be in a formal report to a government: but this is the private version for Ellen Montrose, with whom Peter has a close relationship and who would, perhaps, need to know what her deputy had been up to in Lakeland. <br><br>This would require some revision to those parts of the narrative that explain, for the reader's benefit, the recent history of the eastern half of North America, but I don't think the changes would be all that difficult to manage, as most of it could be re-phrased as Peter's reflections on his new experiences. I feel this would add a layer of richness to the story by indicating, throughout, the relationship he has with the woman who employs him, as well as to the several women he interacts with in Lakeland. Such a frame would not detract much from the immediacy of a compelling potboiler narrative -- simply because your narrative is not designed as a compelling potboiler. So, I've said my piece.

Walden Two has the outsider WALK back to Walden Two, implying leaving the old world behind by leaving the car behind, and while Bellamy's Looking Backward Utopia having a time machine would be a bit problematic the Victorian "Visitor" character there voluntarily does a long, total and humiliating (to him) apology to the woman whom he has fallen in love with as a replacement for actually choosing to walk away from his life.<br><br>In Atlas Shrugged the trope is subverted (in the Galt's Gulch section of the book) by having Dagney loving her railroad more than the Ideal Society she barged into (and, as it turned out, by Galt loving Dagney more than the society he built up), and in The Island the choice is made moot by a neighboring junta invading for oil (at the exact time where the Outsider would have normally made his choice for the Utopia, as it turns out). Your subversion is in having him being an honorable man – and in him taking a bet and sticking with it. <br><br>I find it interesting that, in this case the trope subversions seem to be more true-to-life than the trope being played straight. It's as if the Utopias seem to wish to be so overwhelming that they overcome the Outsider's past lives and sense of responsibility.<br><br>(and, as a side thought, what is Carr's Marital Status?

This line was built in 1924 and serves the Brooklyn Neighborhoods of Willamsburg, Greenpoint and beyond. It will be closed for 1.5 years to fix damage done to the tunnel under the east river by hurricane Sandy. This old school subway line carries 400,000 people per day under the river to manhatten. At present the MTA and other authorities have no answer to how all these people will cross the river everyday. No modern transportation technology has near the capacity given the time frame and location. A three lane bridge with single occupant cars can only carry 5000 people an hour, and the existing bridges are at capacity. Even buses don't help much given the space needed to load and unload at each end. All of the "modern" improvements we think we have made to transportation over the years from cars to helicopters won't help with this problem. Logically the only thing that could carry the same number of people as the old subway would be to take all of the cars off one of the bridges and completley turn it over to even older technologies, ( walking and bikes). Or perhaps this is a lesson in the unsuitability of large crowded cities when the mid tier technoloy of subways begins to fail. <br><br>Interesting side note, the landlords in Williamsburg are trying to trick and intimidate tennents in Williamsburg to sign very long leases so they can't move away when the L train is shut down.<br><br><a href=#c3004676132178253375 title="comment permalink">9/22/16, 9:30 AM</a><br><br>

Yes, I could happily go there; rationing of food and clothes, no car, no TV and a lot else. It didn’t seem so bad.<br><br>Then I realised a couple of things. Foremost, was the fact that our per capita energy use from fossil fuel was enormous even then, Britain ran on coal and on imported essential food. Petroleum in my young days was still a minor albeit already essential part of our economy. The petroleum age has since from the 1950s meant a much larger reliance on fossil fuel, although it has certainly not doubled it. In per capita numbers we each use only about 50% more energy in total than was used here even as far back as 1900.<br><br>This first thought brought another one to mind in its wake. Our family did quite well, though it seemed, to mum and dad at least, meagre enough at times. For others though it was a much harder time despite the country supposedly adopting a wartime ‘fair share’ philosophy. <br><br>What then can I imagine these days? Your writing latterly has helped my thinking even though you write from a differently placed country. William Morris? Yes I remember him and could go there. There are some writers like Morris that I read in my childhood and young adult life who help. LTC Rolt, an engineer who in the 50s and 60s helped save the by then redundant British canal system from total dereliction, also wrote movingly of how ‘we’ might have done better for the previous agrarian population at the beginning of the 19thC (<i>‘High Horse Riderless’</i>). Although increased agricultural production was done on the back of pauperising the rural population, by mid 19th Century about a fifth of our population fed the then total of 17 millions in England. This was before British agriculture had even begun to be mechanised using petroleum and essentially before modern fertilisers. <br><br>Reading your words and looking back makes me wonder if we might have done better with what we had in the past given what we know now. My grandparents and even my parents would have been immensely reassured with a very modest sufficiency, however pitiful it might look by today’s reckoning. Such could have seemed like Utopia in their eyes. Smile. This country, however, with its large urban population and relatively small cultivated area is still going to have to trade for its essentials, of course, for the foreseeable future for our grandchildren.<br><br>best<br>Phil H <br><br><br><a href=#c432033059022600636 title="comment permalink">9/22/16, 10:52 AM</a><br><br>

That stepping off from the point of retrovation, it's possible to take a suite of technologies whose potential still hasn't been explored to its full, and exploring a completely different line of growth. I've occasionally tried to imagine what modern technologies might have looked like, for instance, had the fuel sources and scientific principals that paved the way for the innovations leading to automation and electronics in our society been invented by the ancient Romans, with their technology built around pressurized hydraulics, rather than early modern Europeans centered on clockwork and gears... or any other point of divergence where progress could have taken one path, but took another instead. The difference between human technology, and biological evolution, though, is that technically have the option of doing a little more than just wondering in a train of whimsy how things might have been different had our earliest ancestors had bellybones instead of backbones… There are thousands of rejected points of divergent along the road of progress from which society could have progressed in other directions, you pointed out in this essay the way that in the ‘70s, the ecotopia vision was in fact a path of progress forward… one of the things that’s suggested here, then, is that the problem isn’t even the idea of progress on its own, but the myth that progress has to take the form of a linear progression from the wheel to the warp drive, or from Hammurabi’s Code to the Federation of Planets. It seems related then, to the popular misunderstanding of evolution as a ladder, when it’s more properly viewed as a tree… or to the mentality behind the popular fallacy people who don’t understand evolution commit when they ask the question “if humans evolved from apes, why are there still apes?” In addition to the idea that progress must mean “getting better” what also seems necessary is an understanding that progress (in the moving forward along a path) sense, has a shape much more similar to biological evolution, with one major difference… you can actually move around on the tree, go back to a point of divergence and tease it along a different path, and find new things by doing that. Even if you were someone who completely denied that resource restraints featured at all as a limiting factor in just how far human progress could go… The degree to which the linear approach to progress diminishes its potentials should be obvious, and yet it isn’t.<br><br>One silly example, but I think a telling one, is our reaction to older visions of the future… such as the ‘50s science fiction films that involve techno-utopian star trek visions of the future, but still include analog computers. We usually laugh at the old computers, but it could be seen as much more telling that a half century ago, their failure to incorporate the “information age” into their technological fantasies reveals not a mere lack of foresight, but a society that didn’t see advances in information technology interesting or desirable enough to feature them into their future visions (unless you were writing a dystopian narrative about the media like Ray Bradbury, in which case modern information technology was predicted to the last detail… which also says something…).<br><br>That’s territory we’ve touched on briefly. But there’s more there I think… that idea that once you embrace retrovation, it also allows unexplored potential of technologies, ideas, etc. from a different age to be handled by different minds, employed in new ways, and carried along its own trajectory separate from what the original cultures used it for or thought of using it for… If retrovation is what we call going back and turning around, I’m not sure what you’d call going back, turning around, finding the nearest intersection and taking a different road entirely.<br><br><br><a href=#c7296345135028202107 title="comment permalink">9/22/16, 11:18 AM</a><br><br>

A helpful explanatory, errr, retrospective (so to speak ;-) on the tale of Retrotopia. I'd already begun figuring out how to apply this lovely notion of retrovation to my own life - takes some navigation, but getting better as I go, umm, 'forward' (sideways? off-kilter? catawampus?). Wow, so many of our figures of speech take their meanings from the 'progress' narrative don't they? <br><br>And hmmm....perhaps that something that could find it's way into stories like Retrotopia - as the cultural narratives change, so does the vernacular. It would be quite fun to hold a contest to generate NEW figures of speech whose meaning derives from a culture where retrovation was the rule! Could be downright hilarious, in fact...<br><br>Regarding this:<br><br>"It’s stunningly well written but evades a crucial question: does walking away do anything to change the situation, or does it just let the ones who walk away from Omelas feel morally superior?"<br><br>I want to echo Picador's thinking here, with which I agree: <br><br>...or does it matter what they do after they've walked away? I would argue that if one becomes convinced that a deeply pernicious system is past saving, past reforming, leading to a desire and intention to 'do it better' elsewhere, this is not only sensible but ethical. Perhaps that's why, as Le Guin puts it "they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas."<br><br>Applied to our current situation, it seems to me that walking away from Aciremasu, if the goal is to establish oneself as a part of a culture that still believes in and practices both community and (hat tip Fleming) carnival, with the intention to help *that* community to prosper to whatever extent they can - perhaps by bringing the appropriate tech toolkit along and looking seriously for applications a la Gaviotas - would be an entirely ethical and indeed arguably a more practical response.<br><br><a href=#c6649408482291182831 title="comment permalink">9/22/16, 11:48 AM</a><br><br>

Obviously, the main fork is between revolvers and semi-automatic pistols. The semi-automatic is used by practically every military and police unit for "duty guns," so many people are trained in their use and prefer them as a default. Duty guns are generally high-capacity; 15 to 17 rounds in a magazine is common, and of course they are easier to reload with minimal practice.<br><br>The disadvantages are that semiautomatics are not nearly as reliable as revolvers, and can be disabled just by pushing on the muzzle if the combatants are in grappling range. Whenever you see a drama with someone pressing a semiautomatic pistol into contact with their foe, that's just faking or incompetence on the part of the technical adviser to the production. When the slide on a semiautomatic is pushed back just a fraction of an inch, the pistol is "out of battery" and will not fire. <br><br>A revolver does not have this problem at all. A person in close contact *might* be able to get a revolver not to fire by gripping the cylinder strongly or, if there is a hammer, by by getting a finger between the hammer and the body of the gun. Just pushing on the muzzle absolutely will not work.<br><br>For a semiauto, shooters are regularly advised to run several hundred rounds of the specific ammunition they plan to carry through their pistol, just to be sure it will work reliably. The shape of the nose of a particular bullet may create a tendency to hang up on the barrel's feed ramp, causing a misfeed. The case of a particular brand of ammunition may have a tendency to get stuck in the chamber, causing a failure to extract; i.e., a failure to load the next round.<br><br>The primers in a given brand may not go off reliably with a particular firing pin / set of internal springs. With a double-action pistol, the shooter can get a second strike at a reluctant primer, and that may or may not be successful. With a pistol lacking this sort of double action - most of the striker-fired sort - the round has to be manually exected and the next round manually fed into the chamber before another shot is possible. Of course, if you really need that next shot right now, you may be dead before you finish this manual procedure.<br><br>With a revolver, once a round is put into the cylinder when the gun is being loaded, there's no such thing as a failure to feed. If a round fits in the cylinder, there's no further concern about the shape of the bullet's nose. If the primer is bad on a particular round, simply pulling the trigger brings up the next round; no jamming, no special procedure for fixing it.<br><br>This does not mean that revolvers are 100% reliable, of course. It just maens that revlovers will not fail for for many of the common reasons a semiautomatic pistol will fail. And when it comes to "pocket guns" (concealable weapons), the smaller size required means that many popular semiautomatics in thes category have little or no advantage in terms of the number of rounds they can hold.<br><br>Consequently, revolvers, which were the technology of choice for the 19th Century, are still useful for many purposes in the 21st. Also as a consequence, we can find the "religion of progress" type of arguments for semiautomatics on YouTube gun channels, shooting magazines, gun nut internet forums, etc. You might want to work some examples of this into future writing when the plot involves pistols in some way.<br><br><a href=#c2178859323415595624 title="comment permalink">9/22/16, 12:09 PM</a><br><br>

From the 1880s on bicycles were the original transportation revolution and if they had gotten 50 more years to become the entrenched mode of transportation the adoption of automobiles probably would have been less universal. So I just have to ask why they didn't even really make an appearance in the Lakeland Republic? On decent roads, even gravel ones, a person in decent shape can out pace a horse on a bicycle and with specialized cargo bikes they can haul as much as a single horse, although not as much as a cart. Also the upkeep and maintenance is much less and the time to be ready for a journey is almost nil. As someone who has had both horses and bikes I know which one I would choose in a future without cars."<br><br>Our host has addressed this elsewhere. The short answer is that he has no personal interest in bicycles. He has also mentioned a limit on steel, but given that he has trains, trams, _some_ trucks, tractors and a _very few_ cars; and that a bicycle requires two orders of magnitude less material (30 v.s. 3000 lbs) than a small car, the steel shortage is not a good reason to me. The in story reason is that most cities were destroyed in the Second Civil War, and rebuilt as practical, compact, walkable cities. Being a regular cyclist myself, I'd still rather live in a walkable city than one which requires a bike.<br><br>To address your points, in the late 19th century the safety bicycle (what we think of as normal) was described as "the poor man's steed" for the reasons you stated. The biggest was that it required no land for pasturage, and was useful to the landless! But I don't know if anyone's done the math to see how much the bicycle depended on a coal driven industrial system. Mind you, a frame can go a century or more, I replace my bearings about once a decade, pedals every five years and rubber every year or two.<br><br>In story, I see bicycles as most useful to rural people; even to your cargo hauling scenario; but primarily as a transition technology until the variety and numbers of horses and other draft breeds can be re-established. Spending his visit primarily in Toledo, Mr. Carr would not have seen this. The other two obvious uses are bicycle dragoons in the army, and city messengers for parcels, light freight and take out deliveries.<br><br>Glenn<br><br>in the Bramblepatch<br>Marrowstone Island<br>Salish Sea<br>Cascadia<br><br><a href=#c3597585972652520333 title="comment permalink">9/22/16, 12:50 PM</a><br><br>

While Retrotopia was obviously not intended as a mindless escape from the realities of today's intersecting (and mounting) crises, it had - to some extent - become that for me. Fro while the people of the Lakeland Republic no doubt work hard to make a living, they are on the far side of the immensely grueling and painful work the next half century will entail. The relief comes because every Wednesday evening for the past year, I was usually disappointed when the posts took a break from fiction and forced me to dump my head in the cold water of 2016 Collapse Reality. Obviously, one of the major themes of this blog is the necessity of direct and honest confrontation with the truth, and the terrifying consequences of head-in-the-sand or head-in-the-clouds denial. But, I still took comfort in the possibility that a sane, sustainable, livable world might still be possible in my children's lifetime, however divorced from the facts that belief actually is. Since I knew the story had ended, I anticipated this blog discussing the U.S. election, Venezuela, Syria, or some other massively depressing topic; so, thanks JMG, for easing us back into reality gently! Bonus irony: I usually read this blog on an aging laptop sold by a very large company based in Cupertino, but was forced to use a backup computer, as that device was spending the better part of 8 hours "upgrading" itself to be shinier, more confusing, less reliable, and so forth.

(It's also the one tolerably realistic portrayal of how anarchosyndicalism would work in practice, warts and all, that I've ever seen.)

Glad to hear it. <br><br>Ganv, thank you. I've been around long enough to watch this process happen many times. <br><br>Dan, my guess is that the internet, and internet culture, will die the death of a thousand cuts. Costs will rise, functionality will decrease, internet crime will become more and more pervasive, the poorer regions of the country will begin to lose access, until fifty years from now the internet is a rich person's toy, while the rest of us have gone onto something more useful. <br><br>Kayr, of course those are still issues in the Lakeland Republic. A hundred years ago in the US, the standard approach was for each county to have one or more large farms where the mentally ill and developmentally disabled (who were not well differentiated from one another in those days) got a clean bed, three square meals a day, and the other requirements and basic comforts of life. Those who could help with the farm work, housework, etc. were encouraged to do so, to the extent of their ability; of course there were problems, and county farms varied in how well they were run, but the system as a whole seemed to work well. Substance abuse was by and large treated as a medical and moral issue rather than a legal one, and that also worked much better than our current system. I'm exploring ways to weave this into the story, for what it's worth. <br><br>Iuval, you can't convince them. It's exactly like trying to convince a devout fundamentalist that the world wasn't created in 4004 BC; if your arguments conflict with their beliefs, they'll simply find counterarguments, because they believe the object of their faith is true in a sense that transcends argument. Instead of trying to convince them, get out there and live a more interesting life. <br><br>RandomQuestionGuy, I'm glad you brought this up earlier in the comment thread, while I still have time to respond. Nuclear weapons are very effective defensive weapons -- if you have them, nobody's going to push you too far -- but they're hugely expensive to build and maintain, and their uses in offensive war are very limited. In the future I've sketched out, none of the North American republics kept them -- they were all turned into nuclear fuel and sold to countries with nuclear reactors as a source of hard cash -- and that, as you've observed, is why a hot war between Texas and the Confederacy is an option. Really, if you're not either trying to maintain a global military hegemony or oppose some other country's hegemony, they're not worth the cost. <br><br>Could one of the few remaining nuclear powers in 2065 threaten the Lakeland Republic with nukes? Sure, but think about the consequences. Every other nation that thought the nuclear power might threaten them would immediately rush out and build some nukes in self-defense, making the entire world much less safe for the nuclear power. It's much less self-defeating for the nuclear power to keep its nukes purely for deterring the other nuclear powers, and to project force in conventional ways. <br><br>Peter VE, excellent. Do you know how to use the slide rule? <br><br>Thymia10, personally, I loathed "The Fifth Sacred Thing." It was such an over-the-top display of San Francisco's patented holier-than-thou arrogance! As for a Lakeland-style railroad system, or even one of European quality, I'd love to see that here in the US.

"Treasure trove" is one of the things the word is meant to evoke, of course. <br><br>Clay, all in good time. My guess is that as cell phone and internet coverage start to become wobbly, citizens band radios will be the entry drug that gets people intrigued by less overwhelmingly centralized modes of communication. Ham radio is already starting to get a foothold at Maker faires, so the foundation's being laid. <br><br>Picador, okay, let's take the antebellum South as an example. From where I'm sitting right now I can see the spire of Emmanuel Episcopalian Church, which was built well before the Civil War. In those days, that spire was a major landmark on the Underground Railroad, the secret network that smuggled escaped slaves to freedom. Maryland was a slave state in those days, but up here in the mountains, abolitionist sentiment ran high. The sexton of the church, a free African-American man, was an important figure on the Railroad; he'd welcome escaped slaves and their conductors when they crossed the river from Virginia (these days, West Virginia), hide them in the crypt of the church, make sure they had food, water, and anything else they needed, and then smuggle them on board hay wagons and the like for the last leg of the journey to Pennsylvania and freedom. He did this with the enthusiastic support of the rector and the congregation, by the way -- and his great-granddaughter is a member of the congregation today. <br><br>So tell me this: who was morally superior -- the people in the slave states who stayed put and participated in the Underground Railroad, or the people who moved to Boston and talked about how horrible slavery was, all the while wearing clothes made from cotton that was grown by slaves? <br><br>Alexander, for the heretic who doubts progress, the F-35 Lardbucket is the gift that just keeps on giving! <br><br>Yucca, the fact that the developers recognized that it was time to stop changing things is a very good thing to hear. I may yet try Linux one of these days. <br><br>Shark, first person narrative fiction is a literary form; sometimes it's done as though the narrator is actually addressing someone else in the fictive world, and sometimes that's not done. I chose the latter, simply because it fit the story better and allowed Carr to talk about things that would be interesting to today's readers but common knowledge in 2065. It's a worthwhile question to raise, though. <br><br>Donald, you're right, of course -- and that's an even better reason to overturn the convention. <br><br>Clay, that's a good one. Thank you. <br><br>Susan, I saw those but never read them. I can handle misandry in science fiction -- I enjoy Sheri Tepper's novels, even though so many of them circle around the idea that testosterone is the Original Sin -- but the Charnas novels seemed kind of over the top. <br><br>Ol' Bab, Dark Mountain is seriously cool and I'm glad to have had some essays of mine accepted by them.<br><br><a href=#c5610759344866715603 title="comment permalink">9/22/16, 7:36 PM</a><br><br>

Britain's going to be in a world of hurt no matter what happens -- too many people on a very small island -- but the strategies that helped during both World Wars might be a good way to minimize the suffering. <br><br>Bruce, I hear stories like that all the time. I also hear stories about people who go out of their way to make sure that some bit of knowledge from the past doesn't get lost -- so there's a way to make a difference. <br><br>Eric, good. Of course that's also an issue, and it's something that I'll be exploring in much more detail as we proceed. <br><br>Cathy, I've been wrestling with this same issue regarding a science fiction story I'm working on. It deals with an intelligent species that's millions of years older than ours, passed through their age of scientific and technological discovery about two million years back, learned everything that can be learned by scientific methods and figured out every technology that was available to them given the resources on their planet, and then ran out of experiments to run and technologies to discover. Imagining a postscientific culture like that, in which all the answers to questions about nature have been known since practically forever, has been a real education in the extent to which fantasies of progress color all our assumptions. <br><br>Donalfagan, you may well be right. <br><br>Gwizard, but in that case you're not just walking away, you're walking toward something. As I suggested implicitly to Picador earlier, you might also want to make sure that the place you're walking toward doesn't depend on the thing you're walking away from, the way that so many allegedly "green" alternatives depend on continued extraction and burning of fossil fuels. <br><br>Art, fascinating.

The downsides of progress are right here, right now, not off in some nebulous future, the way that worshippers of progress like to think. (I have a family member who's been in a wheelchair for decades, by the way, and if I showed him your comments I'm pretty sure he'd describe them as "pity porn;" that's certainly the term that disabled people I know generally use when others try to use their condition to score points in an argument.

Finally, even if we didn't, it may also be the case that learning all about everything may not be enough to take us out of our current predicament - for example, what if the only way to have cheap and virtually limitless energy such as fusion is having a mass core the size of a star?

If you want someone to believe something, in other words, you've got to start by making him or her want to believe it; that was one of the motivations behind <i>Retrotopia</i>, of course. <br><br>Shane, and if I flee from a civil war, I won't feel morally superior for doing so. I'll be doing it out of a desire to keep my wife and myself safe -- a country in a state of civil war is no place for an aging couple, one of whom has chronic health problems and special dietary needs, and the other of whom is not as spry as he once was! If I may mix literary metaphors, there's an important difference between walking away from Omelas and walking away from the City of Destruction...<br><br>Bruno, exactly! First, not all questions can be answered by scientific methods; second, not all questions that could be answered by scientific methods in theory can be so answered in practice (i.e., if your experiment requires conditions that can't be provided, for practical or economic reasons, it's never going to be done); third, not all scientific discoveries produce useful technologies, and many of the results of scientific research amount to "you can't do that." So a species old enough to have passed through its era of scientific and technological progress won't be omnipotent; their technology might even be simpler than ours, as they'll have learned that certain technologies are too destructive to use; and since they don't labor under the burden of blind faith in progress, their technologies will be a (to us) bizarre mix of simple and sophisticated, high-tech, middle-tech, and low-tech, depending partly on fashion but primarily on what works best.<br><br><a href=#c6808693624287138268 title="comment permalink">9/22/16, 11:18 PM</a><br><br>

I see coming a new fall into the turmoil of a collapsed empire. I see street gangs becoming ever more common big and organized. Eventually winning the support of the local people vs a state serving only the elites, ever weaker smaller and more vicius in its attempts to maintain an order. I see commerce and trade breaking down.. ensuing hunger diseases and fights while communities try to get organized at an ever smaller level. State fails .. then cities which depend on the regular arrival of supplies. Eventually only villages start to become viable.. the ones near corporation centers which have the resources to hire a small army to defend the intallations and the employees. Money ceases to circulate as food is the only thing of importance.<br>Like during the fall of the Roman Empire: Rome went from millions to 10000 inhabitants.

I'd be nice if some good came from it. I think it almost has to, merely because there's so much money and effort being poured into the industry - statistically *something* has got to come out of it that's worth saving... But I'm young and optimistic.<br><br>Also, it might interesting to mention that much of Retrotopia is actually currently daily life for me!<br><br>I live in the Netherlands, and we're probably the most technologically resilient country in Northwest Europe - our water purification mainly uses natural systems such as dunes, our waterways are all intact, we still produce wooden sailing ships and horse-drawn tugboats, all mayor cities are connected by rail, which is backwards-compatible with a reserve fleet of old-timey steam-powered locomotives. Even the old steam-powered pumping stations are kept functional, and have been used a few years back during a particularly viscous storm. In major cities public transport is pretty much the only way to go, via subways, tramlines and buses. Everyone I know owns at least one bicycle, and most use it daily. It's somewhat common to not own a car, and not unheard of to not even have a driver's license. We're also one of very few Western countries that could theoretically feed its own current population (though probably not without fertilizers).<br><br>We deal with adversity through humour - sarcastic humour is pretty much the national form of theatre. Gardening is a common hobby, every town has patches of land around it called 'people's garden' which can be rented for little to no money. The Dutch are frugal (or just cheap). Repairing items instead of buying new is tolerably common (but becoming less so).<br><br>So life feels quite retrotopian, because the Dutch never really did do away with things that worked. It's rather common to hang laundry outside to dry, hand tools are commonly used instead of power tools, and passed down, and so on. Frugal and practical.<br><br>The Netherlands, as it is now, might offer some Retrotopian inspiration!<br><br>I'm not sure how long it will all last, though. Being mostly below sea-level is admittedly a mayor drawback, although our current system of dikes and levees should be able to take another 4 meters of sea level rise before needing massive revision.<br>Of course, we have the same ineffectual government that most of the West seems to be stuck with, and we're slowly becoming more like the United States, with increasing wealth inequality, ever more cuts in our welfare system, less support for students, (their financing having been turned into a loan - which of course only deters new students from low income homes, which is tying education level to parental income level, and causing yet more inequality in the coming generation). Then there's the rapidly rising tide of intolerance and racism in society, and all the stuff that's been happening in France and Germany...<br><br>Gah, I had hoped to end this post on a bright note.<br><br>Err... I have neither a car nor a drivers licence, and it has never hindered me in the slightest. Growing your own food is both easy and not hindered by the government. There.

That way you could arrange a bunch of important "milestones of progress" in a sort of "confidence interval" that the spiral faithfully walks along. <br>In another panel you show all kinds of achievements (which we like to omit when taking the previous view) - many of which will be well outside of the path. <br>And perhaps in the next panel one would show how many civilization spawn and collapse (asymmetrically) in a much more bizarre and knotted manner (but perhaps a barely recognizable double helix?), and that one just knocked it out of the park once it started burning through fossil fuels. But even this one starts to shown the same pattern you see in so many other civilizations that eventually dropped back towards the stable and simple "center" of a much greater erratic path which is performed by coevolution of species.<br><br>By the way another nice representation of time can be done using your arm:<br>Earth begins at your shoulder, single celled life is there before you even get to the arm, photosynthesis starts well before the elbow, only a good bit behind your elbow you get multicellular (eukaryote) life, the Cambrian explosion of life happens roughly at the knuckle (also about 7°C above CE), dinosaurs are roughly the second half of your middle finger (up to the fingernail), and humans are a hair's breadth at the tip of the fingernail.

In other words, didn’t he have to invent his own Hand-Wavium technology to make it work?<br><br>Also, I seem to recall that organised sports had been banned in his future hippie-topia; like most writers of utopias, he assumed that all subcultures and hobbies he didn’t personally like would disappear. Tell me if I’m mis-remembering. <br><br>What amazes me about the myth of progress is that almost no one believes in it completely anymore; almost everyone has abandoned it in certain areas of life, but cling to it in others. Religious conservatives feebly protest progress in social and sexual culture, saying that the culture has gone too far down a blind alley, hating the natural order of life and letting humans play God, a course that will lead to our eventual downfall. Yet in economic and technological process those same people accept it unthinkingly as “the next step,” both inevitable and superior to anything that came before. <br><br>Likewise, I know many social liberals who renounce progress in technological arenas – say, feebly protesting the latest GMO crop or highway – and who say that we have destroyed Nature and allowed humans to play God, a course that will lead to our eventual downfall. Change the subject to the latest cultural trend, however, and they accept it unthinkingly as “the next step,” both inevitable and superior to anything that came before. <br><br>One last thing: when talking about science fiction trends past and present, do you feel that people have somewhat abandoned science fiction for fantasy? It seems like the popularity of Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones signifies an increasing attempt to imagine, if not exactly a future, a world without electricity or fossil fuels, with the potential to be great or terrible. <br><br><br><a href=#c4085422746895348945 title="comment permalink">9/23/16, 3:26 AM</a><br><br>

It is one we practice at the farm, and have since we started. As an engineer, we apply a sort of "Occams Razor" to things at the farm - all things being equal, the simplest solution is likely to be the best.<br><br>For us, large family numbers and a single septic tank would be problematic. The volume of wastewater would require additional field lines to spread the black water through the topsoil. Instead, we put in a gray water system, and routed all save the actual sewage to that. The result is less work, fewer problems, reduced solids to fill the septic and free water to irrigate a small patch of garden.<br><br>Solar water heating is just not enough to thoroughly clean dishes in the winter. Instead, we use the solar as a pre-heater and then run it thru natural gas heater for hot water. The result here is that we only need a 75 gallon propane tank filled each year instead of the 150 gallon we used to have in the early years. Boiling water to sanitize it has to be one of the most labor and time intensive tasks required to maintain cleanliness and reduce sickness.<br><br>Moving water is expensive, but required for most growing operations. Instead of firing up a gas engine, hooking the PTO on the tractor up to a pump, or (as strongly recommended by a huge number of people) installing a bunch of solar panels and batteries to drive an AC driven pump, well,... we went another way. We use a pair of 12V batteries with a solar charger to drive four 12VDC bilge pumps and move water daily in small increments. This is what the plants actually require, rather than periodic deluge then nothing. 12VDC batteries are ubiquitous, cheap and the solar charger was $30.<br><br>We do have satellite internet - in order to have phone service (cheaper than landline charges thru AT&amp;T these days) and an internet business presence. But no streaming TV as it is quite expensive, we don't have time and prefer other things (Skyrim and such are more fun to relax in than TV Land, and playing guitars is quite relaxing after a long day and a shower!)<br><br>The only reason many of these things are not common place is that there is a concerted sales push for everyone to use packaged solutions, and that most people are just too afraid of being wrong or making a mistake to experiment. I'm not sure when making mistakes and being wrong became socially criminal, but people sure look askance at us when we tell them we are trying something new. And funny thing, their recommendations are all the same - pre-packaged and pushed via the internet or other media as being "the only way" or the "most technically savvy" solution or simply being the "green solution". <br><br>I'll eventually put in a windmill, but the best use for one is still to fill a cistern rather than generate power - because batteries are hugely expensive and don't last for much more than a few years.<br><br>I applaud you for pushing the retrovation thing and coining the concept - but to be fair, it is nothing new. One trip to Haiti, Dominican Republic or other truly poor places and one can see it in action all around. When things are scarce, people adapt and re-purpose to reduce labor, complexity and costs - which is exactly what you are advocating here, albeit extended into governance and other areas. I hope you expand on this in future posts, as it is part and parcel of collapsing now to avoid the rush.<br><br><a href=#c5604917569247327945 title="comment permalink">9/23/16, 8:46 AM</a><br><br>

Today Retrovation seems so ripe in my little corner of experience! I'm hosting Shabbat dinner at my house later this evening and I've been impressed and heartened by how many people have said they are coming over, and the enthusiasm. Retrovation of course doesn't just examine and utilize technology, but also the treasures of cultural legacies. As I practice the prayers that were sung by so many generations of my ancestors it becomes obvious that an unintended consequence of the cult of Progress is the loss of tradition and culture, which, I have found and I am finding, are enormously important for me to feel fully embodied. I guess if I aspired to live as a robot in outer space embodiment would be an impediment, but since I like to garden, make ritual and drink wine with my friends in candlelight having a body is very helpful.<br><br>There is such an exciting world that opens when progress is recognized as a myth with destructive tendencies and that we have a plethora of established technologies, and cultural legacies that work better. As someone who likes to find things on the street, forage food, and dumpster dive it seems obvious that a strategy of salvage is much more practical than a strategy of innovation in a world with tightly constrained energy availability. By finding clothes in free piles I've spent less than $100 on garments in the past 3 years and my wardrobe is cute and practical. I've also found many books, stainless steel and enamel cooking pots, many with lids, cutting boards, mason jars etc. This salvage based logic is easily extrapolated onto the older technological forms that have been used with success in the west - they are for all intents and purposes in cardboard boxes on the sidewalk left open to the rain. Treasures right there waiting to be put back into use before the elements render them unworkable and they get tossed in history's dumpster and then, a little later, history's landfill.<br><br>I applaud you JMG, for finding such a balanced and nuanced alternative with Retrotopia which seems, as much as possible, to offer the best practical options of several worlds! With the reading of Retrotopia (I too want to buy the book so I can focus more fully than I can with screens) a little Retrotopia was made in my own imagination, a space where I can imagine something, in rich detail, beyond business as usual, progress, apocalypse, dystopia or ecotopia. What a precious gift! Again, many thanks.<br><br><a href=#c1939048728598082122 title="comment permalink">9/23/16, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

There are some older model semi-autos that are rugged and reliable, but if one wants to avoid issues with rounds not feeding, jamming, or stovepiping, go for a revolver.

Just <i>believe hard</i> when the preacher lays on hands and you will rise up from your wheelchair. Except instead of Jesus, it's Steve Jobs and Elizabeth Holmes we have to believe in harder so the lame can walk and the blind can see. And if it fails it's because some people didn't believe hard enough.<br><br>I don't mean this as a personal attack against him or her (though I will understand if this comment is not put through), and it's obvious that NS is very passionate about their belief in the (cue mid-20th century newsreel voice) "March of Progress", but it's a perfect illustration that referring to such beliefs as a religion is no hyperbolic figure of speech but an accurate assessment of today's cultural reality. If Progress weren't a deeply held religious belief, then people wouldn't feel so threatened when its core tenets are questioned. <br><br>Put another way: why is it that my voluntarily forgoing a TV and a smartphone is a step towards bringing back infant mortality? Why does that seem to offend people so deeply? There is no literal or logical connection between gadgets and infant mortality. The development of the Germ Theory of Disease had nothing to do with the development of the iPhone-- that is self-evidently true-- and we (both as individuals and collectively) have the power to pick and choose what technologies we use and retain. Yet we are told if we don't stand in line at the Apple store with the other supplicants awaiting the latest whizbang gewgaw from on high, that we are the reason children get sick and die.

A quick search suggests that in installation is <a href=https://jonworth.eu/ubuntu-and-linux-mint-first-steps-on-an-imac/ rel=nofollow>pretty standard</a>, with a possible <a href=http://askubuntu.com/questions/470153/no-wireless-when-install-14-04-on-macbook-pro/557871#557871 rel=nofollow>wifi fix</a> needed. If you know any Linux users in real life, then it'll take a couple hours and then you'll be good to go. If not, things are a little more complicated. The issue is that you will have to read a little documentation and learn how to do some more advanced computer things--I'd expect to spend a few hours to a few days, depending on your degree of computer ability now. If you're comfortable with that, then it'll be an adventure and not really too hard. Basically, you'll need to make a <a href=http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/burn-a-dvd-on-mac-osx rel=nofollow>dvd</a> or a <a href=http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx rel=nofollow>usb stick</a> that you can boot into. Once you do that, you can actually try Linux without committing to install it by booting that. If you do decide to install, the installers on most popular distributions are pretty simple, and things should work good, with the possibility of needing to run a <a href=http://askubuntu.com/questions/470153/no-wireless-when-install-14-04-on-macbook-pro/557871#557871 rel=nofollow>command or two</a> to get wifi working correctly. <br><br>As far as which type, Ubuntu and Linux Mint are the most popular and usually recommended for new Linux users. I don't know the snow leopard interface, other than what screenshots I see online. The Unity interface I mentioned is standard on <a href=http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop rel=nofollow>Ubuntu</a> and was supposed to be designed to "compete with Apple," so maybe you'll find it more congenial than most Linux users do. I'd recommend <a href=https://ubuntugnome.org/ rel=nofollow>Gnome Ubuntu</a> more, as Gnome was the interface people said was more "mac-like" back in 2008. <a href=https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php%22 rel=nofollow>Linux Mint</a> is what I personally put on new users' computers, but it's default set-up looks more like the classic versions of Windows. It can easily be reconfigured to look however you want, though. Linux Mint is a child of Ubuntu, so the Ubuntu commands I liked for in the wifi should work for either. <br><br>P.S.: If you're a computer expert and were just curious about my personal preferences, then I apologize for the step-by-step, and I personally run Slackware, the most retro of major distributions. And if you have html tags turned off, I apologize for all the links.<br><br><a href=#c999751850652416326 title="comment permalink">9/23/16, 11:03 AM</a><br><br>

At the end of the 90s, the socialist and green party won the elections in Germany and for a very short time, the replacement of NATO by a european structure with participation of russia was cleary on the table as well as the retreat of US nuclear missiles from Germany.

The only reply that comes to mind are the words of the immortal Eric Cartman: "It's all a bunch of tree-hugging hippy crap!"<br> <br> Apple computers has been mentioned a few times so I would recommend people read the article at http://www.fastcodesign.com/3053406/how-apple-is-giving-design-a-bad-name as a must-read in how good design can be corrupted by the marketing droids. Though not a Mac user, I can sympathize with them.<br><br>Re: genepaul said...<br> "While our mass culture wallows in the mental swampland created by the 'myth of progess', counter culturalists often seem to be swayed by the 'myth of wisdom'. In what possible scenario does "homo callidus" achieve the consciousness shift absolutely necessary for a shift towards a wiser and improved society? Declining polities double down on failed strategies rather than invent new ones. Decline is not a time of enlightened action, it is a time of desperation."<br> I think that you have already answered your own question here. Times of desperation are precisely when consciousness shifts will occur and the historical record bears this out. Greer's Lakeland Republic, for example, only came about because all the old political, economical, social and military structures had been swept from the board in a vicious civil war allowing new attitudinal changes to take place. If you want a historical example, Athenian democracy only came about in response to a fight against a local tyrant who brought in foreign troops to bulk up his rule.<br><br> As to the question brought up by Ursula K. LeGuin’s story "The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas" about whether walking away does anything to change the situation, or does it just let the ones who walk away from Omelas feel morally superior, there is a third possibility. After understanding that city's dark city, how could you live with people like that that are prepared to let that vileness continue. How would that change the way that you think about your friends and neighbours? How could you marry someone from there that has it in their heart to go along with it all? The strain of living there after that would be intolerable and you would have to bail for your own peace of mind.<br><br><a href=#c1635224008396419821 title="comment permalink">9/23/16, 5:10 PM</a><br><br>

Those are going to get a nonfiction post of their own in due time. As for "retrouver" et al., yes, I was thinking of that too, and of the "trouveres" or "finders" who launched the era of the troubadors. <br><br>Dorda, of course, and that's an uncomfortably likely future. Still, why not try to imagine alternatives and work for those, instead of just accepting a worst case scenario? <br><br>Brigyn, I've said for a long time that if Europe can get its act together, it stands to get through the approaching mess in much better shape than the US, precisely because so much of the built environment is still shaped by a pre-auto era, good train systems are still in place, etc. Rising sea levels won't help, especially in low-lying countries like yours, but then we're going to lose southern Florida in a few decades, too! <br><br>Brian, I haven't read Ecotopia in a long time; I don't remember the biodegradable handwavium, but it wouldn't surprise me. The fragmentation of the myth of progress -- yes, I see that a lot, and one of the reasons I took the time to deconstruct progress as a religious myth (in the most controversial series of posts this blog has hosted yet, btw) was precisely to point to the underlying pattern and try to help my readers to see it, not just bits of it. As for fantasy and science fiction, heck of a good question -- I'm not well tuned into pop culture these days. I know that in terms of book publication, both genres are in the doldrums, with a tiny fraction of the number of books per year being published as compared to the 1970s and 1980s; a lot of that is because both genres have been in deep ruts for a couple of decades (the interstellar-travel rut in SF, the Tolkien-clone rut in fantasy), but doubtless there are other factors as well. <br><br>Sylvia, wasn't that just a matter of getting somebody out of a city that was about to be destroyed? <br><br>Synthase, fair enough. <br><br>Mmorgue, hmm!

If enough people really begin to notice that "progress" these days means that things get worse, a range of productive possibilities come within reach. <br><br>Mister R., no question, I think we're in for a world-class pout. <br><br>Troy, exactly. You'll notice that NS's comments also had nothing to do with the theme of this post, and flatly refused to address the central point of the post, which is that technological progress is a source of problems as well as solutions, and at this point it's producing more of the former than the latter. That's par for the course with progress worshippers. I noted in <a href=../../2013/08/the-ritual-theater-of-progress.html rel=nofollow>a previous post</a> that defenders of progress have a script that they follow, as rigidly defined as a Christian passion play; they have their stereotyped arguments for progress, and they expect you to respond with an equally stereotyped set of arguments against progress, which they then overcome so that the blessings of the great god Progress will shine on us all. If you bring out an argument that's not part of the script -- for example, that technological progress has reached the point of negative returns, and harms more than it helps -- they don't respond to it; they give you a blank look, and return to their scripted lines, and if you keep on saying something that's not in the script they start yelling insults at you. How dare you deviate from the ritual drama! <br><br>That's what happened with NS. The argument s/he brought up is one of the standard ritual utterances of progress worshippers, and irrelevant to the point made by this week's post; when I tried to bring the conversation back to the subject of the post, NS simply reiterated the line, a little louder, with some pity porn added for the sake of the drama; when I once again attempted to return the discussion to the subject of the post, I got a tantrum, and s/he got banned. It's happened repeatedly here, and let's just say it hasn't given me a particularly high impression of the intellectual abilities of believers in progress. <br><br>Jon, hmm! I hadn't remembered that either. A very good point. <br><br>Christopher, exactly! I'm quite sure that the woman we saw whose oath of office ended "So help me Jesus my Lord and Savior" doesn't approve of same sex marriage, and the minister of the church where she spends Sunday mornings will not perform ceremonies for same sex couples -- but that's like other moral issues, something that sets believers in a given creed apart from "the world." A lot of Christians used to understand that, and I'm glad to say I know some who still do.<br><br><a href=#c8030575924401784435 title="comment permalink">9/23/16, 7:42 PM</a><br><br>

I recently had the pleasure of running across a website on <a href=http://www.solarsystemheritage.com/ rel=nofollow>the Old Solar System</a> -- basically, the solar system as science fiction imagined it, before space probes spoiled it all: canals on Mars, jungles on Venus, and so on -- arguing that since we're talking about imaginative literature anyway, why not write stories set in that alluring context? That's both attractive and eccentric enough to catch my interest, and I'm sketching out a series of short stories set on Mars the way it ought to have been: a gorgeous, arid, ancient world, inhabited by an intelligent species that's been civilized since long before your ancestors and mine came down out of the trees. As well as being great fun, it's an intriguing chance to think about what technology looks like when progress is a couple of million years in the past. I'll post something here when the stories start appearing. The working title for the first story, for what it's worth, is "Out of the Chattering Planet." <br><br>Thomas, you just rocked my world.

Anyone with experience in automation or just plain common sense realizes this is a technology frought with unrealized costs, complications and dramatic pitfalls but many see it as inevitable and beneficial. I find the support for autonomous motor cars the most startlying among those who have fully realized the huge downside of regular cars. People within the urban bike activist community have gained a fairly broad understanding of the many ways that private motor cars cost society, the earth, and the future much more than their benefits. But instead of this leading them to the understanding found in your Retrotopia series, it leads many of them to view the solution as electric self driving cars. But at least its an area people can still discuss rationaly.<br><br><a href=#c3229354569212195823 title="comment permalink">9/24/16, 9:32 AM</a><br><br>

Here's a "map" of plastics, circa 1940, and notice the left side of things – "Resins," "Lignin," "Rubber" and "Cellulose;" all from plants.<br><br><a href=http://excessmemory.blogspot.com/2010/06/synthetica-new-continent-of-plastics.html rel=nofollow>Synthetica, a New Continent of Plastics</a><br><br>And on the anecdotal side: An older friend of mine talked about having a doll that eventually fell apart and rotted. When it started falling apart, she would act like it got cut and put a band-aid over the cracks. She also intimated that the doll was a hand-me-down from the 1930s, and thus it likely was made out of cheap, wood-based plastics.<br><br>So Ecotopia's throwaway plastics – hardly inconceivable (although handwavium was invoked by using special "keys" inputted into the plastic – how they'd make sure that these special "keys" would only land on the outside surface, and only activate after the contents within were used up, is a curious question at best that PROBABLY involved lots of technology). More interesting to me, however, was that Callenback went on to depict that there was a movement to do away with plastics altogether – and that the movement looked to be succeeding.<br><br>Sort of like the movement in Retrotopia to move from level 5 to level 1 in the level of services maintained (and, thus, taxes charged) by the local governments.<br><br><a href=#c888809245061861033 title="comment permalink">9/24/16, 4:08 PM</a><br><br>

The Black Death also helped out too, but it did not teach anyone how to make a stone arch or an aqueduct.<br><br>I can actually see a possibility of a modern day "rediscovery" of ancient (i.e. obsolete) computer equipment made in the early 90's by Apple Computer, in which all components were made by the same company and came with a lifetime warranty because they were so well built that they just kept working and working and working. I still use them to do my genealogy work, and they last longer than modern gadgets do.<br><br>They may not give us an "internet", but who needs that? Their main function was to help make the process of writing, designing, and higher math more efficient by not wasting materials on physical models when they could be simulated by cheap electrons.

My laptop uses a 33 MHz processor and does just fine for most work I need done.<br><br>I also see a definite "reawakening" of the importance of horse drawn wagons, farm equipment, and other transportation provided by "horse power".

Because, if you're in the car, ironically, things seem to slow down. You're comfy, the heat is on keeping the blizzard outside at bay, your standard music channel is playing familiar songs. The sound of the engine and the rumble in your seat tell you that time is passing in a familiar way. There might be some in the car who notice (as you have) that the tank is running empty, but for most of us, everything feels copacetic. Never mind that the car isn't really going anywhere. (For example, How long will it take for the S&amp;P to double again? It seems outrageous, yet back when the car was on the road, we could celebrate the S&amp;P doubling every decade or so.) People call this the "New Normal." But your analogy is so much better. It's different even than a "Calm before the storm." It's something else. A kind of cozy purgatory. Putting solar panels on the roof feels bit like looking through the glove box for some fast food napkins to stuff in the thin sweatshirt we're all wearing as insulation against the cold that will come when the engine dies from lack of fuel. But that's a bit off still, or maybe the catch in the engine is audible. Even so, when the engine cuts out entirely, the car will still be warm for a little while, and at least out of the wind.

Such long term thought is rare nowadays and I was really pleased to have met the engineers and tech people there. Plus they showed me a prototype design for how I can channel the excess electrical energy I have here which is currently being wasted for most of the year, into heating hot water for the house. And they used stainless steel in the device too which sang to my heart! Such great people.<br><br>And then because no good deed goes unpunished, a new neighbour more or less implied to me that I'm a bad person for using local firewood from the forest here to heat the house. I do thank the trees you know in a formal ceremony before felling them. The guy then went on to explain that he was flying out to another country soon. It was about that point that I realised that we are really fighting a rear guard action here...<br><br>My sensibilities are turning more hillbilly with each passing year.

You think our educational system is dysfunctional and that there are limits to what one can do to reform it at this point. Similarly, you have expressed your disgust with the recent library trends, and have suggested it might be wise for librarians who care about about their profession to set up alternatives such as subscription libraries that value a large and diverse collection of books. Now, I too (more or less) agree with you, but I'm curious, do you see these efforts as "walking away" instead of changing the situation for the large majority still stuck in or dependent on public schools and libraries? <br><br>In many facets of my own life I have often struggled with this dilemma: to what the extent do I engage (as subversively as I can) within mainstream dysfunctional systems versus try to "walk away" and work on alternatives outside the system? Granted, the answer is not always as simplistic as that. I find it may not be an either/or choice; sometimes it makes sense to simultaneously work both within and outside of mainstream systems. <br><br>Perhaps I'm interpreting your question in a different way than you were implying. "Walking away" may have different meanings. There is a difference between "walking away" that involves completely abandoning your location (i.e. someone against slavery leaving the South to move to the North to absolve one's guilt, or Carr, if he were to permanently leave the Atlantic Republic) versus staying within one's environment but still metaphorically "walking away" from dysfunctional systems and working on alternatives within the same environment...<br><br><a href=#c4765481155622611881 title="comment permalink">9/25/16, 8:12 AM</a><br><br>

I agree that revolvers are better for self-defense than semiautos for most folk. But most folk aren't buying guns for self-defense - they're buying guns because they like shooting at stuff, aka plinking. Semiautos let you shoot and shoot and shoot some more, and reloading is fast."<br><br>The devil is in the details. A shotgun has more oomph than most pistols. A pistol leaves one hand free to bar the door, dial 911 or draw the pepper spray. One advantage of a revolver is whoever it is pointed at can see the bullets in four of the chambers; this can have a deterring effect. I prefer autos, but having been trained in the service, it's a matter of what I'm used to. I have a very large friend with a preference for bulldog snubbies, and far more gun experience than me. In discussions he says, "any service caliber is adequate if you're in practice; and use the gun you're most comfortable with".<br><br>In the revolver v.s. auto debate, service grade pistols such as the Colt 1911 or Beretta M92 are both quite reliable. Very expensive autos, made to tight tolerances and designed to be quite accurate at longer range do indeed require breaking in, and tend to have feeding difficulties. I never had a failure in the service, but we were using full metal jacket, which feeds well. It is primarily hollowpoints that have problems; as they are popular self defense rounds, I wouldn't combine them with a high end auto!<br><br>Captain Nemo said "steel is surer than lead." None the less, guns have superseded swords, and autos have superseded revolvers; both for military and police uses. For an individual, who is more likely to be in a short confrontation, that probably just involves intimidation, or at most a few rounds, revolvers make sense. My take is that you use what's most comfortable to you. And practice; a lot, regardless of type of weapon or no weapons, there is no substitute for planning and practice.<br><br>Glenn<br>in the Bramblepatch<br>Marrowstone Island<br>Salish Sea<br>Cascadia<br><br><a href=#c3647048798960900467 title="comment permalink">9/25/16, 10:35 AM</a><br><br>

My argument is that vacuum tubes waste a great amount of energy, and are guaranteed to wear out, so they should be avoided. His argument (if I recall correctly) is that it takes a lower level of technology to fabricate new vacuum tubes than new transistors, so a vacuum-tube supply chain is more sustainable in the long run. We agree that there's a vast amount of salvageable electronics (both solid-state and vacuum-tube) to be preserved.

In earlier posts on this blog -- quite a few of them -- I've sketched out where I think things are headed if left to themselves; at this stage of the project, I want to talk about what can be done about it. (That doesn't mean, please note, stopping the Long Descent; one way or another, industrial civilization is ending. The question is purely whether we can make that process a good deal less traumatic and wasteful than it will otherwise be. <br><br>Shane, don't worry about it. I find trolls amusing, and occasionally informative -- when some new line of horseradish is going to be standard among progress worshippers and the like, I usually hear that line first from a troll.

If I ever end up in Australia and need solar power gear, I'll know who to ask after. Is the word "hillbilly" in common use down under, or is it purely an Americanism? <br><br>David, exactly. I would argue that most of the questions human beings can ask have many valid answers, and "what kind of monetary system should we have?" is a prime example. There is no one right answer, not least because "should" presupposes a value judgment, and those are invariably subjective and dependent on irreducibly personal issues. What do you want your monetary system to do? What do you want it to allow, and what do you want it to prevent? That determines what kind you want. <br><br>Beneath, that's a good solid question. Of course there are no one-size-fits-all answers. In the case of homeschooling, I see that as a matter of rescuing one's children from a harmful situation. In the case of libraries, the goal is to build a parallel library system that will eventually be available to the general public, and if it becomes popular enough, to panic the public libraries into becoming libraries again, instead of delivery systems for the mass media. In both cases, bringing competition to bear against a dysfunctional and "stuck" system is one way to cause change. If the ones who walked away from Omelas went somewhere else to work out the bugs of having an equally splendid city without the injustice, with the goal of challenging Omelas to adopt that better system, I'd be less troubled by LeGuin's story. <br><br>Pygmycory, bingo. <br><br>PatriciaT, that's excellent! Thank you, and may the term be enthusiastically adopted by many. <br><br>Aron, well, yes, back in the day. ;-)<br><br><a href=#c5334095720918193671 title="comment permalink">9/26/16, 12:51 AM</a><br><br>

At the same time, as always, you persist in your fundamental prejudice, namely that technology is fatally limited and the technological progress in itself doomed, because there is a "malignant germ" inherent to technology itself. And this is, IMO, the error: you attribute the responsibility to the hammer when in fact the culprit is who uses it in a distorted way. When you say "Most of us these days know perfectly well that every software “upgrade” these days has more bugs and fewer useful features than what it replaced, and every round of “new and improved” products hawked by the media and shoveled onto store shelves is more shoddily made, more loaded with unwanted side effects, and less satisfactory than the last round." you seem not to understand the fundamental point, namely that these "upgrades" are not aimed at improving, but only the generate more revenues for the ones that implements them. The problem is the human being, or rather, that part of human beings who have as their only purposes power and profit, <br>and that those purposes will exercise in any context they may be: hyper-technological or Retro Utopian.

The country's Social Democrat and Green party coalition have submitted proposals to Parliament that would reduce the value-added-tax (VAT) on bicycle, clothing, and shoe repairs from 25% to 12%. Also proposed is an income tax deduction equalling half the labor cost of repairing household appliances. According to The Guardian, "the incentives are part of a shift in government focus from reducing carbon emissions produced domestically to reducing emissions tied to goods produced elsewhere." Per Bolund, Sweden's Minister for Financial Markets and Consumer Affairs, said the policy also tied in with international trends around reduced consumption and crafts, such as the "maker movement" and the sharing economy, both of which have strong followings in Sweden.</i><br><br>Although this is under the umbrella of carbon emissions with this they will build a nice little internal capacity of repairing stuff which will serve them good during times of distress.<br><br><a href=#c1502236775305104029 title="comment permalink">9/26/16, 6:22 AM</a><br><br>

There's a LOT of old Motorola stuff that works <b>much</b> better than brand new Ham equipment, even though it's 30 years old. I've had to get old DOS computers set up to program the radios, but I now have literally hundreds of radios to distribute.<br><br>I'm also refurbishing old Packet Radio TNCs to get to those who can't pay $200 for a new one and computers to go along with them. We're building a quite good network for packet email on both HF and VHF. This is not like the old Packet networks of 20 years ago, but we will be able to get messages through. There have been some improvements even though the modern systems like to depend too much on the Internet. They can be used independent of the Internet if you know what you are doing.<br><br>Since I'm located up on a decent ridge, I have installed a 2 meter and a 70 cm repeater that are again refurbished old commercial equipment and they are all with battery and solar power backup.

Are the elite and establishment truly so wrapped in a self=-referential bubble that they can/do not perceive that the commoner's experience is directly at odds with the picture being drawn by their various proclamations? It seems that the only answer they have is to repeat, again, the same assertions and question why their audience is too ignorant, uneducated, or racist to understand. This is nothing you haven't spoken of, in volumes, but watching it is, well, puzzling. I mean, HRC's solution is to re-introduce herself? Again?

I, for one, want to know what happens next. I understand no crowdsourcing, though at one point you did encourage reader suggestions or thematic concerns, I believe. But you're on the way to building a really interesting world.<br><br>I keep imagining the results of Carr's trade agreements and the reverberations those will have. How many kinds of retrovation there can be! For example, I imagine that the City State of Chicago, with its large population of Native Americans who have real political power there, will utilize the trade agreement to open trading opportunities with the federated First Nations peoples of northern North America and Canada. <br><br>Their culture would be an interesting, vibrant blend of "western" technology and old tribal ways (differing for different tribes), as is developing now. I can easily imagine that the new trade agreements would enable them to do a booming business in hemp and hemp products (cloth, rope, etc.) that would be so necessary to the Lakeland Republic and in future to the Atlantic Republic. Also wild rice, maple syrup, leather, furs, honey, wood and wood products, and flax/linen--all sustainably managed, all traditional products newly important in a retrotopic world. They also might control the last remaining taconite supplies in Minnesota. And their community-oriented lifestyle and earthcentric spiritual ways would be another tonic contrast to (present day) notions of "progress," somewhat different to that of the Lakeland Republic's.<br><br>Perhaps Carr would visit Chicago and be educated even further.<br><br>A minor point: the leader of Chicago would not, I believe, be the "President," but would still be the Mayor.<br><br>Looking forward to future posts.

I would argue that such things have happened throughout human history, and will continue to happen as long as our species continues to exist, because human beings are human beings and not, say, plaster saints -- and one of the things that comes with being human is the phrase "it seemed to make sense at the time." <br><br>Patricia, thanks for the reference. That was entertaining -- and a great example of industrial society's biophobia in action. That other creatures might not just be objects for us to dispose of as we will...the horror! As for <i>The King in Yellow</i>, well, yes. I've been having fun with that in my new fiction series. <br><br>Synthase, which in turn unfolds from our culture's biophobia and fetishistic craving for the kind of absolute control you only have with machines. I'll want to do a post about this as we proceed. <br><br>SteelRust, okay, this is funny. I challenge you to cite a single post or comment of mine in which I say "there is a 'malignant germ' inherent to technology itself." I don't believe that, nor have I said it -- but true believers in the religion of progress love to insist that this is what critics of progress think. Not so. What I am saying is that <i><b>scientific and technological progress are subject to the law of diminishing returns</b></i>. (Please read the passage in boldface again, as many times as necessary, until it sinks in.) Like everything else, scientific and technological progress pick the low-hanging fruit first; as time goes on, the costs of continued progress rise while the benefits decline; eventually, those two trend lines cross, and additional progress imposes costs that exceed its benefits. I also propose that we are well past the crossing of those trend lines. The law of diminishing returns governs every other human action, and it requires far more of a leap of faith to insist that progress is somehow exempt from it than to accept that yes, progress is also subject to it. <br><br>As for the current fad for blaming everything on sociopaths -- well, it's always very convenient and comforting to insist that all the world's problems are the result of the machinations of a malevolent minority. I'm sure you can recall several previous times in the last century when this sort of thinking became generally accepted in one or more countries, and the result has usually involved a body count in the millions. Is that really the sort of thinking you want to encourage? <br><br>Maverick, that's really good news. Thanks for the heads up!<br><br>Randomquestionguy, a couple of dozen nukes sounds simple enough until you start adding up the infrastructure, manufacturing facilities, need for testing, etc., etc. Certainly none of the post-US North American republics, struggling to meet basic needs and pay off crushing debt loads, would be able to cover that. <br><br>August, thanks for the update! I'm sorry greenwizardsradio didn't take off -- one thing I've learned is that you never know what will or won't catch fire in this line of work. Still, glad to hear that the packet email project and your other ventures are ongoing. <br><br>Ed-M, yep. At least one of my more speculative new year predictions -- that the fracking bubble would deflate this year -- is very much on schedule. <br><br>David, yep. I think the political class just had their reality check returned for insufficient funds. <br><br>Michelle, funny. Thank you!<br><br>Lewis, (4) because IT'S PROGRESS!!! (Ahem.)<br><br>Adrian, nope. There will be no sequel; the fact that it sets your mind racing to think of what comes next is exactly the desired point, and having succeeded in that goal, I bow and leave the stage. BTW, the head of state of the Free City of Chicago is a President, because in my fictional 2065, Chicago is an independent nation -- think Monaco or Lichtenstein.<br><br><a href=#c1748400963612199377 title="comment permalink">9/26/16, 4:00 PM</a><br><br>

I've known several herbalists who rely on herbs for regular birth control due to not wanting to rely on synthetic birth control pills (which end up in our waterways through bodily excretion, but that's another subject for another day). I recently listened to a talk by an indigineous woman who explained her tribe's history of largely planning for birth through the judicious use of certain plants.

I continue to be mystified by how rapidly things are changing among the wage class. A coworker who goes to our local Six Flags Over Jesus Christian theme park/amusement ride with another coworker just came out. The response among my gun loving, government hating, conservative wage class coworkers has been supportive. The other, straight, Six Flags attending coworker is always talking about his sexcapades, and other coworkers' kinky adventures pretty much leave me in the dust, mostly. It's a strangely surreal change compared with the world I came out into 20 years ago. We go out for drinks on Friday. Not that evangelicals weren't always doing these things, but they always maintained a unified pietistic, sanctimonious, puritanical public front before. No matter how much you drank privately, you dutifully voted dry and campaigned against "demon rum" every wet/dry election. No matter how many same-sex partners or mistresses were hiding in your closet, you always railed against the "homosexual lifestyle" and sex outside of marriage. I really think that we will see a major fracturing and emptying out of the Six Flags Christian theme park megachurches in the next few years as crisis hits. They're literally now all over the map with their beliefs, and without the unifying pietistic, sanctimonious puritanism, I really don't see what will hold them together. We're already seeing this locally--the major opposition to our local Fairness Ordinance (LGBT civil rights) is the ministerial association, and the members of a local church that is of the same denomination as Six Flags, but is a more modest size, has fractured over the Fairness Ordinance, even though the pastor opposes the ordinance.<br><br><a href=#c5305721256235470937 title="comment permalink">9/26/16, 5:31 PM</a><br><br>

JMG had mentioned something about kids realizing that college was a con and a money drain and not falling for the trap. I'm wondering if these wage class kids are more shrewd than their college educated counterparts. They seem more literate, more engaging, and overall more intelligent than their pot smoking, salary class counterparts.<br>Another thing I have noticed among the wage class, they seem way more class conscious and much less conscious of traditional divisions than in the past. For example, 20 years ago, they'd be way more obsessed about racial and sexual orientation differences. Today, not so much. I think their biggest concern about some minority groups is that they will continue to support the establishment when the compost hits the wind turbine. When push comes to shove, I think that if gay people, immigrants, and black people show class solidarity and pick up pitchforks and rope along with their white wage class counterparts, they will be accepted as "one of us" by the white wage class. There just seems to be some anxiety about minority groups not showing class solidarity when push comes to shove.<br>Regarding staying or leaving when civil war breaks out, on this, I am torn. Reestablishing the Confederacy and ending the Union will cost a lot of lives, and I think I could be a good loudmouthed demagogue, saying the outrageous things no one else is willing to say, whipping crowds into a frenzy for the cause. This is not a responsibility to be taken lightly, though. And I think it would be awesome to be a founding father of the Confederacy, Act II, and I would love to be the first Confederate ambassador to Mexico.<br><br><a href=#c4864632314590157934 title="comment permalink">9/26/16, 5:52 PM</a><br><br>

What for sure has instead reached the no-return point is a society in which the management of science and technology happens in the frame of the today dominant neocon economic, consumeristic and socio-political paradigm. If today a lot of the new "developement" in almost every scientific and technical field seems to be worse ot the stuff they substitute for, is because the main interest of whom produce them is for the quaterly bottom line, not for the quality of the product. What has to be reformed is how and for what the mankind use the developements of science and technology. To be clear: I don't say that this is feasible, the cancer of the neocon capitalism is so anvanced and, apparently, so well attuned to some basic human mental structure, that it seems that nobody today is anymore even able to image the possibility of other socio-economical paradigms. But if we will be unable to change this aspect, the snake will rise again in every alternative society we try to build.<br>Regards<br>SR<br><br><a href=#c2793740516498350853 title="comment permalink">9/27/16, 1:12 AM</a><br><br>

Furthermore, decreased discretionary funding at the federal and state level is creating a hypercompetitive environment between government agencies (e.g., EPA, NIH, CDC), for scientists in these agencies, and for academics seeking funding from all sources—the combination of perverse incentives and decreased funding increases pressures that can lead to unethical behavior. If a critical mass of scientists become untrustworthy, a tipping point is possible in which the scientific enterprise itself becomes inherently corrupt and public trust is lost, risking a new dark age with devastating consequences to humanity.

That's utterly fascinating -- I wasn't aware of magnetic amplifiers before, and if that technology were to become sufficiently well known before the supply chain of semiconductors starts breaking down, it could extend the lifespan of electronics technology substantially -- potentially right through the next set of dark ages. The one question I'd have is the viability of basement manufacture of ferrite cores; will have to look into that. <br><br>Shane, yes, the main characters of <i>Star's Reach</i> and <i>Retrotopia</i> both drink a moderate amount of alcohol; many people do, and it's a common social habit in most cultures.

I was just a bit startled when Cherokee used it. <br><br>SteelRust, you know, if I'd tried to come up with a parody of the illogic that believers in progress use to avoid thinking about things that contradict their faith, I don't think I could have done a better job than you just did now. Let's take a look at this comment of yours. You quote a line of mine, agree that that's exactly the point, and then start babbling about entropy et al., as though that has something to do with what I said. It doesn't. What I said was that <i><b>scientific and technological progress are subject to the law of diminishing returns</b></i>. That law isn't caused by profit-seeking elites; it's present in all human activities everywhere, and it means that scientific and technological progress, taken beyond a certain point, produces more negative consequences than positive ones. It would be nice if you could address that point, rather than veering instantly off into irrelevancies. <br><br>RPC, that's part of what helped build the mythology, yes. These days, though, it's simply that the concept of perpetual progress so saturates the media and what passes for an educational system that most people take it as self-evident, and stop thinking (as demonstrated by SteelRust) the moment it's questioned or contradicted. <br><br>Raymond, I have another reader who's insisting that I ought to do a review of that book. I have a copy, but haven't yet managed to get past the cover blurbs. Oh, well...<br><br>Josh, thank you!

The steel in the combustion chamber is delaminating and I've already replaced several sections of steel plate in that combustion chamber. Yes, it would be fair to say that that unit is in for a good time and not a long time. Which really annoys me as I find it increasingly difficult to tell what bit of rubbish product being foisted onto us is going to last. And I totally hate the waste of time and resources involved in walking away from minor disasters like this.<br><br>Oh, sorry, I digress again. Well, I first came across the word hillbilly as a young kid who was subjected to US culture and the television show "The Beverley Hillbillies". You may or may not recall that one? I didn't really think about the concept much after that, which is possibly a good thing, although some may argue otherwise. Then one of the local farmers here used to stir me up about living in "hillbilly country" and instead of getting defensive about it, I just sort of owned it. Of course with these good natured ribbings there may always be a grain of truth hidden within.<br><br>And the poem ended up being a song. My wife came across the words a year or so back whilst reading a delightful book on US fashion by the author Cintra Wilson titled: "Fear and Clothing". What a great title too. We had a good chuckle about the lyrics as we can sort of see where the writer was coming from. I'll reproduce the words here (with some minor adjustments to the lyrics from the song Way out here, as the singer Josh Thompson has to understand that this is a website run by a Druid, after all - I hope him and the band don't try and come and get me...). Here goes:<br><br><i>"Our houses are protected by the Gods and a gun<br>And you might meet 'em all if you show up here not welcome son<br>Our necks are burnt, our roads are dirt and our trucks ain't clean<br>The dogs run loose, we smoke, we chew and fry everything...<br><br>We won't take a dime if we ain't earned it<br>When it comes to weight brother we pull our own<br>If it's our backwoods way of livin' you're concerned with<br>You can leave us alone"</i><br><br>They kind of lost me with the smoking, chewing and frying bit, but each to their own! Oh my, we've descended into the land of silliness again. The song also went onto to say something, something about John Wayne and Johnny Cash. The only Johnny Cash I've ever enjoyed is when he covered the Nine Inch Nails song. Emotional stuff with that growling voice...<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c697712601679367249 title="comment permalink">9/27/16, 4:46 PM</a><br><br>

They depend on an alternating-current "power supply", historically provided by a spinning alternator, so it hasn't been shown (as far as I know) that they can be used for "short wave" radio communications. If we want to communicate over hundreds of miles with less than 100W, we need to generate signals of at least 3.5 MHz, which is about 20x higher in frequency than is described in Wikipedia as controlled with magnetic amplifiers. (A transistor or vacuum tube amplifier, by contrast, is supplied with direct current (constant voltage, as from a battery or solar panel).) I'm eager to hear of success at frequencies practical for radio.<br><br>I have a modest little book "Instruments of Amplification", (H. P. Friedrichs, apparently self-published), which describes experiments (of varying success) in making vacuum tubes and transistors with household equipment. (I got my copy through ARRL.org.)

(I suppose this could be better than regressing to the default 30s/40s example of disaster: smile). <br><br>I offered this ‘joke’ once before a while ago on this forum, but it seems central to both the Public Good and what we used to call in Britain, ‘Public Service Ethos’. America had a strong moral strand as well, I remember. Things changed. In 1980 Thatcher started to dismantle the Ministry of Agriculture and the ethos of ‘public science’. I made a joke in the pub to the effect - “If it made money, then ‘Government’ should hand it over to ‘Business’. And, if it did not make money then it was not worth doing anyway.” There were some jokes I wished later I had not found so amusing.<br><br>The corollaries seem to have been: “if you can’t find ‘outside’ funding –at going-rates in competitive markets - for the knowledge business, then by definition it is not worth having.” “Teaching is worth what students are willing to pay for it”. “You as a teacher are worth the cash flow, no more, that you bring in to cover ‘our’ overheads as an ‘employer/business’. Remember, you are there to sell it, whatever it is.”<br> <br>On the other hand at some critical point ‘knowledge’ is what we are. For any society and for sure ours, minimum knowledge is a public utility needing maintenance, much like our water and food supply and control of waste and ‘security’. ‘Scholarship’ supporting historically informed ‘understanding’ across the range of our critical ‘utilities’ is necessary for sane policies; i.e. keeping in touch with ‘realities’. And ‘attitude’ or ‘ethos’ really matters! Curiously, Thatcher I guess, thought she had the key to investing in ‘knowledge’ and at the same time solving the ‘diminishing return’ problem. <br><br>best<br>Phil H<br><br><br><a href=#c891288244754992416 title="comment permalink">9/28/16, 3:56 AM</a><br><br>

It would be nice if you could address that point, rather than veering instantly off into irrelevancies. "<br><br>Dear JMG,<br>how can I address what for you is clearly a point of blind faith, i.e. that the reached diminising returns of science and technology IN THEIR TODAY FORM OF IMPLEMENTATION are not mainly caused/heavily influenced by "ab initio" and "in itinere" bad political/ideological choice, but only/mainly by thermodynamic limits? <br>An example? Private vs public transportation. Consumerism vs optimized product design. Profit for the medical corporations vs optimized medical and drugs production.

In other words, to not “progress” into negative territory where the gains of efficiency, comfort, convenience, etc. are in fact outweighed by the bad consequences such as pollution, creating a large poor under class, trashing the environment, etc. We want to avoid the crossover point into negative returns for our efforts.

The subtitle is “Mythology, Sexuality &amp; The Origins of Culture”; it was written in 1981. I first read this book about 15 years ago. I found it slow-going then and now. The words are easy enough, but the sentences are hard. I suspect it is because my college courses were primarily math and physics; no history, no literature.<br><br>I was startled by the following paragraph on page 120, near the beginning of a chapter on agriculturalization:<br><br>“For the few thousand years that Magdalenian culture lasted, the relationships among religion, art, and technology seem to have achieved a condition of harmony and balance. But for humanity all steady-states are temporary, and just when we think we can take nature for granted, whether we live in a hunting or an industrial society, the weather changes, and we are forced to change.”<br><br>The next paragraph begins: “Great ages of transition, with their attendant changes of climate—-as we ourselves seem about to discover—-are difficult times of decreasing culture. Adjusting to a new ecological niche calls for a new adaptation and takes the entire psychic energy of a culture.”<br><br>Your Retropia is largely based on declining petrocarbon-based energy, but this book reminds me we face a greater change—the weather.<br><br>Thank you for Retropia. I liked the contrast in the different state’s approaches to technology, agriculture, etc. I am convinced more than ever that 52 states are too many to govern in one union.<br><br><a href=#c129935768124433913 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 10:35 AM</a><br><br>

If that statement needs any further proof, you can get it by watching the way people respond to technological failure. Most of us these days know perfectly well that every software “upgrade” these days has more bugs and fewer useful features than what it replaced, and every round of “new and improved” products hawked by the media and shovelled onto store shelves is more shoddily made, more loaded with unwanted side effects, and less satisfactory than the last round.</i>]<br><br>in so far as the allusion to a pressurised sales cycle. In fact I recently said something about <i>“seasonally cyclical manipulative advertising practices that push incrementally modified, sometimes deliberately shortened shelf-lifed, disposable products that desperately attempt to create a market“</i>” (1) so it appeals to me.<br><br>but, I simply don’t recognise either the “every software upgrade these days has more bugs” generalisation and or the “more shoddily made, more loaded with side effects, and less satisfactory”. You then go on to say that older was better, sturdier etc. I don't accept the attempted generalisations. I also can’t go along with the “most of us these days know that perfectly well”.<br><br>I would want to see the evidential statistics backing those quite sweeping generalisations. I’m sure you wouldn’t be expecting us to take them on Faith *wink*<br><br>I agree things fail, wear out, have errors etc! There are no doubt differences in shelf-life, reliability and the MTBF of old and new products. Yes! Absolutely! <br><br>I would suspect it goes both ways and perhaps even on balance evens out but if you have a study that supports those claims then I would love to read it - seriously. It could be useful for me.<br><br>When I made statement (1) above I actually had no evidence I could point to in support of the “deliberately disposable” part. It was just feeling based. The rest I could justify.<br><br>As for the following:<br><br>[<i>And of course that’s the crucial point, the most important thing that I hope my readers got out of the narrative. At the heart of most of the modern world’s insoluble problems is the faith-based claim that human history is a straight line with no branches or meanders, leading onward and upward from the caves to the stars, and that  every software upgrade, every new and improved product on the shelves, every lurch “forward”—however that conveniently floppy word happens to be defined from day to day by marketing flacks and politicians—therefore must lead toward that imaginary destination</i>]<br><br>I get the marketing flacks aspects, re (1), but I simply don’t recognise this “that human history is a straight line with no branches or meanders, leading onward”. Anyone with a passing knowledge of history should be able to point at branches or meanderings .. no ? Who is claiming that human history is such ?<br><br>Perhaps I’m just being slow today but I don’t quite understand why you are conflating all of that or why you are trying to say that it is at the heart of most of the modern worlds problems.<br><br>You have this thing about what you have termed “progress” in some other posts ( whatever that may be .. too subjective for my tastes ) and somehow blaming it for the world’s problems.<br><br>I don’t recognise this idea of progress. For me I see evolution, change and adaptation. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes it causes harm etc. Different groups in parallel explore different ways of being. Along the way sometimes some groups of people take advantage and attempt to manipulate others for their selfish purposes but not everyone goes along with it. Some see it and resist it. Some don’t and fall prey to it. Some see it and don’t care etc. Along the way individually and collectively we learn .. at different rates.<br><br>I like the Retrovation term though and the concept. We should be aware of the past so that we can learn from it and where appropriate re-use concept from it but most preferably not some careful curated version of it.<br><br><a href=#c1427173408413795016 title="comment permalink">1/11/17, 7:37 AM</a><br><br>
