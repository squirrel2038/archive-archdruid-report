This is the twenty-fourth (and next to last) installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. At a final meeting between our narrator and Isaiah Meeker, President of the Lakeland Republic, certain unstated agendas are revealed and the future of one of the post-US North American republics takes an unexpected turn...</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A taxi brought back to my hotel from Janice Mikkelson’s mansion—one of her flunkeys called it for me—and I spent most of the ride staring out the window and thinking about what she’d said about the prewar rich. I’d heard plenty of stories along the same lines, of course, everybody has, but for some reason my mind kept circling back to the way that they’d dug their own graves and then jumped into them. Why didn’t it occur to them that voting themselves one billion-dollar bonus after another, while driving their own employees and the rest of the country into poverty, was going to blow up in their faces sooner or later? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I was thinking that, staring out at the darkening sky, when a little pale streak brought me back to reality. The dozens of governments and corporations that kept launching satellites even after 2029, when the Kessler syndrome in low earth orbit should have given them a wake-up call, had gone waltzing just as cluelessly into a preventable disaster of their own. I thought of the mess we’d gotten into back home by going long on nuclear power plants in the 2040s, long after it should have been clear to everyone that nuclear power was—what was Fred Vanich’s phrase?—a subsidy dumpster, one more technological white elephant that never paid for itself and only looked profitable because most of the costs were shoved out of sight one way or another. I thought of the war going on a thousand miles south of me just then, and wondered sourly why a species that was so smart at coming up with clever technologies was so dumb about so much else.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The taxi stopped outside the hotel, and I went in, climbed the stairs to my room, and made a phone call. Yes, the call was to Melanie Berger; yes, we spent the evening together; no, I’m not going to go into any of the details. We didn’t talk about progress or technology or the future of the Lakeland Republic, in case you were wondering. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Another taxi brought me back to the Capitol Hotel about seven-thirty the next morning. I tried without noticeable success to coax my electric shaver into giving me a decent shave, then showered and got everything but the day’s clothing packed. I’d considered more than once putting on ordinary bioplastic businesswear for the trip back, knowing that people back home would look at me as though I had two spare heads if I got off the train in Pittsburgh dressed in my Lakeland clothes, but that resolution lasted just about long enough for me to reach into the closet and grab a business suit. The slick clammy texture of the thing made my skin crawl. So I dressed in hempcloth and wool instead, checked my appearance, put on my trench coat and porkpie hat, and headed out the door to my final appointment with the President of the Lakeland Republic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The weather had turned cold and damp overnight, and stray raindrops spattered down as I walked the familiar six blocks to the Capitol. Another round of scaffolding had gone up on the unfinished dome, and stonemasons were already clambering around up there, laying another course of marble blocks beneath the shelter of brown tarps I guessed probably weren’t made of plastic. Down at street level, people were already picking up the latest papers at Kaufer’s News.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I bought the <i>Blade</i>, glanced at the headlines on the front page:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the fighting in the Gulf and in northeastern Texas seemed to be grinding toward a stalemate; the other North American republics had appealed to the Brazilians and Chinese to stay out of the fighting and try to talk their respective client states into accepting a ceasefire; one of the big Indian telecom multinationals had gone bankrupt—the first corporate casualty of the satellite crisis, though I knew it wouldn’t be the last by a long shot—and stock markets everywhere but Toledo were doing another sickening downward lurch in response. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I stuffed the paper into one of the big outside pockets of my trench coat, crossed the street, and went up<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>the long walk to the main entrance of the Capitol. It was five to nine, still too early for kids on field trips or photo ops in the Rotunda, so the only people I saw were members of the legislative staff hurrying this way and that, getting ready for what would probably be another hectic day, and a couple of white-haired politicians, one light-skinned, one dark-skinned, talking intently as they ambled toward the Senate end of the building. Me, I headed straight across the rotunda to the door in back and went in. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It still startled me that you could just walk into the offices of the President of the Lakeland Republic. No doubt the uniformed guards in the Rotunda weren’t the only guards in the place, but they were the only ones I saw. I went down the corridor into the front office, said hi to Gabriel Menendez, waited while he called back, shed my coat and hat in the cloakroom, and then through another corridor and the round room with the spiral staircase to Meeker’s office. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Mr. Carr,” said the President, as we shook hands. “It’s good to see you again.” He gestured toward the side of the room. “Please have a seat.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same people who’d been present for my first meeting with Meeker were waiting: no surprises there, though I hadn’t expected them to be sitting in precisely the same chairs. I shook hands all around. “Mr. President, Mr. Macallan, Ms. Patel, Mr. Vanich—” With the faintest of smiles, just for her: “Ms. Berger.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We got settled. “Before we get to business,” the President said, “I have a bit of good news to pass on:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>to you, or course, but also through you to Ms. Montrose. Our State Department heard backchannel last night via an embassy I won’t name that the Confederate and Texan governments are both potentially willing to talk about a ceasefire. No word yet about when or where, much less what terms either side’s likely to demand, but at least they haven’t rejected negotiations out of hand.”
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s good to hear,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We certainly have hopes,” Meeker went on. “That’s all we have so far, though.” A gesture dismissed the issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I hope you’ve found your stay here—shall we say, instructive.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s one way of putting it,” I replied. “I don’t mean any criticism at all when I say that in some ways, it’s been two very long weeks.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meeker nodded. “Melanie mentioned that you’ve found yourself reconsidering some of your ideas about technology and the like.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I considered him. “Again, that’s one way of putting it—and that brings me to one last item I’d like to mention before I leave for home.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Of course,” said Meeker, smiling. Fred Vanich and Melanie glanced at each other, and I wondered if they’d made another bet. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I suspect you’re aware,” I said then, “that I had more reasons for coming here than the ones we discussed earlier.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meeker turned to look at Stuart Macallan, who said, “Mr. Carr, I hope you won’t mind if I state the obvious. None of us could think of any reason why Ellen Montrose would have sent one of her key advisers here right after the election, when almost any competent staffer could have handled the preliminary work on the the three agreements we worked out. We’ve had plenty of other unofficial envoys come here since the borders opened, of course, and most of them had some agenda other than the one they told us about. We assumed you had one too.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“With that in mind,” said Meeker, “I’d be most interested in hearing what your other reasons for comong here might be, to the extent that you can talk about them.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Fair enough,” I said, meeting his gaze. “You know that Ellen won the election promising across-the-board changes in our national economic policy. She means it, too—we’ve already got the first round of legislation drafted, and everybody’s going to hit the ground running the day after inauguration. I’m sure you know the basic thrust of it.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“What’s been made public, yes,” said Meeker. “She hasn’t mentioned defaulting on the foreign debt Barfield and his predecessors ran up, but that’s almost certainly going to have to be part of it. Even before this business down south got going, there was no way she could keep her election promises without renegotiating the debt, and that means at least a technical default.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave him a bland look and said, “I can’t comment on that.” He chuckled, and I went on. “The new administration’s going to have its hands full getting the economy a little less dysfunctional, and now there’s what the satellite crisis is doing to stock markets and the telecom industry, not to mention the Confederate-Texas war, to add to the fun and games. Beyond that, though, there’s another set of plans relating to economic regulations, the tax code, and a range of other policies. Those haven’t been made public yet, but when they are, you’re going to find some of them just a little familiar.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Indeed?” Meeker said, his eyebrows rising. “Please go on.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The short form is that she wants to redirect government support for business away from the high-tech sectors of the economy and into manufacturing and agriculture, and change the tax code and other public policy incentives so that they reward employment rather than automation.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Jaya Patel waited a moment to make sure Meeker wasn’t about to speak, then said, “I’m sure I don’t have to tell you how sensible that sounds from our standpoint.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No. When she suggested it to me, though, I told her to her face that she was stark staring nuts.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That got slightly glazed looks from the others. “I’d be interested in knowing how she took that,” the President said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“She expects that sort of thing,” I told him. “You’ve heard about her reputation for blunt talk, right? She hires staff who will talk to her the way she talks to them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Half the problem with Barfield’s administration is that he only hires people who tell him what he wants to hear.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He nodded, gestured for me to go on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I told her that there was no way the Atlantic Republic could go back to a twentieth-century economy, that nobody would put up with it, and even if we could and they did, it just meant that we’d be eaten alive by less backward nations that kept up with the latest technology. She pointed out that the more we invested in the latest technology the further behind we got, and I dismissed that as the product of outside factors. We had a fine donnybrook—the kind where everybody else on the floor gathers outside the door to listen—and I finally insisted that it simply wouldn’t work. She just smiled and said that it was already working.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“So she knew what we’ve done,” said Melanie. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded. “I don’t happen to know where she got her information. I know Barfield sent someone from his inner circle over here right after the borders opened, but her report went into a locked file as soon as she got back and I don’t know if anyone but Barfield ever saw it. Ellen’s got connections in surprising places, though. But she told me that policies like the ones she had in mind were working on this side of the border. I simply wouldn’t believe it, and so we made a deal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>If she won the election, she’d come up with some plausible reason to send me over here for two weeks right afterwards and see for myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After that, if I could give her a good reason why her proposals wouldn’t work, she’d reconsider them.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meeker paused, watching me, and then asked, “And what will you tell her when you get back?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The words came more easily than I’d expected. “Something that I couldn’t have imagined myself proposing a week ago. I’m going to advise her to go considerably further than she’d planned, and begin moving the Atlantic Republic in the same directions that you’ve gone here.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When I was a kid, my grandmother used to talk about deep silence by saying it was quiet enough that you could hear a pin drop. That’s what came to mind just then; I’d have had to drop it onto Meeker’s desk—the floor was carpeted—but if I’d done it, nobody in the room could have missed hearing it. Everyone but Melanie was staring at me; she was smiling. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Well,” Meeker said, recovering before any of the others. “If I may say so, Mr. Carr, that’s quite a compliment.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Thank you,” I replied. “I’m not sure whether it’s a compliment to the Lakeland Republic, though, or a criticism of everyone else. It shouldn’t have been so hard to figure out that if you’ve gone down a blind alley, the only way you can go forward starts by backing up.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Fred Vanich glanced at his boss, and then at me. “It’s a little more complex than that, Mr. Carr,” he said. “Progress, development, going forward. Those are powerful metaphors, and it’s not always easy to think clearly when they’re being waved around by those who have blind faith in them—especially if rich people stand to get much richer by convincing others that here and now, going forward means buying whatever technology they happen to be selling.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gestured, conceding the point. “Have you decided how you’ll propose going about the transition?” Jaya Patel asked. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No,” I admitted. “I’ve only had a couple of days to think about it, and quite a few other things to do in that time. When we get the first couple of rounds of legislation passed, cope with the end of satellite services, and figure out how we’re going to deal with the blowback from the war down south—ask me then and I can probably tell you.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“If there’s anything our government can do for yours in the process,” Meeker said, “I trust you’ll let us know.” With a sudden amused smile: “For reasons that are not entirely altruistic, of course.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I know Janice Mikkelson would love to sell us some streetcars,” I observed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That got a general laugh. “Yes,” Meeker said then, “but there’s also the point you made when we first talked, about not wanting a war zone or a failed state on your country’s border. If I may be frank, if the Atlantic Republic had kept going the way the Dem-Reps were leading it, it’s an open question whether you could have avoided serious trouble for long. The changes Montrose has announced will help, but it’s going to take quite a bit more to achieve the kind of economic and political stability we’ve managed here. If we can help you make that happen, that’s an investment we’ll consider.” He smiled again. “‘You’ in this case meaning the Atlantic Republic and Ellen Montrose primarily. I don’t claim to know what role you personally will be playing in all this.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s another issue,” I said. “My position in the new administration was one of the things hinging on my deal with Ellen. Of course there’s the confirmation vote on our side and the usual formalities on yours, but part of our deal was that if I ended up agreeing with Ellen, I was committing to four years as our ambassador to the Lakeland Republic.” I drew in a breath. “So I expect to be back here early in the new year, if everything goes according to plan.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meeker considered that and nodded. “That’s welcome news, Mr. Carr.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
“Thank you, Mr. President.” We shook hands. Past the President’s shoulder I could see Melanie’s face. She was smiling as our eyes met. </div>

One fundamental theme throughout your work, especially your nonfiction is that there is almost always a third way out of what looks like a binary situation. It seems like the Lakeland Republic's approach to our challenges represents a third way between, say the path the sort-of-monastic Christian (Mennonite?) order Carr visited earlier in the novel, and the path that the Atlantic Republic is taking. Although I see the merit in the idea of completely reverting to, say, a 17th century level of technology as being an entirely reasonable approach for a small community within a larger, friendly entity like the Lakeland republic, it seems clear to me that without the technologies used in Toledo and other urban centers of the LR, the economic might necessary to purchase the armaments needed to keep the LR sovereign might be too great a burden. I'm curious if these ideas are explored explicitly within the final novel, especially the possible downsides of the Mennonite approach if applied on a national level.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c2462114050123306113 title="comment permalink">9/7/16, 4:00 PM</a><br><br>

Are there any new religions of the fall (like original Christianity or Buddhism)?

Lovins' quips are good, but arguments based on cold hard cash are better!<br><br>Justin, to some extent that's implicit in the story; I've been trying to make the point that "retro" doesn't mean "back to the caves," it means quarrying the past for things that work better than what we've got now.

The young hero is making a cross country trip and on a back road, runs across the remains of such a redoubt. Earlier in the book, there were references to the almost semi-mythical rich who had held onto enough of their wealth after financial collapse, to hold up in such bunkers. <br><br>I was trying to think of things that might not have been touched on in your story so far. It's been such a long trip :-). Did Carr ever visit a grocery store or farmer's market? What were they like? Quality? Selection? Product labeling? I vaguely remember a trip to a drugstore or chemist ... maybe. Now I don't think he visited any thrift stores. Or, opportunity stores, as my Australian friend calls them. What IS the second hand / flea market / salvage scene like in the Lakeland Republic?

Perhaps Mr Carr can use one, and be surprised by the simplicity and lack of smell involved. Some designs have a slight suction on the bowl to vent any smells up to the roof. The byproduct could go into the city's methane power grid as well.

Right now the practice in the US is for small-town AM stations (and they still exist) to reduce power during the night to avoid interfering with other stations on the same frequency due to skip. Many even leave the air at sundown. There might not be as many stations in the LR, though, so that might not be a problem. But do you suppose there are people who run higher power stations near the borders to broadcast to nearby countries? Does someone in Lakeland run Radio Free America? Are there circuits for crystal sets somewhere out on the metanet? Do teenage boys hide in their basements and listen to Lakeland jazz and radio dramas?<br><br>Also re Aladdin lamps. Those are wonderful, but will there be an adequate source of yttrium to make the mantles? They stopped using thorium because of the radioactivity concerns, mostly in manufacturing (although some manufacturers of gas and kerosene lamps on the Aladdin model just shipped production to a developing country where they didn't have to worry about contamination). The original mantles were made with magnesium, which isn't a rare earth, but they weren't as efficient.<br><br>@JMG: this has been a thought-provoking excursion.

There's a fundamentalism of progress, exactly parallel to other kinds of fundamentalism, and like them, it's wedged itself into a self-reinforcing belief system that prevents disproof. All you can do is walk away. <br><br>Armata, a future fiction project I had in mind would trace out the geopolitics of North America in the late deindustrial dark ages, and yes, the Ohio valley would be the linchpin region. Unlike other pivot areas -- the Ukraine and northern Mesopotamia come to mind -- it's geographically defensible, and so I suspect its role will be more like that of northern France (the pivot area of western Europe) -- not a zone to be fought over but the heartland of a dominant polity. But we'll see! <br><br>Candace, dances and carnivals, certainly; in rural areas, Grange halls hosted a lot of dances back in the day. Cosplay? That seems to be a very modern habit, as it presupposes lots of disposable income plus opportunities to get together with other cosplayers to show off your new kit. I'll have to think about that. <br><br>William, it should be available for sale by the holiday shopping season. As for electricity, <a href=../../2015/11/retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html rel=nofollow>that's already been covered</a>. <br><br>Keith, it was an upset as well as a realignment election, and what the pundits didn't see is the same thing a lot of pundits have been missing of late: the 80% of the population that isn't affluent and doesn't dominate the media discourse also has a say in things, and used it. You're right that I should make that point a little more forcefully. <br><br>Lewis, hmm! Kudos to Shriver for getting that edgy. As for the shops in question, they're on the to-consider list. <br><br>Dennis, composting toilets would be used outside of the cities -- in town, fecal waste goes straight to the power plants via basement tanks pumped out by municipal workers.

What I really want is more of it. <br><br>I'd like to have a glimpse at the domestic economy.

I'm sure that will expand into cottage industries and craft work done in the home during bad weather. What portion of the available market goods might this provide to urbanites?

The domestic economy won't be easy, but I might be able to squeeze in a reference here and there. <br><br>Patricia, there seems to be a problem with the email connected to the print edition site; I'm working on getting that fixed. <br><br>Keith, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Patricia, the nearest thing to a single post that sums up green wizardry is the one that started the series of posts, <a href=../../2010/06/merlins-time.html rel=nofollow>Merlin's Time</a>.

Hmm. <br><br>Glenn, no question, the Pacific rim is its own geopolitical zone, and especially in a changed climate -- when the dryland west goes to Saharan levels of aridity -- it's going to have about as much in common with the rest of the continent as the north African coast has with sub-Saharan Africa. A lot depends on the level of maritime travel that remains viable; the strategic center of the Pacific basin, if tall ships stay in use, could as well be either Japan or Australia. <br><br>Harvester, Callenbach was basically reinventing the utopian genre -- and his success can be measured in the deathgrip the Ecotopian vision still has over so much of the green left -- but yes, he did make some mistakes, and that was one of them. I tried to learn from those. <br><br>Peter, there aren't any refugee flows yet, and if the ceasefire happens, there won't be. As for immigrants from elsewhere, we saw one family at the beginning of the story, you know, and there have been many more. Since the Lakeland Republic has effective control of its own borders, the number of immigrants is kept to a level the economy can sustain. (Europe and the US could do exactly the same thing if they wanted to, but letting in mass migration is so convenient a way to force down wages and break the power of the unions, so the governments in question wink and pretend to care...)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c6615039067160582659 title="comment permalink">9/8/16, 12:44 AM</a><br><br>

I think there is potential to say a lot with very few words. <br><br>Library buses (or rather detachable streetcar sections) as used in some parts of France or Scandinavia. Also small book exchanges have become a lot more common in many places, perhaps that could be somehow combined.<br><br>Cash-less economy (e.g. three way barter, or simply writing up on tab), general tolerance (if not desire) to leave some accounts unbalanced so as to keep a relationship.<br><br>Repair shops - I would imagine the flea market and thrift scene is perhaps somewhat disappointing for a large number of goods.

I was thinking in the direction of trying to keep up e.g. food safety, but not do total overkill in food production regulation. So you'd work similar to 100 years ago, but you routinely take samples and quickly (pneumatic post? pidgeon?) turn them in to a lab that tracks them and evaluates them. Since paths are short you could rapidly (radio) intervene if something raises a flag. The product batch in question may not have to be removed from the market even then. Educated consumers may be able to decide if it is an issue by themselves. A food producer could learn what went wrong and could improve the process, with no/little legislation necessary. Perhaps the general theme would be consumer "protection" (really: emancipation). <br><br>Re Montrose's jibe:<br>One more reason for sending someone like Carr may have been the need for an ally in the skeptical camp, who knows their language, sensibilities, etc. Thus not only will the gambit assure a decent due diligence, it changes the ratio regarding for/against - and more importantly, is very likely to guarantee Montrose the initiative for a while. The opposing camp will first have to figure out if there aren't more de facto (or potential) converts in its ranks.

Half of our funds come from the 'wealthy', who wish to see small organic farms thrive in the face of development. The other half of our funds come from the 'state', which are merely redirected tax receipts. Neither the wealthy nor the taxed should be considered as a sustainable subsidy for local agriculture, yet that is where we find ourselves today. What is progress in this model? So far, we know we need to connect 'wealthy' landowners who do not wish to farm, with young farmers (the New Peasantry) who are okay working the dirt for not much money. They aren't making a living, they're living a life.

This is a satisfying ending, with a southern cease-fire in the offing, and with the Atlantic Republic itself about to overhaul domestic policy. <br><br>I hope, however, that you will not be miffed if I remark on two points that might also attract the attention of your eventual substantive-stylistic editor at the publishing house (assuming the house is sufficiently funded to assign you such an editor, as part of its "book development" process). <br><br>(1) Carr's account of Atlantic Republic intel is questionable: <i>I know Barfield sent someone from his inner circle over here right after the borders opened, but her report went into a locked file as soon as she got back and I don’t know if anyone but Barfield ever saw it.</i> Inept though Atlantic might be, they will have been getting, either through ordinary channels or through covert channels, the principal Lakeland newspapers and magazines. Such reading, plus superficial debriefings of even untrained travellers, will have given Barfield's team an overview of Atlantic nuts-and-bolts - the county tier arrangements; the available ranges of consumer goods; the state of the telephone network; the organization of industry, including labour relations; and so on. <br><br>Even in the Cold War, the picture of USSR day-to-day life available to casual American readers (let alone to White House teams) was not too skimpy. And Lakeland, unlike the USSR, is an open society. <br><br>(2) I have to concur with Deborah ("9/7/16, 5:28 PM") and Justin ("9/7/16, 6:49 PM") in querying the reasonableness of a romantic liaison between a Lakeland national and an ambassador, i.e., a Head of Mission. You reply to Deborah ("9/7/16, 6:40 PM"; I paraphrase) that diplomatic annals abound in romantic liaisons. Oddly, however, I cannot think of any, at the level of Head of Mission. It could be that I am not adequately read. But in what I <i>have</i> read, I do not seem to see Heads of Mission apprehended in ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay. We get other awful stuff: some writer linked to UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office says, notably, that yes, the Diplomatic Pouch really has been used (perhaps in some African case) for moving a live human being from State A to State B. But Head-of-Mission in a liaison? Here what mainly comes to mind is the 1960s spook-novel <i>Smith and Jones</i>, in which security specialist "Drillpig" recalls inspecting the personnel file of diplomat Smith or diplomat Jones, and finding in it that damning sheet regarding future career path, with that damning annotation "Not above Second Secretary." <br><br>Also, it is a little depressing, though admittedly true to some actual recent American practice, to find the Atlantic President so casually rendering a mere political adviser, as opposed to a career diplomat, Head of Mission. <br><br>It's your book. But were I in your shoes, I would consider in the revision process retaining the romantic link, and retaining the idea of Carr going to Lakeland on a multi-year posting or secondment, and yet dropping the idea of Head of Mission. Car need not suffer the indignity of sitting in some Embassy slot "not above Second Secretary". There must be some more creative way of getting him into the Atlantic Republic, for the longer term, perhaps even under dual citizenship. Maybe other commenters here on ADR will have ideas? <br><br><br>Hastily, respectfully, <br><br>Tom <br><br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a><br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c3987769685461746900 title="comment permalink">9/8/16, 7:36 AM</a><br><br>

Much nicer to have an adult ending.<br><br>As for the objections to the talk to the audience concerning Carr and Melanie's evening, I too found it slightly out of the flow but understood the way you used it (as a fellow writer). If you have room for a middle long addition, I think I have a idea that could address several people's suggestions.<br><br>Have Carr phone Melanie, and offer to get together but have Melanie say she needs to stop by someplace first. Have her be a bit vague and mysterious as to where. Then have her pick him up and take him to a visiting carnival. Say her brother is working as a roustabout at the carnival. Melanie is dropping off letters from their mother.<br><br>One thing I haven't seen is whether common people can just walk up to their politicians and speak their mind. I imagine in the Atlantic Republic where Carr is, that body guards would swiftly intervene. You might have a few people recognize Melanie and come up and ask her questions. She could put them off with "I don't know much more than the newspapers have right now" and "wink, wink, I'm out with a NEW friend please".<br><br>You could show some of the social life of teenagers interacting. Have a band and a dance floor, watched by chaperons of course, where they can meet and pair up. Kind of like a school dance. Carr invites Melanie to a dance. And then when the song is done she can suggest they leave.<br><br>That might provide a sort of interlude before the seriousness of the final chapters.

When talking about the future of energy (and the nuclear industry specifically)with two twenty-something, college educated individuals, they both gave a shocking perspective on the legacy of nuclear power/waste. It boiled down to "who cares". One said they'd rather decimate a relatively small geographical area as opposed to allowing fossil fuel emissions to destroy the entire planet, and the other responded by hoisting up post Chernobyl Ukraine as a wildlife refuge otherwise impossible without the 1986 disaster. I was expecting the regulation argument, the fuel reprocessing argument, anything but the apparent apathy I encountered. Still mulling it over!

Glass, the importance of. I've visited the sites of 18th and 19th century glassworks; even back then they had rather large energy footprints. Affordable window panes would have to come from a glass industry comparable in scale to Mikkelson's streetcar company (which would also be a customer, of course). Achieving this would have been a major milestone during rebuilding, when long-boarded-up windows and store fronts would have begun literally coming back to light.<br><br>Example: glass beverage bottles that get collected not for recycling but for re-use. If from a large brewer, the brewer's logo might be embossed in the glass, instead of a paper label. (Easy to note in passing in any bar or restaurant scene.)<br><br>Shutters on the windows of the elegant houses, that (Carr notes) are actually functional, because (perhaps Carr can deduce) storms happen and replacing large glass panes is a significant expense (or at least, back-order wait) even for the wealthy.<br><br>Glaziery as another of the revitalized craft trades.<br><br>2. Ruins and salvage. I figure you don't want "ruinmen again" in this novel, but it stands to reason that if there were once a lot of higher-rise buildings and big-box stores and giant "elder care" complexes and the like around the cities, and there aren't now, there's more scrap steel around than could easily be used, or even easily be removed to somewhere else. Not to mention vehicles, construction machinery, war materiel from the CWII; and a lot of concrete still <i>in situ</i> and so forth. Wartime damage and requisition (or post-war pre-embargo business deals) might have reduced the mass, but can't be expected to have cleared out (even if it burned down), for instance, every ugly ex-chain hotel at every freeway exit.<br><br>Along railways (and also canals) would be a logical place for heavy salvage yards; perhaps a glimpse in passing? Unlike in typical apocalypse tale window dressing, such a yard would likely be busy with human activity.<br><br>3. Phone systems have been discussed extensively in an earlier Retrotopia comment thread. The problem with dial phones is that the dials (as they originally worked) were peripheral devices for "exchanges" which were originally building-sized electromechanical machines. It's unlikely that Lakeland would re-create those monsters, just for highest-tier and inevitably temporary usage, when in the near term a refrigerator-sized digital unit could do the same task (as anathema as importing and using one would be to LLR economic philosophy), and in the longer term, live operators using patch panels would replace the dials and exchanges (so why not rebuild it that way from the start?). Either way, telephony would be expensive, and used for business and important communications instead of social recreation.<br><br>4. To include in popular forms of recreation, consider board games, which seem to have periodic bursts of popularity and creative design every few decades, despite (or perhaps because of) technological progress.<br><br>As a more speculative prediction for group social events, instead of (or in addition to) masquerades and the like, low-tech LARP (live action role playing) might have a place. Even though it's only retro to the early 1980s, theater-style LARP is (I believe) in the category of things that could have been done decades earlier if someone had invented it and worked to popularize it. <a href="http://www.interactiveliterature.org/Q/Schedule.php?action=60" rel=nofollow>This list of games planned for an upcoming LARP convention</a> might give you some idea of the range of subject matter and play styles that are possible.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c2397333417139346152 title="comment permalink">9/8/16, 9:26 AM</a><br><br>

With that background, I offer the following observations:<br><br>The economic non-viability of nuclear electricity generation is usually heavily overstated, particularly as it seems to ignore the level of subsidies that its main competitor, coal-fired electricity generation, receives. Most analyses that dismiss nuclear power based on economic grounds seem to be more examples of motivated reasoning than clear-headed analysis. I could go on at length and in detail on this particular subject, but I will spare your readership, as it is only tangential to my real point, which follows.<br><br>The risk of catastrophe does exist, as we all know. With proper management and a proper institutional culture, this risk can be adequately mitigated, and for an economically reasonable cost. The U.S. Navy has managed to do this for over 60 years. However, the "proper institutional culture" I mentioned is extremely demanding (when it comes to nuclear power) and is potentially a very fragile thing; no other organization that I am aware of has managed to establish this kind of culture for any significant length of time, and I have my doubts as to whether even the Navy (which has a significant advantage in that as a military organization, it can impose cultural norms on its people in a way most other organizations simply can't) will be able to keep this up for an indefinite amount of time into the future. In particular, for-profit corporations as we have them in the modern industrial world and the institutional culture I see as necessary to support nuclear power can't really co-exist.<br><br>The bottom line is that while I don't see economics as a major obstacle, and individual humans can certainly be trained and individual systems can be designed in ways that make the odds of catastrophic failure virtually non-existent, it seems unlikely to me that any human society has the capacity to organize a whole industry with the level of engineering competence and consistency of performance to safely use nuclear power as a significant method of electrical generation for the long haul.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c923546021717932469 title="comment permalink">9/8/16, 11:13 AM</a><br><br>

It would still serve to illustrate to Carr what happens when there is a Republic-wide election. Just a thought.<br> Speaking of robustness, I saw something that could very well have come out of the Lakeland's workshops at http://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/09/ox-flat-pack-truck/ which is a flat-pack light truck that can be assembled in half a day by three people and is rugged enough for African roads.

As for cinema, I'm considering it. I'll have to work through the details of having cinema production in the Lakeland Republic when for thirty years it was basically shut off from the rest of the world, and so the market for movie sales was very small; live theater would arguably have been more viable, though it's not impossible that a movie industry might get under way after the borders opened. <br><br>David, thank you!<br><br>Doug, you've missed the point of Carr's reflections. It's not wealthy people that he's criticizing, it's wealthy people who are stupid about their dependence on the rest of us, and so think they can push the rest of the world to the wall and not pay a brutal price. It used to be the case that most rich people realized that their wealth obligated them to give back to society -- look up the Carnegie libraries sometimes for a great example. These days, the attitude of a great many rich people is "I got mine, Jack, too bad you're starving"...and that attitude is a good way to guarantee that they're going to end up dangling from lampposts in due time.<br><br>Helix, thank you! <br><br>Duke, not a problem. Many thanks for the link!<br><br>Toomas, first, you've apparently forgotten the briefings that Carr received before he went. The report that got roundfiled certainly wasn't the only intelligence the Atlantic Republic had about its western neighbor; Carr's ignorance is primarily that of someone who had a lot of other things to be concerned with until a few weeks previously, and knew about as much about conditions in the Lakeland Republic as I know right now, say, about conditions in Estonia. (And without looking it up, I couldn't even tell you the name of the Estonian head of state or which party he or she leads, for example.) Second, we've already settled that the post-US republics of North America share the USA's entertaining habit of appointing politically well-connected amateurs to ambassadorships, the same habit that made Shirley Temple the US ambassador to Czechoslovakia and John Kenneth Galbraith the US ambassador to India. (In all such cases, the subordinates are State Department professionals who do much of the actual work.) Will there be difficulties about a relationship with a foreign national? Of course -- but we'll get to that...<br><br>Donald, because Montrose's New Alliance isn't explicitly against progress -- it's simply opposed to the continuation of a failed business as usual, and Carr is on board with that. (For example, he supports Montrose's plan to renegotiate the AR's foreign debt.) Think of him as one of the relatively conservative Democrats who supported and advised FDR, because they figured his plans, radical as they were, were better than the failed orthodoxy he was trying to overturn.<br><br>RPC, electronic voting didn't outlast the old Union -- it turned out to be so easy to hack that in the 2020 election, Bozo the Clown won the presidency. That was covered up really fast, and the parties quietly settled things on the basis of their internal, honest, and highly secret polls, but by 2022 every state had gone back to paper ballots. <br><br>Albatross, I checked it, and somehow a close quote slipped in there. <a href=../../2015/11/retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html rel=nofollow>Try this one instead</a>.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c5123181773931926425 title="comment permalink">9/8/16, 5:55 PM</a><br><br>

The issue that matters is economic viability. Coal is not the main competitor to nuclear power, and hasn't been for quite a while -- largely because at this point, with the rapid decline in the quality of available coal reserves, coal is also a subsidy dumpster. The main competitor to nuclear power is combined cycle natural gas turbines, and economically speaking, those eat nuclear power alive. Yet the point I made still stands: nobody anywhere has ever had a commercial nuclear power industry without massive ongoing government subsidies, because nuclear power is a financial black hole. That isn't true of coal, or oil, or natural gas, or any other energy technology except for ethanol and a few of the gaudier forms of solar power.<br><br>With regard to maritime uses of nuclear power, are you at all familiar with the history of the SS Savannah, the world's first and only nuclear freighter? It was just as technically successful as the US Navy's nuclear program, and a total financial dud. The only reason that the Navy can afford to operate nukes is that war doesn't have to make a profit. <br><br>PatriciaT, I wish they'd demolished the developer instead. I'm sure he had a few parts worth salvaging. <br><br>Joel, I'd be delighted to know of any other discussion of the way that the perverse incentives of the current US tax code penalize employment and reward laying off workers. I'm not familiar with any, and would be delighted not to be a lone voice in the wilderness on this topic!<br><br>Weedananda, those have gone into the to-consider list. Thank you!<br><br>Myriad, my guess is that the current tort regime went out the window in the wake of the Second Civil War, when everybody wrote new constitutions and renegotiated the terms of the social compact. Still, I'll look into it. <br><br>Patricia, I'm glad to hear it. <br><br>Bob, that's an excellent point, though by November baseball season is iirc over, so Carr isn't likely to watch a game in progress through the window of a train. Yes, both are played in the Lakeland Republic; I may find some way to weave baseball into things, since it's so much a retro-Americana thing. <br><br>Kyle, and progress doesn't always make things better. <br><br>Violet, nope. They mostly live in urban tenements with nowhere they can plant seeds at all, unlike their opposite numbers in the Lakeland Republic, who can get spaces at community gardens and are encouraged to grow window boxes. I'll see if I can fit that in somewhere. <br><br>Deborah, that's been covered in an earlier episode. General practitioners are extremely common, being trained by apprenticeship, and they're paid for on what used to be called a "lodge trade" basis -- a group of people contract with a physician, they pay him a flat sum per month, and he takes care of all their ordinary health care plus referrals when necessary. It worked really well before the AMA destroyed it, since it kept a lid on doctor's profits...<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c6955240197133525282 title="comment permalink">9/8/16, 6:27 PM</a><br><br>

It just seems that although we hear about the conflicts between the restorationists and the conservatives, the Lakelanders that Carr meets seem to have such similar views on everything, except for religion. It would seem more real to me if he encountered more people who had some grievences, even it they on the whole thought highly of the way their country was going. He could meet someone who is worried about the effect that Lakeland's recently opened borders are having on the culture, and someone else who's happy about the open borders because they're looking for other cultural influences not readily found in Lakeland. Someone else could be a struggling artist or musician who's more experimental with his music than the tastes of most Lakelanders and complains about Lakelanders' conservatism in artistic tastes. Someone could be angry about how a canal being built will impact their farm. All of those people would still be glad they live in Lakeland rather than the neighboring republics that are basket cases, just wishing some things were a bit different.<br><br>I think having such encounters would perhaps make the story appeal to a broader audience by showing that different subcultures are alive within Lakeland that don't agree with the dominant culture on everything, but still for the most part respect the positive things the Lakeland system has done. I know for myself I can see a lot of good ideas in the Lakeland system, but the whole story also gives me the sense that I'd feel out of place there. I also recognize that the story takes place in one small time and place in a large country, and the experience of other places and subcultures within Lakeland may be quite different than one would get among government people and those catering to them in the capitol, and one brief visit to a nearby rural area. But, I'd be interested in hearing from a few Lakelanders who have grievences, it would loosen up the sense of conformity that I get from the narrative as it is.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c965120886818395154 title="comment permalink">9/8/16, 7:13 PM</a><br><br>

Their burial grounds, water supply, etc? Of course, it is compatible with the larger goals, and this is how for me it has a certain consistency with the gay marriage issue.<br><br>Back when I was heavily involved with environmental issues, we tried whenever possible to provide a positive goal. We found, e.g., that it was more effective to fight for Wild and Scenic Status for a popular or beautiful remote stream than to always be fighting rearguard actions. After losing our first big battle over the Stanislaus, it became much more effective to fight for positive protection for the Tuolomne and American. Unfortunately, some overly busy person or govt agency almost always has their designs on any unmarred space, so opposition work will be with us, I'm afraid.<br><br>All to say I see the issue as a bit more complex.<br><br>AS for cinema, many early movie houses began life as vaudeville theaters, and continued to serve both functions for long times. I occasionally worked the Paramount in Oakland back in the 80s, and I'm sure it's still hosting live theater, music, and cinema. It was (is, I hope) a beautiful art deco style structure with a full ornate proscenium and a serviceable, if shallow, stage. It contained a full fly-house with counterweight system, though I'm pretty sure Lakeland would have chosen mostly to revert to hemp rigging and sandbags. Probably an orchestra pit, though my memory fades.<br><br>Showing films would be a matter of flying a screen and building in a projection booth somewhere in the house. Well, and a sound system.

They don't tax earned income, defined as wages, salaries, royalties, and dividends below a certain dollar amount per annum. They do tax income from interest, speculation, and any other form of income where you get money for having money, and those are taxed progressively. They also tax every use of natural resources, whether as raw materials or as a dumping ground for waste, at a flat rate that covers the total cost of remediation or replacement, plus all knock-on costs to the rest of society.

I can’t believe you blithely skipped over the developing relationship of Peter and Melanie! Did you perhaps believe that we would not notice? Hehehe!!!! For some strange reason, with all of your recent hints about the direction of the story, I believed that the story would have had a much darker ending... For some reason I had a mental image that the returning train with Peter Carr on board would be taken out by an IED. Dunno why.<br><br>If you may indulge me with recounting a little short story from the sayings of Wu Tzu...<br><br>"The Lord Wen once assembled a number of his subjects to discuss affairs of state: and none could equal him in wisdom, and when he left the council chamber his face was pleased.<br><br>Then Wu advanced and said:<br><br>In ancient times, Lord Chuang of Chu once consulted with his lieges, and none were like unto him in wisdom; and when the Lord left the council chamber his countenance was troubled. Then the Duke Shen asked and said: 'Why is my Lord troubled?' And he answered: 'I have heard that the world is never without sages, and that in every country there are wise men; that good advisers are the foundation of an empire; and friends of dominion. Now, if I, lacking wisdom, have no equal among the multitude of my officers, dangerous indeed is the state of Chu. It grieves me that whereas Prince Chuang of Chu was troubled in a like case my Lord should be pleased.'<br><br>And hearing this Lord Wen was inwardly troubled."<br><br>Just sayin... My, my, but that Wu Tzu dude had a sharp tongue with some great insights! :-)! And, I tell you what, but I have been there too and been the only dissenting voice - which got drowned out.<br><br>Thanks for continuing the Retrotopia story and I look forward to the next instalment. Incidentally, I believe zinc which is quite an important and useful metal is now in short supply and no further large deposits are being exploited because they haven’t been discovered (that is code word for not existing if ever I saw it used that way).<br><br>Incidentally, I have almost finished reading your book Innsmouth.

Crowd funding is a thing, and I suspect your audience is better heeled than you know. I pledge Aus$100 to start the ball rolling. I say this because, while I read books, my partner is not a great reader, but she will sit and watch a movie, and if it interests her she will watch it several times to wring the full meaning out of it. Watching it with her and our son would start a conversation in a way that would never happen with a book, likewise with many other friends and family. I understand your reticence but I would regret not pointing out the opportunity you would miss to do humanity a great service.<br><br>James M Jensen, re a word for regressive progress. Many years ago two friends of mine invented "posterous" as a joke. They used to roll it into conversation just to see if anyone spotted it and asked what it meant. In over a year I was the only tone to spot it. It is a word seeking a meaning, and as mechanical fitters, both could be relied upon to understand the idea that progress is not always better, and sometimes its just posterous.<br><br>Roy Smith, re nuclear power. Safety is moot when your reactor is situated on a big ship that amounts to nothing more than a slow moving target for any one of the many enemies your nation is going hell for leather to generate.

It'd be the domain of street and stage performers working with stage magicians and hobbyists, so the products would be much more in the vein of Georges Méliès films, but that's an art form that so long as the chemical process behind making photosensitive celluloid is not forgotten could continue well into the de-industrial dark ages, and it doesn't have to be the centralized behemoth the film industry is today, or the mind-numbing propaganda engine that's been discussed in the past.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c5653885223649096757 title="comment permalink">9/9/16, 4:58 AM</a><br><br>

Real appealing, and not offering an appealing third alternative. Most people, Amaericans in particular, will readily choose present comfort and hypothetical future crisis versus shitcanning their current lifestyles in the here and now, absent any appealing alternative. Futhermore, most of the movement seems to have the expectation that the lions share of the sacrifices will be borne on the backs of the already embattled and misrerable wage class, so they're gojing to sign up for more misery?<br><br>"I like my TV, SUV and smartphone.

Right now, a lot of soil nutrients take a one-way trip from the field, to the crops, to a city or suburb, and then to an underground septic field, sewage treatment plant, or convenient river or ocean.

When he meets the President on returning, she already knows about his Amour thru her spy network. She makes someone else the Ambassador, demotes him to "Charge d'Affairs" or other lesser position that does allow for dalliance, and sends him there with the delegation anyway.<br>2) There are already cultural differences between the MidWest and Atlantic states in the US.

I was a bit worried I was way off topic.<br><br>Incidentally, I think one big factor in the decline of Noldor was their failure to marry and have kids at a decent rate in Middle-earth. Part of the fault of this is probably basic elvish psychology as Tolkien wrote it, but a lot of it is the fault of the Laws of the Eldar, which don't allow remarriage after the death (or leaving behind in Valinor) of a spouse. This leads to a lot of lonely people, and also to people leaving for Valinor to go see if their partner is out of Mandos yet. It also leads to people not marrying unless everything is absolutely peaceful, which it rarely is in Middle-earth. Seriously, among the descendants of Finwe in the second age you have no marriages and one child, while there are two deaths and the extinction of the direct male line, and the High Kingship. Those laws are not suited to Middle-earth conditions at all. <br><br>Then you've got large numbers of people up and leaving for Valinor every single time there's a war in the second or third age, and people knowing that they can just up and leave if things get bad. I tend to think this reduces their attentiveness to what is going on around them.<br><br>And the desire for things to stay the same, as embodied by the three elven rings. And when the Rings failed at the end of the third age, and change arrived in Lothlorien and Rivendell, what happened? Lothlorien disbands completely, and Rivendell loses much of its population as the elves leave for Valinor. Adaptation to a changed world: epic fail.<br><br>Meanwhile, the elves of Mirkwood successfully pass their Kingship down, move the nation as needed, and are the only elvish realm of decent size surviving into the Fourth age.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c2203364461067655736 title="comment permalink">9/9/16, 12:26 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not confident that the plant would survive a 5.9 earthquake.<br><br>Of course Fukushima is the poster-child example. The nuclear plant there is in a known tsunami zone. There are even monuments dotting Japan's northeast coastline warning of the tsunami peril, including one warning residents not to seek higher ground on the hill on which it stood because it was swept clean in a previous tsunami. Yet the backup generators were installed at ground level!

A major point of the book seems to be that mechanization takes away jobs and stifles the economy. I imagine anyone who's thought much about it realizes that mechanization reduces the need for human labor, but then that's part of the grand vision of progress, isn't it? Machines replacing human labor was going to mean that humanity would be prosperous with far less human effort, everyone could work few hours and have lots of leisure time. It didn't actually work out that way, but I see that vision still holding enough sway that many people reflexively support any mechanization thinking it will make everyone's life better. Although now, the grand vision of progress has faded a lot, replaced by a belief that mechanization and other means of "progress" are simply inevitable and can't be any other way. I see your story addressing the latter view quite well, offering an alternative way forward. Still, I'd be interested in hearing a more in depth discussion of why, even during the zenith of the era of cheap energy, mechanization never delivered the benefits that so many writers up until the mid-20th century (and many even now) assumed would come with it. I read Ecotopia recently for the first time, and I saw the same ideas there too in green clothing, as green technology gave them all a 20 hour workweek.<br><br>I mention this because I personally haven't come across anything that addresses directly the failings of why mechanization fails to lead to the lives of leisure that so many assumed would happen. Sure, there's plenty out there that has pointed out the unsustainability of industrial society, but there must be more to the mechanization issue than just resource limits, as it wasn't delivering as promised even when energy was at its cheapest.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c969638906466983092 title="comment permalink">9/9/16, 3:18 PM</a><br><br>

Instead, we placed two cedar boards on opposite sides of a partition in our basement, and put the eye half of some heavy duty hook and eye sets about 6" apart on each of the boards. We have a total of 7 eyes on each board. We then used hooks as endpieces of laundry line and strung them between the boards in the basement, with an oscillating fan blowing toward them to help with stiffness. (You'll need an extra package of hooks, as the eyes only come with one.) Make sure you find studs or use anchors to put up the boards and they can absolutely hold blankets, quilts, comforters, mattress pads, heavy towels, and other weighty things. We have never had one fall down. <br><br>This knocked our electric budget down by about 30% alone - we only use the dryer now to fluff things on the fluff cycle or to dry batches of little things like socks or dish rags. At our old town house, we had the same system in the dining room - with the boards painted the same color as the walls. When we had guests over, we strung lights and streamers instead of laundry lines, and everybody thought it was awesome. They never realized it was camouflage for laundry drying. :) You can also use hangers to dry many things on your shower curtain rod overnight, with the exhaust fan on to send the humidity outside. They are certainly sturdy enough for heavy towels and comforters. Just make sure you clean the tops of the rods before you toss things over them - they do get dirty up there, believe it or not. <br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c8195910109675087597 title="comment permalink">9/9/16, 3:58 PM</a><br><br>

I was kind of using it as an example of what can be done.<br><br>Everything I have ever heard of the Great American Suburb is indeed abysmal - I looked up some images on-line, and you are right, they are truly dire from the standpoint of being liveable in a car-free society. Did you notice the plot point in last weeks ADR post where Mikkelson is salvaging a gated community? I see you have read The Mandibles? A bit familiar, isn't it? <br><br>However, major catastrophes and civil wars aside, the future I see for suburbs is this - inner cities will become more an more gentrified and expensive, as the wealthy always get first dibs on the best bits, and the best bits will be a walkable neighbourhood. Suburbs will be left to the poor, and will become less and less regulated. Lack of transport will mean that those trapped in the suburbs will have to organise their own communities, which will operate largely on the salvage economy for some time. Those big box stores have lots of steel in them, after all! Many abandoned houses will indeed moulder away, and after a couple of decades there will be a bunch of green space, returning to wilderness, which can then be farmed - much like what is happening in Detroit right now. I think what we may see is the re-emergence of 'villages' - small, walkable communities, little centres of commerce and community retained among the rubble and returning fields of the old suburbs. Of course, there will no doubt be much violence, poverty and degradation to get through first, as is also very much in evidence in Detroit..<br><br>But think how much better it would be if there were political will to help that process along in a safer and more orderly fashion, in the manner of the Atlantic Republic's new government..<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c3744401133921975472 title="comment permalink">9/9/16, 5:10 PM</a><br><br>

With Gates, Brin, Page and Zuckerberg as the success stories of our era, it is natural that innovation became an obsession.

Thank you!<br><br>Scotlyn, too funny. There were similar problems with folklorists in early 20th century Britain trying to find the authentic ancient handed-down-from-forever customs of the folk, while the folk themselves were doing what they normally did and changing things every single year. This is one of the reasons why I never bought the claim that Wicca had been passed down unchanged from the Neolithic...<br><br>Coco, the food's a good point. As for the other, remember that this is a utopian narrative, and having lots of helpful people to explain this, that and the other goes with that genre. If I was writing ordinary science fiction, I'd have done a much rougher, more problematic society -- those make for more interesting plots -- but the point of a utopian narrative is to point up a better way of doing things, and talkative, friendly tour guides are kind of indispensible. <br><br>Cherokee, many thanks for the Wu Tzu story! I wonder if we can pick up a shipping container or two of ancient Chinese sages and turn 'em loose -- the intellectual carnage would be worth the price. Thanks for the tip on zinc -- I'll look into it, and add a zinc shortage to the list of headlines. As for <i>The Weird of Hali</i>, I'm not sure what the current schedule is; I think the publisher's waiting to sell off the first volume in hardback before he brings out the second. (The third is in final edits right now, and the fourth is 3/4 done; you may be interested to know that Dr. Miriam Akeley, as a result of a long and intricate series of events, is crossing the Cerenerian Sea on a galleon to find Randolph Carter...) <br><br>Unknown Eagle Eye, I didn't say that I'm not willing to see <i>Retrotopia</i> in movie form. I said that I'd be extremely wary and demand some degree of creative control. The one time I've had somebody approach me about a movie version of one of my books, the guy wanted to take <i>Star's Reach</i> -- a story about how we're not going to the stars -- and turn it into a story about how we're going to the stars. I could just as easily see some studio decide to film <i>Retrotopia</i>, and then turn it into a morality play in which adopting past technology by definition means you also have to adopt Victorian social mores, massive infant mortality, and ultimately go back to the caves. That's the conventional wisdom, after all, and you don't make a box office hit by contradicting the conventional wisdom. <br><br>Sylvia, that would be hilarious!

Since this is, ahem, a <i>Retro</i>topia, I'm taking the old-fashioned system we have in America, returning it somewhat to its roots, and bringing in a couple of other well-tested features, such as proportional representation, that have also proved themselves in practice. It might be interesting to do a story with some kind of very different system, but again, the point of this narrative is that there's much of value to be quarried from the past. With regard to the corn belt, yes -- corn is grown from the plains states of North America south all the way to the equator, so it'll be viable over the long term as long as there's enough water. <br><br>Ed-M, interesting. I haven't read <i>The Mandibles</i> yet, though I'll doubtless make time to do so one of these days. <br><br>Helix, already covered. Manure, human as well as animal, is purchased by tier four and five municipalities, shipped via canal, and fermented to produce methane for electrical generation; the residue, which contains all the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, is sold back to farm country as fertilizer. Combined with green manures and other soil-building agricultural practices, that yields steady crop yields for the indefinite future. <br><br>Emmanuel, it'll be available for preorder in the not too distant future -- the contract's already been signed, and it's just a matter of final edits at this point. I'll post something when the sales link goes live. As for your other two points, I've pretty much settled the plot, and as for the behavior of East Coast types, I come from laid-back Seattle, and I don't find East Coast people especially abrasive -- I wonder if that stereotype is a bit overblown. <br><br>Pygmycory, you really ought to write this up in detail and put it on a Tolkien website somewhere. Take an Elvish pen name, and present it as an analysis -- written, no doubt, in Mirkwood in the early Fourth Age -- of the rise, decline, and collapse of the Noldorin colony in Middle-Earth during the Second and Third Age. I think a lot of Tolkien fans would delight in it; certainly I would! <br><br>With regard to squatters in the Atlantic Republic, that's a good point, but they're a somewhat different population from the working poor. The squatters have dropped out of the system completely and scrape by on what they can grow, salvage, and barter. Hmm...<br><br>Ozark, that's a major question, and something that probably deserves at least one post all to itself. You're right that there was a massive disjunct between what everyone expected and what actually happened -- several disjuncts, actually.

It is still painfully easy to mis-remember the original settlers of our island. <br><br>For those who are interested, probably mostly the Australian readers, I have just finished reading 'The Secret River' by Kate Grenville, concerning the disastrous clash of cultures when Australia's first white settlers met its original inhabitants. I highly recommend this very thoughtful novel. It is not only pertinent to that time and this place, though. At its heart it examines the immense difficulties faced by Europeans who could only see this continent in terms of their own culture, history, climate and social mores, unable to see how the Aboriginal population had settled so successfully in place.<br><br>I think we face the same difficulties now going into the future - we can't wrench our heads out of the rut of 'business as usual'. What we need to do is face the realities of our situation and come up with a completely different paradigm for our future successful societies to rest on - a paradigm that isn't 'progress at any cost'. <br><br>In Grenville's novel, there is a very, very tiny chink that opens to reveal what might have been possible had the Europeans had the humility to look at another culture and learn from them instead of exterminating them.<br><br>Retrotopia is another lens in which to see another possible future, but to take hold of that, as a global society, does require a lot of humility. Relinquishing our hold on the dream of endless progress and being more powerful than Nature itself is going to be very psychically disturbing on a very large scale.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c8109393053667944782 title="comment permalink">9/9/16, 7:31 PM</a><br><br>

The anonymous author taking to task his fellows for preferring the illusory comforts business-as-usual.

I think he’s the most dangerous kind of con man—he believes his own con.) If Trump should prevail, I think he will be rendered ineffective by the same obstructionism faced by the current President, only much more so.

None of these ideas are new (of course), but maybe it helps to frame them in a heroic, stick-it-to-the-man framework:<br><br> 1. Find a way to shrink the distances between where you eat, sleep, work, shop, socialize, and worship. (When we use less transportation, we demand less oil.)

Unfortunately, I'm very late in the process (no excuse, family life takes a lot of my attention, but this DOES point out that the time to get involved in anything is *early* on!). And by late, I mean that I'm still formulating my own opinion, and in no position to state it 'for the record' anywhere. I MAY get a comment to the planning commission/city council before the deadline next week, but that's not a guarantee.<br><br>I'm wading my way through the city's archived documents related to the General Plan (GP) process, plus trying to parse what's being said in the draft GP. It might not be as horrible as I'd originally perceived - though at this point, the suggestion that anywhere *ought to be growing* is, by itself, horrible if the underlying assumptions aren't addressed (ie. why grow? legitimate influx of new residents because ___good reason here__? Are we making good and appropriate use of what we already have? Where are we failing in our town's current reality and is "growth" just a way to mask/avoid dealing with that? Are we assuming today's access to resources is unending? etc).<br><br>I'm unfamiliar with the way this all works - I note that there is talk in the minutes of various city meetings about "articulating a future vision" and that "a great deal of time has been spent in assessment and organization of appropriate goals and policies," but I'll be darned if I can find when and where that assessment and organization has taken place. Maybe I missed all that given my tendency to focus on mostly-home. Maybe it all happened in city offices.<br><br>But like I mentioned upon opening this comment, the ideal moment is the nascent one. Now, I know, every moment holds some sort of nascency and maybe Chris can give us a good Sun Tzu passage that talks about opportune moments and opening acts and the power of early action. But I realized that even though I'm late to the table as it stands in regard to this Updated General Plan and its proceedings, I'm not late for everything. There'll be a next step and a next one. I'll try to be more informed about local happenings so I take the steps I'm capable of taking. <br><br>Thanks, everyone for the conversation that touched on defending turf vs. setting out a vision and working <b>for</b> something.

In fact, I claim that we do; it's just not optimally distributed. Look at the workforce participation rate. The fraction of working-age adults who are actually working (now just 62%) has been falling for the last 38 years, and those who work part-time ARE counted among the working. However, many workers would rather work more hours for more money than fewer hours for less, and many employers would rather have fewer employees working longer hours than more employees working less (for administrative overhead and scheduling simplicity). There's also an efficiency argument for having organizational memory concentrated within a smaller number of expert employees.<br> <br>So, how do we overcome this bias toward smaller work-forces? An expensive mandatory insurance plan for "full-time workers only" seems like one way to increase the number of part-time positions!<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c6872397885409361024 title="comment permalink">9/10/16, 3:11 PM</a><br><br>

What an amazing ending! Didn't see it coming! Montrose was in on it the whole time! I can't think of the technique you used, but I'm sure you will tell us. It's more than just a plot twist. Also, I love Meeker's casual reference to default, in comparison to the way the current establishment goes apoplectic/apocalyptic about the issue. So retro nations will now stretch from the Atlantic to the foothills of the Rockies? Awesome. We can only assume that post-ceasefire, the South and Texas are rediscovering I'll Take My Stand and carefully considering their own past.<br>Regarding phones, I'm not sure about energy usage, but I do know that rotary dial, loop disconnect, pulse dialing is a very basic, resilient technology that dates to at least Tier 2 or 3 (early 1900s). The only reason it was not deployed by the Bell System was political, not economic. Automatic Electric, the manufacturer of equally indestructible phones for the General System and other Independent telcos, invented the dial and held its patent (hence the "automatic" in its name). The Bell System and Western Electric did not want to pay Automatic for the use of its patent, so they kept using operators. There was one instance in California where Bell bought an exchange and attempted to revert back to operators, but the customers, in true California fashion, protested, and kept their dial service (anyone who has worked California customer service knows how demanding they can be--California is truly "exceptional" in that it really is the "land of exceptions") One nice convenience that Lakeland might reinstate is 5-digit dialing for same-exchange calls. There is a small town in my county, Midway, that still had their old step switch when I was in high school (90's), and they could still call each other by dialing the last five digits. Advertising in Lexington before the 70s would only list the last five ("phone 5-5555 for Bill's Shoe Repair")--I guess all of Lexington at that time was on the same exchange? Supposedly, Lexington's exchange was "AShland" (27X-), but it was never used in advertisements of business phone numbers, only the last five. I most definitely think the old pre-divestiture model of telephone service is Lakeland's model: highly regulated utility, long distance subsidizes local--hence, local service is affordable and unlimited, and long distance costs a fortune, and is only used by businesses and sparingly by individuals. Most homes will be on party lines, and part of the strong regulation is that the phone company is responsible for providing adequate pay phone coverage in poorer urban and high cost rural areas for those who can't afford even a party line.<br>As to touch tone, we didn't get our first pushbutton phone until the late 80s, and my parents would never pay extra for touch tone service, so our pushbutton phones were set to dial pulse until they converted/stop charging up in the 90s. I remember, one by one, going around and replacing the "connecting blocks" (grandparents) and four-prong jacks (parents) with modular jacks as we gradually replaced our phones. Am I the only one who grew up with the "General System" and Automatic Electric phones? My grandparents had a teal green Automatic Electric wall phone with the side chrome switchook in one of those built-in-the-wall phone nooks w/the phone book shelf underneath. Is everyone else a Bell System/Western Electric veteran?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c8808219360866736342 title="comment permalink">9/10/16, 6:46 PM</a><br><br>

Good grief! Our class on telephone use at school had stressed what BAD children we were if we dialed wrong numbers. I thought I was going to be punished. (The teacher seemed to know what the "Empire" business was, but her explanation went over my head. She was dealing with a lot of other, much livelier children.)<br>Years later, the next time I worked up the courage to use a telephone, I got the non-English speaking Greek mother of a classmate on the line, who sounded furious with me.<br>The next time I tried phoning someone was high school, stuttering in sheer terror at a friend.<br><br>@JMG, I think you have already reflected my input (or maybe not) several months back with the mentioning of noblesse oblige. That is such a nice and important element in this story! It may be too much to ask (and I'll understand) to mention tech addiction. A couple of kids pointing at an oldster with his handheld something-or-other, and one of them says, "Our grandpa's tech addiction bankrupted the family!" "What, a hacking?" "No! He just had to keep up with everything, and you know it was all just an illusion anyway."<br>The only reason I bring up this personal refrain of mine is what I know about collapses or other major social transformations is that one family member with an addiction can really wreak havoc. The system changes and while people are getting used to how the new one works, the quick and creative scammers get to work mopping up loose assets. One handy means is servicing addictions for a reward.<br>Katie Singer's most recent "Electronic Silent Spring" newsletter reported: "Dr. Nicholas Kardaras, former clinical professor at Stony Brook Medicine and author of Glow Kids: How Screen Addiction is Hijacking Our Kids--and How to Break the Trance (St. Martin's), has found treating heroin and crystal meth addicts easier than 'lost-in-the-matrix video gamers or Facebook-dependent social media addicts.'" Wondering how they'll cope...<br>Thank you for that link back to the original Green Wizardry post, too! That gets me thinking (like you usually do) that the handiest choice of translation of "wizard" is "mahotsukai," but the image of that here is mostly via Disney and Time Warner. They have a much better, familiar choice from China: "sen'in," and I knew a person with that honorary title, who lived year-round at the top of a mountain. The strongest image there, though, is being able to subsist on mists supplemented with lichens, and it really seems closer to "hermit." But Japan had the kind of people you described, and still has them, in fact, carrying forward old knowledge on local herbs and agricultural techniques, for example, and providing Taoist mystical guidance and purifying/divining ceremonies involving fire or steam. In folk Shinto, it is mostly women doing this, and it is quite empowering to them. The men do something similar in Shugendo (syncretic Buddhism/Shinto), but it seems more regimented. The words for such practitioners would be "miko" and "yamabushi," respectively. I've never encountered an "onmyoji" but that would be a male Shinto wizard.<br>Quin Arbeitman suggested keeping "Green" as it is, because the Japanese are all familiar with it. The problem I see, though, is they are all familiar with it through "Greenpeace," who made a bad first impression. Their own word, "midori" lacks that baggage, but otherwise has a similar meaning, so I will go with that.<br>It will be much much easier translating relevant parts of that post of yours than that two-word title!<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c7903482450849366394 title="comment permalink">9/10/16, 9:43 PM</a><br><br>

I suspect like you do that the drift of plumes from Fukushima was substantially more serious in North America than anyone officially let on. From the sound of things (dying wildlife, reports from stewardesses), Alaska got hit hardest. It is merely anecdotal, but shortly thereafter my aunt in Anchorage developed a sudden Stage 4 breast tumor, and many friends and family living within 100 km south and west of Fukushima developed serious health problems or accelerated signs of aging. I've observed the remains of typhoons travelling across the Pacific, and they tend to head north toward and sometimes into Alaska because of a strong low pressure area over the Okhotsk Sea and Aleutians. While Japan insists on restarting its reactors it might be good to steer clear of Alaska or at least its southern coast.

It suggests a degree of attention to reality far from common these days! <br><br>Samurai, AIM is *exactly* the sort of thing I have in mind. Notice the way the Native peoples did the good cop-bad cop routine on the government, with the very serious peaceful respectable activists on the one side and AIM making as much trouble as possible on the other.

For a couple of hours I was off the map until friendly strangers took me in and informed my parents of my whereabouts. "Why didn't you phone us from school?" my mother asked. Simple. I'd been told over and over that the telephone is "not for little children to play with". It never crossed my mind to use it to phone home.<br><br>As late as the 1970s I was using public phones with a crank handle you had to turn to get the attention of the lady at the exchange. If you had no change on you for the money box but talked nicely to them they would let you phone for free provided you promised to pay later. This was in a small community where everyone knew everyone, so they'd know if you didn't pay.<br><br>The crank-driven telephone generators were also used by the security police to extract confessions. A guy brought one to school one day and we tried it out. Ouch! They give you a nasty kick.<br><br>One modern innovation that must stay is the coiled-coil plastic coated cord connecting the handset to the phone. Those old phones had fabric-covered plain cords that always got twisted, no matter how hard you tried to untwist them. You couldn't just pick the handset up and talk. You had to dangle and untwist the cord first.<br><br>Another retro thing we can do without is the fuse box with the porcelain fuses.

Still, it is a finite planet, and every mined out hole is one less ore source. <br><br>The scrap metal operation I worked for a few years ago was hooked up with an operation in Detroit (iirc) that was working on technology that stripped and recovered the zinc from galvanised steel. It was described as an urban Zinc mine by management and was seen to be a company maker, at least until the greed and corruption killed the company. Don't know what happened to the research.<br><br>Loss of zinc will have far reaching ramifications for livestock agriculture. Even the best galvanised fence eventually needs work, and staples in treated posts do not last. Electric fences have drastically reduced the amount of wire used, but require plastic to provide the insulators, which often break down from the UV light over a decade or two. Perhaps shepherding will make a comeback...... And galvanized steel is mandatory in any yarding and structural frameworks if you want them to last. <br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c7927654057032331340 title="comment permalink">9/11/16, 2:15 AM</a><br><br>

Overlays necessitate 10 (or in the case of California, 11) digit dialing b/c the system has no way of "knowing" which area code you mean to dial w/out dialing it, since two or more area codes are in operation in the same geographic area. California, as usual, is "weird" b/c "1" signals you are dialing a 10 digit number, not making a long distance call--people in large geographic area codes in California can make long distance calls using just the 7 digit phone number.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c3318973175168574980 title="comment permalink">9/11/16, 4:34 PM</a><br><br>

Back in the day, if the second digit was 0 or 1, it had a special meaning. That’s why, if you look at the key pad on a telephone, neither 0 nor 1 have letters assigned to them. So if you dialed RY6-6666 (pronounced R’rleh six) the exchange knew that it was a local number, while if you dial 411 or 911 it switches you to a shared, public service number. It’s that 1 in the second digit that made the crossbars do something different.<br><br>When we got national dialing with area codes, the second digit of all area codes was either 0 or 1, which told the switching equipment that you’d just dialed an area code instead of an exchange. That was enough to give 128 area codes, which was plenty. Right? Um, no. That’s why you have to dial all ten digits - with the number of numbers we need, those very convenient 0 and 1 clues went away.<br><br>All-number calling happened when they figured out how to use those 0 and 1 codes for local exchanges. Since they didn’t have letters, they moved away from those easy-to-remember mnemonics. My “local exchange,” for example, is 803. Look at the phone pad, and there is no way you can make a mnemonic out of that.<br><br>There are mnemonic techniques that you can use to memorize these things. Using the Major System, 803 is 8 -&gt; f or v, 0 -&gt; s, z or a soft c, and 3 -&gt; m. Season with vowels to taste. So 803 could be fizzam. Good way of confusing someone who isn’t in on the system.<br><br>When an area code runs out of numbers, there are two possible ways of dealing with it. One is to split the area code, which is what happened here in New Mexico a few years ago, and what’s happened in the Chicago area where I’m from, a bit farther back. The other is to simply overlay another area code on the whole area, which is what happened in the Atlanta area.<br><br>Both of them cause quite a bit of pain while they’re happening, and both of them mean you’re going to have to dial 10 or 11 digits at least part of the time. That extra 1 on the front is more of a billing convenience than anything else today: it tells the equipment that you’re dialing long distance.<br><br>@Shane<br><br>Back when I was a wee lad, we dialed 4 digits for local calls, and put a fifth digit on the front for a couple of different exchanges. This was in the 50s, out in the country where we still had a party line. Phones weren’t all that common until well into the second half of the 20th century. My grandmother had a pay phone in her home, for example - she got tired of moochers using her phone on her phone bill, and badgered the phone company into installing it.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c4844289627022198694 title="comment permalink">9/11/16, 4:56 PM</a><br><br>

Regarding trip switches, which we call circuit breakers, I agree, but I think that copper will be in too short a supply in Lakeland to continue three-wired grounded (earthed) service, and will revert to two-wire ungrounded (unearthed) service. To this day, many advanced countries do not ground their outlets, and personally, if I had an older home with two-wire service, I wouldn't spend the money to retrofit it w/three-wire grounded unless it was knob &amp; tube. If it was two-wire "snakeskin" Romex, it would be safe enough for me, and I'd keep it and the historic two-pronged outlets. While I'm sure it has happened, I've never been shocked by an appliance w/the ground pin removed, and I don't know of anyone who has. If I had a house w/two-wire Romex, I'd only put in a few grounded outlets for electronics which require grounding for the surge protector to work properly.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c2461664095375453802 title="comment permalink">9/11/16, 5:13 PM</a><br><br>

All I mean by this is that the local population is able to acquire a varied diet and plenty of it without spending most of their waking hours gathering, trapping or growing food, and without moving around all the time.<br><br>In order to have a reliable food surplus for a city sized population, you need agriculture. However, you can have a complex of sedentary villages within easy traveling distance of each other without agriculture, relying entirely on hunting, fishing, gathering, and low-tech methods of managing the hunting and gathering grounds for maximum productivity (e.g. lighting small fires in the forest to clear out old brush and make space for plants that provide nutritious browse for the deer.) It isn't possible to do this everywhere on the planet, only in areas that are especially rich with plants and animals humans can eat.<br><br>The Garden of Eden story has been explained as a memory of a prehistoric time when the Tigris-Euphrates delta was a place like that. What happened during the Neolithic Revolution was that the farmers and herders outbred the hunter-gatherers, went looking for additional lands to farm and graze, and they drove the pre-agricultural people off the richest lands into the wastelands that the farmers didn't want. If you don't have access to the salmon run, the fertile river bottom land, the most species-rich forest, etc. , it takes a lot more time to gather and catch enough food, and big settled hunter-gatherer villages are no longer possible. <br><br>Most of the places on earth where those villages once were have been built over by later cultures or erased by changes in topography or vegetation. The ones that survived long enough to be recorded, or that left substantial artifacts, are flukes.<br>Between the ice ages there may have been a lot of them, and during the last ice age there may have been others on coasts that are now under the wave.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c2940486178193387438 title="comment permalink">9/11/16, 9:37 PM</a><br><br>

A good example of non-trivial, large-scale effort innovation that literally changed the world would be the development of nuclear weapons (something I note is absent from this story). How do you address this? The Lakeland republic is nice and all, but they're basically prey to whatever nearby power decides to build a nuke, and the Confederacy should be able to do it (they got the labs and production facilities for nuclear materials in Nashville). It doesn't matter how sustainable or well-developed your society is if several such weapons can wipe you out, even if they are a long-shot innovation-wise. How does the Lakeland republic respond to that? With its own arsenal?

Before the mid 90s, you could call long distance within your area code by dialing 1+just the number, after, you had to include the area code even if it was the same, b/c the system could no long differentiate based on the middle digit. This is how California won its exception, California customers complained, and the state PUC mandated that customers be able to call w/in their area code by just dialing the number, regardless of local or long distance--dialing "1" just signaled you were calling outside your area code. 10 digit dialing is not required unless you live in an overlay--my area code, 859, is not overlaid, and we make local calls by dialing just the phone number.<br>Regarding voltage, I read online that 220-240 is the preferred voltage, but that by the time it was made the standard in the mid-20th century, Americans already had way more electrical appliances than people in the rest of the world, so it would be very difficult to switch, and people would have to scrap all their appliances, so we kept 110-120V, despite its deficiencies (thicker wires, less voltage pressure, more line loss). However, we have the better frequency, 60 Hz vs. the 50 Hz the rest of the world uses--supposedly, 60 Hz is better for electrical motors, etc., but that other countries use 50 Hz. b/c it is more compatible w/the metric system.<br>JMG, if Lakeland is retro, and was under a longstanding trade embargo, I'm assuming that it scrapped the dual metric/customary measurements currently used in the US for strictly customary units for simplicity's sake. Please let us know if any metric survives in Lakeland--I was told that even the medical system had old customary units for pharmaceuticals/etc.<br>Extremely off topic, but my first call center job was a 411 operator. I got "ma'am'd" all the time. At first, if they asked, I'd tell them I was a Sir, then there'd be that awkward pause. After a while, I was just, "Frack it", and started doing phone drag. I'd even have my work drag name, "Jayne". Phone drag is much easier--you don't have to put on a face, wear stilettos or sequins. The real interesting part was the guys flirting with you. "I'm sure you're a real pretty lady." Me: (giggle)"oh, honey, you wouldn't think so if you saw me." "No, I know you must be a real pretty lady."

Most of the sophistication in them comes from ensuring that they are as efficient as possible in achieving fission and fusion, and the rocket delivery system. But the nukes themselves will work just fine with a less sophisticated explosion system and a larger amount of fissible material, and they can be flown and dropped instead of rocketed. They are undeniably powerful weapons that can wipe out cities and almost guarantee complete safety from invasion to the country that has them. I find it odd that the greatest societally disruptive advance of the last two thousand years gets dismissed out of hand as a phallic symbol. Only two of them were ever used in war, and killed over two hundred thousand people. One could argue that if Texas and the Confederacy in the Retrotopia story had nukes, the hot war over oil would not have happened because of the threat it might escalate. It is a non-trivial topic, and I find it odd that it is completely skirted in the story, which I otherwise really like. One could argue that the invention of nuclear weapons is the reason why our society is developing towards this techno neo-feudalism, as it is.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c7696786427679466659 title="comment permalink">9/13/16, 6:29 AM</a><br><br>

I don't believe I specified a time line. There are a lot of places where you don't have to dial ten digits, not just California. All it requires is not being able to assign a 0 or 1 as the first digit of an exchange.<br><br>To explicate a bit more: with those nice alphabetic prefixes, they couldn't assign a 0 or 1 for either the first or second digit. That's 640 possible exchanges in an area code. Allowing 0 or 1 in the second digit expanded it to 800 and in both digits to 1,000, which is over a 50% increase in the available number of digits.<br><br>What you lose in the first bump is the ability to automatically distinguish an area code from an exchange. What you lose in the second is the ability to just dial 1 + 7 digits for out-of-area-code numbers.<br><br>It wasn't cell phones that caused the expansion in numbers. Part of it was Direct Inward Dialing. A company used to have one phone number for a lot of lines; their operator or PBX took the next few numbers to get to the right phone. Now they'll assign you a block of numbers so every employee has cis own number.<br><br>Then one of the phone companies started giving out unique phone numbers for "friends and family" dialing. And there are blocks taken up by alarm companies, where they give each of their clients a unique phone number to call rather than making their devices more complicated by having them dial a code number.<br><br>We are using a lot more phone numbers than strictly necessary.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c5941305182778626698 title="comment permalink">9/13/16, 12:13 PM</a><br><br>

Of course the general public considers anyone not living an industrial lifestyle to be primitive. But when anthropologists started studying them in depth, they found they were truly different from other uncontacted peoples; their culture did not show the same depth and maturity the others did. Linguistic and genetic analyses showed that they had diverged from the main population only a few centuries ago, around the time Europeans started showing up and taking slaves. Thus the anthropologists think the Tasaday are actually refugees. But in this context, it is the idea that there is a cultural clock showing how mature a society is that I find fascinating, and I suspect modern industrial society is quite young on that scale.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c2043924302636906997 title="comment permalink">9/13/16, 3:10 PM</a><br><br>

No prefix ever had a "1" or a "0" in the middle prior to the mid 90s, and no area code ever had anything but a "0" or a "1" in the middle before the mid 90s. 10-digit dialing is conditioned on whether the area code is overlaid or not, not the presence of a "0" or a "1".

The yearly maintenance budget for the thousands of nuclear weapons the U.S. has is around 25 billion. The Air Force is about 170 billion. Just from that, the nukes are more efficient as a deterrent weapon, and even more efficient if you simply don't build thousands of them, since no one really needs that many. In the Retrotopia world, probably having a couple of dozen reliable nukes+delivery systems would be enough for a deterrent for a regional power, since most states do not have that many cities to target. You don't need enough nukes to wipe the whole continent, merely to threaten a single belligerent.<br><br>That being said, I'd rally like to hear from the author on this.<br><br>The bombing of Dresden (and of Tokyo) were done with conventional bombers, sure. Dresden required over 1200 heavy bombers. Nagasaki and Hiroshima required just 1. Dresden killed 25000 people. Each bomb dropped on Japan killed at least 40,000. By any metric, the nuke is, unfortunately, a much more cost-effective and efficient weapon. It needs less maintenance than 3,900 tons of bombs and 1200 aircraft, and even in the modern age it requires less maintenance than the equivalent destructive power in the form of airplanes or tanks. We could go through the manufacturing costs and such, but, again, the cost of production of a single nuke and a single plane/rocket to carry it is cheaper and faster than the cost of 3900 tons of conventional bombs and 1200 heavy bombers. The argument of simplifying costs and keeping things as efficient as possible, often used in the story, pushes any rational actor to adopt nukes. You can have a citizen's millitia for minor border disuptes, and nukes to ensure no real invasion ever starts, and it would work.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c3962784163761733902 title="comment permalink">9/13/16, 10:36 PM</a><br><br>

It is the knowledge side of things that interest me now.<br><br>I.e. think about fire-fighters. Sure, they have much more technology now, but its benefits are eatten away by the challenges posed by having to act in a more techno-rich environment: Mechanical ladders that fall short of reaching to the highest buildings, fire retardant in garments that have to stand much hotter chemical fires, respirators that have to protect against not just regular smoke but much more toxic fumes, etc.<br><br>Yet, modern fire fighters are nonetheless more effective than their peers from 150 years ago. I suspect this has to do with having a relatively small number of people devoting<br>their lives to figure out the details of how fires work, and what can or cannot humans do to mess with the natural working of fires in an effective way. Then there is a larger number fo people that devotes a fair share of their time to learn that knowledge, distill specific tactics and operation procedures, and drill down those into becoming teams of people that can fight fires effectively.<br><br>From those come types 2 and 3. Some of those knowledges can be just passed down indefinitely was long as there are youngsters willing to pass the torch to the next generation. But others require a minimum of infrastructure to keep going. I don't see modern fire-fighter stations in counties of tier 1, 2, and maybe 3; though I do see every tier can have organized, trained volunteers that do hold day jobs but still serve as first (and in some cases, only) responders when needed.<br><br>I do think this part was kind of covered in the military side of things, when Clnl Papas explained the defense strategy of Lakeland Republic, but at first I dismissed this as a special case and did not think about its implications for other professions as well.

Fire-fighters come to mind, as do law enforcement. It is not hard to pick a bunch of (mostly) law abiding citizens that are not shy about using (a proper level of) violence to put trouble makers in their place, but then you end up with frontier/pose level of justice, and all the fine grained stuff about patrol work, or detective work, etc, just gets lost.<br><br>John, you probably will not open new arcs for the sake of this, but maybe you could hint at this issue while discussing the cases that are already there?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c7385193366499795590 title="comment permalink">9/19/16, 9:52 AM</a><br><br>

It explains why the Montrose administration's biggest struggle may be disentangling the Atlantic Republic from the World Bank*, why the rentier class seems to be swooping into its grave like cummings' shrill collective myth**, and why you may be wrong about AI being impossible:<br><br>http://aberrant-eyes.tumblr.com/post/142123318928/capitalism-as-geobiological-extinction-event<br><br>"What happens when human survival stops being an absolute limit on capital’s ability to infinitely expand itself? What will it mean when humanity becomes yet another barrier for capital to overcome? [...]<br><br>"By some estimates, upwards of 70% of the volume of trades in the US stock market are made by automated algorithms. These high frequency trades occur thousands of times per second at the speed of light across a globally-integrated communications infrastructure constructed to coordinate the planetary distribution of resources. This tendency in political economy is a marked shift from a few short decades ago, when trading times were measured in hours if not days. Vitally, human agency is irrelevant to these decisions. The agents which now operates a majority of finance capital are nonhuman ones. Humanity is rapidly becoming obsolete to the functioning of market economies. [I]t is naive to presume that human survival imposes an absolute limit on capital’s operation - that capitalism will reach the point at which it threatens humanity’s planetary dominance and then stop. Indeed, as the trend towards market automation shows, the more machinic, the more alien, the more inhuman which capital becomes, the more efficient its operation. [...]<br><br>"Just as the aerobic mode of production revolutionised and terminated the anaerobic population which sustained it, planetary technocapital is rapidly approaching the point at which humanity will no longer be a necessary component in its functioning. Beyond that? It’s possible all of human society to this point has served only as a precondition for the capitalised and posthuman beings still yet to come. Human history until now may be a mere trace to be detected in the geological record in a thousand thousand years by our unrecognisable descendants, as moved by our deaths as we are by the suffering of our anaerobic ancestors."<br><br>Or, alternatively, they could drive us into extinction and then, with nobody around to do maintenance on the computers that run them, follow us.<br><br>TL;DR The world economy is dominated by the closest thing to artificial intelligence we have, and we exist in the same relationship to it that the anaerobic bacteria had to the cyanobacteria at the time of the Great Oxygen Catastrophe, or possibly that the ant has to the brainworm as it climbs to the top of the leaf and waits to be devoured.<br><br>* Unless they already have and I missed or forgot where you mentioned it.<br>** Line 9 of "all ignorance toboggans into know"<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c6806881570023349496 title="comment permalink">9/20/16, 6:25 AM</a><br><br>

This is not correct. HFT does not increase economic activity, just realocate financial resources backing preexistent economic activity over and over again.<br><br>If this realocation was done with the purpose of making the economy more "efficient" (for some objective definition of that word) you might be onto something; you'd see how HFT would asymptotically approach some "ideal allocation" of money to make maximum use of industrial capacity or whatever. That is not the case. I've never worked in the financial industry, but know people who have done so (at least one as HFT programmer). The utility function they are pursueing is short term financial gains. Sure, the algorithms are complex and try to detect patterns that humans cannot, but more often than not those patterns are related with the volatility of markets rather than the industrial capacity itself.<br><br>At the end of day, HFT does not uncover the mythic long-term pulse of the economy, but just tries to arbitrage the process of financial allocation itself by analyzing the noise in the signal and placing buy/sell calls ahead of unsophisticated investors (or other HFT machines executing an almost equivalent algorithm just a handful of microseconds slower than yourself). HFT transactions do not set new trends, they just rip off a few cents, here and there, from the naturally ocurring trends; and they do so at the cost of making the whole system much more chaotic.<br><br>That HFT is seen as the shiny new thing is, again IMHO, not a sign of strengt but of weakness. If professional investors had bigger fish to fry they would not dream on pursuing this strategy that forces them to deal with finicky computers and the weirdos that control them. To me, it looks like they are scrapping the bottom of the barrel and are using computers to scoop into the crevices that their own hands are too big and clumsky to reach.<br><br>Now... if you add the Internet of Things into the mix... that's a whole new dimension of hurt that computers could cause once they are left to pursue their mechanistic, ill-defined goals in the physical world.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-only-way-forward.html#c8262650482248012212 title="comment permalink">9/21/16, 10:23 AM</a><br><br>
