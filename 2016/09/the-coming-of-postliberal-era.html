One of the big challenges faced by any student of current events is that of seeing past the turmoil of the present moment to catch the deep trends shaping events on a broader scale. It’s a little like standing on a beach, without benefit of tide tables, and trying to guess whether the tide’s coming in or going out. Waves surge, break, and flow back out to sea; the wind blows this way and that; it takes time, and close attention to subtle details, before you can be sure whether the sea is gradually climbing the beach or just as gradually retreating from it. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Over the last year or so, though, it’s become increasingly clear to me that one of the great tides of American politics has turned and is flowing out to sea. For almost precisely two hundred years, this country’s political discourse has been shaped—more powerfully, perhaps, than by any other single force—by the loose bundle of ideas, interests, and values we can call American liberalism. That’s the tide that’s turning. The most important trends shaping the political landscape of our time, to my mind, are the descent of the liberal movement into its final decadence, and the first stirrings of the postliberal politics that is already emerging in its wake. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To make sense of what American liberalism has been, what it has become, and what will happen in its aftermath, history is an essential resource. Ask a believer in a political ideology to define it, and you’ll get one set of canned talking points; ask an opponent of that ideology to do the same thing, and you’ll get another—and both of them will be shaped more by the demands of moment-by-moment politics than by any broader logic. Trace that ideology from its birth through its adolescence, maturity, and decline into senescence, and you get a much better view of what it actually means. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s go back, then, to the wellsprings of the American liberal movement. Historians have argued for a good long time about the deeper roots of that movement, but its first visible upsurge can be traced to a few urban centers in the coastal Northeast in the years just after the War of 1812. Boston—nineteenth century America’s San Francisco—was the epicenter of the newborn movement, a bubbling cauldron of new social ideas to which aspiring intellectuals flocked from across the new Republic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Any of my readers who think that the naive and effervescent idealism of the 1960s was anything new need to read Nathaniel Hawthorne’s <i>The Blithedale Romance</i>; it's set in the Massachusetts counterculture of the early nineteenth century, and most of the action takes place on a commune. That’s the context in which American liberalism was born. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
From the very beginning, it was a movement of the educated elite. Though it spoke movingly about uplifting the downtrodden, the downtrodden themselves were permitted very little active part in it. It was also as closely intertwined with Protestant Christianity as the movement of the 1960s was with Asian religions; ministers from the Congregationalist and Unitarian churches played a central role in the movement throughout its early years, and the major organizations of the movement—the Anti-Slavery Societies, the Temperance League, and the Non-Resistant League, the first influential American pacifist group—were closely allied with churches, and staffed and supported by clergymen. Both the elitism and the Protestant Christian orientation, as we’ll see, had a powerful influence on the way American liberalism evolved over the two centuries that followed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Three major social issues formed the framework around which the new movement coalesced. The first was the abolition of slavery; the second was the prohibition of alcohol; the third was the improvement of the legal status of women. (The movement traversed a long and convoluted road before this latter goal took its ultimate form of legal and social equality between the genders.) There were plenty of other issues that attracted their own share of attention from the movement—dietary reform, dress reform, pacifism, and the like—but all of them shared a common theme: the redefinition of politics as an expression of values. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s take a moment to unpack that last phrase. Politics at that time, and at most other periods throughout human history, was understood as a straightforward matter of interests—in the bluntest of terms, who got what benefits and who paid what costs. Then and for most of a century thereafter, for example, one of the things that happened in the wake of every Presidential election is that the winner’s party got to hand out federal jobs en masse to its supporters. It was called the “spoils system,” as in “to the victor belongs the spoils;” people flocked to campaign for this or that presidential candidate as much in the hope of getting a comfortable federal job as for anyother reason. Nobody saw anything wrong with that system, because politics was about interests.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the same way, there’s no evidence that anybody in the Constitutional Convention agonized about the ethical dimensions of the notorious provision that defined each slave as being 3/5ths of a person. I doubt the ethical side of the matter ever crossed any of their minds, because politics was not about ethics or any other expression of values—it was about interests—and the issue was simply one of finding a compromise that allowed each state to feel that its interests would be adequately represented in Congress. Values, in the thought of the time, belonged to church and to the private conscience of the individual; politics was about interests pure and simple.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
(We probably need to stop here for a moment to deal with the standard response: “Yes, but they should have known better!” This is a classic example of chronocentrism. Just as ethnocentrism privileges the beliefs, values, and interests of a particular ethnic group, chronocentrism does the same thing to the beliefs, values, and interests of a particular time. Chronocentrism is enormously common today, on all sides of the political and cultural landscape; you can see it when scientists insist that people in the Middle Ages should have known better than to believe in astrology, for example, or when Christians insist that the old Pagans should have known better than to believe in polytheist religions. In every case, it’s simply one more attempt to evade the difficult task of understanding the past.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Newborn American liberalism, though, rejected the division between politics and values. Their opposition to slavery, for example, had nothing to do with the divergent economic interests of the industrializing northern states and the plantation economy of the South, and everything to do with a devoutly held conviction that chattel slavery was morally wrong. Their opposition to alcohol, to the laws that denied civil rights to women, to war, and to everything else on the lengthy shopping list of the movement had to do with moral values, not with interests. That’s where you see the impact of the movement’s Protestant heritage: it took values out of the church and tried to apply them to the world as a whole.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At the time, that was exotic enough that the moral crusades just mentioned got about as much political traction at the time as the colorful fantasies of the 1960s did in their own day. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Both movements were saved from complete failure by the impact of war. The movement of the 1960s drew most of its influence on popular culture from its opposition to the Vietnam War, which is why it collapsed nearly without a trace when the war ended and the draft was repealed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The earlier movement had to wait a while for its war, and in the meantime it very nearly destroyed itself by leaping on board the same kind of apocalyptic fantasy that kicked the New Age movement into its current death spiral four years ago. In the late 1830s, frustrated by the failure of the perfect society to show up as quickly as they desired, a great many adherents of the new liberal movement embraced the prophecy of William Miller, a New England farmer who believed that he had worked out from the Bible the correct date of the Second Coming of Christ. When October 22, 1844 passed without incident, the same way December 21, 2012 did, the resulting “Great Disappointment” was a body blow to the movement. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By then, though, one of the moral crusades being pushed by American liberals had attracted the potent support of raw economic interest. The division between northern and southern states over the question of slavery was not primarily seen at the time as a matter of ethics; it was a matter of competing interests, like every other political question, though of course northern politicians and media were quick to capitalize on the moral rhetoric of the Abolitionists. At issue was the shape of the nation’s economic future. Was it going to be an agrarian society producing mostly raw materials for export, and fully integrated into a global economy centered on Britain—the southern model? Or was it going to go its own way, raise trade barriers against the global economy, and develop its own industrial and agricultural economy for domestic consumption—the northern model? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Such questions had immediate practical implications, because government policies that favored one model guaranteed the ruin of the other. Slavery was the linchpin of the Southern model, because the big southern plantations required a vast supply of labor at next to no cost to turn a profit, and so it became a core issue targeted by northern politicians and propagandists alike. Read detailed accounts of the struggles in Congress between northern and southern politicians, though, and you’ll find that what was under debate had as much to do with trade policy and federal expenditures. Was there to be free trade, which benefited the South, or trade barriers, which benefited the North? Was the federal budget to pay for canals and roads, which benefited northern interests by getting raw materials to factories and manufactured products to markets, but were irrelevant to southern interests, which simply needed riverboats to ship cotton and tobacco to the nearest seaport? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even the bitter struggles over which newly admitted states were to have slave-based economies, and which were not, had an overwhelming economic context in the politics of the time. The North wanted to see the western territories turned into a patchwork of family farms, producing agricultural products for the burgeoning cities of the eastern seaboard and the Great Lakes and buying manufactured goods from northern factories; the South wanted to see those same territories made available for plantations that would raise products for export to England and the world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yet the ethical dimension became central to northern propaganda, as already noted, and that helped spread the liberal conviction that values as well as interests had a place in the political dialogue. By 1860, that conviction had become widespread enough that it shaped thinking south of the Mason-Dixon line. As originally written, for example, the first line of the Confederate song “The Bonny Blue Flag” ran “fighting for the property we won by honest toil”—and no one anywhere had any illusions about the identity, or skin color, of the property in question. Before long, though, it was rewritten as “fighting for our liberty, with treasure, blood and toil.” The moment that change occurred, the South had already lost; it’s entirely possible to argue for slavery on grounds of economic interest, but once the focus of the conversation changes to values such as liberty, slavery becomes indefensible. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So the Civil War raged, the Confederacy rose and fell, the Northern economic model guided American economic policy for most of a century thereafter, and the liberal movement found its feet again. With slavery abolished, the other two primary goals took center stage, and the struggle to outlaw alcohol and get voting rights for women proceeded very nearly in lockstep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 18th Amendment, prohibiting the manufacture and sale of alcohol in the US, and the 19th Amendment, granting women the right to vote, were passed in 1919 and 1920 respectively, and even though Prohibition turned out to be a total flop, the same rhetoric was redirected toward drugs (most were legal in the US until the 1930s) and continues to shape public policy today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then came the Great Depression, and with the election of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932—and above all with his landslide reelection victory in 1936, when the GOP carried only two states—the liberal movement became the dominant force in American political life. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Triumph after triumph followed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The legalization of unions, the establishment of a tax-funded social safety net, the forced desegregation of the South: these and a galaxy of other reforms on the liberal shopping list duly followed. The remarkable thing is that all these achievements took place while the liberal movement was fighting opponents from both sides. To the right, of course, old-fashioned conservatives still dug in their heels and fought for the interests that mattered to them, but from the 1930s on, liberals also faced constant challenge from further left. American liberalism, as already mentioned, was a movement of the educated elite; it focused on helping the downtrodden rather than including them; and that approach increasingly ran into trouble as the downtrodden turned out to have ideas of their own that didn’t necessarily square with what liberals wanted to do for them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Starting in the 1970s, in turn, American liberalism also ended up facing a third source of challenges—a new form of conservatism that borrowed the value-centered language of liberalism but used a different set of values to rally support to its cause: the values of conservative Protestant Christianity. In some ways, the rise of the so-called “new conservatism” with its talk about “family values” represented the final, ironic triumph of the long struggle to put values at the center of political discourse. By the 1980s, every political faction in American public life, no matter how crass and venial its behavior or its goals, took care to festoon itself with some suitable collection of abstract values. That’s still the case today; nobody talks about interests, even when interests are the obvious issue. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus you get the standard liberal response to criticism, which is to insist that the only reason anyone might possibly object to a liberal policy is because they have hateful values. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s take current US immigration policy as an example. This limits the number of legal immigrants while tacitly allowing unlimited illegal immigration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are solid pragmatic reasons for questioning the appropriateness of that policy. The US today has the highest number of permanently unemployed people in its history, incomes and standards of living for the lower 80% of the population have been moving raggedly downward since the 1970s, and federal tax policies effectively subsidize the offshoring of jobs. That being the case, allowing in millions of illegal immigrants who have, for all practical purposes, no legal rights, and can be employed at sweatshop wages in substandard conditions, can only drive wages down further than they’ve already gone, furthering the impoverishment and immiseration of wage-earning Americans. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
These are valid issues, dealing with (among other things) serious humanitarian concerns for the welfare of wage-earning Americans, and they have nothing to do with racial issues—they would be just as compelling if the immigrants were coming from Canada.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Yet you can’t say any of this in the hearing of a modern American liberal. If you try, you can count on being shouted down and accused of being a racist. Why? I’d like to suggest that it’s because the affluent classes from which the leadership of the liberal movement is drawn, and which set the tone for the movement as a whole, benefit directly from the collapse in wages that has partly been caused by mass illegal immigration, since that decrease in wages has yielded lower prices for the goods and services they buy and higher profits for the companies for which many of them work, and whose stocks many of them own. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That is to say, a movement that began its history with the insistence that values had a place in politics alongside interests has ended up using talk about values to silence discussion of the ways in which its members are pursuing their own interests. That’s not a strategy with a long shelf life, because it doesn’t take long for the other side to identify, and then exploit, the gap between rhetoric and reality. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Ironies of this sort are anything but unusual in political history. It’s astonishingly common for a movement that starts off trying to overturn the status quo in the name of some idealistic abstraction or other to check its ideals at the door once it becomes the status quo. If anything, American liberalism held onto its ideals longer than most and accomplished a great deal more than many, and I think that most of us—even those who, like me, are moderate Burkean conservatives—are grateful to the liberal movement of the past for ending such obvious abuses as chattel slavery and the denial of civil rights to women, and for championing the idea that values as well as interests deserve a voice in the public sphere. It deserves the modern equivalent of a raised hat and a moment of silence, if no more, as it finally sinks into the decadence that is the ultimate fate of every successful political movement. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The current US presidential election shows, perhaps better than anything else, just how far that decadence has gone. Hillary Clinton’s campaign is floundering in the face of Trump’s challenge because so few Americans still believe that the liberal shibboleths in her campaign rhetoric mean anything at all. Even among her supporters, enthusiasm is hard to find, and her campaign rallies have had embarrassingly sparse attendance. Increasingly frantic claims that only racists, fascists, and other deplorables support Trump convince no one but true believers, and make the concealment of interests behind shopworn values increasingly transparent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Clinton may still win the election by one means or another, but the broader currents in American political life have clearly changed course. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s possible to be more precise. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, in stark contrast to Clinton, have evoked extraordinarily passionate reactions from the voters, precisely because they’ve offered an alternative to a status quo pervaded by the rhetoric of a moribund liberalism. In the same way, in Britain—where the liberal movement followed a somewhat different trajectory but has ended up in the same place—the success of the Brexit campaign and the wild enthusiasm with which Labour Party voters have backed the supposedly unelectable Jeremy Corbyn show that the same process is well under way there. Having turned into the captive ideology of an affluent elite, liberalism has lost the loyalty of the downtrodden that once, with admittedly mixed motives, it set out to help. That’s a loss it’s unlikely to survive. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Over the decades ahead, in other words, we can expect the emergence of a postliberal politics in the United States, England, and quite possibly some other countries as well. The shape of the political landscape in the short term is fairly easy to guess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Watch the way the professional politicians in the Republican Party have flocked to Hillary Clinton’s banner, and you can see the genesis of a party of the affluent demanding the prolongation of free trade, American intervention in the Middle East, and the rest of the waning bipartisan consensus that supports its interests. Listen to the roars of enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump—or better still, talk to the not inconsiderable number of Sanders supporters who will be voting for Trump this November—and you can sense the emergence of a populist party seeking the abandonment of that consensus in defense of its very different interests. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
What names those parties will have is by no means certain yet, and a vast number of other details still have to be worked out. One way or another, though, it’s going to be a wild ride. </div>

George W. Bush and the Koch Brothers, rightfully lambasted in decades past as the epitome of warmongering and pay-to-play politics, are now trumpeted by my Hillary-supporting friends as Trump opponents and evidence that "those who really matter" lack confidence in him. The Iraq War has shifted in the national discourse from a national disgrace indicating incompetence at the highest levels to a regretful, unavoidable necessity. I remember attending a left-wing anti-NAFTA panel when I was in college, but now the Daily Beast and other hip, young "liberal" media tell me it's ridiculous to question the logic of free trade. It is as if veils are falling away everywhere you look.<br><br>I notice, though, that you gave us examples of the religious movements that powered past political eras, but nothing for this one. 2016 should be remembered as the year the "flat earth" movement somehow became part of several different spheres of actual public discourse. As <a href=http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/flat-earth-bob-outside-physicist/431583/ rel=nofollow>The Atlantic</a> pointed out, it's not even an illogical theory; rather, like all mad theories, it's far too logical. It fits the logic of something we all both perceive and desire: that the "experts" are lying to us about the fundamental nature of reality, that the "world" as we know it is a myth. It's not very original, but I think it's accurate to say that the dominant religion of America this year is conspiracy theory. We have stepped over the line into real, actual gnosticism, and only the Demiurge knows what comes next.<br><br><a href=#c7685566770475515585 title="comment permalink">9/28/16, 10:54 AM</a><br><br>

Last election, I was considered an extreme liberal and now I am considered an extreme conservative, despite the fact that my views haven't changed much at all. Just because I don't believe every working class person who doesn't listen to Beethoven is a secret Klansman deserving of ridicule and humiliation, I get called a racist everyday. Oh well.<br><br>I wonder if you will ever write anything about the current trend of calling people "ignorant" and "uneducated" all the time. (Maybe you have, I am just beginning to read through your posts.) I find the current worship of education to be a little disturbing, since it implies that non-intellectuals are stupid, and also tends to imply that intellectuals can't be self-educated. I worry it will lead to free college education, which will then cause people to spend great amounts of tax-payer money earning women's studies degrees, or other things which won't benefit society at all.(No offense if you are in favor of free college!)<br><br>Thanks again for writing your blog- it is very refreshing and insightful!!<br><br><a href=#c1661775926731026039 title="comment permalink">9/28/16, 12:11 PM</a><br><br>

There is a similar viciousness around many Trump supporters - not even most of them - but the accusations of racism aren't entirely misplaced!

I'm going to have to chew on this one a while, I suspect, but a couple of initial thoughts and reactions.<br><br>I was engaged in a recent conversation with someone who would very easily fall into the category of liberal as you've described, with the typical technocentric views. I had been proposing that we might better focus on developing well-paying jobs for American workers, rather than notions of efficiency, output, and trade. During the discussion he pointed out that automation was as much or more a culprit than trade when it came to job-loss (I'd accept that it does have a significant role) and that is why we need to institute a UBI (universal basic income). The conversation had ended at that point, but my first thoughts turned to your discussion of intermediation -- and that UBI is a good way to destroy human society. My labor is irrelevant, I merely consume. (Setting aside the fact that the technotopia wouldn't actually work due to resource limits, etc.) I would lose all sense of being human, of value, of purpose. I have been trying to come up with any similar ideas in history -- would you consider the "bread and circuses" of ancient Rome to be a reasonable analogue?<br><br>I did not watch the debate, but I read analyses afterwards (better for my psychological well-being, I find), and many folks thought that the populist-type on the stage scored a number of points against the establishment-liberal on the topic of trade, even though the over-all scoring (to the extent it means anything in terms of votes) went to the establishment-liberal. There was one story I read where a blue-collar, historically-Democratic voter was convinced that he'd vote Trump and was completely put-off by Clinton. His comment was something along the lines of "her points either don't affect me or else they hurt me," which speaks to your gap between rhetoric and reality.<br><br>I do think that the new parties forming will be establishment-corporate and populist, defined significantly (though not necessarily completely) by class interests. How we get to that point and what conflicts act as the catalyst for that process, we shall see. As you say, a wild (but fascinating) ride.<br><br><a href=#c84605786471691988 title="comment permalink">9/28/16, 1:08 PM</a><br><br>

I live in Massachusetts. This to me signals a seismic shift in the orientation of the politics on the Right, and quite possibly politics in general. My interpretation of the Confederate flag being displayed this far north signifies that many, many people <i>believe the federal government is an occupying force</i>. This belief is both deeply radical and has a strong tendency towards decentralization. <br><br>On the leftward end of things where I find my social niche there is less powerful symbolic initiative. I am critical about much of the left because:<br><br>a) it's attached to an identity politic that seems to delight in alienating as many people as possible<br>b) places much, much more emphasis on values than interests which hamstrings effective politicking <br>c) it has contempt for the laboring classes who are, historically, the very people who support the Left, and;<br>c) frequently imagines no positive futures and simply says that the alternative is worse<br><br>My positions are shared by most on the Left who I engage with. It should be noted that I'm someone who for the most part <i>can</i> (and do!) talk about hot-button issues such as immigration in a subtle, nuanced way without being shouted down, I believe largely on account that I'm olive skinned, trans, and a religious minority (that I need to have certain appearances and identities to have honest discourse with genuine content is offensive and grotesque to me, but still, I work what I got). What I find in these conversations is that underneath a perhaps outdated consensus about social values on the Left, there is a desire for more social democracy - ie larger government institutions, more social welfare, and the protections for the vulnerable. This seems to me a centralizing force. <br><br>It thus appears that the new political paradigm is one that pits radicalism against conservatism. The Right is radical in its thrust for decentralization whereas the Left seeks to preserve the New Deal, and perhaps expand the welfare state which is ipso facto conservative, federalist, and centralizing. The Right seems more coherent in its initiative, whereas the Left seems of two minds and somewhat divided against itself - it is half in the old paradigm of liberalism and half in the new. Said perhaps more simply the Right seems awake to itself whereas the Left is mostly asleep. If I'm reading the signs correctly, these two perspectives are much more diametrically opposed than the current political arrangement of senile liberalism, and I pray that the tension they imply can be shared collectively without ripping the nation to bloody shreds.<br><br><a href=#c1460477338625531554 title="comment permalink">9/28/16, 1:31 PM</a><br><br>

As someone who has identified most my life as liberal but who has seen an increasing influx of populist thought into my political ideology, this one hits very close to home. I feel increasingly dissatisfied with the choices offered up by both parties--and not excited about the third party options, either. I would be quite happy right now if Bernie Sanders was the nominee (and likely sporting a 10 point lead on Trump, though perhaps I'm being too generous) and if I had a candidate who truly understood the devastation of globalized free trade who didn't also make it a habit of making misogynistic statements about women, making bigoted remarks toward a variety of ethnicities, and just generally being a smart but still kind of terrible candidate who refuses to formulate a clear world view despite having many of the pieces of such right there in his stump speeches.<br><br>Alas, so goes current politics.<br><br>To be perfectly honest, I would love to see the rise of a populist movement that advocated for a protectionist economic policy; limited legal and illegal immigration that provided an infusion of cultural and ethnic diversity without impacting the wage-class to too detrimental a degree; a movement away from over-reliance on the speculative financial economy in favor of a return to a goods and services-based economy, with heavy emphasis on "goods"; a general favoring of a closed system economy in which we largely provide for ourselves utilizing our country's own energy resources, natural resources, and labor base--and rebuild rural communities and economies in the process; a strong support of civil rights and internal diversity; and a reduced federal government that still maintained oversight of those civil rights and implemented certain national priorities, such as a reformed, single-payer health care system, a national transportation network that emphasized rail transit between population centers, a reformed tax structure that rewarded employment and penalized mechanization, and a national energy policy that incentivized conservation and local and renewable energy generation with a focus on passive technologies (make solar water heaters and passive solar design as mandatory as fossil fuel-powered hot water and space heaters, for god's sake!)<br><br>I'm sure I'm missing a wide variety of elements in that break down, but it's a heck of a good start in my mind. The thing is, too, if liberals like me want to ensure a society in which minorities are treated fairly and equitably, then we need to ensure as broad-based and beneficial an economy as we can, address the problems afflicting the wage class and rural people, reduce our own standards of living for the benefit of everyone, stop advocating and supporting destructive policies so long as they don't impact us, and acknowledge the very real and legitimate concerns, interests, and devastation of people not in our class, or else we're going to guarantee the exact sort of abuses we proclaim to be against (but engage in ourselves at times). Sometimes the sheer stupidity, short-sightedness, and unwillingness to face hard truths makes me crazy. And yeah, I include myself in that statement.<br><br>Joel<br><br>P.S.

It seems, in fact, that the decision to include a bill of rights at the beginning of the constitution implies that ethical values were always at the heart of the political system in America. What I imagine is that the presence of a bill of rights in the constitution, and the use of the bible to oppose the nascent women’s rights movement is part of something different than what you’re alluding to, but it definitely looks like values were always extremely close to the surface.<br><br>My other thought: you’re pointing out here that values are not always at the heart of politics, and sometimes don’t even feature at all, and on the other blog you’ve pointed out the dangers of turning religious institutions into political ones, and called for religious spaces to remain open and neutral. Meanwhile, you’ve also pointed out in past essays here on this blog that religion itself isn’t always about ethics or moral values, and is at its heart about spiritual relationships (though, of course conflicts within religious traditions such as say… the conflicts within the heathen world over the two lines of traditions with competing and irreconcilable values surrounding ethnic diversity, gender roles, and the like), and of course the history of liberalism you’ve discussed here or certain theocratic societies (such as Saudi Arabia) show that values and morality can take a central stage in politics, but as you’ve pointed out with other examples this week, just like religion can be completely about spiritual experience, politics can be purely about individual interests. Which means that it’s feasibly possible for a society to exist in which values, ethics, and morality are the domain of neither the church nor the state, that suggests the presence of a binary that is in need of resolving… if there are no ethics in either religion or politics, what institution would be powering the ethical aspects of the society’s actions?<br><br>As for the future of politics on our own world: do you see a full on return to the social Darwinism of the Gilded Age? Or do you think that liberal politics has left enough of a mark that ethical concerns will continue to factor into political decision making on at least some level? And of course… the million dollar question: you just wrote an entire novel about the ways that adopting the technologies in the past won’t guarantee a return to the uglier cultural institutions of the past. What can be done, going forward into a post-liberal and post-industrial world to actually avoid that? Just because retroversion of technologies and retroversion of cultural institutions aren’t connected, doesn’t mean the latter can be avoided simply through sitting back and assuming that it can’t happen… so what exactly can be done to try to avoid a future with a “Handmaid’s Tale” vibe to it?<br><br><br><a href=#c8092172024372661685 title="comment permalink">9/28/16, 1:53 PM</a><br><br>

Basically, the powers that be of the original order (politicos, financiers, lawyers) made the rules of the game, and decided what worked best largely for their interests. It's not that they didn't take values into account, they simply didn't take normal well-functioning, conscientious, human values into account. They took into account the values of the immoral. Their values were essentially binary : the intersection of money and power. <br><br>Today, we have a similar thing. The democratic party, what we are told is the last bastion of liberal and progressive ideas (which I'm sure most people can now understand is anything but, seeing how the party treated Bernie Sanders)has essentially over the last three to four decades morphed into the professional moneyed elite, and have, aside from a few social niceties like gay marriage and pot smoking, turned against all values about the ethical treatment of those that don't get a fair start in life, and have become the same rapacious types that required the creation of a liberal movement in the first place.

The Peace of Westphalia and the Peace of Augsburg in the mid 17th century did much to establish our modern notions of government and international relations, and they're arguably quite liberal in character. The principle of "Cuius regio, eius religio" is, after all, the de jure embedding of religious policy- of the holy salvation of the people- at the level of national government. That looks like a moral consideration—at first glance, at least. <br><br>But perhaps I conflate religion and morality, and perhaps the fragmentation of religion across the Holy Roman Empire is better understood not as a moral question of liberty and self-determination (as it is typically cast today), but as a preliberal weighing of power and interests-- a mutual recognition that no one side had enough power to wipe the other side out, and that mutual toleration of others' competing interests was preferable to eternal conflict.<br><br>I don't know.<br><br><a href=#c6955036242298242540 title="comment permalink">9/28/16, 2:36 PM</a><br><br>

By definition, a "movement" has to be <i>moving</i>. Having accomplished its goals, the movement no longer has a reason to exist, so it starts dying - but many people have their livelihoods invested in the movement. So how do they keep it afloat? Two ways come to mind:<br><br>1. Move the goalposts - find some different but similar goal to support. This is of course subject to the law of diminishing returns, because a social movement is naturally going to go after (what it perceives to be) the most impactful goals and the most overt forms of oppression first, until it gradually reaches a point where it's fighting against "oppressions" that are arguable at best, and its goals have negligible or even negative impact on the situation of the supposed beneficiaries.<br><br>2. Invoke perasmenophobia, the fear of the past seemingly ubiquitous today - imply, for instance, that the movement's successes are entirely due to the continued existence of the movement and that if they ceased to fight, all their successes would be forfeit nearly instantly and the situation would revert to that of, usually, the period in the past the movement's hangers-on perceive as having been the most oppressive for its beneficiaries. But this loses its effectiveness as time passes and the oppressions of the past fall out of memory into history.<br><br>This is not to discount the importance of social movements. When the status quo is unacceptable or untenable, movements are an absolute necessity to break social and societal inertia. But they are inevitably self-defeating by virtue of their own success.<br><br><a href=#c7083398297742586295 title="comment permalink">9/28/16, 4:17 PM</a><br><br>

Instead, he talks about jobs, trade, raw law and order, etc. "Interests" rather than "values". Seems to be working just fine!<br><br>As I perhaps said before, I think Trump himself is a transitional figure even if elected. During the primaries, he sounded like a right-wing populist with some quasi-left features tacked on. Now, he sounds like a strange hybrid of conservative Republican, liberal Republican and populist. In other words, he wants a deal with the old establishment (which he is really a part of himself), while aiming to win over the Tea Party types *and* holding on to his neo-populist base at the same time. How this will turn out is anybody´s guess at this point, although I think a Trump victory is fairly certain unless Clinton organizes *massive* election fraud.<br><br>You are right that there seems to be a re-alignment between liberal Democrats and Neo-Cons around the Clinton candidacy. I think this reflects a broader re-alignment between left-liberals and neo-liberals internationally. The goal is to create a global and globalized "free market" economy, but with left-liberal values rather than conservative ones. Mass immigration is part of this agenda. It lowers wages and destroys welfare states, but can be pushed as a left-liberal demand ("multi-culturalism"). <br><br>The present challenge to this comes largely from the right (UKIP in Britain, Trump in the US, Front National in France), but in the future, there "should" be a traditionally socialist reaction from the workers, if only because many of the right-wing populists are really pushing an alternative corporate agenda. Even if Trump gets the manufacturing jobs back to the US, there might still be low wages and union-busting... I´m not sure what role, if any, Corbyn will play in this drama. On the one hand, his rise is the result of opposition to neo-liberalism. On the other hand, he is left-liberal and "pro-Muslim" and apparently supported Remain (!). Labour´s future might be a pretty wild ride, too! <br><br>Perhaps there will be three or even four parties in the US in the future. Apart from the Marie Antoinette Cookie Party (led by guess who), there could be a People´s Party to the left, a minimal government/state rights Tea Party to the right (Ted Cruz?), and a right-wing populist but government-interventionist party (Fred Halliot?). There might also be ethno-nationalist parties among Hispanics and Blacks, when these minority groups get tired of being played by Marie Antoinette in pantsuits.<br><br>And yes, the world *is* watching... <br><br><br><br><a href=#c3365539125431417573 title="comment permalink">9/28/16, 4:44 PM</a><br><br>

For example, is it possible to pursue "interests" without any contamination from "values"? Your thesis that liberalism injected values into politics which was previously only (or mainly) driven by interests implies it's possible to have a much more cut-and-dried politics that really just reflects "interest." But what all makes up "interests" is a bit vague here. I'd like to hear more.<br><br>I'm working out a couple of hypotheses that are probably related. One is that democracy might be inherently unsustainable - because it posess no natural defenses to the accumulation of wealth and power in a few hands. In previous eras there were periodic "jubilee years" that attempted to level the playing field again. But it probably takes authoritarianism to do this.<br><br>The other hypothesis is based on the observation that now in the US we seem to be extremely obsessed with celebrity and personality. I feel there is a connection here with the hegemony of "values" in politics as you put it - as the basis for all of this conflict over identity issues. Viewed in terms of likely outcomes, I feel a Trump or Hillary Presidency (or anybody else for that matter) is all basically the same. But if you try to tell some one, "Hillary or Trump, 6 of one and half dozen of the other..." people freak out. Because they are judging based on personalities (or maybe better term, personae), which are really different. Outcomes are what matter though. To the extent that we obsess over celebrity and differences in personality we fail to deal with substance. We never get around to discussing practical stuff, like how to allocate scarce resources with a modicum of fairness. <br><br>"Democracy" has become all about the right to choose whose personality you most resonate with or against - whoever is willing to trumpet your favored values/identity issues. Outcomes fall by the wayside. I don't wish to live under a dictatorship, but it would be good if some wise and powerful entity could cut through the bullsnott and set things straight.<br><br><br><a href=#c2472307236581054717 title="comment permalink">9/28/16, 5:02 PM</a><br><br>

"Make America Great Again" sounds like the ultimate in a declaration of values, not policy. <br><br>There is also a cyclical process here. There is always a popular reaction against the party of the current president. Anti-government militias rose during Clinton, and again during Obama. Left-wing street protests rose during Nixon, and during Bush II. I expect they will subsude under Trump or continue to grow under Clinton. Amidts all this it can be very hard to pick out anything specific and ongoing as representative of the large cycles of history versus these shorter cycles. <br><br>One large cycle I see is the evolution from Democracy to Oligarchy.

Another covered slavery, economics and a boatload of other issues; I think the authors dredged up everything any of them had ever been peeved about. They're interesting documents.<br><br>Another thing I learned is that Lincoln came into office with a worked-out plan for the 30-year abolition of slavery, including reparations to slaveholders, resettlement and ways to handle old age.

But it's a question that has bothered me for some time. Is "environmentalism" an interest or a value? Are you familiar with the legal concept of "standing"? The late (but not lamented) Justice Scalia consistently sought to exclude environmentalist plaintiffs from US courts on the basis of lack of "standing." They lacked "skin in the game" according to Scalia. So if they lacked "skin in the game" how could they have been pushing their own particular interests? So was it values, then? Something along the line of "do-gooders"? The lawyers, and economists, tend to view environmentalists as just another competing interest group. So according to Scalia they could be ignored as not an interest group, but on the other hand they were just another interest group. It's as if any lame logic at all would suffice to avoid taking environmentalist concerns seriously. One might think that "Conservative" would include conservation, but that does not seem to be the case.

I have to tell you that it's not just US where liberalism is failing, it's happening throughout the world including in my own country. Which leads me to believe that liberalism is joined at the hip with economic growth and empire.<br><br>Ever since the British set foot here, the followers of English language, customs and traditions have always had an upper hand over the natives who failed to adopt to such nuances. This resulted in the political discourse getting dominated largely by people who were educated in elite western institutions. This tradition continued well after our independence largely because the west and it's ideas dominated almost everything. <br><br>In the interest of keeping the republic alive, local histories (which included religious, caste and linguistic rivalries) were suppressed and school books were modified accordingly. Even mentioning any such trends or native history was considered blasphemy unofficially and such people were routinely branded fundamentalist and backward. However over the last 20 years or so the natives have fought back (helped by the slow demise of the empire) and this has resulted in the rise of several regional parties and one 'nationalist' party in particular who have no sympathies for such western educated elites.<br><br>Even then the grip of the empire is so strong that although socially and culturally we are moving away from the west, economically we are still rooted to the same old ideas. This is because the moneyed elites from west and our own diaspora (from west) still dominate economic theory, but I expect that to change going forward as the west declines and Asian economies regain their natural standing in the world order.<br><br><a href=#c5165336163554350381 title="comment permalink">9/28/16, 8:09 PM</a><br><br>

Perhaps it would be useful to differentiate between codifying moral values into law versus codifying laws to keep order, to ensure that people behave in an orderly fashion and have no reason to resort to violence. I have been thinking about the origin of law and government, since I have been reexamining Libertarianism and anarchy. I think with 7 billion people on the planet, it's unrealistic to imagine a world with minimal government, because we no longer have the type of social institutions that correct behavior in a small community (I grew up in a town of 500 people, so I understand how behavior is regulated in a place like Mayberry, for example). When community is eroded by large size, too many interactions are between total strangers so there are no repercussions for bad behavior. Reputation is everything in a small town, and it's meaningless in a city. So my thoughts brought me to the first code of laws written by Hammurabi. It's no coincidence that law had to be codified and enforced in the first civilization, because once a community reaches a certain size, everything is mob rule, pitchforks and torches, until someone creates a system of law and punishment. Certainly, "an eye for an eye" is a type of ethical statement (as archaic as it is now), but it wasn't promoted to make people more ethical. The law was created to prevent people from murdering each other over lost eyes. It was to create order, as opposed to the alternative, which is unethical behavior being policed by the angry mob. Granted, there was a danger of women and slaves turning into angry mobs until their conditions improved. I think as things degenerate, we should probably keep this in mind, because if social systems and governments degenerate and lose the capacity to provide justice and order, we need to understand how to prevent chaos. It goes back to building small communities, where values are traditionally enforced by gossip and the ostracizing of neighbors. The government never needed to codify values before, because communities enforced values. As communities grew larger, people became more anonymous and communities could no longer impose values. The problem is growing complexity and diminishing returns in social interaction. <br><br>For example, in a town of 400 people, there are no secrets. Every secret gets out and becomes "the talk of the town" eventually. Infidelity is found out, and then the victim of the infidelity can personally chase down everyone who perpetuated the rumor until he or she finds the source. Some rumors are false, but most are true(but exaggerated). Once a rumor gets out, the cheater and homewrecker have to face an entire community looking at them sideways. Parents worry what their children will think. Just the thought of your dirty laundry getting aired to everyone you see on a daily basis is terrifying. What if everyone you knew was aware that you were cheating on your spouse? That's what happens in a small town. You sneeze and the phone rings and someone across town says "bless you." If you do something truly horrible, you get run out of town. The flip side of the coin, is everybody knows everybody. So people living alternative lifestyles are still people first. Every face has a name, so it's easy to overcome prejudice. <br><br>Once a community is large enough to avoid punishment for bad behaviors by simply blending into the crowd, you need codified laws. You need codified morals. You need codified punishments. I think if you look at the evolution of law, and what behaviors Hammurabi made illegal and what behaviors are illegal today, it reveals a clear picture of the growth of humanity from towns to city-states to gigantic states. I think we have gone so far off the rails now that government no longer remembers the purpose of law at all, and it has become a self-serving system of promoting interests, not order.<br><br><a href=#c5768546820983997904 title="comment permalink">9/28/16, 8:45 PM</a><br><br>

Each week we look forward to your posts. We loved Retrotopea. <br><br>Out here in the intermountain west I’m working to repair the 30+ year old Anderson window frames in a dwelling we refer to as the inefficient modern home, as all homes built in the last 300 years on this continent are, and may continue to be (yes even LEED / solar powered) into the future. The sand paper is interesting; the sand comes from Mexico, gets shipped to Canada where the paper pulp is shaped, treated, cut, and sent to the US where it is packaged, marketed, shipped and sold. <br><br>Meanwhile the battle for Allepo is raging. <br><br>Politics, all politics for large agrarian-dependent centralized societies is but the frosting on the cake of resource allocation - parceled out in ratios to the existing participants of the hierarchical system of that time. <br><br>As you have mentioned more than once in past posts; we’ve had a good run. We’ve managed to use up millions of years of stored sunlight in a fraction (150+years) of geological time as the dominant species on this planet. <br><br>As resources go, this particular country has had the benefit of the lion’s share of those resources for some time now. The ugliness of human beings forced by way of violence, to arrive and work here are part of that resource story. Unless any one of us can claim membership to a Native American Nation, all of us to a person are immigrants from somewhere else and arrived to a continent absolutely filthy rich in resources. My family left Ireland, that island having been stripped of its forests, and its people stripped of their land. Values and interests become murky water, and their differences can go mostly unnoticed when the resources are plentiful and cheap to extract. Optimism, and opportunity, like the butterfly winged rainbow unicorn kitten, can grow and expand to include countless ideals, values, and ‘rights ‘and those pursuing the aforementioned exercises can afford, by virtue of abundant resources, to look the other way as to how those resources, now shrinking since the 1970’s have arrived at their doorsteps. <br><br>My understanding is that John Quincy Adams, who had some concerns relevant to the dangers of foreign entanglements and the incompatibility between imperialism and democracy mentioned we might best avoid “going abroad in search of monsters to destroy” and I might add, resources. <br><br>None of us, it seems, are willing to do with less, yet speak in words that indicate extreme emotion when it comes to talking about our values, while refusing, each and every one of us, to address the actual physical limitations of how that might work out given the increase in population and decrease in resources. Left or Right, Up or Down, our collective culpability in missing the basic facts of physics has allowed self-interested parties to spin the story of interest as the story of value to its countless consumers, and as the pie keeps shrinking the Unicorn Kitten will face ever increasing pressure to deliver. <br><br>Meanwhile the battle for Allepo is raging and we will continue observing and finding ways to treat relics as resources. <br><br>sheila<br><br><a href=#c4162721536731563494 title="comment permalink">9/28/16, 9:21 PM</a><br><br>

I think it's quite accurate to say that Gnosticism, whether or not it's become the dominant religion in America today, is certainly the dominant political and social ideology. <br><br>Michelle, your friend is quite correct -- though it's entirely possible that the new populist party will be called the Republican Party. Stranger things have happened. <br><br>Fred, your well-read homeschooler's analysis is rather oversimplified -- there was more going on than that -- but what she's talking about was certainly an important part of the picture. A really thorough history of the forces that drove the Civil War would offend people on all sides of the Mason-Dixon line! <br><br>Sebastien, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Julien, that's a very good point. One of the consequences of the common liberal use of "uneducated" and "ignorant" for the people who disagree with them is that, across a very broad range of American society, education and knowledge are becoming suspect, or even treated with contempt. Of such things are dark ages made. More on this in an upcoming post. <br><br>Breanna, good! That's a point I'll be discussing in an upcoming post. The short form is that liberalism is not the only ideology of the left. Sanders and Corbyn, for example, are socialists, not liberals -- they're not the same thing -- and there are other leftward approaches as well. One of the things I'd like to see, as a moderate Burkean conservative (who recognizes the point of having someone speaking for values in a political context), is those people who are actually concerned with values, and not just as a stalking horse for the interests of the affluent, jumping off the sinking ship of liberalism and making common cause with the downtrodden via one of the less elitist leftward approaches.

So does offshoring, which again is rewarded by government tax policies, and so do several other factors. The tacit encouragement of mass illegal immigration is, as I noted in the post, one of the things involved, not the only thing involved; it's simply that you can reliably get a kneejerk shout of "racist!" out of a liberal by mentioning it, thus my use of it as an example. <br><br>Paul, you're welcome and thank you! <br><br>Violet, I hadn't seen the Gadsden snake over the Confederate battle flag, but it doesn't surprise me a bit -- no, not even in Massachusetts. The old lines and loyalties are shredding, and new patterns are taking shape. Whether that can be done without a convulsion like the Second Civil War of my narrative is the big question. <br><br>Joel, for what it's worth, I'd vote for such a party in a heartbeat. I suspect a lot of other people would, too -- the issue is simply getting that set of ideas into circulation. <br><br>Eric, as I noted in my post, first wave feminism had a long and convoluted trajectory on its way from Seneca Falls to the Nineteenth Amendment. One of the things that made it so is also, coincidentally, an answer to your second question: where do values reside if they're neither in politics nor in religion? One answer, of course, is "in the household" -- and it was central to nineteenth-century antifeminism (see, for example, Coventry Patmore's <i>The Angel in the House</i> to assign values to the female sphere and interests to the male sphere. It was precisely when first wave feminists learned to turn that around and use the language of values to shame male legislators into voting for suffrage that they triumphed. <br><br>Peakfuture, no, I didn't watch or read transcripts of the debates -- my stomach isn't that strong these days. Still, from what I've read, "political NASCAR" is a good description, complete with everyone hoping that one or the other car will crash and burn right there on camera. <br><br>Gee, that's absolutely standard. The radicals of one era, if they survive, become the entrenched establishment of the next. "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss..."<br><br>Bill, I see the Peace of Westphalia as a profoundly pragmatic document, based on the decision of all sides after the Thirty Years' War to ditch the absolute claims of religious values as a political requirement and, instead, recognize that all sides had interests that needed to be accommodated. <br><br>Johnny, fascinating. I didn't watch the debate, but it's definitely a sign of the transition from values to interests that Trump is acknowledging his pursuit of his own interest rather than cloaking it in value language. <br><br>Drhooves, I certainly hope you're wrong. <br><br>James, the deliberate cultivation of outrage as a kind of recreational drug deserves some serious discussion...<br><br>Pat, in today's America, the shark jumps you. ;-)<br><br>Twinruler, it is indeed.

Mason was a slaveowner, and so had economic reasons to want the slave trade stopped -- it boosted the value of his property -- and the compromise over when the slave trade was to be stopped was, equally, a compromise between those whose interests benefited from its continuation (primarily slaveowners in recently settled areas who were still relying on imported slaves) and those whose interests benefited from its end (primarily slaveowners in long-established areas who could sell their slaves at a profit). <br><br>Mickey, I'm aware of South Park only because people have mentioned it to me now and then, and who Cartman might be is a complete mystery to me, but yeah, that sounds about right. <br><br>Mister R., well put! One of the few ways in which Obama's paralogic makes any kind of sense is if he thinks that the media's audience is solely composed of Democrats -- as though Trump voters are tentacled horrors from the dawn of time who glibber their own detestable language to one another in deep caves far from the sun.

Zinn, as an honest and thoughtful liberal, puts politics in a perspective that centers on values, while I address the same things from a point of view in which interests play a more central role. By all means make up your own mind!<br><br>Phil K., that's an excellent point! One of the problems with today's liberalism is the conviction that if you do the right thing, it can only have good consequences. This makes it very easy to dismiss the hideous consequences that many supposedly good and moral choices have. <br><br>Tom, what do I make of it? That the African-American community has been played for suckers by the Democratic party for decades, and I'm delighted that they're finally challenging their supposed friends over the lack of actual help they've gotten during that time. <br><br>Barrigan, I don't think I've encountered the term "perasmenophobia" before -- thank you! You're right, of course, that it's pandemic today; the only way believers in progress can keep on claiming that history is headed onward and upward from the caves to the stars is if they redefine the past as Dante's Inferno. Life in today's America, for most of its current inmates, really does suck -- one of the reasons why I think my novel <i>Retrotopia</i> may be timely...<br><br>Tidlosa, what I see happening, rather, is a gradual rapprochement between the Corbyn/Sanders left and the populist right. The fact that UKIP basically destroyed the British Nationalist Party by giving people who rejected open borders someplace less extreme to go shows, to my mind, that there's a huge potential following waiting for the first politician who rejects both globalism and austerity, and sets out a platform refocusing government's role in the economy from enriching the already rich to benefiting the general citizenry. I doubt this lesson is lost on the younger generation of ambitious political activists...<br><br>Josh, the difference between values and interests is very simple. Interests are about who gets the goodies and who pays the costs, pure and simple. Values are about ideas of right and wrong. If you say "I voted for this measure because it's going to improve my standard of living," you're motivated by interest; if you say "I voted for this measure because what it's meant to stop is morally wrong," you're motivated by values. <br><br>Justin, yep. It was quite something to watch people who screamed hate speech at George W. Bush turn around and spend eight years insisting that Barack Obama was above criticism, even though the two men pursued exactly the same policies, and in some cases (drone strikes, for example) Obama was even more extreme than his feckless predecessor.<br><br><a href=#c752388192354808622 title="comment permalink">9/28/16, 11:12 PM</a><br><br>

Sanders is a socialist -- of course he's Socialism Lite, but he's one of the people I referenced in the post who assailed liberalism from further left. That's why, like Jeremy Corbyn, he's attracting people who have lost faith in the liberal movement. As for oligarchy, nah, we had that in the first half of the twentieth century, and have now moved into the stasis that comes when power is so diffuse nobody can muster enough of a majority to change anything. What comes next, as Polybius pointed out better than two thousand years ago, is some form of monarchy -- in American terms, the election of a charismatic leader to the Presidency with enough of a mandate to overturn the status quo and impose an entirely new order on things; cf. George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Roosevelt. <br><br>John, good! But notice how the Awakenings alternate between primarily religious and primarily political focus -- the Great Awakening and the Missionary Awakening were primarily religious, the Transcendental Awakening and the Hallucinogenic Awakening were primarily political. (The next one will therefore almost certainly be religious.) As for slavery, of course -- as I noted in my post, slavery was the linchpin of the Southern plantation economy, which promptly went broke once it was abolished. Lincoln's plan would have prolonged that process -- though it still would have been preferable to what happened. <br><br>Unknown, I read about that! May I recommend that all my readers in South Australia consider getting backup 12 volt power systems, since events like this will become more and more common as time goes on? <br><br>Howard, they kind of have to talk about Trump. Clinton just isn't that inspiring or impressive a candidate -- they basically have to do a "lesser evil" campaign. <br><br>Patricia, the capacity to say "I don't like that, but it's none of my business" is a rare achievement these days, and one of the basic rules of civilized existence. You can interpret that as you wish!<br><br>Mark, nicely summarized. <br><br>Pantagruel, environmentalism is a political movement, currently a captive constituency of the Democratic party. Like most political movements nowadays, it talks entirely in terms of values, and that's one of the reasons most Americans ignore it. If it learned to talk in terms of interests it might get somewhere!<br><br>Harvester, exactly. The taboo concerning interests in today's politics resembles nothing so much as the taboo concerning sex in Victorian times, and in both cases, frank talk is a necessary cure for a lot of ugly things.<br><br>Pygmycory, one of the nasty consequences of the accelerating decline of the US is that a lot of worthwhile expenditures are being thrown under the bus to keep a lot of worthless ones going. You could pay for a lot of SNAP payments by cancelling the F-35! One way or another, whoever ends up in the White House, a lot of people on this side of the border are going to face a lot of unnecessary suffering. I wish I knew of a way to stop it, but I don't. <br><br>Robo, the concept of "energy slaves" has been used by peak oil types to try to talk about that. Why do you think so many people on the left are so frantic in their insistence that of course renewables can keep their lifestyles intact? <br><br>Maverick, thanks for the update from the subcontinent! In 1600, as I recall, India was among the richest countries on Earth, and England was a backwater that mostly produced wool and codfish. In 1900, India was among the poorest countries on Earth and England was filthy rich -- and of course you and I both know why that was. (It was an Irishman, as I recall, who said that the sun never set on the British Empire because God Himself wouldn't trust an Englishman in the dark.) As India regains control of its own economic destiny and shakes off the last hangovers of the Raj, I expect it to become a major economic and political power again, and yes, that's going to involve a lot of changes worldwide.<br><br><a href=#c2473063122167071536 title="comment permalink">9/28/16, 11:32 PM</a><br><br>

It doesn't; it's a specific movement, and there are other leftward movements such as socialism, social democracy, and syndicalism, which have their own very different answers to the questions liberalism once tried to solve. Sanders and Corbyn are socialists, of course, and that's why they both came under such savage attacks from liberals, who don't want their temporary monopoly of the left to be overturned. Does that help? <br><br>Wendy, in at least some browsers, the comment you're responding to doesn't appear with your comment, so I (for one) have no idea who you're responding to! If you can put in something like "@JMG, that's a lousy idea and here's why..." or what have you, the rest of us will know who you're talking about...<br><br>Unknown, that's an excellent point. One of the downsides of the liberal focus on values is precisely the insistence that laws ought to be passed to make people do the right thing, however defined -- Prohibition is a solid example of this -- rather than restricting laws to their proper sphere, which is the prevention and punishment of those behaviors that undermine the basic agreements that make civilized life possible. We have far, far too many laws in the United States today, and of course you're right that a vast number of them are simply meant to further somebody's interest under the camouflage of values. <br><br>Zachary, I certainly find it useful!<br><br>Martin, yes, that's another piece of the puzzle. <br><br>Sheila, nicely put. Thank you. <br><br>Nancy, can you point me to examples of UBI being implemented? I'd like to look into how it's worked out in practice. <br><br>Nathan, that depends hugely from state to state, and that in turn reflects the divergence in the motivations of the various original colonies. Massachusetts was founded by Puritans, of course, and spent the next two centuries trying to legislate virtue, with little success. Other colonies such as Maryland were founded for the purpose of making money, and generally avoided that bad habit. One of the things I'd like to see embraced by a new American populism is the idea that if you're going to legislate morality, please do it on a state by state basis rather than nationally, so that people in South Carolina and Minnesota can have the laws they want, rather than constantly beating each other up in Congress trying to impose their laws on everybody.<br><br><a href=#c6265020948083213620 title="comment permalink">9/28/16, 11:48 PM</a><br><br>

It is happening down here too. During the recent election, I was rather surprised to engage in a conversation with a young lady who was a supporter of Pauline Hanson's One Nation party who talks to the disenfranchised down here. They won four Senate seats during the recent Federal election, and to be honest I make a point of speaking to everyone no matter their social standing and I just listened to what the young lady had to say. We too often make a point of not engaging and not compromising when our values are clashing with others and I don't feel very strongly about values anyway as I don't generally feel that there is a political solution to the current state of affairs, although a political solution can help soften the blows.<br><br>I'm sort of wondering whether the display of values are also subject to diminishing returns? Like take Obama's campaign with the noise about "hope" and "change" and then nothing. Surely, that experience would have undermined faith in the establishment? And people also tend to worry more about interests rather than values when there are economic incentives to do so - like the people don't have a job or a living wage?<br><br>I've just finished reading Liar's Poker by Michael Lewis (him of The Big Short fame) and honestly it is like watching a car crash. I can now see the bigger picture that the deficit spending since the days of the Reagan era have fuelled speculation. It just became more lucrative to hoard tokens than run businesses - literally in many of cases and often not even voluntary. The four biggest companies down here are banks and what does that say? And the debt, I doubt many people understand what a destruction of built infrastructure and productive capacity many of us have witnessed in such a short period of time. Oh my, there will be a fall out from this. I tend to be a bit contrary in that if people are running in one direction, I'll check out what is going on in the other directions before deciding to join the massed hordes. Far out, it is not good.<br><br>Whilst I mention, the not good thing. A cyclone appears to have hit South Australia (the state to the north and west of this state) and it took out the power grid. The main feeder transmission lines between this states coal fired generators and that state (which has 40% wind capacity) simply buckled. I didn't believe that those big steel things could actually buckle. The photos are pretty awesome: <a href=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/worsening-conditions-cause-more-blackouts-across-sa/7887020 rel=nofollow>SA weather: Worsening conditions cause more blackouts as BOM warns of more storms</a>.<br><br>Anyway, the loss of the grid meant that the wind turbines had to be shut down. <br><br>cont...<br><br><a href=#c8014417970831808770 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 1:32 AM</a><br><br>

You see the resistance from the electrical grid when applied to the wind turbines helps to slow the blades from rotating too fast. When the grid goes down, the resistance on the turbines motors disappears and the blades can spin much faster (i.e. because it is so much easier with no resistance) and then the turbine may possibly self destruct. They avoid that fate by turning the blades out of the prevailing winds and keeping them out of the severe winds. I had to build that sort of fail safe into the wind turbine here back when I had one and the fail safe device actually caught fire and it was one of the reasons I got rid of the wind turbine. Anyway, a lot of that state still has no power, although they are slowly bringing it back on line in places. This is the second time in under twelve months where states relying heavily on renewable energy sources got to find their upper limits first hand. The other was Tasmania last summer which relies heavily on hydro power and because of the drought the dams got down to as low as about 12% to maybe 14% full. The interesting thing there is that the cable link between Victoria and Tasmania broke and took about five months to repair (it was under Bass Strait) so they lost access to our brown coal fired generators...<br><br>I'm not saying that renewable energy sources are not good, it is just that they have limitations and more often than not, we install them (like grid tied solar PV systems) with the assumption that nothing will go wrong and that they can operate when the grid is disconnected - which they can't. The grid itself is used like a giant battery system for these renewable energy devices in their current format. They work much better in smaller arrangements rather than these gargantuan setups.<br><br>You have readers in South Australia so it will be interesting to read their views. Oh yeah, I heard one of your readers on the radio the other day (perhaps it was Monday) talking about America's economic decline...<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c1478894979642869244 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 1:32 AM</a><br><br>

I think the main reason (our now internationally famous) Geert Wilders is getting so much attention is because he's saying the things many people are thinking - though it would have been near unimaginable two decades ago. From his actions it seems he prefers being in the opposition over ever actually ruling, though. Maybe he's found a nice stable career in pointing out everything that's wrong without ever having a hand at trying to fix it. People are angry and desperate, but I worry that emotions are being projected on mostly powerless minority groups who have no direct relations to the causes of the problems - mostly that there is no economic growth - companies don't grow, people don't get hired - thus banks won't loan money. I also find that people out of a job tend to be less sympathetic to the plight of those who, say, find they're in the wrong body or somesuch.<br><br>I've heard many people say that the crisis of 2008 is still ongoing. It has mostly led to a strange mix in society, no longer are there middle-class or poor areas in town, rather, you have some people struggling horribly for the last 8 years in one house, yet their next-door neighbours kept their jobs and haven't noticed a thing. It's rather hard to be put out of your house here, so impoverished people tend to stay put - they definitely can't afford to move, even to scale down.<br><br>Part of it is new housing projects being aimed either at seniors or the wealthy. There are few to no affordable homes for poorer or starting families being built, since there's not enough money in it. The city councils promise new housing for students and the like whenever open meetings are held, but I've seen them been cut out of the final budget plan at the last moment for five years in a row now. <br><br>Supermarkets and the like tended to fire employees right before their 18th birthday, because they would have to start paying them minimum wage after. Under new laws, after 3 temporary contracts a permanent contract has to be offered. This resets after 6 months, after which they can offer another 3 temporary contracts, and so on. This has only lead to almost no one I know having had anything more than a 6 month contract. One of my friends is a lab technician and has been hopping between several large companies for years now. It's a good line of work - still pays well above minimum wage - but no one is getting permanent contracts, anywhere, it seems. He just saves up and tries to weather the 6 months cooldown period, and tries to find another job for that time. You can't make promotions this way - the best you can do, if you can afford it, is study next to your job, and let your next temporary contract be for a higher paying function.<br><br>Banks won't issue you a loan for a house if you're working from a temporary contract. For most, horribly expensive rental is the only option. The few people I know who managed to buy a house had their (wealthy) parents guarantee the payments to the bank.<br><br>I'm unsure why -all- young people are being screwed over. It's even tough for those with wealthy parents and a scientific university education (but admittedly far more bearable - there's work, and hope). I thought it was usually the poor who were thrown under the bus - or are the young (twenties) seen as poor collectively? Since we can't get into the workforce, the vast majority of us will remain so, possibly for decades... And I'm even more unsure how exporting immigrants will solve these issues.<br><br><a href=#c3784674695839736068 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 2:51 AM</a><br><br>

And everyone understands now that if you defy the Germans by, say, repudiating the banking debt overhang, you will be the next Greece (the poverty there is now extreme but barely reported on in the mainstream media outside that country).<br><br>Ireland I think has a unique problem in that we don’t have a recent history of relative prosperity and economic independence to look back to. Ireland in the 1950’s and 1970’s was a pretty poor place with massive emigration, inflation, unemployment etc. (things improved briefly in the 60’s before the oil crises hit). <br><br>As you’ve said, Britain spent 800 years stripping the country of all wealth that wasn’t nailed down and people were disappointed to find that you don’t recover from that overnight following independence. By and large they took to blaming themselves – for being as incompetent, venal, corrupt and parochial as they had for so long been told they were. We still do that. <br><br>We’re different to the US in that most Irish people today, even among the wage and welfare class, are economically better off than their parents or grandparents were – although that is beginning to change now, particularly as a result of high rents and property prices that are partly caused by the IT salary bubble and immigration here. <br><br>But you have Irish people in their 50’s who grew up on farms that were not far from subsistence agriculture and who now have a standard western European upper middle class standard of living. There is nostalgia for some aspects of the past but we don’t have that American post-war working class prosperity to look back towards. People here have genuine reasons to be terrified of falling back into poverty and isolation. <br><br>Mallow<br><br><a href=#c4124875642155332574 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 3:04 AM</a><br><br>

You have to go back to pre-1800 (before the Act of Union with the UK) to find an Irish economy with a semi-prosperous industrial sector. Foreign Direct Investment from the 1960’s, being an open economy without trade barriers and membership of the EU are seen as the policies that saved us from that very real poverty. <br><br>Basically most people know that we’re pretty much a tax haven, a relatively favoured client state of Germany and through it the US, but as long as we’re doing ok economically they’ll defend that state of affairs. We’re a tiny country that never industrialized the way the UK and US did. People I think understand that we’ll probably always be under someone else’s hegemony (at least as long as empires can reach here). <br><br>So retrovation will be a tougher sell here than elsewhere. My hope is to emphasize that we’re not limited to the example of our own history but can also take good ideas that have worked in similar contexts in other parts of the world. On the EU and euro I’d take the stance that it is in the process of falling apart anyway, whether we like it or not, so we need to prepare for that. <br><br>The wage class are the ones whose interests need representing – so to them I’d point out that if we continue on our current path there will be work for middle class graduates in the likes of google, facebook and the financial sector while the wage class is reduced to competing for sandwich-making jobs competing with illegal immigrants who work 3 jobs and sleep in shifts in an 8-bed room. <br><br>I’d be making a kind of precautionary principle argument: that we should learn from where other countries who are further along our course have ended up and for once decide not to simply follow their bad example. <br><br>Sorry this was much longer than intended!

The difference between values and interests are the same as the difference between abstractions and reality.<br><br>Values are a form of abstraction - you can never really prove or disprove them, and they are subjective views masquerading as objective truths. On the other hand, interests can be reasoned and argued, as they are real - it's very hard to say that some decision or the other won't benefit or harm someone, and the causations can be proven with logic and evidence.<br><br>Just like values have been used to mask interests, in general abstractions are used to mask reality. I'm thinking of all the propaganda from the liberal outlets that America has a growing, nay, booming economy right now. To prove it are pages and pages of unfounded abstractions, to hide the reality that any person outside of silicon valley can tell you - America is in serious trouble. <br><br>Why?

Now I obviously won't go into the reasons for that here, but as a result of how hard as it's been to take this position and be on the 'wrong' side of society, it's become a 'blessing in disguise' as it's really opened my eyes.<br>I can see how group-think works, whether it's the average Joe, corporate Australia or the 'Scientific Community'.<br><br>As a result of this change of seeing the world, I recently told the relative who I used to argue with over climate change (I believe it's real), that while I still don't agree with him, I can no longer trust the nature of the public arguement. I can see how there is no discussion or understanding, not even accepting a single point from the opposing side, just arguing from two polarised sides.<br>I've come to the understanding how intellectually vapid alot of left/liberal thought like I used to have has degenerated into.<br><br>Now, for good reasons we can't think about all subjects with a fresh mind all the time, so it's perfectly normal and appropriate for our thoughts becoming crystallised. However those people who are driving public discourse on matters of importance tend to not only over simplify (dumb down) the argument but get caught in taking and then defending positions.<br><br>And that's where I think liberal thought will break, with the taking and defending positions, those 'thought leaders' who tend to lack critical thinking, will ignore or even attack any evidence which conflicts with their 'intellectual' or 'scientific consensus' positon. This is creating a cognitive disonance which becomes more apparent the longer the argued positon is crystallised and ignoring inconvinient facts.<br><br>As for vaccines, when the 'vaccines are safe' bubble does break, and I strongly believe it will, it'll shatter not only that industry but alot of faith in science itself. Which will be a very sad day indeed.<br><br>(p.s. I loveed the part about Chronocentrism, once again you've put to words what I've felt for a while)<br><br><a href=#c3898299295407088753 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 5:12 AM</a><br><br>

In that kind of system, our only purpose would be to consume, so that the consumerist economy might be kept afloat. Credits deposited into my electronic ledger, used to order food and other goods online, delivered by robotic drones, meals prepared by an automated kitchen. Void of any depth or meaningful human interaction. The atomization of community into singletons would be essentially complete. That is the "destruction" of humanity to which I was referring.<br><br>I lean socialist myself, but argue that the governance and provision of the goods and services ought to be done at the closest level to the people as possible -- some things more or less have to be nationally administered, but much can (and ought) to be done at the state, local, and community levels. Further, I would distinguish between public goods and services available to all (public transportation or community garden plots, for example) on the one hand and an allowance of monetary credits on the other. The latter strikes me as yet a further layer of intermediation and a relegation to the role of mindless consumer. I would also distinguish between pensions for which one has contributed or a community providing for those of its members who are in times of need versus a systematic allocation of money simply by virtue of existing.<br><br>So perhaps we are talking about slightly different things when we each speak of UBI.<br><br><a href=#c6687475227630639598 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 5:33 AM</a><br><br>

First it was painting all Bernie supporters as misogynistic white boys regardless of race or gender, now it is calling anyone who wants to vote third party selfish. Of course this ignores that politics is largely about self interest. I have my own problems with the green party, but right now Stein is getting my vote. The standard line of attack is that green voters are selfish ignorant straight white people who can afford to vote for her because they don't have anything at stake in this election, ignoring that everyone has something at stake and that the demographics of the green and democratic party are equally white and privileged.<br><br>This is the most comprehensive rundown I have seen of all the experiments with UBI.<br><br>https://decorrespondent.nl/541/why-we-should-give-free-money-to-everyone/20798745-cb9fbb39<br><br>I have mixed feeling about government benefits, but this approach does seek to get rid of some of the bureaucracy surrounding benefits which to my mind is one of the big drawbacks of many of these programs. I also like the idea that giving people a small guaranteed income frees up time for them to pursue more meaningful work, get educated, or take care of family. When given UBI people generally did not use the money to stay idle, but instead used it as a means to pursue this kind of work over wage slavery.

I particularly like your identification of the destructive taboo against talking about interests in educated company. At many educational institutions, framing an argument in terms of who benefits is enough to get you labelled an outsider. Instead, interests have to be discussed under a cloak of liberal values. And the double-think required is a big barrier against clear thinking.<br><br>A major challenge in seeing ahead through the unravelling of liberalism is that I find it easier to identify the incoherent rhetoric that must collapse than to identify which coalitions of interests will emerge. It is easy to see that claims like "multi culturalism is a universal cultural value that everyone must embrace", or the claim that "traditional family structures will return if we just elect the right politicians" are incoherent. But it is much harder to see how establishment members could find enough common ground to build a party to oppose a populist party. Populist rhetoric can evolve quickly, but underneath, the populists that want a conservative overhaul of the current system and those who want a progressive overhaul are going to have a hard time finding common ground. It seems ideological fragmentation may be the most pervasive feature of the coming era. The economic realities of individuals are so very different and the possible solutions so diverse, that we may get quite used to electing people that most people don't like.

Thus when treated as an interest environmental services tend to be assigned some arbitrary (usually small) value. I brought this up with my economics prof at MSU some years ago and his response was that we do know that the value of environmental services is "not infinite." This, apparently, was the justification for assigning some inconsequential value to these services. This is the logic of "market liberalism" which is not the same liberalism you are discussing in this post. I don't even buy his "not infinite" claim, because if some blunder on our part makes the planet virtually unlivable for some period of geologic time, was that not infinite in any practical sense?<br><br><a href=#c1347027636639499040 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 7:32 AM</a><br><br>

It was precisely when first wave feminists learned to turn that around and use the language of values to shame male legislators into voting for suffrage that they triumphed.”<br><br>Ok, I can see that, as well as the way that could easily have been turned around in this passage from “The Angel in the House,” in which the stereotype of women as chaste and honorable and men as unthinking brutes ruled by their passion is used in defense of the male need to dominate and the idea of men as being interested in Christian justice is put forth as a fiction:<br><br>“She seem'd expressly sent below<br>To teach our erring minds to see<br>The rhythmic change of time's swift flow<br>As part of still eternity.<br>Her life, all honour, observed, with awe<br>Which cross experience could not mar,<br>The fiction of the Christian law<br>That all men honourable are;<br>And so her smile at once conferr'd<br>High flattery and benign reproof;<br>And I, a rude boy, strangely stirr'd,<br>Grew courtly in my own behoof.”<br><br>It’s interesting that the same stereotype that was being used in antifeminist literature in the 1850s continues to be used today by certain types of feminists as a way of insulting men (the usual “you can’t trust men, they only think with their penis” sort of polemic). So the values contained in the stereotype were reversed, without the stereotype itself changing among those who still see a need to use gender stereotypes. One thing that those stereotypes highlight though is that complete reversal of gender stereotypes that emerged in the 19th century, from what they were in the middle ages.<br><br>If you look at gender stereotypes in medieval literature, what you see is a portrayal of women as insatiable in their appetites, blind in their lusts, and only capable of pursuing their own self-interests, while men were the ones portrayed as paragons of virtue and reason whose job it was to protect their weaker wives from falling into sin. Something changed between that, and the 19th century hesitance to admit that women were even capable of having orgasms, and I’ve never quite been able to figure out what precipitated that shift. The closest example I can think of to the Victorian stereotype of women as innately chaste and virtuous, enticing men to be better is Dante Alighieri, and his portrayal of Beatrice, but even there, the power of Beatrice in that story comes from her ability to channel that raw female sexual energy into a higher virtue, and Dante spends a great deal of his poem exploring love as the highest virtue, and sexual sin as almost forgivable because of its closeness to being holy. So he’s essentially subverting the idea that the sexual and indulgent aspects of female nature are reflective of female weakness, by saying that it actually shows women as closer to holiness than men and therefore more prone to having that holiness perverted. Other medieval and renaissance courtly literature, such as Mallory’s Morte d’Arthur, still used the stereotype of women as lustful and men as virtuous, with the men like Launcelot who succumb to female allure being treated as fallen men (closer to the 19th century idea of sexual women as fallen women). Meanwhile, in the 19th century you had figures like the Pre-Raphaelites generating controversy merely by reminding people of those forgotten medieval stereotypes (and subverting them in their own ways). I’m not sure if any of this features in to your argument or not, but it does seem like being faced with two completely contradictory narratives about the innate nature of women had to have done something to start to chip away at the idea that women are necessarily any particular “way” at all, which made the idea of “male and female spheres” a much easier structure to start tearing away at.<br><br><br><a href=#c43407903346104513 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 8:13 AM</a><br><br>

For instance… during the civil rights movements of the ‘60s, you had the differing political strategies faced by liberal groups like the NAACP on one end, and various Black Nationalist Groups on the other, the former occupying the traditional liberal strategy of appealing to the values of the establishment and the other taking matters into their own hands and building a movement based entirely around advancing their own interests. And of course, the liberal side of the movement tended to discount the concerns and interests of the Black Nationalist groups every chance they got. It could possibly be looked at as evidence that the liberal narrative was already fraying around the edges before the end of the Vietnam War, that the biggest advances in the era were made not by the NAACP, but by Martin Luther King Jr.’s movement which occupied a middle ground position, putting the people the movement concerned at the center and pushing their own interests, but being willing to appeal to values when necessary.<br><br>Fast Forward to the idea of post-liberalism you’re discussing emerging today, and I think you can see the post-liberal approach at work in the way the Black Lives Matter movement is operating, in which you have an organization that’s being led by people advancing their own interests and speaking out for themselves, a liberal establishment that is trying to jump on their movement and subsume it into their own narrative at every turn, and leaders of BLM having very little room or patience for would be “white saviors” to play entryist with them. What’s emerging even on the left, is a culture in which when you have an activist group speaking out about some issue related to rights for trans people, gay people, African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, women, and so on, there’s a general expectation that the people leading the movement should be the people the movement concerns and when that’s not the case the people the movement concerns start speaking out for themselves pretty fast. And the WASP savior mentality is losing ground on all sides, with people on the right noticing that half the people calling them out for saying something non-PC are well… white middle cass people… and calling fowl, and people on the left beginning to realize that minorities and vulnerable demographics are starting to get really tired of other people speaking for them. Is that trend part of the tide you’re noticing?<br><br><br><a href=#c6987120986471183102 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 8:46 AM</a><br><br>

I am one of your regular readers and I really appreciate your work.<br><br>Nonetheless, this is an unusual occasion because I have to disagree with one of your points. (Or something like that.) The point is not the main message of the post but I think it is still relevant: you said that you are grateful to the American liberal movement "for championing the idea that values as well as interests deserve a voice in the public sphere". In contrast, I usually find value-based politics unpractical, often hysterical and potentially very dangerous. <br><br>In my mind, values and interests are interdependent: values usually originate from experience and embody interests. The emphasis on these established standards is certainly a political tactic but it is acceptable only when the standards in question are held by everyone affected, and everyone understands their roots anyway. Otherwise the whole thing can lead to shouting, hatred and violence. Values are clearly not universal. On the other hand, the direct discussion of underlying interests avoids the question on "whose values are better", this is a practical way people can give respect to the views and beliefs of others without betraying their own. (I think it is crucial, at least in my region of Central Europe.)<br><br>The argument can be turned around, of course. If the origin of values can be left unknown in politics, then the door is open for... ehm... "new" or "artificial" moral standards. For example, you said that it is impossible to argue for slavery on moral grounds, but that is not true if the principles are freely selected. <br><br>The latter objection seems to be similar to your critic of contemporary American liberals who cover their interests with casually convenient values. The initial success of the movement is more surprising to me. Perhaps the fundamental moral principles of the 19th and early 20th century America were more solid and widely held than those of today; if this is the case, then the problems with value-based politics could less important in those earlier times. It would probably also mean that we talk about the same thing using words differently.<br><br><a href=#c3576694336608927633 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 9:24 AM</a><br><br>

He begins with a call for an 'attention commons' after discussing the ways in which our attention is usurped without permission - such as mass transit riders in S Korea who have an advertisement in the form of the smell of Dunkin' Donuts coffee squirted into their noses while an audio advert plays just before stopping outside of a franchise location (that one won an award), or the way you now find insurance ads in the bottom of the little bowl you're forced to use at the airport when emptying your pockets, or the way that TVs are now everywhere in profusion, or (my favorite) the school district in Massachusetts that sells advertising space on the blank backs of report cards and permission slips. From there he navigates through territory populated by Kierkegaard, Hegel and Kant - as well as by casino designers who exploit the psychodynamics of addiction to keep the seats at slot machines in Vegas occupied (a particularly horrific description of this little slice of Sheol) - and winds up in much the same place as your latest post does: the place where liberalism, and its core doctrine of so-called individualism, has led us.

I sense a fine irony in the fact that a movement that rose through implementing value centered rhetoric is now hellbent on destroying itself by, on the one hand, using value talk to try to cause every concievable aspect of human life to degenerate into a political issue, and on the other hand using the same value talk to ensure that no actual political issue ever gets to come up for actual discussion on its own terms.<br><br>Phil mentioned the inability of liberals to concieve of consequences, and JMG made a passing reference to the Gnostic undercurrents of the contemporary social discourse. Having contemplated the antics of liberals I have been subjected to, the conclusion I came to was that at the core these people are at war with limitation. Any percieved limit gets a kneejerk reaction of fear and loathing and "the good" always boils down to some effort to erase distinctions between one thing and another (the imagined global utopia where borders do not exist, ethnicities have blurred to the point of being indistinguishable from one another, and everyone ekes out the same miserable middle class consumer existence while having fashionable liberal left beliefs and at least three genders is basically a representation of the absence of the horror of limits). The inability to anticipate, relate to, and learn from the consequences of ones actions? That is an inevitable part of the package when you take it upon yourself to transcend limitation (i.e. existence itself) through the act of having the right opinions. Admittedly this business sounds somewhat drearily familiar, methinks... ;-)<br><br><a href=#c7588207284933991331 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 9:49 AM</a><br><br>

The wording of the US Constitution (look it up, or the sentence is handy in Wikipedia under "Three-Fifths Compromise") refers clearly to "other persons" who are counted up, with the resulting number used in a formula for political purposes. This wording does regard slaves as persons to be counted. If the purpose was to apportion representation, Southern slaveholders would have preferred counting fully, never mind how it was worded, but if the purpose was taxation, they would prefer less. The voting power of the slaves, of course, was zero, not 3/5: any power derived from the count and the formula was assigned to others. The common reaction of bridling at the supposed 3/5 insult always seems odd to me, as to many the personhood of slaves was denied entirely or mostly, not just discounted 40%. The phrase "3/5 of a person", which would be clearly insulting if applied to what we consider a person, seems misleading or irrelevant, and captures very little about 18-century attitudes. Too vague to be illuminating, and not sourced carefully.<br><br><a href=#c8913145822943097458 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 10:23 AM</a><br><br>

I must admit, I'm getting confused by the labels these days. I've always considered myself a liberal, regardless of my own interests and economic standing - which has changed and covered almost all levels at one time or another. I believe in those classic liberal values of equality, universal, tax-paid safety nets for the poor, the sick, the old… Government interference if necessary to promote a more level playing field for the working class and less fortunate. IMHO these are more important than a free and open playing field which ultimately favors the lucky few who have been either born rich or clever, ambitious or ruthless. I think community well being and harmony is something that needs to be decided upon and enforced. Human individual aspiration comes far more naturally and IMHO doesn't need to be promoted as much if at all. I am aware that this philosophy is not shared by everyone, or even everyone here. That's perfectly fine by me.<br><br>Like many others here, I don't feel like I've left the democratic party, but it has left me. Where do I go? I find on some issues I fall more into the libertarian or far right camp, on some - the socialist camp… and I just lost a very long-term friend here for making a joke about being a Commie!

You have highlighted this distinction before, but sometimes it takes a bit of repetition for a new thought to sink in (or as another commenter put it, for a new conceptual tool to demonstrate its uses). In mulling this post, several new ways of looking at old reflections came up for me. <br><br>1) in a previous comment thread, I tried to analyse Black Lives Matter in terms of interests, not values. I said something to the effect that "a state or police force that can kill black citizens with impunity, is a state or police force that can kill citizens with impunity". That is to say I feel that regardless of my skin colour or ethnicity, I believe I have a personal stake in the existence of a rule of law that protects citizens from state or police over-reach. And every (in my judgment) unlawful, unpunished police killing of unarmed, unthreatening citizens injures my interests. Another commenter called this "liberal boilerplate". (Boilerplate, maybe, but liberal? No, I don't think so). <br><br>2) JMG you have answered a commenter with the view that feminists first succeeded by turning the tables on the domains allocated for values/interests... perhaps it is time to turn the tables again. In much of current discourse, the domain of "values" is OUR TEAM (tm) and the domain of "interests" is THE OTHER TEAM (tm). It strikes me we could all learn a great deal from re-phrasing what we think of as our own values in the language of interests - and we may even discover that pursuing our own interests does not necessarily make us terrible people. (It makes us normal). (We might also be more willing to consider that people we disagree with have values, as well as interests - much like ourselves). <br><br>3) The most problematic kinds of interests are "powerful interests" (because they are difficult for less powerful people to check/counter) and "hidden interests" (because they are difficult for anyone not in the know to check/counter). One of the problems you highlight in this post is that "values" language can so effectively mask interests as to make them "forbidden" to discuss. Quite often having a clear idea of another's interests is the starting point for reconciling theirs and yours. Without it, your conversations will sail past one another and never connect.<br><br>4) Just as an individual may have conflicting values, they may have conflicting interests. That is to say, the value vs interest pole of conflict is not the only pole that may give rise to internal contradiction, or tension, within any individual. Value vs value, and interest vs interest may also do so. To understand how this could be, consider the famous "tragedy of the commons" problem. It may be in an individual's short term interest to cheat and take more from the commons than it can sustain for short term gain and advantage. Yet it is equally in the same individual's long term interest to have a share in a sustainably managed commons. One could analyse many of our current political, social, and yes, environmental conflicts in this way.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c5222287628068205709 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 12:40 PM</a><br><br>

It is not possible for any two people to completely share interests, if for no other reason than that we cannot occupy the same place at the same time as another, therefore our histories, our perspectives, must diverge - a little or a lot. IF conflict is inevitable, then the necessary skill or knack is to be able to resolve conflicts in the most bloodless way possible.<br><br>6) This leads to the thought that some concepts that seem intuitively to be values, may actually be meta-interests. For example, the saying "privilege benefits some, justice benefits all" speaks to the "interest" in the concept of justice rather than the "value". For good order, let me say that my definition of justice is simply this - "the principle of arranging things such that, were our positions in the arrangement reversed, the arrangement would still work well for both of us". For an analogy, let me reach for a sporting one. The interests the players and the teams have is in winning, and they will bend their efforts towards that end. In that sense, the interests of one team will be opposed to the interest of their opponents. In a different sense, the meta-interest of all players is in having rules, arbitration, facilities, etc so arranged that no team derives a hidden or unfair advantage, and all can use the play opportunities to demonstrate skill, teamwork, and etc. If the play were rigged, sooner or later, the whole concept of playing would lose its flavour, and no one would want to.<br><br>Ok, that's enough.

In the multi-post twitter essay, he posts a commentary on Sarah Perry's "Weaponized Sacredness" article : http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/05/07/weaponized-sacredness/ <br><br>This is very very good read in itself. I cannot do it justice in summarising. <br><br>A few notes here: Mr Bones represents a section of the alt-right, the kinds that lurk in the murky bogs of 4chan, /pol and other disreputable hives of scum and villainy. He is intelligent, verbose, ironic and actually onto something here, a few quotes to wet the palate: I've condensed some of his tweets into contiguous paragraphs.<br><br>" Much confusion around Catholicism, Christianity, religion, etc in Alt Right and similar rejections of modernity. This is largely due to our rejection of the sacredness of progressive liberalism, sometimes via rejection of sacredness itself. Some of us look at the Pope suckling on the toes of Muslims, saying the same tripe as leftists, and see it as more progressive liberalism. Some of us see religions as competing with progressive liberalism, demanding we respect their sacredness instead. Some of make an uneasy truce, rejecting some claims to sacredness but accepting others, unsure if we have a good basis for choosing. Plenty of us embrace progressive liberalism's doctrine of degrading the sacredness of all others, but then apply it to all including proglib. This is a confusion born from lack of understanding the mechanism at play here, "sacredness" itself."<br><br>"Sacredness forms us into marauding mental tribes to wage social warfare for resources and status. But the ideas we form around, demand of us steep payment for their services. Payment to an *idea*? This is no ordinary warband situation We need a better metaphor. And so we meet the Egregore: believers worshipping their god, waging war on other sects. No accident that we speak of feminism or progressivism as we might speak of vengeful gods. No accident, either, that we bring our own: Kek.<br><br>Meme magic is real: it made both Pres candidates notice us! Egregores really do exist: they ARE the acts of its believers, working its will. Egregores are not just for war (though it is their natural element). They could coordinate a band of builders, too. Western Civilisation is the greatest, most complex artifact built by man. It was built under the dominion of successive egregores. At first Christianity (particularly Catholicism) was the steward-god supervising the construction of the Western world. After came the Enlightenment, secular liberalism, driving us through the Industrial Revolution, whipping us harder, a frenzy of achievement. And then, the West was beholden to Progressive Liberalism. Lacking the skill or taste of our previous masters, it had us produce modernity. But this egregore is sick, it is dying. Harassed by that other egregore, Islam, it cravenly sacrifices its humans to avoid a fight.<br> <br>Our disgust with modernity, our violation of proglib sacredness, is because we see clearly that it has abandoned our wellbeing. Disaffected, we performed - unconsciously, unknowingly - a great ritual to spawn a new egregore, and we christened it Kek. This egregore bound us together, hardened us against our foes, formed us into a formidable warband, challenged the others prowling society.

Because teens didn’t have to work to support their families, drop-out rates decreased. Crime rates, hospital visits, psychiatric hospitalizations and domestic abuse rates all dropped, as well. More adults pursued higher education. Those who continued to work reported more job flexibility and more opportunity to choose employment they preferred."<br><br>Look at all the "professions" that are less needed when families function - psychiatrists, doctors, nurses, school administration (to chase down missing kids), special education teachers (to increase test scores), police, social workers, and all the various non-profits that feed, house and clothe the hungry. What isn't listed is elder care, nursing homes, day care, preschools, the various after school programs, fast food restaurants and every kind of place to grab a quick bite between jobs or because one just isn't home to cook.<br><br>So paying people a decent living wage will basically crash the economy, not because it will cost too much to implement, but because of all the people put out of work when people aren't struggling to survive.

Check out the spring and early summer archives of a site called Down With Tyranny, DWT.com I think, for the gory details. In so doing, the Democratic leadership, I use the term advisedly, have managed to disrespect and sideline some very capable and ambitious people, and I doubt those individuals are going to run away and cry in a corner somewhere. <br><br>So, we may be seeing some quite serious and sustained new party building over the next few years, with candidates who already have national reputations and national followings. I imagine new party staff members will be scouring the internet to figure out what kinds of policies might attract voters; therefor, I would suggest, now is the time for us to make our preferences and criticisms known.<br><br><a href=#c8692594497638511791 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 4:29 PM</a><br><br>

The pundits who insisted that the stars and bars merely represented racism are just as full of it as the 'heritage not hate' folks. A flag that only CNN, MSNBC and Al Sharpton will call racist that represents the legitimate desire for Southern independence, but is sufficiently divorced from the 'Old South' that a sympathetic Canadian might consider flying it because, well, Don't Tread On Me is the American Molon Labe, or Tiocfadih Ar La, or Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite.<br><br>One reason why I think the USA was successful, on top of the (far more important) geopolitical reasons is the model of loosely confederated states. Even when the USA was 90% white, politics often followed ethnic lines among whites. One interesting point that Scott Adams of Dilbert fame has made recently is that our perception of reality is modulated by evolutionary factors and is therefore not objective but also inherent in us. Adams does not go so far as to point out that different ethnic groups might perceive reality differently, but I think the evidence for that idea is strong. I can't find the link, but there was a fascinating study done where people were asked to group three objects into two groups. Two of the objects were made of the same material, and two were the same shape (for example, a wooden cylinder, a plastic cylinder and a wooden cube). Asians (living in China) nearly all grouped the objects based on material, and whites in America almost all grouped them based on shape. There's a possibility that there's a cultural bias, but culture comes from people after all.<br><br>It's obviously silly to say that the Asian way of looking at things is superior or inferior to the (white?) Western way of looking at things. But it my hypothesis is correct, then we live in a far richer world than the cultural-deterministic model popular in elite circles suggests, and that we must also acknowledge and respect our differences with other people, which goes back to the notion of states rights. I think we need to accept that we're not all going to get along, and should leave each other alone to a certain extent.<br><br><a href=#c8589453489122785457 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 4:39 PM</a><br><br>

I'm enormously heartened and relieved that there is no longer the same polarization of queers towards the left, that we are becoming, it would appear, less of a captive constituency and more fully integrated into the American project right, left and center. this would also mean that there is greater general acceptance of queerness - I've been thinking this week that a major reason that minority groups tend to cluster around the left is because we want to, very understandably, be protected by a centralized power. if queers as a group are becoming more center and right orientated I imagine that would imply that there is no longer such a desire to cleave to the state for protection against a hostile majority. Perhaps we have, I dare say, assimilated quite nicely into the mainstream culture. This squares pretty neatly with my experience - mostly, people don't care that I'm trans, at all. It is totally a non-issue. Sure, there are a few people that look at me like they want to stomp my skull in, but mostly no one gives a flying frack that I'm queer. Some people are really into it even and are generous with me or take me under their wing, which is nice and sweet.

Yes, no doubt value-based politics also obeys the law of diminishing returns, and we're well into negative returns at this point. With regard to wind turbines, the gigantic ones that are fashionable these days are riddled with problems, but of course we can't just have good sturdy old-fashioned wind turbines of the sort that existed all over the US in 1920; no, we've got to progress to something that works much less well!<br><br>Koen, these days, if a politician's lips are moving, you can be 99% sure that they're lying. <br><br>Brigyn, thanks for the report from the Netherlands! The reason all young people are being screwed over, of course, is that in a time of serious (though unmentionable) economic crisis, if young people were to get a fair share, their elders would have to live less lavishly, and that's unacceptable to the elders. Always look for who gets the benefits and who pays the costs!<br><br>.Mallow, likewise, thanks for the report from Ireland! I really don't know what to say, other than that we're definitely further down the curve here in the US, and what makes sense here may not make sense elsewhere. How exactly to help the working class see past liberal virtue-mongering and pursue their own interest -- well, that's the challenge, of course. <br><br>YCS, excellent! Yes, and that puts the rise and fall of liberalism into a broader context I've discussed before, the movement from concrete to abstract that Vico traced in the cycle of the rise and fall of nations. In a real sense, liberalism is in trouble because its abstractions have become so obviously divorced from reality that too few people are falling for the rhetoric any more. <br><br>K Sc, the implosion of public trust in science is <a href=../../2015/03/the-view-from-outside_18.html rel=nofollow>something I've talked about here before</a>, of course, and it's a huge issue.

I'd point out, though, that liberalism as such has more often than not been fairly comfortable with corporate power, so long as that's been wielded in ways that support the liberal agenda -- not at all surprising for a political movement of the affluent elite! Thus we get talk about breaking the glass ceiling rather than, say, talk about flattening out the hierarchy of wealth and influence; if women and ethnic minorities have an equal shot at becoming absurdly rich, to the liberal mind, all's well.

Talk about taking purity politics to the extreme. This is uniting everyone who has any any skepticism about the official line under one banner, from those who just want to delay vaccinating their children or space them out to those who want to rid the world of vaccines, and since so many of the science types in fields far from medicine have equated any dissidence on the vaccine issue with being anti-science, that's setting the stage for any sort of scandal to irreversibly ruin the prestige of science as a whole.<br><br><a href=#c2609926917842638500 title="comment permalink">9/29/16, 7:59 PM</a><br><br>

All sorts of prominent Republicans claimed they were going to vote against Trump, but now they're meekly falling in line. <br><br>My prediction is that Clinton will edge out Trump in a narrow election, have an abysmal presidency with approval ratings akin to Bush II's second term, especially after the trouncing of US combat jets over Syria by the Russians in late 2018 followed by the Panic of 2019. Then Fred Halliot makes mincemeat of her in 2020, with a map that looks like an updated version of the Carter-Reagan map in 1980.

The whole thing is completely run by non-scientists, who understand the actual science very poorly - policy makers who cherry-pick results, and promoters who do all the actual communicating with the media.

Whether you call them Republican &amp; Democrat, Conservatives &amp; Labour or whatever, the outline is mostly the same. They just take turns is all. Going way back, Republican Rome was a balance of these two forces until Caesar knocked that set-up over.<br> On another level, I think that historically there has always been a sort of grand bargain between rulers and ruled. The agreement has usually been that the ruled say to the rulers; "OK, we know you want to skim some money off the top but as long as things run smoothly, we are cool with that. But you must provide paying jobs, keep the streets safe and clean, have the schools run smoothly, give the little guy a chance to advance themselves, etc." It is a pragmatic approach to human nature and if the rulers do not get too greedy and corrupt, can work over a very long time. When it doesn't work you have France 1789.<br> The present elite in most western countries has deliberately broken this bargain as they feel that they can now get away with it. All of us can name a hundred things without much effort of how things are being stuffed up by them such as the F-35, fracking, Cold War 2, global warming, decreasing life spans, terrorism, rigged economies, oil dependency, quantitative easing, negative interest rates, bail-outs and bail-ins.

And I don't see anyone suggesting that course of action which would actually work, so no wonder the movement for pay equality focuses instead on appeals to "values" instead of anything that would actually produce a useful outcome on that issue.<br><br>And I have also noticed that when it comes to salaries and perquisites, some pigs certainly feel that they are much more equal than others... Just sayin.<br><br>And if anyone should choose to judge me for those opinions, I once took a lower salary so that my team could be paid more, and because they all pretty much knew what everyone was paid (because they were snoopy as and access to the accounts!), they were a very loyal team and followed my lead and worked hard. I met one of them a few months back by sheer accident in the city and I got a big happy hug, which was nice!<br><br>You are so right about the small scale wind turbines as there is so much less to go wrong with them. The large ones just will not operate without a base load grid which plays the role that the batteries do here. And nobody wants to pay for that massive investment of infrastructure.<br><br>You may be interested to know that the old school wind turbines down here were usually used to pump water from water bores into storage tanks. Those were very common and they were all over the landscape. You can even still see them nowadays, although they are probably not as well maintained as they should be. The ones for electricity were not as common, because most rural houses in those days (and it wasn't that long ago) just didn't have or need electricity. But water, they needed water... Oh yeah.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>Hi eagle eye,<br><br>Mate, the Tarkine. Awesome and total respect! What a stunning part of the world you live in. Thanks very much for the suggestion about the steel. I almost missed reading your comment and may never have considered that option. There is a specialty supplier in Melbourne too. I could fabricate something myself. And yeah, drilling hardened steel is a nightmare. Last year, I had a lot of fun with 3mm stainless steel. What a nightmare...<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c7873968344094588057 title="comment permalink">9/30/16, 5:17 AM</a><br><br>

The Christmas piece is relevant, at least for me, because of the prevalence of 19th century Americana in holiday decor. I have always had a sentimental view, to a degree, for that era. The student of history in me knows -- knows very well -- of the considerable warts that time period had, but there was also, at least as viewed in hindsight, a balanced simplicity but also an optimism for the future, a sense of open possibility which contrasts strongly with the narrowing of possibility today. Community still existed and vestiges of noblesse obliged remained, as opposed to our increasingly fractured and isolated individualized society today. On the other hand, I also know that the achievements of that period were largely possible only due to the very trajectories that resulted in our problems of today -- so perhaps this is foolish sentimentality on my part. The question before me remains -- what will I do about it? Given the (non-negotiable) set of circumstances we face, what path will I take? I feel my way forward, blindly at times, and cannot see very far. Perhaps as things continue to work through their course, I will be able to see more clearly. In the meantime, mining the past for what works seems a good place to start.<br><br><a href=#c1735357046328751064 title="comment permalink">9/30/16, 5:34 AM</a><br><br>

Liberalism is unravelling as a coherent project, but there is still a lot of life left in the splintering causes fired by progressive values. After your exploration of the progress myth, this post focusing on values replacing interests suggests a likely trajectory for the next few decades. If reality is crushing progressive economic utopian dreams. A natural shift will be to focus more on progressive social values that are not explicitly economic like racism and sexism. One might argue that the current stream of movies and shows about race relations and oppressed women can be read it that light. The problem is that there isn't a path forward to rights the wrongs of the past. As reality bites back at an economic system that has been using resources beyonds its means, then everyone is going to feel oppressed. It may be convenient to focus on traditionally oppressed groups rather than facing the reality of the coming decades.<br><br><a href=#c386763786943025002 title="comment permalink">9/30/16, 9:32 AM</a><br><br>

That happens, of course. <br><br>But, the nonsense starts when the left talks about the likes of UKIP. They invariably accuse them of 'fomenting rage' against immigrants. In fact, UKIP et al are not aiming to foment such rage at all. They aim, as it says on the tin, to reduce immigration levels and in support of that aim they point out to people the concrete damage that mass immigration causes. It's perfectly possible to agree with that aim and that statement of fact without feeling any rage whatsoever towards any immigrant. That is what most UKIP supporters do. <br><br>The reason that the left insists that any such movement is simply stirring up base emotions against often darker skinned minorities is that they know perfectly well that they themselves have no intention of doing anything to reduce immigration levels even though that's exactly what many of their constituents actually want.

Vaccines are not absolutely safe. There will always be some proportion of people who have a reaction of some level of severity. They’re justified because they prevent pandemics of more serious diseases via something called “herd immunity,” which simply means that, when just about everyone is vaccinated against something, pandemics don’t have a chance to take hold. By not vaccinating, you’re helping to break “herd immunity” and contributing, in some small way, to the next pandemic.<br><br>This seems to be a hard concept to get across.<br><br>There’s also a more generic question of what over-vaccinating does to a person’s micro-biome and whether it hinders the development of a healthy immune system. A lot of the current crop of vaccines seem to be oriented more to financial interests than addressing a significant health problem.<br><br>@JMG<br><br>I noticed your comment about Awakenings alternating between religious and political. Then I remembered that in a prior post you had that alternation at 40-year intervals instead of 80-year intervals, which matches Strauss and Howe’s formulation: Awakenings are always about values while Crisis periods are always about politics - specifically, about how to fix the crisis, stabilize the situation and keep it from happening again.<br><br>In the Michael Teaching, the first, third and fifth in a set of five are individualistic (for very different reasons) while the second and fourth are community-oriented. This may match your perception of the four Awakenings we’ve seen in the American Experience so far. I notice that both the Transcendental Awakening and the Consciousness Revolution had a strong commune movement; I don’t remember that commune movements being anywhere near as strong during either the Great Awakening or the Missionary Awakening.<br><br>I could also comment that John Xenakais (Generational Dynamics), in his work to expand Strauss and Howe to the rest of the world and the rest of history, does not find that the Awakening periods are in general religious in nature. This seems to be a local characteristic of the American Experience.<br><br>Re: Clinton<br><br>I note that a number of people have criticized Clinton for not having anything positive to say.

Ward's blog <i>The Slog</i> is one of the blogs I follow regularly along with this one, SNAFU, Vineyard of the Saker, Fourth Revolutionary War, Traditional Right and Lord Beria's.<br><br>https://hat4uk.wordpress.com/2016/09/29/deutsche-bank-events-are-accelerating-and-no-amount-of-elite-balm-can-stop-that-development/<br><br>https://hat4uk.wordpress.com/2016/09/30/crash2-this-isnt-just-one-silly-deutsche-bank-its-the-catalyst-for-a/<br><br>The US news media has largely ignored this story in favor of the latest trash talking about Donald Trump and his supporters and whether or not Kim Kardashian will vote for him, but this could be YUGE! Between the financial crisis unfolding in the German banking industry, growing tensions over the immigration crisis, the rise of populism on both the right and the left and continuing concerns over terrorism coming from Islamic and right-wing extremists, things could get very interesting indeed in the European Union.<br><br>Oh, and it look like Hungary might get kicked out of the EU if its citizens fail to vote to allow asylum seekers from the Middle East overrun their country as well. <br><br>The vote is on Sunday and polls show Hungarians are likely to vote overwhelmingly to tell the senile elites in Brussels and the SJW's exactly where they can stuff their demands. Since Brussels has already threatened to stick Hungary with a 250,000 Euro fine for per day for every migrant they fail to take in and its been months since the standoff began, Hungarians are in a position where if they do knuckle under, they risk being assessed crippling fines they will never be able to pay off. That's the problem with pushing people until their backs are against the wall: sooner or later they realize their only hope is to fight back because they've got nothing to lose.<br><br>That old Chinese curse about living in interesting times just keeps coming to mind over and over again...<br><br><a href=#c1554551076615360586 title="comment permalink">9/30/16, 3:42 PM</a><br><br>

I still have trouble because I have poor automatic responses (for example, it takes me about half a second too long to return a smile), but I certainly have no trouble in normal society. One reason why I don't like victim culture is that I'm aware that if I had been taught that I'm a special snowflake, rather than someone with a mental difference from the average human, I might not have been so inclined to regard neurotypical social iterations as normal and aspire to being normal, which would have lead to a worse outcome for me.<br><br>I need to work on my run-on sentences.<br><br><a href=#c3562813030376319440 title="comment permalink">9/30/16, 5:08 PM</a><br><br>

I found it a luminous experience - the contrast of the voiceless, powerless narrator in our own violent and exploitive society, with the future imagined society where everyone has a voice is just heart rending.<br><br>In the same way that Retrotopia has imbued many of us with a sense of wanting to return to this sane, safe place that feels like home, the future utopian agrarian community in 'Woman on the Edge of Time' feels almost womb-like in its practices which prioritise the mental health and happiness of its citizens - not, incidentally, in the sense of liberal ideals as JMG outlined today, but because these communities have realised that their longterm survival, their real happiness and significant limits on material progress are all synonymous terms for living lightly in terms of things, and deeply in terms of relationships, philosophy and social cohesion.<br><br>This is, of course, also the conclusion that many traditional societies have come to - for 40,000 years or so Aboriginal Australians have lived both lightly on the land and deeply in regard to complex social relationships, the arts and spirituality.<br><br>The contrast of this ideal with our current priorities - the worship of technical progress, of material wealth over the health and happiness, or even the basic rights and dignities of citizens - is like a blow to the solar plexus. What on earth are we fighting to preserve our current way of life for? It really is time to get serious and fight in the opposite direction - to get rid of as much damaging technology as we can, along with the appalling assumption that technological progress is more important than the health and well-being of humanity and the earth.<br><br>Apart from reforming my own lifestyle, I am currently trying to work out just how I can engage in my community to further these ideas..<br><br><br><br><a href=#c3301221117048760350 title="comment permalink">9/30/16, 5:47 PM</a><br><br>

Which is the deal Cuomo strongarmed for that plant on Lake Ontario. <br><br>There is an argument that reliable baseline load electric power is under valued by the market, But that argument is based on the old industrial economy which has been systematically dismantled over the last decades. And energy efficiency has improved a lot in the survivors. Consider my employer. In 2004 we pulled 50 megawatts pretty much constantly and produced 220 tons a month.

The EU really is threatening to fine Hungary a quarter of a million Euros per day per refugee they don't take, a move the Hungarian government openly describes as "blackmail", and they are right. Here are a couple of articles that appeared in the British news media:<br><br>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3573384/Hungary-accuses-EU-blackmail-introducing-fines-250-000-MIGRANT-countries-not-quota-refugees.html<br><br>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/03/eu-to-fine-countries-that-refuse-refugee-quota/<br><br>And apparently, Poland is facing similar sanctions:<br><br>http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/112116-160504-hungary-poland-blast-eu-fines-for-refusing-refugees<br><br>Pretty disgusting, huh? It's no wonder why the Hungarian government is urging its citizens to vote "no" in the Sunday referendum. Like I said, if you push people too far, you give them no choice but to stand up and fight back because they have been left with no alternative. <br><br>Between EU bullying of countries like Hungary, Greece and Poland, the predatory beggar-thy-neighbor economic policies of the Germans and the escalating crisis in the German banking system, which could trigger off banking crises in other countries like Spain and Italy, it certainly looks to me like the senile elites in the EU are sealing their own fate.

I want people to chew on these ideas, not merely accept or reject them blindly. <br><br>Greg, to my mind the best arguments for UBI are that it would cost rather less than the current US welfare system, be much less intrusive, and would allow some millions of government bureaucrats to be fired. (They'll be fine -- after all, they'll have UBI to fall back on.) Since it would actually lower government expenditures and cut bureaucracy, it seems like a very conservative measure! <br><br>Ganv, the establishment party doesn't need rhetoric -- it simply needs a recognition of shared interests. The same is true of the populist party. That's the thing about a shift away from a value-centric politics: rhetoric plays much less of a role. You're certainly right, though, about the wild card. <br><br>DaShui, if I'd set out to make a complete catalog of the ways that American society dresses up blatant self-interest in moralizing drag, I'd be busy for weeks! Which is to say, of course you're quite correct. <br><br>Pantagruel, that's exactly what you can expect from an economics professor. Not all interests are economic in nature. Keeping your kids safe is difficult to quantify in dollars and cents, but people identify it as an important interest. The key is to get outside a purely economic analysis of interests and understand them as anything that somebody wants, or wants to avoid. <br><br>Neo, thanks. It's a data point, at least. <br><br>Nastarana, no, when combined with the extortionate railroad pricing policies of the day, it was a form of sharecropping. The point of UBI is that you don't have to do anything at all to collect. <br><br>Eric, exactly! In politics, every narrative is always contested and always in competition with other narratives. The liberal narrative was never univocal, even when it monopolized the mass media, and yes -- the rejection of elite white liberal leadership by BLM and others is very much part of the process I have in mind. <br><br>Mister R., glad to hear it. Yes, once you bring interests into the picture, things really do get clearer in a hurry!<br><br>Yucca, of course! You've spent your life in an environment in which all politics were by definition framed in terms of values, so yes, it takes an ongoing effort to think your own thoughts rather than those that your culture and the media hand you. <br><br>Sleisz Ádám, I suspect here we have one of the great divides separating the Anglo-American from the continental European experience. In 19th century America, there was a very high degree of consensus on moral values, and nothing like the sort of cultural diversity you've got in central Europe, thus the very different results of values-based politics in the two regions. <br><br>Gwizard, I'll definitely take a look at Crawford as circumstances permit. As for other historians, the vast majority are writers on specific, narrowly defined historical issues -- for example, Bryan Ward-Perkins on the fall of Rome.<br><br><a href=#c6150555539244865513 title="comment permalink">9/30/16, 11:11 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not sure why I didn't catch that, but I somehow managed to miss it -- and you're right, of course; one of the other core aspects of liberalism is the absolute, and at times hysterically frantic, rejection of limits. Hmm. That's going to need some serious brooding. <br><br>Ric, I made use of the phrase precisely because it's misused in that context so consistently, so I knew that a reference to it would get the reaction I wanted to undercut in the next paragraph. If this were a book, and not a blog post, I would have footnoted that very point. <br><br>Varun, whether values or interests predominate in politics is a matter of cultural fashions, and varies from culture to culture and from era to era. As for syndicalism, why, yes -- democratic syndicalism (I'm not a fan of anarcho-anything) has long struck me as one of the best of the forgotten alternatives, and I'd be happy to see it revived and put back into the debate. <br><br>Nancy, many thanks. I'm interested in data from trials, primarily -- you can make any system, even Marxism, look good in the abstract. If Finland gives it a try, it'll be interesting to see how things go. <br><br>Moon-Shadows, thank you. <br><br>Caryn, no, it hasn't always been this messy. Old alignments and allegiances are disintegrating and new ones haven't yet formed, and so a lot of people are trying to define themselves when the lines between the categories have been washed away. It does make for tangled conversations! <br><br>Thymia, that's certainly a crucial element. The other thing I'd like to see is more churches putting their money (and labor) where their mouths are -- there are some very good examples in this field, but also a lot of self-absorbed churches that have forgotten what the founder of their religion said about helping the poor. (And of course there are plenty of other religious bodies, some of which do a great deal, and some of which could do much more.) <br><br>Susan, that's a fair challenge! I'll consider doing a post on the alternatives to the current system, of which a return to federalism is one and peaceful dissolution of the Union is another. <br><br>Scotlyn, excellent. Exactly. And the jujitsu move of turning the tables, redefining a position in terms of interests rather than values when values are supposed to be the hallmark of "your team," is the kind of political thinking that might actually get some traction. As for Saudi Arabia -- yes, I'm watching that carefully. I'm beginning to wonder if the slump in luxury real estate worldwide may be driven by frantic selling of assets by the Saudi government, in an attempt to refill a looted treasury before the whole thing comes crashing down...<br><br>Nancy, I'll certainly consider that. <br><br>Lucretia, true enough. Liberal rhetoric has devolved to "do what I tell you, or I'll call you a nasty name!" That somehow doesn't have a lot of clout.<br><br><a href=#c8491107929448973037 title="comment permalink">9/30/16, 11:39 PM</a><br><br>

It was the first place I found out about communes before the 1960s. In Federal Way, WA, where I spent a chunk of my childhood, a defunct commune from the late 19th century was still a subject of fading local gossip in the late 1960s and early 1970s. <br><br>Phil, yes, I've been watching the alt-right for some time, ever since some of my posts started to get lots of page views via alt-right blogs. (They seem to like my challenging the myth of progress, though they aren't happy about my comfort level with gender equality and my dismissal of the myth of "the white race.") If Clinton wins this race, my guess is that the alt-right will be the big winners -- she gave them a great deal of publicity, and they can now present themselves to the public as an alternative to the moribund status quo that she embodies. <br><br>WB, yep. Things are heating up in a big way. <br><br>Justin, I don't have the references handy, but one of the major new trends in psychology research focuses on the fact that theories based purely on the behavior of white American college undergraduates (the main research-subject pool for most psych experiments on humans in the US) simply won't work when applied to people of other cultures. America is not the generically human -- it's an extremely idiosyncratic culture with its own weird kinks and twists. That is to say, I think you're on to something. <br><br>Bob, different countries have different histories, and liberalism in Canada may have a while to run yet. <br><br>Carl, funny! I like that. <br><br>Noroman, I got that detail from Niall Ferguson's <i>Empire</i> -- amusingly, he managed to miss the obvious implication. <br><br>Grebulocities, that certainly seems like one plausible set of outcomes to me. <br><br>KL, I'll put that on the get-to list. Many thanks! <br><br>Santeri, so get out there and organize a movement for that goal, if you really think that's the way to do. Political change does not happen because someone posts a comment on a blog, after all. <br><br>Kevin, of course that's normal -- a party for the establishment and a party for everyone else. The last few decades, during which both parties have pandered to the establishment, is the anomaly. As for "Les Deplorables," I've already considered it. <br><br>Rebecca, you're welcome. Since I have Aspergers, I'm comfortably unaware of any social reaction to my mentioning that I have Aspergers! ;-) Seriously, though, there are a lot of us out there, and a lot of people in nearby regions of the autism spectrum. While I think it's an utter waste of time to play the victim role, the more of us are public about our condition, field questions from those who don't know a lot about it, and provide role models to show young people with AS or the like that they don't have to become full-time victims or let the medical industry drug them into numbness -- that they can have pleasant, productive lives doing things they care about -- the better off everyone will be. <br><br>(BTW, fans of my novel <i>The Weird of Hali: Innsmouth</i> may like to know that one of Owen and Laura Merrill's children has Aspergers. He'll be introduced in the fifth book; I'm not sure, but I think he's going to grow up to be a mad scientist...)<br><br><a href=#c785887236072083031 title="comment permalink">10/1/16, 12:01 AM</a><br><br>

Fixating on breaking the glass ceiling also distracts attention from questions like "just what does an executive do to earn those absurd paychecks?" and "does it actually benefit other women if one woman becomes an overpaid CEO?" <br><br>David, to my mind, that sort of nostalgia is already becoming a powerful force. The challenge will be to overcome the assault of the progress worshippers, who will insist (screech, rather) that if you favor anything from the 19th century you must by definition be in favor of their extreme caricature of all its worst features. <br><br>Latefall, and if you have a lot of oil revenue to throw around, things like that are options. <br><br>Bill, your first comment I can agree with. Your second? Not a chance. If Clinton wins this year's election, as of course she might, she'll face no meaningful opposition in the 2020 primaries; she could bomb Canada, legalize slavery, and strip mine the national parks, and the Democratic voters will do their fifteen minutes of socially approved protest and then fall bleating into line to vote for her. <br><br>Anthony, good! Exactly; two very narrow political ideologies that barely differ from one another have defined themselves, via the media, as the whole spectrum of political choice. The question is how to get other options into circulation again. <br><br>Hammer, if I had a dime for every time this question has been asked here, I'd order pizza right now on the proceeds. Slavery only makes economic sense when you have an export-based economy and a labor shortage -- that's why it was so important in the Roman world and the antebellum South, for example. We won't be facing that combination of circumstances for many centuries to come. <br><br>David, and yet that nostalgia motivated attempts to preserve Roman culture, some of which had very valuable results. Nor was it out of place for fourth-century Romans to back candidates for the imperial purple who were capable of providing relative stability the way Augustus did...<br><br>Ganv, yep. And those who care about, say, gender equality or the rights of sexual minorities can jump off the sinking ship of liberalism and find other political frames for their interests.<br><br>Gwizard, Graeber is interesting, but he's missing the possibility that the poor are also angry about their treatment by his class...which they are. <br><br>Matthias, sure. And if pigs had wings, we'd all catch our breakfast bacon in butterfly nets... ;-)<br><br>Lordberia3, thank you. A lot depends on whether the populists can mobilize fast and hard enough, at least in this country -- in Europe, their ascendancy is basically a given at this point, and becomes more so with every idiotic utterance out of Brussels.

Like most other political movements, liberalism began with high ideals and gradually betrayed them -- but I would argue that a look at the 19th century origins of the movement shows that the ideals were actually there, and not just as reflections of interests. Nowadays? I won't argue with you at all. <br><br>Synthase, and one of the core reasons it's collapsing is that institutional science has become so gaudily corrupt, and so riddled with claims that too obviously support this or that interest, that a great many reasonable people can no longer take on faith the kind of claim you've just made. Yes, that's a pity. More on this in an upcoming post -- the decline and fall of science is shifting into overdrive around us. As for illiberalism, do you track the alt-right at all?

I think that the same "valuification" has been also applied to the labour market.<br>In the current public discourse having a job is described as something necessary for dignity instead of being the trade of time and effort in exchange of money as it is. So an employer becomes a "workgiver" and is advertised as a good man providing people with the opportunity to make themselves useful. Unpayed overtime, pushing a company culture requiring people to sacrifice more and more time and effort just to maintain the job? Opportunities To make themselves even more useful ! Good! <br>Subscribing to a trade union (not the old ones .. all bought ) and -horror- striking ? How bad, horrible, lazy unpatriotic attitude! They deserve to be fired ... and they better learn to be flexible afterwards and bend to every whim of their next employee after a convenient period of suffering imposed by personeel selection practices. <br>In the meanwhile they can make themselves useful volunteering free time and effort for the CEO wife (herself very well payed for presiding over the charity!).<br><br>Companies writing sweety "mission" statements describing how they, yes, want the bottom line but whatreally interests them is bla bla bla.. Companies (Apple) sanctifying their CEO as if he had all ideas and were directly responsible for all good produced in the company while all employees were are unfortunate but necessary costs to bring all this good to the people.<br><br>All this has in common is that what used to be a simple exchange .. balanced or horribly unbalanced and abusing is masked in moral overtones that make an honest discussion over the fairness of the deals impossible.<br><br><a href=#c612674165840623308 title="comment permalink">10/1/16, 2:15 AM</a><br><br>

I don't pay too much attention (I read counter-currents, and that's about it), but one thing the alt-right does seem to consistently believe is that the world that progress created is not so good after all.

Methinks the Upset Engineer is far more prevalent and more fun to deal with - I'm met a few in real life, as opposed to comics. Because when they go off the rails, it's as you said - totally logical and, like Asimov's robots, never reasonable.<br><br>But on another statement, "Slavery only makes economic sense when you have an export-based economy and a labor shortage -- that's why it was so important in the Roman world and the antebellum South, for example. We won't be facing that combination of circumstances for many centuries to come...", I give you one word from the very Dark Ages barbarian early Anglo-Saxon culture: "Thrall." With "Welsh" used as a synonym." A slave by any other name... it's the plantation economy they won't have.<br><br>Also - in ancient Rome - a huge number of the slaves in Rome itself were not plantation workers at all. Many were the maids-of-all-work for the poor prole who could only afford one slave, and therefore bought a young woman - often, if the owner was male, instead of taking a wife. Or a shop assistant for the craftsman in the Subura, sleep on the floor of the shop and eat the master's leftovers. <br><br>But ask anybody if they don't need more kitchen help and/or a guaranteed bedmate, feed them a truth potion, and see how fast the positive answers roll in. Doubled if you actually need physical help in everyday tasks. It's so silly to go to the beauty shop just to get your toenails trimmed, when a good lady's maid would be of enormous help! Now add in an economy without money, where running away to find paid work would be difficult. [And no, I hope I would hire a maid on decent terms with the option to leave and a good dowry upon leaving. But then I was born into a set of values now rapidly fading, not a hard-pressed barbarian steading where the work is never done.]<br><br><a href=#c2463417060688153663 title="comment permalink">10/1/16, 8:31 AM</a><br><br>

Where there are fundamental and intractable differences of opinion about what the basic agreements underlying a civilization should be in the first place?

Hungary is not a destination for immigrants. Yes, the transit of predominantly Asian migrants in the last two years became a significantly larger burden than before. Any denial of that fact is futile. However, this matter is hardly comparable to the problems of destination countries.

I just don't see it that way. Eastern EU governments attack Brussels for their short-term benefit in popularity and international prestige. In the meantime, their current arguments are tearing apart the very power structure their status depends on. The political/economic/intellectual elites of these countries are largely sustained by the West and they are quite unaware that essential changes are coming.<br><br>Hungary is very much prone to the dangers of mass migration but the actual troubles are not even mentioned in the context of this referendum. We have a process of serious mass emigration under way. To the West. People are talking about moving out of the country all the time, and hundreds of thousands have done it already. Most of them young, strong and ambitious. The loss of these people is awful to Hungary. Ironically, the demonizing of migrants can easily turn against them in the future and there will be nothing we can do about it then.<br><br>I hope you excuse me for this little rant.

I have a lot of respect for science as a tool and definitely would not want to see it lost, but I also see all the cries of "anti-science" and "war on science" as being overblown, although it's quite possible they will be come a self-fulfilling prophecy in the future. For now, I see no coordinated anti-science movement, merely more questioning of establishment views on things. There are plenty of people with no strong interest in anything scientific, but I don't see that as anything different than its always been. The difference that I'm seeing is an increase in skepticism, ironically its skepticism of a sort that most of the self-proclaimed "skeptics" can't stand, skepticism of the establishment views. And, since the establishment is increasingly corrupt and using their prestige and people's trust to frame laws and policy, I personally see this increases skepticism as being a good thing at this point in time, though not without its drawbacks.<br><br>When I hear news of this or that discovery in medical science, I know I'm far from the only one who's first reaction is "What are they going to try to push on us now?" This doesn't apply to science as a whole, I can read about, for example, extrasolar planet discoveries, and still feel a little bit that sense of wonder that attracts so many to science in the first place. That's because nothing about extrasolar planets are being used by corporations and governments to control our lives more and more. I welcome a drop in the prestige of science not because I want science to disappear, far from it, I'd just like to see science lose some if its power as a political tool, and to see more humility about what we actually know.<br><br>Increasing distrust in the "scientific community" doesn't mean society will revert to medieval social norms, or those of the 1600s like some seem to fear. So much of science, especially science that's been around for a while, has affected our culture deeply enough that it won't change too quickly. Science could still play a significant role, it just would be more focused on producing tangible results that would then win people over, and keep the studies and the theoretical stuff within the scientific world. An example is weather forecasting, I suspect that science-based short term weather forecasts would still have a similar following as long as their accuracy remains better than anything else. People grumble when the weather forecast is wrong but if the weather is important to them, still usually pay attention to it because they don't have a more accurate alternative, whatever their views on science in the abstract are. Weather forecasters will end up in trouble when their satellites and superrcomputers aren't working anymore, but that's a completely different issue.<br><br>If science loses much of its political and social clout, I imagine the corruption and co-opting of science by various interests will dwindle as well, as there won't be enough money and power in it to be worth their while. That could be good for science in the long run, science could get back to its roots and focus on answering questions rather than forcing people to the will of various interests. I'd personally be overjoyed to see modern "scientific" medicine be on the same playing field as other forms (which may involve some science as well). If, as the defenders of scientism like to insist, it is superior to the others, why are they so afraid of it competing on equal terms with other sorts?<br><br><a href=#c8244426632566771477 title="comment permalink">10/1/16, 7:11 PM</a><br><br>

I'll use young-earth creationism as an example, since I don't agree with it and thus don't think I'm biased in favor of it at all. I can't consider YEC to be part of a war on science, though, because so many of its proponents come up with theories that attempt to make a scientific theory that fits the biblical narrative. A YEC that's truly anti-science would just say something to the effect that they trust that the Bible is literally true more than they trust in information gained through the scientific method. Some do leave it at that, but the fact that so much effort has been put into YEC theories (including a $27 million museum in Kentucky) that attempt to make YEC scientific says to me that there's still a good amount of respect for science in the YEC community, enough to put a lot of effort into attempting to reconcile a literal belief in the Bible with science.<br><br><a href=#c6909214744603495255 title="comment permalink">10/1/16, 7:12 PM</a><br><br>

And <i>American liberalism</i> is something very different from essentially pragmatic tradition of <i>continental European liberalism</i>. <br><br>So I prefer to talk about incoming end of European left (and my friends see even British Labour primarily as European left wing party). That way I can escape any confusion concerning <i>"illiberal democracy"</i> of Hungarian prime minister Victor Orban, with his fifty shades of fascist brown. Also it isn`t necessary to speak about such themes as "neoliberalism" etc. - debate which can be almost always very emotional and confusing. <br><br>End of reformist left was already foretold by late German sociologist Ralf Dahrendorf in 1990. He applied as model the end of major European <i>liberal democratic</i> parties in thirtees, when they exhausted realistic part of their political programme. <br><br>A little bit strange, however, is the reaction of far left, because they feel that the end of center-left reformism somehow "validates" their more radical sectarian position. If blairism is dead, they think, surely we can expect something really big, Apocal..., sorry, Revolution. Leftists political base - as a whole - shrinks, "proletarians" act as conservatives or even xenophobes, but far leftists still hope to convert enough citizens to their political religion. <br><br>European politics was about values all the time. It`s heritage of feudal past and religious wars. But there existed wide politically neutral and so called value-free field in the last sixty years, European unification proces. Even this may end, with radical shrinking of trust horizon and renaissance of nationalism. <br><br>There is really nothing constructive at sight, this is probably "political dark night" moment of entire West. <br><br>Maybe one certitude is, if only in philosophical sense: We still live in the <i>cosmopolis</i> of Stoics - no matter how fractured the human world will become.<br><br><a href=#c3569766137511296863 title="comment permalink">10/1/16, 9:50 PM</a><br><br>

That’s hardly a meaningless threat. So I don’t see how the fact that Hungary is not a target destination is relevant. The referendum is specifically about Merkels pointless forced redistribution plan. <br><br>I don’t understand this common argument that A is not the ‘real’ problem, B is. Is it not perfectly normal that there are many real problems, all of which deserve attention? The redistribution of migrants problem can be resolved with a referendum and a No message to the EU. <br><br>The brain drain from central Europe has no such clear solution. It’s just what happens in a world of increasing freedom of movement and increasing wealth gaps globally. <br><br>Of course there is xenophobia in Hungary. But, to take one example – Orbans campaign is running ads saying ‘did you know that migrants carried out the Paris (Bataclan) attacks?’ Now, technically that’s false. They were European citizens. <br><br>But those decrying him as stoking xenophobia to distract from domestic failures use that kind of inaccuracy as evidence. While they studiously ignore the fact that two of the Bataclan attackers did arrive in Europe from IS territory through the refugee route presenting themselves as refugees with false passports therefore allowing them to evade security checks. Others from the same group got stalled in Vienna and have since been charged there with their part in that plot. <br><br>Several other people living in refugee centres, claiming asylum, have been found to be IS operatives. The German train axe attacker was another, an Afghan, and another 16 year old, an Iraqi, was arrested a couple of days ago. Those have all been asylum claimants/migrants. <br><br>So while Orban is technically incorrect, the actual point he’s making – that jihadists have, as predicted, used the mass migration to travel to Europe to carry out terrorist attacks, is correct. That’s not xenophobia, it’s what any sensible jihadist group would do. Political messages that fit on posters are always simplifications. As I see it, central and eastern Europe have simply observed the state of multiculturalism as it exists in western Europe and decided that the benefits are not worth the costs. That’s not xenophobia. <br><br>Mallow.<br><br><a href=#c1638579684560896515 title="comment permalink">10/2/16, 12:09 AM</a><br><br>

Which will be a very sad day indeed."</i><br><br>Firstly I used to have the same world-view on this subject as John Roth, Vaccines are safe and only crazy/ignorant people don't vaccinate.<br>However, as my child was on the way, I did as I tend to in these scenarios, not only listen to everybody, but also asked myself the uncomfortable questions, read up opposing views and - god forbid - end up with my own thoughts on the matter.<br>And I have to say, like many things, once you give this subject a serious look, it's amazing how much 'conventional wisdom' is nothing more than very effective marketing.<br>This lead me to a little crisis of belief. I believe is science, but we're told science says they're safe, when clearly that has not only not been adequately studied, but anyone who tries to report an adverse effect gets shouted down.<br>It took me a while to come to the view that a lot of what we're told is science is not actually science.<br><br>I really appreciate what @Brigyn has said. It furthers flesh to the bones of my belief that what we are told is 'the science' or the 'scientific community' is not actually science itself.<br>I don't blame the scientists, especially as I've noticed in the last few years a growing fight from within science where sets of scientific papers are being analysed and found to be wanting. whether 'ghost papers', summary completely mismatching the findings, or whatever.<br>Also listening to podcasts from editors of major medical journals talking about how half the studies are fraudulent, or the way lobbying government has changed the way big business have changed the rules to suit themselves.<br><br>In today's world (unlike 30+ years ago) big business decides which studies to do, designs the studies, conducts the studies, reports and markets the studies accordingly, of not report at all if found to be inconvenient.<br>While we will get the occasional independent scientists (like Dr Seralini) they don't have the financial or political clout against these behemoths.<br><br>It's my fear that what the 'scientific community' believes as it's marketed, will be shown to be false in a dramatic way. Where what's actually been shown to be false is what big pharma has marketed.<br>I can't think of anything that comes close to vaccines that can strike this blow.<br>With this in mind, it's been fascinating to watch the progression of the CDC Whilst-blowers (Dr William Thompson) allegations.<br><br>But it's not just effective marketing, but also a bullying culture (marketing strategy) which have very effectively kept many people in line. I know a nurse who after her daughter had a bad reaction and stopped vaccinating her children, will be very careful not to have any hint of anti-vax views on her Facebook page for fear of her bosses knowing. Also the doctor she goes to who accepts the reaction will only give her a medical exemption from the one vaccine not the whole lot, because it'll put her career in jeopardy.<br><br>The 'religion' of Scientism or as I like to call it pseudo-scepticism is a part of this bullying culture with it's inbred group-think and is especially strong in Australia<br><br><a href=#c3986425070394225987 title="comment permalink">10/2/16, 4:58 AM</a><br><br>

Managing groups and combinations is what society is all about. I am reminded of Margaret Thatcher's famous quote,"there is no such thing as society... only individual men and women, and there are families" If you buy into that view, what will hold you back from looting the entire world? Nothing, and that was the point and continues to be the point.<br><br>I find it hopeful that our politics, at least in America, is slowly returning to notions of political economy. Broader connections must be made and discussed if any meaningful social policy is to be adopted in the near future. Broader, and honest views must be brought into the public space.

I like to point out by contrast what's implied by the recent habit of renaming the personnel office in a company the Human Resources department. What do you do with a resource? Why, you exploit it! <br><br>Kyle, that's truly funny. I certainly hope it gets plenty of investment from people who deserve to lose every penny! As for the shrinking pie, exactly. <br><br>Justin, not biologically genetic, but culturally genetic -- the habit of taking religion very seriously came here with the religious fanatics who made up so large a fraction of immigrants from Plymouth Rock onward, and it's remained part of our culture ever since. As for restricting the vote to 25% or so, that's been tried -- you might look into who had the right to vote in the US immediately after independence. It didn't work too well. As Churchill pointed out, democracy is the worst political system, except for all the others. <br><br>Pantagruel, exactly -- I'm not disagreeing. That's why it's necessary to challenge the ravings of economists, and point out that interests do not always, or even mostly, equate to dollars and cents. <br><br>Jay, that's certainly my guess. <br><br>Patricia, exactly. I've seen that sort of thing way too often. <br><br>Rebecca, I'm not surprised. Disgusted, but not surprised. <br><br>Patricia, the barbarian conquerors of the Western empire -- Saxon and otherwise -- borrowed the Roman habit of slavery from the societies they conquered, but it largely faded out over the centuries that followed because it makes such poor economic sense. Parceling out real estate to the peasants in exchange for a cut of the harvest and certain services in peace and war -- that is, protofeudalism -- gets you better returns at lower cost, and you end up with a labor force that has a motivation to work other than the lash. In exactly the same way, the household slave gave way to the feudal servant, who was a free person bound by pledges of mutual loyalty, and was much less likely to betray you for a few trinkets or just plain cut your throat in the middle of the night. Historically, slavery is a phenomenon of complex societies and relative prosperity -- for example, it was practiced by those Native American tribes, such as the Northwest Coast nations, who had a great deal of surplus wealth, and not by those who lacked that surplus. As we go through a transition from plenty of surplus wealth to very little, I wouldn't be surprised to see slavery here and there as a transient phenomenon, but over the longer term, some form of feudalism is the normal dark age system.<br><br><a href=#c3788332774070544742 title="comment permalink">10/2/16, 10:57 AM</a><br><br>

The words "liberal" and "conservative" do not mean the same thing in Europe that they mean on this side of the pond.<br><br><a href=#c9199746672312994392 title="comment permalink">10/2/16, 11:16 AM</a><br><br>

Pejorative term "fascism" has been thrown around like some magic formula, which exposes Dr. Evil and his minions of Evil Evilness. I am personally quite shell shocked by how fast political landscape is transforming right now here in Europe. Yet, I found it little bit ironic how fast persons throw word "fascism" at everything challenging their world view. "Fascism" seems to mean for them anything that challenges Unholy Trinity of current liberalism - multiculturalism, feminism and free trade. <br><br>I am not Hungarian, but I know and have seen as random by-passer how suspicion towards EU took root at that country. Hungary was occupied by CCCP for decades after WW2. That occupation was not known for it's light-handedness. Hungarian uprising in -56 and following devastation were hard to handle for a country which produced proud kings like Janos Hunyadi and proud warriors like "fekete sereg", warriors in cruel and long war against ottomans and Islam for Christianity and magyars.<br><br>Hungarians I have met seem to be very sensitive for any signs of oppression and bureaucratic centralism from foreigners. And tower of Babel known as Brussels EU elite are decidedly foreign. EU has inherited baton of oppression from their ideological successors the Soviets with alarming eagerness. Hungarians, like many other East European countries, have raised against this stealing of national sovereignty. And yes, insane ideology of mass immigration is part of this robbery. There is no reason whatever let total strangers to overrun your country, especially if they are your religion's thousands-of-years old enemies. Frontier between Islam and Christianity, especially along Ottoman borderline, is bloody. There is absolutely no reason to help rapefugees invading Christian lands from Middle East and North Africa. No reason at all. Their problems are not ours.<br><br>I have understood that most Hungarians dream not about national socialism; they just want heel of this bureaucratic behemoth lifted from their necks. They have recent experience what it is to live under foreign, leviathan, corrupt machinery. They don't want to re-experience that.<br><br><br>Of course there are exceptions. Hooligan firms of Hungarian football clubs seem to be quite active in far-right scene. In that they follow alarmingly common, pan-European trend. In Euro games those Hungarian ultras whose original fealty lies with clubs like Nyíregyháza Spartacus, Újpest FC and Ferencvárosi TC seem to have strong far-right leanings. As I have stated here before, this underground political awakening and networking by young male warrior societies is politically deeply underestimated phenomenon here in Europe. It seems that this working and lower-middle class phenomenon is so far away from the bubble of affluent class that it's future indications go totally unnoticed. But they are still a minority among Hungarians, while anti-EU and anti-immigration stance is clearly majority position there. Still, even if minority,you should see HOW MANY of them there are. You should see. There are couple of videos to describe the feeling of awe as mask of normalcy drops off, but they are NOTHING compared to real experience. Earth trembles under their feet. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AySWEXSFnGc<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftfFmPtCj9w<br><br><br><br>Same goes with most East European countries I have experienced, like Poland. Of course they feel they are Central Europe and Eastern Europe starts with former Soviet states, but let's not complicate things for American readers. In general, those countries which were occupied after the big one by Soviet Army are very much against current version of European liberalism.<br><br>So, using word "fascism" to describe every anti-free trade and anti-free movement stance is quite stupid and boring. If you people want to truly understand world as it is, open for fracking's sake your eyes and see things as they are.<br><br><a href=#c7586550588280832 title="comment permalink">10/2/16, 11:18 AM</a><br><br>

As I noted to Ozark, a vast amount of what's driving today's antiscience is the blatant corruption of scientific institutions, which strikes at the heart of the cultural legitimacy of science itself. <br><br>K Sc, "the bullying culture" -- that's a very apt term. I think I've mentioned before that I used to hang out on the fringes of the unknown-phenomena scene, and watched what happened whenever anybody reported experiencing something that isn't part of the officially accepted scientific view of reality. It was always the same. A self-described "skeptic" would show up and behave in a bullying, abusive fashion toward the witness and everyone else, and a believer would show up and be friendly, supportive, and thoughtful. Care to guess whose explanation the witness usually ended up accepting? <br><br>The same thing happens even more dramatically where the medical industry is involved. The MDs and their allies are by and large arrogant, dismissive, and uninterested in anything that contradicts their obvious self-interest, while the alternative-medicine people almost always come across as friendly, supportive, and approachable. This is, to my mind, half the reason why alternative health care has become so prevalent in today's America. (The other half is that so many officially accepted health care modalities have ghastly side effects and are fantastically overpriced, while alternative health care is usually affordable and, even when it doesn't help, rarely causes any harm.) All this is helping to drive the crisis of legitimacy I've been talking about. <br><br>NZ, that's too rigid a distinction. Most people are both part of the power structure and subject to it -- that is, they are subject to power exerted by others, but they also can exert power on certain people, and almost inevitably do so. It's the inability or unwillingness to grasp the latter that gets in the way of learning many of the right lessons! <br><br>WB, right now the doublespeak is primarily a matter of using values to avoid talking about interests. That's not always the case, and there are also times in which people have talked about values and meant it. <br><br>234567, I certainly acknowledge that there are still some people in the older end of the age spectrum who are doing as you are, and I honor that.

In this day, it sounds like an oxymoron. Given the historical sketch you present, I can definitely see the arc of values-based liberalism in America. It seems like the liberal elites who ran the movement relished in slaying political dragons: worker’s rights (be they slaves or blue-collar stiffs), women’s rights, black rights, and now, gender defiant rights. One commonality through all of these is the elites proscribing their solution to the masses instead of the masses demanding a particular solution.<br><br>There are a couple things I think exacerbated the fall the values-based liberalism. First, their championship of multi-culturalism as a way of “freeing the oppressed”. One unintended consequence of multi-culturalism is a dispersion or fracturing of common values. How can you get the masses to do something if you no longer have a common set of values to motivate them or justify your actions? Their actions lose their moral imperative and reveal the underlying self-interest. This is where we’re at today - the liberal elite have lost their moral mojo, and we’re left looking at their naked self-interest (a sight I can never unsee!)<br><br>To overcome this they invented political correctness - the moral imperative without the morals. PC actually becomes very convenient to promote just about anything since it isn’t tied to any particular value, just the social censorship associated with being politically incorrect. It’s given the liberal elite at least a little longer on life support.<br><br>The onslaught of multi-culturalism foisted on us by the liberal elite will have several enduring legacies. The one that will have a major effect is the wholesale importation of Islam into western culture. Since current politically correct dogma precludes any real debate of how Islamic and modern western worldviews can integrate without the destruction of either, the actual debate will be held at the fringes by jihadists and nationalistic rednecks. It will not be pretty and it will not resolved in the next generation. Unfortunately, neither the Affluent Establishment Party nor the Deplorable Populist Party have any motivation do solve this since they both benefit from the conflict in the short run. Fortunately, we in the USA will have a bit longer to consider the consequences since Europe has volunteered to be the epicenter of the debate for now.<br><br><a href=#c7452767455808706106 title="comment permalink">10/2/16, 12:02 PM</a><br><br>

This of course is valid observation only among those who have emigrated behind blue-collar jobs. Academics have their own behavior patterns and virtue signalling systems guiding them. So young males of emigrant populations are MORE prone to extreme tribal thinking than those living in their original homeland. And in their fatherlands, blue-collar males are more prone to alienate totally from current status quo than females or white-collars. Same goes with Muslim population. Fracture lines are already visible, only waiting for economic nose dive (driven by resource depletion) into abyss of true break-down. <br><br>Need to belong seems to be more important than need for personal safety. All around Europe young, non-privileged males are ready to take enormous personal risks or die for the feeling of belonging. That is the true bloom of alienation and individualism for those who don't really make it.

Specifically, in North Carolina not too far from Durham, and there is no "one strike and you're out." In fact, they're fighting hard now for the checkbox on job/housing applications that asks about criminal record, to be removed entirely.<br><br>Often, after a criminal kills someone whether by DWI, driveby, shaking his "fiancee's" baby HARD because he's trying to play a video game and it's not his seed anyway, or a gunshot point-blank to the face at a "party", then and ONLY then does it come out that he's got a rap sheet of increasingly violent crimes for which he got probation, if that. In the case of illegal aliens who are caught after they kill someone, it turns out they didn't even show up for their deportation hearings. Letting criminals go unpunished is called "social justice" among those who have lucrative jobs with the Big Victims industry.<br><br>Further, I do not believe that a criminal is just as deserving (a favorite word of the Big Victims leaders who don't pay their own income taxes - hm, seems they stole the commons from the goose and look how successful they are!) of housing or work as someone who managed not to commit crime and/or had backup plans for their hard luck. I prefer to deal with people who are more resourceful and self-sufficient than that, because they're less likely to leave my remains in a shallow grave when Big Victims tells them that I stole their money and land, and anything I have is due not to my skills and hard work, but due to "privilege" and it's noble to "take back what's theirs". Nor do I want to entertain claims of racism or threats of lawsuits, and such "mistake makers" have access to the attorneys on retainer at Big Victims. I don't. <br><br>I didn't read the story about the child with the milk, and do I really need to specify that that's not who I or any other reasonable person refers to when I say "cheats, thieves, frauds and liars"? JMG makes the point repeatedly that just because we choose some elements of a culture, it doesn't follow that we must or do choose all elements. Our laws wouldn't need to be as draconian as in the Middle East. Heck, Welfare to Work in the 90's cut the welfare rolls by 60% between 1994 and 2004. Everyone kept their extremities.<br><br>Sidebar: I just watched a 1961 movie called "After the Fox" and the writer - Neil Simon - was making the same point 55 years ago: Only the little criminals end up in jail.

From the 90s onward, I very much identified w/liberalism and the Democratic party, and at one time, was a member of the DNC and other liberal organizations. I pounded the pavement and phone banked for Democratic candidates, the last being Barack Obama. Yes, I did fall for "Hope and Change", as this was before I'd encountered the ADR and learned how things really work. I was very disillusioned after that election, and swore off politics, and went into an anti-American funk, whereby I discovered Morris Berman's anti-American trilogy, which led me here after I got bored w/his anti-American rantings and wanted to discover more about peak oil, the rise and fall of civilizations. I simply cannot reward the Democrats with my support with I have absolutely no faith in their ability or even willingness to accomplish what they campaign on. Hillary is mouthing the same things she's been mouthing since she came on the national stage over 20 years ago, and I have absolutely no faith that she means any of it, or will accomplish any of her meaningless campaign promises.<br>Right now, I work with the wage class in a bright red state, and I can tell you that they are all over the map with all of their beliefs. To a t, they identify as either "conservative" or are apolitical. Regarding extrajudicial killing of black people, when I bring up JMG's idea of militarization of the police as cannon fodder against an insurgency, many of the "Don't Tread on Me", gun-toting libertarian types are sympathetic and relate their own police experiences. One guy, in politically incorrect fashion, said that once they move beyond rioting and looting into organized violence, it's over. Others are reflexively defensive of the police. I sense an attitude that the status quo is intolerable, and the attitude seems very similar to the one that pervaded Europe in the run up to the First World War, with less of a bloodlust for war. One guy thinks we need a severe Depression as a corrective, others seem to think Hillary would trigger an insurgency/Civil War. Some fear Russia, and respect or admire Vladimir Putin, and think we need that here. One is a big admirer of FDR, and thinks Trump would be like FDR when the next Depression hits. The point is, these people are all over the map with their beliefs, which reinforces what JMG has said about politics undergoing a massive realignment and drastic change.<br>Some people, especially the older, Gen X cohort, still espouse beliefs in the "system"--think they will be able to retire, are saving for retirement. Even some of the younger cohort express belief in the system, one twenty something has faith that education will be his ticket to wealth as a Psychiatrist. (I am hopeful that the student loan/education bubble will burst before he saddles himself with all that debt.) The ones that seem the most sane are the ones who are most Retrotopian in their beliefs and attitudes, and interacting with them is like interacting with someone from the past. These are the sanest of the bunch, and the most promising.<br><br><a href=#c2628782414702967356 title="comment permalink">10/2/16, 1:52 PM</a><br><br>

I'm so glad I now have some framework for understanding current events. I'm replying to your remark on the corrupt medical industry. Being an MD, I am a bit amused by your characterization of arrogant MDs, but it is a laugh-instead- of cry scenario. The medical industry (especially the feds, when formulating laws) now calls doctors and patient "stakeholders", and we are all the little guys in this process. The majority of doctors in the county are depressed (we call it call burnout), and arrogant behavior is mainly passing bullying on down the pecking order. The process being extracting 19% of the GDP, with fond expectations of a bigger cut,as people get less sturdy and more stressed and scared.<br>Doctors have been set up as the figureheads of this cynical and rapacious industry, but we are being stealthily replaced with paraprofessionals who are trained to execute industry protocols, not to treat patients as individuals. At some, perhaps most, hospitals and clinics, you are more likely to have your "doctor" be a PA than an MD. <br>Of course, there are doctors who are selfish jerks, but most are extremely self-sacrificing, if a little naive about the fate of our profession. The health insurance and pharmaceutical industries, on the other hand, are uncompromisingly evil<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c1976388459939564552 title="comment permalink">10/2/16, 7:01 PM</a><br><br>

It's possible it will rise again, if JMG's timetable of religious vs political movements is correct then I'd imagine that could possibly happen sometime after 2060 or so. What's interesting to me is that at least for now, the influence of both Christianity and science are delining in America, whatever fills that void won't be anticipated by those who see the only options as scientific materialism or a return to the values of the prescientific era in the western world.<br><br>@K sc<br>You ever hear of James Lyons-Weiler?

And her entire speech to him when she first meets him is about the way that her earthly beauty, and her death, which should have elevated his eyes towards heaven instead pushed him towards his own damnation. Throughout the poem, the boundaries between divine love and lust are constantly in the balance, and feminine beauty exists on a fulcrum between them. And much of what Dante has on romantic love and sexuality is an exploration of contemporary attitudes towards courtly love, whose fault it is if it crosses a boundary, and just where that line is. Traditionally in courtly literature, the man engaging in the courtly romance was bound by a code, with the woman ever enticing him to cross the line, and many of the great courtly romances are about a man struggling to hold on to his honor and virtue while the woman he is pledged to tries to trick or entice him into violating it, and the two either maintaining the balance or the man falling (and that traditional motif is explored in Inferno), Purgatorio explores Dante’s own relationship to courtly love through Beatrice, and her innocence, her early death, and the unrequited nature of the relationship all serve to allow Dante to transcend the fall. What’s unique about this is that it really does reverse the trend, in that the lusts Dante has burned away in the seventh circle are his own, while Beatrice is idealized to the point of near-divinity, which sets the state for some of the trends you see in renaissance Italian Art and Literature. . One of the more interesting things about Dante is the way that he pushes the envelope on medieval literature and sets the stage for the themes that you see pop up in the Renaissance, between his emphasis on elevating the vernacular in his use of language, his idealization of feminine beauty, his romanticization of the pagan authors, his willingness to criticize and challenge papal authority, the emergence of some early humanistic themes, and some of the echoes of a nascent quasi-universalism you see in his speculations on the nature of Salvation on Canto XIX of Paradiso, reveal Dante as very much a medieval writer pointing towards the beginnings of the Renaissance, to the point that I tend to view him as the first Italian Renaissance figure, especially when you examine his direct influence on Boccaccio a generation later. There’s a lot to Dante, and his writings are pretty impossible to exhaust.<br><br><a href=#c3930203321417433694 title="comment permalink">10/3/16, 9:27 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not saying it is likely (I don't it is), but it is surely a possibility in this climate.

I think there are some exceptions to the rule (e.g. Iranians, perhaps because they tended to be more urban elites or because they really wanted something else, not just more money?). But the Turkish population in Germany is very much like that. Fairly recently young German liberals have learned that they are also widely despised in Turkey (among the liberals there). Though extreme turks are more likely to end up with the grey wolves or salafists I think.<br><br>@Timberwolf <br>When I hear labels such as fascist or (neo)liberal in my personal environment they are rarely used as self identification but mostly assigned to you with a certain agenda in mind for the discussion. So let me reluctantly step up to that label. <br>I think we can agree on the fact that the status quo isn't likely to last and that's a good thing. But if you rush headlong into a revolution and "sweep the ivory tower into the trash heap of history", what then?<br>The French Revolution wasn't exactly over on July 14th, nor on the 27th. I would really like to engage more with people like you or Juhana. But I'll probably have to do that in the flesh unless we manage a more constructive debate here. You need to plan ahead unless you want to replace one ivory tower with a pile of bones (pulled from the same heap). <br>I saw a good bit of hooliganism in Marseille, and while somewhat impressive in this place and age (especially to the watching Africans), you would do well to remember that the couple of thousand people seen in the videos buy you 1-2 hours on The First Day of the Somme. And that is it. So I would strongly urge people to build a desirable and viable post EU model - now. Nationalism without a defensive superstructure* (including immigration) is unlikely to outlast what is probably ahead of us (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpQTni1wF0E). <br>While I don't think the analogy of terrorism with peanuts (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kZsOISarzg - also interesting for a interests vs values exercise) is correct the issue currently ranks far below the negative impact of automobiles on society. I do think that terrorism (really: hostile violence) is an issue that has more in common with Ebola (very loosely though) than with with peanuts. To address this effectively I would address this mostly with birth rates**, narratives, and future perspectives. <br><br>As for Americans moving to Eastern Europe, I do see (hear really) the odd beggar with American accent down here in Marseille already. Of course you get many more tourists but it is enough to challenge the narrative of American exceptionalism a little. <br><br>*Most of my views are fairly well represented in defense-and-freedom.blogspot (with a little more emphasis on the southern arc of instability)<br><br>**Regarding population growth I think the issue has not received the depth of treatment that it merits. Neither here nor in society. I suspect that this is mostly because of the "growth imperative" and because for the most part advice to "reduce" is a little late.

First there is the survival instinct (perhaps not limited to the individual), but once you've covered that it gradually transitions into "survival in style". This transition is not at the same level of effort for everyone. People are more or less capable, and they live in more or less challenging environments* (interestingly the polar ends of the plant, where species apparently go to die, feature relatively liberal attitudes). Perhaps for many of those values there is a hard survival reason behind it?<br>I often hear voices critical of liberal ideas and values, who do not seem to work this through its implications for themselves (and I am sure I am guilty of that myself).<br>This is the case for much of the Brexit vs Ireland/Scotland, (Brexit vs Poles) vs (Poles vs Muslim Immigrants), Hungarian financial compensation/fine re immigrants vs Germany/EU taking in more poor people**.<br>From a German perspective there are a few extra bits to consider: For a good few decades you were a couple of weeks away from living (or rotting) in a (nuclear) battlefield (even if there was very limited escalation). So the option of becoming a refugee (or emigrant) was pretty attractive (and very many went to the USA). The probability of this has diminished - (subjectively) to a large part trough European integration. This is one the one hand the EU, but also things like the German reunification. <br>If Germany had not made the impression that a unified Germany would put values before interests - I don't think French or British skeptics would have sat still and let it happen (an incredibly fragile and sensitive process). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification#Foreign_support_and_opposition<br>Here it becomes more difficult of distinguishing priority of values and interests. <br><br>So if Germany was return to acting on interests (especially short term) in this context the first two figures I would cite are of course the German per capita contribution to the EU budget (~275 EUR), and the receipt of Hungary (&gt;500 EUR per capita). <br>Next, from a German perspective housing refugees in places like Hungary is not only closer to their home geographically, but also culturally and financially. So pretty much Orbans suggestion with North Africa replaced by Hungary. On top of that, abstract fear may be replaced by real life experiences in the host role (more with an eye towards Poland). If that lead to bad situations, it would help German politicians pushing for stricter control, and also bad press with nasty pictures would likely curb the flows of economic migrants (but not of refugees of war or terrorists). Germany could of course put into place an appropriate "golden visa" program to skim the top end.<br><br><a href=#c5295521426261779812 title="comment permalink">10/4/16, 6:29 AM</a><br><br>

Geopolitically the northern European plain will likely keep its role until the sea claims it. I know Hungary also has a pretty eventful past. Is it not on peoples minds that they may fall on harder times again? Or do the not expect mercy from others in such an event? What do people think of the 1951 refugee convention (I think Hungary adopted in 89)?<br><br>@Mallow can you give a number for the fine regarding immigrant/refugee resettlement? How does it compare to the approx 60 billion that German people will have to shell out if there is no resettlement? Unfortunately I couldn't manage to find much hard data in English or German media. <br>What do you think would happen if the German population and Merkel (or her successor) would adopt a stance more along the lines of Erdogan fueling desires of a revival of the Ottoman empire? I have big difficulty imagining this without a lot of strife that makes the worst moments of the EU look like a tea party. <br>From a practical perspective though I don't think the EU can be reformed. Unfortunately I assume significant and necessary change will only happen after short (and hopefully shallow) period of chaos. But that means we need to be able to find some consensus, which is a question of values and compromises.<br>*For example living on little money in southern Europe is vastly more comfortable than doing this in the north. I don't know if suicide rates make for a good proximate measure but comparing the Greek crisis (as bad as it is) is still a long shot from the end of the Soviet Union, or even the beginning of it. It is difficult to put numbers on these things.<br><br>**I am happy to discuss this issue. I don't have a totally fixed opinion myself. For now I think there is an obligation to help legitimate refugees (morally and by international treaties). But it could be done significantly better, particularly with an eye towards local options, incentives (including in host countries), and root causes. There is a lot that can be improved on a technical level as well.<br><br><a href=#c6158503678300698795 title="comment permalink">10/4/16, 6:29 AM</a><br><br>

Jorgensen<br><br>Autism is a grab-bag of conditions, which vary from an almost complete withdrawal from interaction at an early age to Aspergers, which is the traditional socially-inept genius type. Like a lot of “medical” issues, putting a name on a group of disparate and poorly understood syndromes to attract funding has unfortunately led people to think we’re talking about one thing, which it isn’t.<br><br>In any case, everything I’ve ever seen on treatment has focussed on social interaction as the one thing that can help the more severe early-onset form from that grab-bag. This is the first that I’ve heard the education bureaucracy has gotten its claws into the matter with its emphasis on improving test scores to protect the school management’s jobs.<br><br>@Armata<br><br>Yes, I’ve noticed the way the Deutsche Bank issue isn’t being addressed here. The US is proposing a fine that will essentially destroy it for its part in the 2008 debacle. Are you aware that this is the only bank that will deal with Donald Trump’s businesses? The other big commercial banks have blackballed him after the way he’s stiffed them for hundreds of millions in losses. That’s just the way business works.<br><br>That fine will probably be negotiated downwards. In any case, I believe that the German government thinks it has a plan which doesn’t involve the loaded word “bailout.” Merkel has got to be sweating.<br><br>That “overwhelming” vote in Hungary turns out to be invalid because voters stayed home. The ones that did turn out voted against allowing refugees, though.<br><br>By the way, I note that Hungary’s quota for settling refugees is 1,294 (source: Guardian). I presume that’s per year. Hardly the millions that some people seem to be fearing. It’s still a billion-euro fine, but it’s hardly the size of Hungary’s GDP, which was 133.4 billion USD in 2013 (source: Wikipedia via Google).<br><br>@ Chris<br><br>Yes, I noticed that OPEC agreed to cut supply. As far as I can tell, that’s going to have almost no effect, because the people who are going to keep pumping regardless aren’t OPEC members, and OPEC’s dictates in the past have been ignored by almost all OPEC members as well. Saudi Arabia has been the only one that will actually change its output to get a higher price. That worked when Saudi Arabia was the biggest exporter and didn’t have money problems. Neither of those is the case any more.<br><br>@Unknown<br><br>As far as “gender-blind” compensation statistics goes, the majority of the difference is that women are preferentially in lower-paid fields. If you ignore that, yes, the difference is relatively smaller, but it’s not zero. See the comments coming out of Silicon Valley at this time on compensation. Since software development is my field (I’m retired) I keep an ear out for what’s happening, and it’s not pretty.<br><br>@Patricia Matthews<br><br>One often overlooked factor in the slavery debate is that slavery wasn’t all that uncommon in the Northern states, and for exactly the reasons you mention: household and shop help.<br><br>@.<br><br>“Sharia” is simply law that’s based on Koranic principles. The attitude seems to be that the Koran has a number of universal principles that are applicable at all times and places - a sentiment that seems to be shared by Christians with respect to the teachings of Jesus and Paul, and the Jews with respect to the Torah.<br><br>Applying those principles to the particulars of a specific country and culture leads to a lot of variation.<br><br>@JMG<br><br>As far as a minimum payment just for being a citizen or permanent resident is concerned, I think that some of that money is being counted twice. Specifically, one fact that’s often glossed over is that what the Federal government pays for health care is essentially what the typical Western European country pays on a per-person basis. That’s one of the bases for Single Payer. However, a lot of that’s part of Medicaid (a welfare payment) and so it’s got to go into one of two different pockets.<br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c3700095519205184576 title="comment permalink">10/4/16, 11:25 AM</a><br><br>

The feisty colonial heroine attracts the attention of the head of the Cultural Engineering Department of a small but prestigious Earthside university; much discussion of why Cultural Engineering is a Good Thing. Mainly because it's in the Right Hands. <br><br>Long-time s/f readers (others can stop gagging now) will recognize the hand, and the hangups, of the late, memorable John M. Campbell, who could go off on and logically justify as many tangents as any mad scientist (or upset engineer) in the known universe. And had the same ability to be convincing as Robert Heinlein. And Campbell's Astounding was pretty well universally read by those who thought they were Making Our Future. How many absorbed the attitude described above, hook, line, and sinker? Especially reading story after story in which such sanctified meddlers stopped wars, raised native people from barbarism - in one notable case, by making a tribe move far enough out of their territory that they could not farm by their traditional methods, thereby being forced to turn to Scientific Farming. <br><br>BTW, this book, once a favorite because heroines like Lizzie were few and far between, leaves my hands as soon as I can get it out the door.

Kids and teenagers, on all levels of society. In the towns, boys and some girls went into apprenticeships; the other girls went into service. In the countryside, your hired girl was probably your neighbor's daughter, and your farmhand, your neighbor's son; when manors took over from castles, the village youngsters took service in the manor house. <br><br>Castle staff, apparently, was almost all male; the castle was a fighting fortress, and the men-at-arms or war band lived there. And it was the duty of the lord's wife to protect whatever maids they had. (Renaissance, not medieval, but Catherine Howard was a maid-in-waiting in a holding where this was not the case, which was part of why she got into such serious trouble even before Henry took a fancy to her.)<br><br>The pattern of hiring your neighbor's sons and daughters carried over into America in many regions. One thing that destroyed the system was the coming of the factory - the Lowell mill girls could have money in their pockets to call their own for the first time ever.

In regards to regenerative agriculture, absolutely! I've worked on a number of small farms, grown a lot of food via various sustainable and organic methods, and helped raise animals on pasture. I've also thought as much about the food system as I likely have anything else, and done a lot of reading on it. I'll be talking about agriculture on Litterfall, and probably will address it in the Closed System Economics posts. It would make sense for state and federal governments to implement some basic supports for small scale agriculture while reducing and ultimately eliminating the perverse subsidies that encourage large scale industrial agriculture. There's a very clear national interest in having a strong base of competent farmers and a large supply of productive farmland, and there's no reason we can't start filling the agricultural hole we've dug over the past several decades.<br><br><a href=#c351959743009522120 title="comment permalink">10/4/16, 9:14 PM</a><br><br>

My take was more personal, like instead of analysis from the outside, I experience it directly from the inside, like a 13th century monk undergoing a spiritual awakening, there's the difference between looking at things from the outside and from the inside. The old saw goes 'before you judge a man walk a mile in his moccassins'. We have lots of problems nowadays, strife, as people cannot relate to one another. This is perhaps the ultimate liberalism, true understanding. Few people can do this.

I have no idea how that compares to the costs on Germany but such figures are usually impossible to accurately calculate anyway. And that data is always 'politically sensitive' so you can never trust it. <br><br>I don't know what you mean about Germans and Erdogans caliphate dreams. <br><br>By far the most effective and humane way to help as many refugees as possible is to do so in the first safe country they reach. The current migration to Europe in fact has little or nothing to do with Syria. <br><br>Anyone who can: reach Libya, pay a boat owner to take them a few kilometres off shore from Libya where there'll be collected by the European navy ferry services and brought to Italy, destroy their ID papers - can remain in Europe and will be provided with at least basic social welfare. <br><br>The merit or lack thereof of their application for asylum (if they ever make one) is irrelevant. They either disappear then, adopt a new identity or are permitted to remain because deportation is not possible. You can't deport people whose identity you don't know, who receive medical certs from a sympathetic doctor declaring them unfit to travel, whose home country is no longer a functioning state or which refuses to accept them back. Those circumstances cover most migrants arriving in Europe. <br><br>The only reason Europeans aren't up in arms about this is that most have only slightly more knowledge of how the system works than Americans do. <br><br>In fact, anyone from the US who'd like to live in Europe will find that a flight to Libya is a far easier way to do so than jumping through the hoops required to get an actual visa. <br><br>If you're pale-skinned that won't be an issue - European authorities would rather die than suggest that a pale-skinned person might not be from Syria. I'm only half-joking - there are reports that enterprising young adventurers have already spotted the opportunity. <br><br>Mallow<br><br><br><a href=#c3592219109306278277 title="comment permalink">10/5/16, 4:30 AM</a><br><br>

It’s the principle that they won’t allow their non-EU immigration policies to be dictated by a decision that Merkel unilaterally made and then bullied everyone else into signing up to. <br><br>The low turnout is partly because all opposition parties called for a boycott. But much of it was complacency. Everyone knows that the redistribution plan is dead in the water. The migrants want Germany or Sweden and those few relocated so far have promptly turned around and gone back. Hungarians also know that Orban won’t allow it under any circumstances anyway so they didn’t feel the need to vote. <br><br>72% of Hungarians have a negative view of Muslims in their country. That’s the reality and that’s why it’s safe to assume that most are with Orban on this policy – whatever their other political views. <br><br>http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/07/11/europeans-fear-wave-of-refugees-will-mean-more-terrorism-fewer-jobs/<br><br>On sharia: It’s nowhere near as varied as many of us non-muslims and women might like it to be. <br><br>In a Pew forum survey of muslims in 20 countries who support making sharia the law of the land (not all muslims do): <br><br>28% – 88% support corporal punishments as part of sharia – that means whipping and cutting off the hands of thieves. <br><br>21% to 89% support stoning for adultery as part of sharia (adultery is often defined as all extra-marital sex – that’s why Malaysia whips those accused of such relationships). <br><br>4% to 86% support the death penalty for leaving Islam. <br><br>Out of 23 countries, support for equal inheritance rights for daughters and sons varies from 15% to 88% (unequal inheritance rights are a part of sharia) <br><br>Even the bottom end of those ranges are extremely problematic for anyone who disagrees with them so the variation is not all that relevant. And the lower percentages are generally from places like Bosnia and former Soviet satellites in south Asia. They represent quite small population numbers overall. <br><br>Such views may bear comparison to the views of some fundamentalist Christians in the US but for western Europeans they’re completely out of line. <br><br>The European Court of Human Rights in Refah Partisi was able to get past the cultural variations to conclude that sharia, itself, has a real content, and that that content is incompatible with the Convention on Human Rights.<br> <br>http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Annual_report_2003_ENG.pdf <br>http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/ <br><br><br> <br><br><br><a href=#c4709358674382845953 title="comment permalink">10/5/16, 4:58 AM</a><br><br>
