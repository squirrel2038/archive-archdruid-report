<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the twenty-fifth and last installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator spends his last few hours in the Lakeland Republic, finds an answer to a question that has been bothering him, and boards the train back to Pittsburgh and the unknowns that wait there...</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There wasn’t much more to be said after that, and so we all mouthed the usual things and I headed back to my hotel. The rain had settled in good and hard by then, so I didn’t dawdle. Back in the room, I got my coat and hat hung up to dry a little, and then turned the radio on to the jazz station, settled into the chair, and read the morning news. I had one more appointment at noon, and a train to catch at 2:26 that afternoon, and not a thing to do until then; I knew that I was going to be up to my eyeballs in meetings, briefings, and two weeks of unanswered textmails the minute I got back home; and just at the moment, the thought of taking some time at the Lakeland Republic’s less frantic pace and trying to make a little more sense of the world had a definite appeal. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d already read the headlines, so there weren’t too many surprises in store, though a United Nations panel had issued another warning about the zinc shortage, and meteorologists were predicting that the monsoons would fail in south Asia for the third year in a row. Two more satellites had been taken out by debris; a second jokulhlaup down in Antarctica had chucked another thousand square miles or so of ice sheet into the Indian Ocean; stock markets everywhere outside the Lakeland Republic had had another really bad day; the ceasefire negotiations in the California civil war had gotten off to a rocky start, and more details had gotten through about the opening rounds of the Texas-Confederate war—both sides’ offshore oil fields had taken even more of a hit than the original reports suggested. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was only about half of the first section, though, and it was the other half, and the rest of the paper, that held my attention. That was the stuff that wasn’t about shortages and crises. It was about what people do when they’re not being held hostage by shortages and crises. There were birth announcements, marriage announcements, obituaries; a new streetcar line out to one of Toledo’s eastern neighborhoods was in the planning stages, with public meetings scheduled to sort out the route over the winter and tracklaying planned to start next May; a high school student was honored for volunteering more than a thousand hours reading the daily newspaper over one of the Toledo radio stations, for blind people and shut-ins; the big local shipyard had just bought another piece of property and would be hiring another three hundred people to meet the demand for shipping. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then there were the help-wanted ads, pages and pages of them, looking for shipwrights, file clerks, millworkers, secretaries, mechanics, all the jobs that got automated or offshored out of existence back home and were keeping people busy and self-supporting here. There were two full pages of apprenticeship ads—if I’d wanted to become a carpenter, a pharmacist, a plumber, a doctor, an electrician, a millwright, a teacher, or a lawyer, just for starters, I would have had no trouble in the world figuring out where to apply. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All the while, though, the thoughts that had circled through my head on the trip back from Janice Mikkelson’s mansion hung in the air around me, and not even Louis Armstrong’s trumpet solos on the radio could chase them away. People knew long before I was born that the things we were doing were going to end really, really badly, and yet everyone just kept on marching ahead, making the same dumb decisions over and over again, convinced that if they just did the same thing one more time it would undo the bad results they’d gotten every other time they’d done it. If you discover that you’re in a hole, the saying is, the first thing to do is stop digging—but that’s exactly what nobody was willing to do, because they’d convinced themselves that digging the hole deeper was the only way to get out of it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was the thing that twisted like a knife. The climate mess that was dumping icebergs off Antarctica and had already turned half of Manhattan into a rusting ruin that flooded deeper with every high tide, the Kessler syndrome that was busy putting an end to the space age, the cascading shortages that were taking a bigger bite out of the world’s economies every single year: none of those had happened by accident. They weren’t the result of fate, or destiny, or any of that claptrap. We’d <i>progressed</i> straight into each of them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of course progress also churned out plenty of good things back in the day—that’s why the jobs in the help-wanted ads weren’t limited to “peasant.” Somehow, though, most people outside the Lakeland Republic never got around to noticing when the costs of progress started to outweigh the benefits. Everybody kept talking about how progress was supposed to make people’s lives easier and better even when it started making people’s lives harder and worse, and when some part of that became too hard to ignore, everybody insisted that the only option was to go in for yet another round of progress. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And somehow, I thought, I’m going to have to explain all this to the people back home. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So I was in a pretty sour mood, all things considered, by the time the radio stopped playing jazz and the eleven o’clock news came on instead. I turned it off, got my coat and hat back on, grabbed my suitcase, and headed down to the lobby to check out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>After two weeks in the Lakeland Republic, I wasn’t too surprised when the clerk wrote something with a pen in a notebook full of sheets of paper, took my key, and wished me a good trip home in less time than it would have taken a hotel clerk elsewhere to get the computer to do whatever it is hotel computers do. Then I was out on the sidewalk under the canopy in front of the hotel door. The rain was still pelting down, but I flagged down a cab to go the train station. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Not quite half an hour later I got out in front of the station, paid my fare, got my suitcase, and headed in. The big vaulted space with benches on one side and ticket counters on the other was pretty well stocked with people going about their lives. I headed over to a window to one side of the ticket counters, stashed my suitcase with the clerk there—I’d asked Melanie about that and so knew what to do—and then headed for one of the restaurants on the side closest to the street. The place was starting to fill up with the lunch trade, but a glance back at the big clock on the wall above the platform doors showed me that I was still early. I went in anyway, asked the greeter for a table for two, got seated at a little table over by the windows looking at the street, shed my coat and hat, and ordered a chicory coffee to kill the time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m not sure how much time passed, and how many cabs stopped to disgorge their passengers on the curb out front, before one of them finally let out the person I was waiting for. It was Melanie, of course, bundled up in a raincoat and broad-brimmed hat the way she’d been when we’d first met. She got most of the way to the station entrance before she spotted me there in the window; she waved, so did I, and then she hurried inside out of the rain and came around to the restaurant entrance. A few moments later she was settling into the chair across the table from me. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The waitress came over pretty much the moment Melanie sat down, so we got menus and talked about little things that don’t matter for a bit, until the waitress came back and took the menus and our order. I waited until she was gone, and then said, “I admit I’m really curious about Meeker’s reaction.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I bet,” she said, with a sly smile. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was what I expected her to say, and she knew that I expected it, so I smiled too. Everybody in my line of work makes jokes about horizontal diplomacy; of course it’s discouraged, and of course it happens, and if you’re in politics and get into that kind of situation you know exactly where the lines are, and edge up to them now and then just to firm up the boundaries. When you get a relationship between two people in politics, you make extra sure that both know where the boundaries are so they don’t get in the way of the relationship, and one of the things that I liked about Melanie was that she was as professional about it all as I was. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ll say this much,” she said after a moment. “You took him by surprise, which isn’t easy to do—but it was a pleasant surprise. If there’s any help you need from our side to help push things along, let us know and we’ll see what we can do.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Please thank him for me,” I said. “I don’t have much more of a clue about how to push this thing than I did this morning, though.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She nodded. “May I offer a suggestion?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Of course.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Focus on cutting subsidies. It costs a lot to prop up the illusion of progress, and if you actually make every technology cover all its own costs, things sort themselves out really quickly.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Granted,” I said, “but you know as well as I do that the tech sector and some of the other resource hogs are going to scream the moment anybody tries to push them away from the feed trough.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“True. The one advantage of this wretched war is that Ellen Montrose may have a little less trouble making that happen.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded, conceding. “The war and the economy,” I said. “Our stock market had another ghastly day yesterday, and I’m pretty sure the impact of losing the Gulf oil fields hasn’t really hit yet.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The waitress came back with lunch, made a little conversation, and headed off to the next table. “One thing that might help,” I said then, “is if more people from our side of the border come here and see what you’ve done on this side. I know I was completely clueless about what was going on here, even after reading a pretty fair stack of briefing documents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’d like to see more people see for themselves, if that can be done without putting too much of a burden on you.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We can handle it,” said Melanie. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I also meant you personally,” I said with a smile. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I survived the Honorable Velma Streiber,” she said, with a smile of her own. “After that I think I can handle just about anything.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I laughed, and so did she. We busied ourselves with our respective plates for a few minutes.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I wonder,” she said then. “If you really want people from your side of the border to see what we’re doing on ours, President Montrose might want to make an official visit. We’d be happy to host something like that.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I considered her. “That’s a real possibility.” Then: “Have you had any other heads of state visit?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“A few.” She gestured with her fork, dismissing the idea. “Once diplomatic relations got reestablished after the Treaty of Richmond, we let it be known that we’d be happy to welcome any head of state that wanted to pay a visit, and reciprocate. The President of Chicago’s been here, of course—show me a country in North America he hasn’t visited—and we’ve exchanged state visits with Quebec and Missouri, but everyone else has backed away uneasily from the suggestion.” The fork jabbed down into her chef’s salad. “We’re still North America’s pariah nation, you know.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Even though your way of doing things works,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No.” She glanced up at me. “Because our way of doing things works.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We ate in silence for another few minutes. Of course her words made me think yet again of the same frustrating question I’d been brooding over earlier. It must have showed in my face, because she said, <br>
“Penny for your thoughts.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Just wondering why it is that everyone else keeps making the same mistakes over and over again, trying to fix their problems by doing more of what made the problem in the first place.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Progress?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yes.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I have a suggestion.” When I gestured for her to go on: “I think it’s because all your talented people get put to work building new gadgets, instead of coming up with solutions for the problems that gadgets can’t fix. That means you have too many gadgets and a serious shortage of solutions.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I stared at her for a moment. “And since your talented people aren’t working on gadgets—” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We’ve found some solutions. Yes.” Then:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“There was nothing wrong with seeing how far progress could go and still get useful results. The problem was simply that people forgot to stop once they passed that point. We’ve got all the gadgets we need; you’ve got more than you need—and maybe it’s time to stop putting all our talents and our efforts into more gadgets and get to work on some of the other things that go into being human.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded after another, longer moment, but I knew already that I had my answer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We talked about other things after that, mostly personal; I promised to write—the Atlantic Republic still has a postal system, though it’s nothing like as good as the one the Lakeland Republic has—and so did she; I paid the bill, we kissed, and then she went back to the Capitol and I got my suitcase from the baggage room and headed for the doors to the platforms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Ladies and gentlemen, Train Twenty-two to Pittsburgh via Sandusky, Canton, and Steubenville,” someone called out. “Now boarding at Platform Six. Train Twenty-two.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I showed my ticket, and a couple of minutes later I was on Platform Six. A conductor took another look at my ticket and sent me three cars up, to a car that was going all the way to the end of the line. I climbed aboard, got my suitcase stowed, and settled into a window seat on the right hand side. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What was going to happen when I got back home, I knew, was a complete crapshoot. Among Ellen’s top advisers, I’d been the most outspoken critic of her planned reworking of government policies, and so it was pretty much a given that once I threw my support to the plan, it would go ahead. Just how far the legislature would be willing to cut government subsidies for technology and stop penalizing employers for hiring workers was another question, and just how much of the broader Lakeland Republic program would be adopted was an even bigger one. The more clear it became that what they were doing worked, and what we were doing didn’t, the easier it would be to push that ahead, but there would be plenty of resistance among those who still thought that it made some kind of sense to keep doing the same thing while expecting different results. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Maybe I could make it work, and maybe I couldn’t. Maybe my term as ambassador to the Lakeland Republic would be successful, and maybe I’d flop. Maybe the other North American nations could get Texas and the Confederacy to agree to a ceasefire before they ran both nations into the ground, and maybe we’d all end up with failed states on our southern borders and a world-class refugee problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For that matter, though I had high hopes for the relationship Melanie and I had gotten going, there was no way to know in advance if that would work out in the long run or turn out to be a flash in the pan. The future hides in a cloud, and you just don’t know what’s going to pop out of it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The conductor came through, calling out his “All aboard!” as a last handful of passengers got on. Doors clattered shut. No, I thought, there’s no way to tell in advance what’s behind the cloud that hides the future, but maybe—just maybe—I can make a difference. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The car jolted once, and then began to move. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

Maybe the other North American nations could get Texas and the Confederacy to agree to a ceasefire before they ran both nations into the ground, and maybe we’d all end up with failed states on our southern borders and a world-class refugee problem. For that matter, though I had high hopes for the relationship Melanie and I had gotten going, there was no way to know in advance if that would work out in the long run or turn out to be a flash in the pan.</i> <br><br>Well, one does value this: it leaves open all the questions that ought to be left open, including the question whether Carr and Melanie will suffer consequences for their various indiscretions. I had been worrying all week on how to end the narrative in some non-facile, non-vulgar way, and yet had not thought of leaving questions open. <br><br>From this we learn a lesson regarding narrative technique. <br><br>It is perhaps unlike classical Greek drama, as far as my dim recollections from some 1970s classics-in-translation exposure goes: on the JMG model we take care NOT to sort everything out into tidy categories, with tidy anastrophe and tidy catastrophe, and with the chorus tidily wailing "O poli, poli" at the tidy if unpleasant instant of nemesis. <br><br><br>Rather cheerfully, <br><br><br>Tom <br><br>PS: I add in amplification (some readers may find a clarification helpful) that on the Greek model of storytelling, first you have subtle moral failings generating a mess, in the so-called "anastrophe", with the Euripidean chorus sort of dancing "Ka-choonk-ka-choonk-ka-choonk-ka-choonk-ka-CHONK." Then a bleeding corpse, I think normally of some high political authority such as King Oedipus or King Agamemnon, gets rolled out on a trolley or gurney. The chorus at this point throw up their hands, wailing "O poli, poli", i.e. "O City! City!" - therein starting a "catastrophe". In the "catastrophe", the chorus as I imagine it now dances away from the puddle of gore around the trolley or gurney, in a sort of "Ka thonk ka thonk ka thonk ka thonk ka THONK," all its questions answered. <br><br>"Ana" is of course "up to", and "kata" is "down from" (and "strophe" is probably, a little boringly, the same as "strophe" in ordinary Anglosaxonia, i.e., "verse in poetry"). <br><br>I additionally gather that Aristotle had a theory about all this - you are supposed to have the bracing experience of "katharsis" upon witnessing the "kata" part, a bit like eating lots and lots of prunes. <br><br>Anyway, now I see from this literary production a different way of telling stories. This is fun. <br><br><br><a href=toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a><br><br><a href=retrotopia-cloud-that-hides-future.html#c2072436483488982717 title="comment permalink">9/14/16, 7:10 PM</a><br><br>

From there it is not a stretch to conspicuous consumption, more for the sake of more, getting as much for me as possible and screw the rest of you. So, along comes a predicament that says 'We are all in this together' and bingo, the failure of the commons due to 40 years of indoctrination. <br><br>Not to say the that JMG's comments are incorrect, but it is a heavy lift to flip consumer culture on it's back and get people whose whole existence has been about sucking up as many resources as possible, being comfortable, and entertained to voluntarily save a planet for a bunch of people they really don't care about. <br><br>If you have $450 for cheap seat to see a Vikings game (really, a Vikings game) in their new $1,000,000,000 stadium, do you suppose they care at all about the size of their carbon footprint ?

Thank you for this last bit of reflection and meditation--I think it makes for a much better finish to the story than last week's plot resolutions in the way it works to bring us back to the core ideas and commentary on our current ways of living.<br><br>As someone who discovered the joy of physical labor through a multi-year foray into farming, I particularly enjoyed the paragraph in which Carr is reading the help wanted ads and sees the many apprenticeships available to those looking to learn a useful craft. I admit it made me ache a little. I would love little more than to have those sort of opportunities available to me and others today. I can't help but think of how many people who I've met farming who really loved it--and how they had to work for little or no money to do it, with very little prospect to start their own small, diversified farm unless they had a significant source of funds available some other way. I imagine in the Lakeland Republic, it's fairly easy to spend a few years apprenticing on small farms and then lease or purchase land on your own at a reasonable price that provides for payments that one can pay through farming alone.<br><br>We don't have to keep choosing to organize our society in these failing ways. I love the way that theme kept coming through in <i>Retrotopia</i>. I find it inspiring and am looking to explore the idea a fair amount over the next few months on my blog. I hope you'll be doing more of that here, too. It sounds like you may have some posts up your sleeve.<br><br>Anyway, thank you one last time for this story, and especially for this really wonderful ending.

Zinc. Glad to be of service. :-)!<br><br>I feel that you were writing about yourself in there too? That was a nice touch.<br><br>I finished Innsmouth this morning and rather enjoyed it. I feel that Shelby received quite the surprise at the unexpected turn of events at the end, although I have no idea what actually happened in that scene, apart from the fact that it can't have been good for her continuing health and if I may be cheeky enough to suggest - neither would it have been good for her continuing rationality! ;-)!<br><br>The rain is continuing here today and the weather has been rather feral over the past week. Looking out the window into the valley below there are huge pools of water in paddocks and the local river has clearly flooded. Fortunately, there hasn't been any major damage, the bridge deck is still higher than the floodwater and livestock appears to have been moved to higher ground well in advance. I have noticed that a couple of unexpected springs are producing crystal clear water in odd spots about the farm and I have taken note of those spots. One of the unexpected springs flooded my firewood storage, so it was a prudent investment of my time to build and fill a second firewood shed. I’m slowing down on the consumption of firewood as things warm up anyway.<br><br>The other interesting thing is that once I completed your book - you can tell that it is a slack day for me today - that I began reading Michael Lewis's older book: Liar's poker. Michael also wrote The Big Short. The book Liar's Poker is set in the early 1980's when he began as a graduate trainee in Salomon Brothers bond trading business on Wall St. The story is based as far as I am aware on his experience and actual people and events. A fascinating read, but what actually stands out to me is that the deficit and monetary expansionary policies of that time - and ever since, by the way - fuelled some rather unusual behaviour and market instruments. One of the things that I personally find interesting is that the characters in the story - bar a few notable exceptions - seem to not be able to understand the macro implications of those policies. There were one or two notable naysayers in the story, but really they appear to be background characters. The macro viewpoint just seems to be completely lost on the characters and they appear to believe that the windfalls are their due. Dunno, but it is weird and I'm sure there is more to it...<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cloud-that-hides-future.html#c3272535996004301449 title="comment permalink">9/14/16, 9:36 PM</a><br><br>

The open ending was a realistic touch and I think a good way to get the reader to use their imagination. I do hope dear Carr doesn't find himself a lonely Cassandra when he gets back to the Atlantic Republic--at least he will have Montrose on his side. Back here in 2016, the doubling-down on stupidity and cupidity in the name of "progress" (with a hefty dose of reactionary aggression) is abundant everywhere I look. It's pretty depressing.

Instead I will be applying my energy where it can actually do some good, on the local and person-to-person level (including non-human persons). I'm not quite sure how that will manifest in terms of specific actions, but I'm pretty sure it's the only way to stay sane. And also more effective than voting for someone else to be the change I want to see in the world.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cloud-that-hides-future.html#c8174432217716597790 title="comment permalink">9/14/16, 10:12 PM</a><br><br>

I suspect that in the long run it'll have roughly the same sort of run as the hula hoop and goldfish swallowing, if on a longer time line, and people afterward will wonder what they were thinking. As for installments twice a week, er, I also have to earn a living, you know! <br><br>Dylan, I've already got the contract signed and the publisher is working on cover art.

It may be a bit before I do another round of Archdruid Report fiction, but we'll see. <br><br>Thijs, thank you -- I'd missed the anniversary! <br><br>Mister R., a lot depends on the vagaries of inspiration, but I plan on discussing utopian narratives next week, doing a bit of a Retrotopian retrospective, and talking about a certain pervasive flaw in certain earlier examples; and then the discussion of politics and activism needs to continue, with various nods in other directions. We'll see. <br><br>Joel, thank you. One of the things I hope to do with this narrative is to point out, to as many people as possible, that we don't have to settle for a choice between the miserably unsatisfactory situation we're in now and something even worse, which is what current politics offers us. There are other options, and envisioning them is the first step toward creating them. <br><br>Bill, ah, yes, editors. Don't get me started. <br><br>Genevieve, thank you! Of course it's deeper than that, but if you start by forcing a level playing field, it becomes much harder to insist that a money- and resource-wasting technology is "more efficient" et al. <br><br>Hacker, thank you. <br><br>Cherokee, glad you enjoyed <i>Innsmouth</i>. I don't actually know what happened to Shelby either -- you'd probably have to take it up with Yog-Sothoth himself, which could very well end with you either babbling random fragments of incantations in the Aklo language for the rest of eternity, or suddenly finding yourself on the world of Vhoorl in the twenty-third nebula. As for zinc, many thanks -- I needed one more shortage to add to the list, and that did very nicely. <br><br>Bill, nope -- though I'll put that on the get-to list once I finish the current series of Lovecraftian epic fantasy novels.

Do the media there portray it as some bizarre and reclusive, North Korea-type place? Are there small subcultures in the Atlantic Republic who idolize Lakeland as traditional or eco-friendly, the way some factions in the USA might idolize Native Americans, or Scandanavian-style government, or the Amish, without knowing much about it? <br><br>Do even the Lakeland supporters have a misguided and rose-coloured idea about what Lakeland is like? Do they form online "rallies" to support Lakeland, without changing anything tangible in their lives? I can think of many contemporary equivalents. <br><br>I'd also like to hear something about what it's like for our protagonist as he finds himself no longer being tracked in life; that is, that the piece of paper at the hotel was the only thing saying he was there, and can only be "accessed" from that spot. No one can hack into anything in Lakeland, no NSA can track people's movements or predict their next move.

In my case that taking on of an allotment at the beginning of the year - for those who are non-UK based we have a delightfully antiquated law that requires local councils to set aside land for people to grow vegetables on if they want. It has been a year with a lot of hard work and learning - 5 courgette/zucchini plants are too many for a small family, 4 bean plants are too few :). <br>It all culminated last weekend with my taking my young son for a walk in the woods doing something that I hadn't done since I was a teenager, picking wild blackberries. Of course, as any experienced blackberry picker knows, the best berries are away from the path where few people go. Still stout boots, thick jeans and a willingness to dare brambles and rampant spiders (lots of those this time of year) will see you well rewarded. That walk with my son got me thinking of your many posts and how somebody with a little preparation and the willingness to move off the path more commonly travelled can thrive among the thorns of the coming decline. So thank you for starting us on the journey away from the path and out among the berries and spiders :)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cloud-that-hides-future.html#c1826891185808786946 title="comment permalink">9/15/16, 8:27 AM</a><br><br>

The Comcast dude was flabbergasted that we didn't want Cable TV (their big profit center) and just Phone and Internet. <br><br>But yeah, I do have a drafting table down in the basement, and we're hoarding books.

Both are excellent examples of technologies where the designers were so busy making them cutting-edge they forgot to make them work.</i><br><br>The F-35 is an epic boondoggle, and a fiscal catastrophe worse that it's fitness as an aircraft. Just the endless list of problems and complexities, while Russia and China get no-nonsense, and lethal modern fighters in the air. And apparently you could down an F-35 with a well tossed ROCK.<br> <br><br><i>Patricia, the surprise was last week. This is simply the denouement. No, nobody in 2065 thinks that climate change is bogus; the party line at that point is "Yes, but we have to balance the effects of climate change against the benefits of fossil fuel use for the economy," blah blah blah.</i><br><br>Sometimes it seems to me that more than half the people around me - including nominally intelligent folk - seem to have utterly skipped Middle School Earth Science on the subject of Climate Change. Tho' many have been conditioned to be skeptical, as in this Nation, our corporate media covers Climate Change as a <i>political</i> issue instead of a <i>scientific</i> or Public Safety one. So the "liberal hoax" narrative gains traction. Not to mention the hubris of the scientific community has undermined the public's faith in scientists, along with their ill-use by corporations.<br><br>What I fully expect, even as the effects of Climate Change are more than apparent, is that due to civilizations hunger for energy, and the near-impossibility of replacing many modes of transportation and classes of products without petroleum - despite expectation of high tech solutions. I don't see the industrial scale needed - or the economy - in anything yet announced, despite the associated hype. <br><br>For example, the reverse osmosis process to desalinate seawater certainly WORKS. But it is tremendously costly, both energy and resource intensive. Other advanced tech to solve our problems has similar issues, you've gone on about the subsidy issues of Green energy other than hydroelectric.<br><br>So my expectation in the face of this, is that despite pressures, we will still scrabble after every drop of oil, every crumb of coal, every wisp of gas, till we CAN'T any more. Costs suggest that in the face of a conflict like Texas vs the Confederacy, legacy oil rigs won't be replaced. But the pressure for energy will probably inevitably, if not lead to more wars, economic dislocation, and stress fractures of all kinds - will certainly see the utter dismantling of nearly every environmental protection currently in place and the plundering of public lands, national parks and monuments as the squeeze for accessible resources grows acute. Our current political and corporate leadership will undoubtedly place their own continuance and comfort before future generation's prosperity.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cloud-that-hides-future.html#c3549667047170856153 title="comment permalink">9/15/16, 4:23 PM</a><br><br>

Not only is it a great story (which, as we know, keeps the people reading along, allowing all the good, subversive stuff to soak into their brains) but it shows those people not in "the choir" *what* could be done, *how* it could be done, *why* it should be done, and what is likely to happen if it is not done.<br><br>Regarding Melanie and Peters "illicit" romance, I don't think the explanation/justification in this last episode is needed. They're simply doing what humans do, rational thought doesn't really play a part. And sometimes, the more rules you break, the better the sex is. Oh, and the steaminess will help prevent those that you most want to reach from throwing the book out the window. Perhaps just a brief, giddy, private conversation shared between the two of them: "do you know what would happen to us if they found out what we just did?!"<br><br>Anyway, great work, I will definitely buy this one...and if anyone ever wonders out loud why on Earth I would ever live my life the way that I do, I will suggest they read Retrotopia, and it may just sink in.<br><br>Cheers from Cascadia<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cloud-that-hides-future.html#c9093460878126679185 title="comment permalink">9/15/16, 5:09 PM</a><br><br>

I'll be spending the next week in final edits, and then the manuscript will be off to the publisher -- I'll be sure to make an announcement here when it's ready for ordering. Many thanks, again, for all your enthusiasm and interest in this project! <br><br>Nancy, the one advantage our side has against the marketers is that products are boring, and a world that works isn't. <br><br>Brian, those are in the to-consider list. <br><br>Shane, if they can back away from the war with Texas, I think it's quite possible. <br><br>David, I know. US influence in the world is slipping very fast. I'm pretty sure the only people who don't realize that live inside the DC Beltway. <br><br>Kim, to my mind one of the things that's kept the green movement spinning its wheels for thirty years is its failure to come up with anything to offer besides a continuation of the status quo with different electricity sources. It's not just that "save the world so I can keep my privileged lifestyle!" isn't that effective of a rallying cry; it's that for the vast majority of people, life in today's America sucks. There's no gentler way to say it; everyone outside the circles of the affluent knows it; and so campaigning to keep things the way they are does not attract a following. I'm quite convinced that the reason so many people want to believe in imminent apocalypse is that they think that mass death and devastation would be less wretched than day after day in the mess we've made of things!<br><br>.Mallow, I'll put housing on the list; a heavy tax on speculative income would help, but I'll see what else I come up with. As for dialectic, hmm! Hard question. Ordinary informal logic is a good start, and there are plenty of good books on that. <br><br>M, Toomas passed on a suggestion from a blind correspondent of his that I put in something that shows that Retrotopia addresses the needs of the vision-impaired as it does those of the mobility-impaired, so I put that in where the opportunity presented itself. Glad you liked it! <br><br>.Mallow, confront it head on. That's what I'm trying to do here -- charge straight at the insistence that there's something wrong with "going back," by confronting the notion that "the past" (like "the present") is a single thing that you have to take or leave, rather than a resource from which useful things can be extracted. I plan on having much more fun with that as things proceed. <br><br>Unknown Sophia, delighted to hear it!

Hopefully people catch the meta-reference of using a utopian novel, a popular 19th century literary form, to describe the benefits of reversing some of the changes since the 19th century. Any utopian novels that you found to influence your work?<br><br>Fitting for the literary form, it is too clean. I suspect cultures and economies will actually evolve to have little resemblance of any specific earlier era. In an energy constrained future, solar panels and robotic surgery will coexist with trolly lines and horse drawn taxis. This was hinted at in the trip to the countryside, but the reality will be much more complicated, with a lot of modern technology evolving toward robustness that creates systems that are simpler but would be unrecognizable in the 19th or 20th centuries. <br><br>But the main story to me is the future of the cult of progress. The movies imagine all kinds of societal disasters, often techno dystopias, but they can not imagine that we will continue to pursue progress while it makes our lives steadily worse. I read Archdruid Report because it reliably gives that kind of new angle on things. The penchant for self-deception is very strong in humans, and I find it quite believable that people will continue to demand allegiance to this cult long after its returns have become negative. How much is the dream of a better life a modern cult, and how much is it inextricable from being human? There is a certain hope that is necessary for all humans. But its object will be much less on scientific innovations than on the possibility of better social and psychological ideas for managing the complexity of human society.<br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-cloud-that-hides-future.html#c923900275076155851 title="comment permalink">9/15/16, 6:40 PM</a><br><br>

I understand the momentum, the psychology, and sociological reasons behind what we are witnessing and our seeming inability to collectively alter our trajectory, but that comprehension doesn't make it any easier to swallow.

I think that's probably one of the major differences between Norway and the US: around here, campaigning to keep things just the way they are attracts quite a following every election, with both the Labor Party in particular but also the center-right mostly fighting the War Against Change (to borrow another fine term from your writings) with everything they've got. <br><br>We love to tell ourselves we're "the best country in the world to live in", and while there's obviously exceptions, my feeling is that people feel they have much more to lose than to gain from any substantive change to the status quo.

Is basic polite humility in social exchanges just another thing the Lakelanders have decided to do away with? Or is this a way of showing that they have undergone great hardship and adversity and are just very pleased to have come out the other side intact, stable and sustainable? Maybe it's just an American thing. As a Canadian, I've been conditioned to a greater degree of polite modesty.

For Western Europe, the most logical choice is Russia, and we're already seeing Turkey and other nations conciliating Russia. My guess is that the various right-wing movements will conciliate and cozy up to Russia to maintain quality of life.<br>I'm more familiar w/Canada, which sounds very much like Norway in maintaining a much higher standard of living than the US, and politically favoring the status quo. They seem to be conciliating the Chinese, time will tell if they make overtures to the Indians as well, which is my preference--I have a much more favorable opinion of India and their politics than the Chinese. They may conciliate the Russians, b/c of the Arctic, although I don't think Canada has as many ties w/Russia as India or China.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cloud-that-hides-future.html#c4248711160174878101 title="comment permalink">9/17/16, 6:45 AM</a><br><br>

It must be personal prejudice but when I picture the story scenes in my mind, I see the people dressed in a 1930s style clothing. Must be all those old movies that I saw growing up. I understand that one of the points of the narrative was about how progress is not always really progress but a thought occurred to me.<br> When we talk about progress it is always along material lines with technology being a special subset of this. What if instead that we had a society that was still obsessed with progress but along emotional and spiritual lines instead? People forget that the way people are today with its I-got-mine-stuff-the next-generation may be common now but that this was not always so. Not by a long shot. Just developing those two aspects of human life would help us decide on how we should go about material and technological progress. Something to ponder.<br> I was also thinking about JMG's idea how technology gets developed to the point of being far less efficient than its predecessors when I came across the following story but beware!

Ironically, all this combined with our rugged terrain and lack of debt would probably make Norway an ideal candidate for a European Lakeland Republic (well, Kingdom) if the political will was there to try. <br><br>I tend to view the post-war Nordic model/social democratic experiment as a noble idea, and worth the try as one of the better ways to manage a society under abundance industrialism. It's certainly contributed to our higher levels of social capital and much less flagrant inequality than, say, the US or the UK, even if consumerism has taken its toll since the 70s. Still, the Nordic model and its lavish welfare state ultimately depends on Progress and continual growth, at least in the way it's current understood and promoted here. <br><br>As for cozying up to Russia...maybe things will change if/when we're up with our backs against the wall, but it definitely looks unlikely now. Our former Prime Minister is Secretary General of NATO, and politicians tend to act "tough" on Russia. There's also a long-standing rivalry in the Arctic, and cultural differences such as the Russians' extreme hostility to anything LGBT-related while we're one of the more liberal countries there.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cloud-that-hides-future.html#c6091216240578309763 title="comment permalink">9/17/16, 2:37 PM</a><br><br>

It was two days after I had finished reading the book and was quite excited to hear her thoughts. <br><br>She was attempting to makes a few points in her novel as I understand her: <br>1) The governments' right to know all of our earned income no matter what the source and to tax it for whatever use they want. She used the extreme technology and digital currency to demonstrate this absurdity (people's income, spending and taxes in real time, not once a year filings) . She uses the example of 70% tax rate to support the aging boomers healthcare as another demonstration.<br>2) The way the family survives and pulls together, not because they like each other and agree with each other, but because they are all each other has. They are a typical American family spread out across the country, keeping in touch through courteous phone calls, showing the emotional scale from disdain to jealously for each other. When some of the family escape to the Country of Nevada they come across the remains of people who fled to a bunker and didn't make it, and she wanted to show that we can't isolate ourselves from one another.<br>3) The ridiculous nature of the gold standard. Putting the US on the gold standard is held out often as a utopian ideal that will save us. When it is shown in Nevada, the reader can see the limits.<br>4) The egotistical nature of America's leaders and that we will always be a world power. The Presidents makes decisions from this hubris and it quickly unfurls the ruin in the book. Of course in retrospect it was going to happen anyway given Keynesian economics.<br>5) When the crisis starts, each character in the story reacts differently to the events unfolding. Most of the characters don't recognize what's happening - one flat out says nothing bad is happening and throw more money in the stock market immediately, and most assume things will get better soon. The characters adapt each in their own way to events and in ways they never would have expected to adapt when things first started going poorly. It takes over a year for most to come to terms with events. They wake up each day and sort of fumble through it. There's no planning except on the part of two characters.<br><br>It looks like in the library The Mandibles is categorized as a "humorous story". I don't know where the library gets that direction on how to categorize it. Regardless, from what I heard from the author, It's intention isn't to tell a tale of what the author expects to happen in the future, as much as a commentary on US government leadership and family dynamics in times of struggle.<br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-cloud-that-hides-future.html#c5616253984327003924 title="comment permalink">9/18/16, 2:43 PM</a><br><br>

Here's to less progress and more things that actually work. <br><br>Ondra, no, health care isn't infrastructure, so it's not governed by the tier system. The Lakeland health care system prioritizes the sort of routine health care provided by general practitioners, though there are specialists in the usual fields and hospitals to carry out surgery and other complex procedures. Today's health care in the US is designed to extract as much money out of patients as possible, and that's one of the reasons why so many terminally ill people are kept alive in misery for a few extra months -- that's money in the bank for the industry; in the Lakeland Republic, if a condition's terminal, you go to palliative care, and if the only way to keep someone alive is to pour extravagant amounts of resources into one temporary expedient after another, that's considered a terminal condition. The flipside of that, as we've seen, is that every effort goes into making things functional for those with health-related disabilities. <br><br>Kyle, the law of diminishing returns applies to every form of progress, across the board, no exceptions. Up to a certain point, you get improvement; then the improvement diminishes while the costs increase; then the costs keep rising while, shall we say, "negative improvement" sets in, and you get lousy can openers, Windows 10, etc. <br><br>RPC, indeed they were!<br><br>David, time in the garden is a good way to deal with it, yes. <br><br>Donalfagan, go back through the thing and you'll find that there's a lot of exposition everywhere.

I'll put that on the to-consider list. <br><br>WB, absolutely. Let's make people happy today by guaranteeing that they're going to have to choose between high tax bills and failing infrastructure tomorrow! <br><br>Johnny, I don't see there being any particular cultural pressure to go down-tier, but there's a very definite financial pressure, since taxes are much lower!<br><br>Unknown, thank you. <br><br>Samurai, exactly. They'll go after every drop so long as they can make some kind of profit by doing so -- but as we're seeing right now in the fracking field, making a profit is starting to become very problematic. <br><br>Temporaryreality, no, not at all -- aiming for increased resilience is something that people do in every society, whatever their beliefs about the future. Even in cultures that believe the future will be worse than the past, there's always the hope that there'll be a good harvest sooner or later that'll allow a little extra to be set by, or people piling on the hard work to build an extra cistern so there'll be more rain water stored for the dry season. What makes faith in progress toxic is the notion that the future is <i>automatically</i> going to be better than the present and the past. <br><br>Pygmycory, stay tuned! <br><br>Rita, nobody in the US is willing to admit that our economy is contracting. That's the brontosaur in the living room -- but until that's dealt with, of course, nothing constructive is going to be done. <br><br>Onething, under US tax law, if you hire someone, you don't just pay that person's wages -- the employer has to pay social security, workmen's compensation, and a flurry of other taxes, for which he receives no benefits in return. This penalizes employers for hiring employees. Meanwhile, if an employer buys machinery, he can write that off on his taxes as a capital purchase, and depreciate it for twenty years for more writeoffs. That rewards automation. In the Lakeland Republic, that's done the other way around: you're taxed for automating and rewarded for hiring people. <br><br>Kevin, one of the fascinating things about the modern faith in progress is that it used to apply much more broadly than it does now. I did <a href=../../2013/04/the-god-with-three-heads.html rel=nofollow>a post a while back</a> on the ambiguities of progress. The reason most people have settled for technological progress is that the other kinds didn't work out so well -- but I don't doubt that it could be tried again. <br><br>As for tea in a squirt can -- gah. Yes, that's a good example of progress way past the point of negative returns. <br><br>Art, my understanding is that pennies are already worth slightly more than their face value.

I just found this article here from Flagstaff, Arizona, giving a great example of some Lean Logic and Lakeland Republic thinking. <br>The president of the Navajo Nation has issued a gardening challenge for Dine families to move toward food sovereignty. <br>“The first year of the gardening challenge is for Navajo families to plant a garden. The second year will be for Navajo communities to revitalize dormant farming areas. The third year will be a challenge to the entire Navajo Nation to farm.<br>Nez said the all-encompassing nature of farming needs to be reintroduced to the Navajo people, especially the aspects of working together and independence.<br>“It’s all there: physical exercise, bringing young and old together for intergenerational teaching, revitalizing speaking Dine’ bizaad and the traditional teachings behind farming,” Nez said. “Farming and gardening is about self-reliance and doing for ourselves, which is true sovereignty at its core. We must take the next step and incorporate food sovereignty into this initiative, by creating laws that require businesses on the Navajo Nation to allow Navajo farmers to sell their produce and meats for consumption.””<br>If anyone has experienced gardening in the Southwest, it is challenging, but not impossible. I spent most of my adult life doing “Don Quixote” gardening at 7000 feet. We will see how climate change affects methods of feeding people. The Hopi have some amazing plants they have selected for, including corn that will germinate beneath eighteen inches! of soil (sometimes mulched with volcanic cinders). Many of the foods we enjoy were selected for by the observant peoples in the ‘New World’. The following list is from here. New World Foods: corn, potato, tomato, bell pepper, chili pepper, vanilla, tobacco, beans, pumpkin, cassava root, avocado, peanut, pecan , cashew, pineapple, blueberry, sunflower, petunia, black-eyed susan, dahlia, marigold, quinine, wild rice, cacao (chocolate), gourds, and squash.<br>Thank you JMG for creating this place of sanity and thoughtfulness. I have spent many, many hours reading this blog and enjoying the comments from those who have brought their diverse views and experiences to this forum.

I mentioned a while ago when oil was really down, that this is perhaps the last opportunity for a somewhat graceful exit from fossil fuel subsidies.
