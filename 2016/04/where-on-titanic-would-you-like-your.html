Last week I had the enticing experience of being denounced as a racist on one blog and castigated as a social justice warrior on another. As my regular readers know, such entertainments have been anything but rare since I launched <i>The Archdruid Report</i> just under ten years ago. The odd belief that there are only two possible ways to think about any issue pervades modern American society; contradict that habit of thought, break with the conventional wisdom, and propose a third alternative, and you can count on both sides insisting that you belong to whichever point of view they like least. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If this week’s post fields a similar response, I won’t be surprised. Over the last month, we’ve been talking about the convoluted landscape of privilege in American society, and the way that the preferred rhetoric of both ends of the acceptable political spectrum falsifies the actual complexities of privilege that exist in contemporary American life. Some of my readers have wondered aloud, though, what that theme has to do with the broader issues at the heart of this blog’s project—the increasingly bleak future that modern industrial society is building for itself, the particular shape that future is taking in the United States, and the possibilities for constructive action that are still available this late in the day. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In this week’s post, I propose to start tying those threads back together. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the things that’s determined by privilege, after all, is which members of a society have a voice in making that society’s collective decisions. When George W. Bush sent American troops surging over the Iraqi border in 2003 and plunged the Middle East into its current state of chaos, for example, that decision was not made by all Americans equally. A small group of ideologues in the inner circles of the Bush administration made that decision, and got it rubberstamped by the President.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>A larger circle of politicians, representing an assortment of power centers toward the upper end of the nation’s political and economic hierarchy, either supported the move or chose not to oppose it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The few million Americans whose wealth and influence give them the ability to make themselves heard by the political system, in turn, either went along with the plan, or contented themselves with the kind of pro forma protests that the establishment has learned it can safely ignore. The rest of the American people, to say nothing of the people in Iraq and elsewhere who ended up bearing the brunt of the Bush regime’s squeaky-voiced machismo, had nothing to say in the matter. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is normal. Every human society without exception gives some members more say in making decisions than others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since human beings are what they are, in turn, every human society without exception hands out those decision-making roles in ways that can reasonably be called unfair. That’s true of all other species of social primates, too, so odds are it’s as thoroughly hardwired into our behavioral repertoire as, say, sex.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I mentioned a little earlier the common American habit of insisting that there are two and only two ways to think about any issue. This is another example. The conventional wisdom on the Left holds that it’s not only possible but mandatory to create a society with no inequality at all, where everyone has the same privileges as affluent American liberals have today. The conventional wisdom on the right holds that existing inequalities are good and right and proper, and reflect the actual worth of the more or less privileged. Both of them are wrong, but they’re wrong in different ways. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Left’s faith in the possibility of a society of perfect equality, where no one is more or less privileged than anybody else, has deep roots. Christian heretics in the Middle Ages roughed out the idea of a society in which perfect love would erase social divisions and everyone would share freely in all of life’s blessings; most had the great good sense to place this utopian vision on the far side of the Second Coming, when divine omnipotence could be counted on to take care of the practical difficulties of such a system. With the waning of Christian faith, Enlightenment philosophes such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau transposed the old vision into a new key, but lacked the perspicacity to find some existential barrier to shield the dream of a world of perfect equality from the fraught realities of human nature. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The result has been a long string of societies that proclaimed that they had abolished all privilege and made everyone equal. In every case, without exception, what happened instead was that an overt system of privilege was destroyed, and promptly replaced with a covert system of privilege—and since this latter was covert, it was much less subject to checks and balances. That’s why, from the Terror of revolutionary France to the killing fields of Cambodia, utopias of perfect equality quite reliably end up awash in rivers of blood. The American left, though, remains immune to the lessons of history, and once you get beyond the affluent end of the left, you can readily find utopian fantasies of the same kind that drove Robespierre, Stalin, and Pol Pot to their destinies being loudly proclaimed as the next great step in human history. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On the affluent end of the American left, by contrast, the blindness to history takes on a different shape. From the standpoint of the privileged liberal, the only reason everyone in today’s America isn’t equal is the machinations of the Evil Ists—that is, racists, sexists, fascists, and the like, who hold down all of American society’s underprivileged groups out of sheer evil evilness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Theirs is the logic of the <a href=../../2016/04/american-narratives-rescue-game.html>Rescue Game</a> discussed in an earlier post this month; the idea that privilege is structural and systemic, and that they’ve benefited from it all their lives without having to take an active role in the process is right outside their grasp of the world. Suggest it, and they’ll assume that you must mean that they’re Evil Ists and leap up in outrage shouting, "No, no, we’re the good guys!" </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of course there’s another massive problem with the particular form that the dream of a perfectly equal society has taken on the contemporary American left. Most versions of that dream imagine dragging the privileged down to the level of the poor; the current American version, as already noted, dreams of bringing everyone else up to the level of the affluent. It’s a more generous vision but also a far more clueless one, because the privileges, perquisites, and comforts that make the life of an affluent American what it is today are made possible, first, by the breakneck consumption of irreplaceable natural resources at wildly unsustainable rates, and second, by a distorted global economic system that until very recently allowed the five per cent or so of humanity that lives in the United States to consume around a third of the products of the global economy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve already discussed at length, here and in several of my books as well, the impossibility of keeping America’s affluent in the style to which they have become accustomed. (The short form was summed up memorably by Kenneth Boulding: “Anyone who believes that exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist.”)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Factor in the cost of giving everyone else those<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>lifestyles and the impossibility factor soars to Himalayan heights. Understandably, a great many affluent American liberals don’t want to hear this, but facts of this kind are like cats—the more strictly you ignore them, the more they persist in wreathing around your ankles and jumping up into your lap. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Right’s faith in the fairness of existing inequalities has more flexible roots, as shifts in intellectual fashion have sent the rhetoric of privilege careening all over a broad landscape of ideas. Back in the Middle Ages, the usual argument was that God had assigned each person his or her station in life, and asking questions about privilege was tantamount to questioning God’s good intentions. The collapse of Christian faith in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries sent the apologists of privilege scrambling for other options; theories of racial superiority and Social Darwinism put fake biology in place of religion. More recently, the insistence that modern industrial societies are meritocracies, where each person naturally gravitates to a place consistent with his or her abilities, fill the same dubious role. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That said, the American right remains just as closed to the lessons of history as their equal and opposite counterparts on the left. Track the individuals and families that populate the upper reaches of privilege in any modern industrial society, and you’ll see something that resembles nothing so much as a pot of spaghetti sauce at a slow rolling boil. Individuals and families rise up from lower in the pot, linger on the upper surface for a while, and sink back into the depths. No one formula explains the churning; for every person who climbs into the upper ranks of privilege on the basis of talent, there’s at least one who bullied and bluffed his way there and another who got there by sheer dumb luck—and there are many others just as talented who never succeeded in climbing the social ladder as far, or at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The way down is a little more predictable than the way up, not least because it used to be a favorite theme for novelists. I’m thinking here among many others of Thomas Mann’s <i>Buddenbrooks</i>, which follows a wealthy German family from the zenith of privilege through decline and extinction over the course of the nineteenth century. The lesson to be learned here is that a life of privilege doesn’t foster the habits that conduce to the preservation of privilege. Within a few generations, the descendants of the talented, the blustering, and the just plain lucky who clawed their way to the top become clueless and cosseted, unable to deal with the ordinary hurly-burly of life outside their bubble of privilege, and when something disrupts that bubble, down they go. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In ordinary times, as the spaghetti-sauce metaphor suggests, the turnover in the privileged classes is relatively steady and goes on without causing any particular disruption to the pot as a whole. To extend the metaphor, though, there are times when history turns up the heat suddenly under the sauce, a great bubble of steam rises to the surface, and the entire upper surface of the sauce is replaced in a single convulsive blorp. When that happens with spaghetti sauce, the result is usually quite a mess, and the same is just as true of the social phenomenon. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here a different novel by Thomas Mann is a useful guide—the most famous of his works, <i>The Magic Mountain</i>. What it’s about, if I may sum up an extraordinarily multilayered tale far too crudely, is the world of European privilege in the years just before the First World War. There were plenty of novels written about that theme in the 1920s, when the memory of that vanished era was still fresh enough to be painful, but Mann went about telling his story in a typically unorthodox way. The slice of prewar life he chose, half metaphor and half microcosm, was a tuberculosis sanitarium in the Swiss Alps. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Back before the development of effective treatments, tuberculosis was a death sentence for the poor. Those who didn’t have to work for a living, though, could seek a cure in sanitariums in mountainous regions, where the clear dry air might give their immune systems enough of an edge to overcome the infection. There, with nothing to distract them but conversation and romance, the patients go round the narrow circles of their well-ordered lives, their every need taken care of by swarms of servants. Far below the magic mountain, on the crowded plains of Europe, things were happening and pressures were building toward an explosion, but the feckless viewpoint character Hans Castorp and his fellow-patients—Lodovico Settembrini, Clavdia Chauchat, and the rest—drift aimlessly along until the explosion arrives, the trance shatters, and Castorp is flung, or flings himself, down from the magic mountain and onto the killing fields of the First World War. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a heck of a read and I recommend it to anyone who has the patience—not that common these days—to take in a long, thoughtful, and richly ironic novel. That said, Mann’s take also places the current state of affairs in the United States and the rest of the industrial world in mordant focus. History paid Mann an elegant compliment, because the Swiss town where the International Sanitarium Berghof was located in Mann’s novel is famous today for a slightly different gathering of the coddled and cosseted rich. Yes, that would be Davos, where the self-proclaimed masters of the world gather every year to take in speeches by movers, shakers, and tame intellectuals, and issue oh-so-serious<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>rehashes of whatever vacuous brand of conventional wisdom is in fashion just then. Look at pictures of the the last few Davos gatherings, and I’m quite sure that you’ll be able to spot Hans Castorp among the crowd, blinking owlishly at the camera.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Castorp’s vague cluelessness, certainly, is much on display these days, and not merely at Davos. I’ve discussed a great many aspects of that cluelessness in previous posts, but the one that’s relevant here is the way that people high up on America’s social ladder understand their own privilege. By and large, as already noted, the affluent on the leftward end don’t think they have any privilege at all, while their counterparts on the rightward end think that their privilege is a straightforward reflection of their own superior talent, intelligence, and so on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here again, the reality is a bit different. The affluent classes in America, as already noted, have the privileges, the benefits, and the comforts they have for two reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The first is that the world’s industrial societies are consuming irreplaceable natural resources at unsustainable rates in order to keep the global economy churning out the goods and services needed to prop up the lifestyles of the affluent. The second is that wildly unbalanced patterns of exchange concentrate the lion’s share of the benefits of that orgy of environmental destruction in the hands of a small percentage of our species. If you want to talk about the 1%, I’m fine with that, so long as it’s applied globally: to the top 1% by income of Homo sapiens. If you live in America and have an annual household income above $38,000 or so, in case you were wondering, you belong to that category. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the magic mountain of our era—a mountain of privilege whose inmates either have no idea that they’re privileged, or have convinced themselves that they deserve whatever they have and that those who don’t have the same things don’t deserve them. Far below the magic mountain, in the rest of the world, things are happening and pressures are building toward an explosion, but most of those up there in the heights haven’t noticed. It does not occur to them that there’s anything unusual about their lives, much less that some sudden turn of events could fling them down from the mountain and into a chaotic future for which most of them have made no preparations at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What they don’t see, in brief, is that both of the pillars propping up their lives—the breakneck exploitation of finite natural resources and the arrangements that funnel an oversized share of the proceeds to a small minority—are running up against hard limits right now. In upcoming posts I’ll be going into much more detail about how that’s playing out. For the time being, I want to talk about what this means for the structures of privilege we’ve been discussing for the last month. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s take the two pillars one at a time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A nation that supports itself by exploiting the rest of the world has a very different economic structure from a nation that supports itself by its own efforts. In the latter, the economy tends to be dominated by productive labor, on the one hand, and investment on the other, and the sort of conflict that Karl Marx liked to talk about—in terms of the analysis I’ve been using in these essays, the conflict between the wage class and the investment class—determines the distribution of wealth and privilege in society. In the former, by contrast, it makes more economic sense to offshore the production of goods and services to other countries, and to use the profits of global exploitation rather than domestic savings to provide capital for industry; thus the wage class and the investment class both suffer, while the salary class—the class of managers, marketers, bankers, bureaucrats, and corporate flunkies, all those professions that make their livings by manipulating the wealth produced by others—prospers as never before. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The transition from an economy focused on domestic production to an economy focused on global exploitation takes plenty of time. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In the case of the United States, it took a hundred years, from the first wave of American imperial expansion in 1898 to the temporary triumph of globalization in the 1980s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The transition the other way, though, happens a good deal more quickly, as a faltering hegemon generally gets shoved aside by rising powers rather than being allowed to decay slowly in peace. The aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse is a good working model here: once the Soviet system imploded, Russia suddenly had to do without the large subsidies it received from the rest of the Eastern bloc, and most of a decade of raw economic chaos followed as the Russian economy struggled to adapt to the task of meeting its own needs domestically. Soviet Russia, it bears noting, was much less dependent on overseas imports for goods and services than today’s America, so the post-Soviet experience should be considered a lower bound for what we’re in for. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The other pillar has similar implications. An economy based on the breakneck consumption of natural resources tends to concentrate influence in the hands of those who control resource flows directly or indirectly, and in today’s America, once again, these tend to be disproportionately members of the salary class. An economy based on the conservation of natural resources tends to concentrate influence instead in the hands of those who own sustainable resources such as land, or those who work directly with those resources; again, the conflict between owners and laborers determines the distribution of wealth and privilege in such societies. Transitioning from a conserver economy to a consumer economy takes plenty of time—in the case of the United States, the better part of two hundred years—while the transition the other way tends, once more, to be much more rapid once the resources run short. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s in this context, finally, that we can understand the unexpected revolt of the wage class that’s having so dramatic a role in shaping this years US presidential race. Hillary Clinton, like her already-forgotten Republican equivalents, is a perfect salary class candidate; she speaks for the privileged, and her entire campaign consists of waving around sound bites that signal to the privileged that they don’t need to worry about significant change if she moves into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Donald Trump, and to a lesser extent Bernie Sanders, are appealing instead to the wage class. I doubt either one expected to get anything like as far as he has, but both seem perfectly willing to ride the wave of popular discontent just as far as it will take them—and in Trump’s case, it seems likely to take him straight to the White House this autumn. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That is to say, what was supposed to be an ordinary contest among the champions of the affluent has suddenly taken on a very different shape. To shift metaphors a bit, the affluent are beginning to notice that their jockeying for position resembles nothing so much as bickering over the arrangement of deck chairs aboard the <i>Titanic</i>. The revolt of the wage class shows that the structure of power and privilege in today’s America is already beginning to shift, and two weeks from now we’ll take a hard look at some of the ways that shift is unfolding and some of the factors that are driving it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
First, though, comes something a little different. Next week marks the tenth anniversary of <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, and I plan on a bit of retrospective—and a bit of celebration. After that’s done, we can roll up our sleeves and get in under the hood of a society and a civilization in terminal disarray.</div>

I have to say, you can put me in the camp of those who have had the uncomfortable task of taking a hard look in the mirror over the course of these recent posts. I find the salary class versus wage class distinction absolutely fascinating--particularly since I currently fall in the salary class camp. That said, it's all something of an intellectual mess, as I've actually been wage class for most of my life, but feel as though I tend to fit culturally more into the salary class, but also have strong sympathies and leanings toward the wage class. It's all so complicated!<br><br>As noted, though, I currently am in the salary class and may yet stay there for the foreseeable future, though my status there is somewhat always at risk and could change at any moment--particularly if the economy tanks, as I continue to expect it will at some point. A variety of life changes are making it harder for me to walk away from the salary class should it look like the best option, but I don't know that that will stop me. The one thing I'll give myself is that I'm not going to be shocked if the world takes a tough turn, and I'm not going to bemoan my fate if I get thrown out on the economic curb. (Well, it's possible I'll bemoan it, but I <i>will not</i> claim it unfair after all the unfair comfort and affluence I've experience in my life.) I more or less expect an economic fall to happen to me at some point, likely not too far off in the future, and my hope and plan is to stay ahead of the curve--or transition gracefully if I don't. If nothing else, I have years of farming experience to fall back on, a determination to continue to work on my Green Wizard skills, and a happy comfort with living with LESS. I hope it's enough, though we'll see.<br><br>I will say this (something that I suspect is far too easy for me to say while I still am living in comfort): I do hope that some of the very hard changes that are coming improve the lot of the many millions of people who have been given the short stick for years upon years now, even if it means me taking a major hit in my standard of living. I <i>do not</i> like what we're doing as a country and a culture. I've lived long enough in rural areas and managed to speak to a diverse enough a population (not nearly enough, but enough to see and understand) to know that a whole lot of people are getting kicked and spat on through no fault of their own. It's not right, and it's time for the winds to shift in their favor. I don't know that I look forward to it, because it probably won't be good for me, but I hope that I'll be wise enough to approve of it.<br><br>I keep thinking of the comments in the last few posts about what those of us who are privileged (and I am very, <i>very</i> privileged) owe those who are far less privileged. There are small things that I do now that I think work toward the responsibility I owe, but there are undoubtedly many more I should be doing. I don't yet know exactly what that responsibility looks like, but I'm trying to figure it out.<br><br>Thank you for making me think about this.<br><br><a href=#c3806164501243993274 title="comment permalink">4/27/16, 8:49 PM</a><br><br>

I can see what's going on down the mountain now, and while I'm a little less close to the top I'm still a 55 year old guy whose life has been shaped mainly by privilege. I can grow my own vegetables and make my own medicine and I've raised my children to be less privileged than I was.

However, I think you've misrepresented the position of some of your pro-egalitarian critics here. I don't think anyone is denying that inequality exists and is usually unfair, but it exists in a range from "very unequal" to "moderately unequal", and it's in this range that we have a lot of flexibility and realistic prospects of improving a given society. The same human species can produce both Denmark and North Korea. When you adopt the attitude that inequality will be with us forever and there's nothing we can do about it, so we better grow up and deal with it, you sweep the continuum of societies that humans have proven capable of living in under the rug of fatalism.<br><br><a href=#c8981610263659000097 title="comment permalink">4/27/16, 9:23 PM</a><br><br>

One reason I support Bernie Sanders is that when things start to seriously fall apart, I would like to see someone in charge who will try to make the burden of dealing with that less rather than more unfair.

Right now I am doing a feudal lifestyle. Working someone else land and getting paid in kind with shares from the fields. It covers things pretty well. Still puttering with growing mushrooms, they produce well, but not predictably enough for restaurants. Bike parts are another expense. I am over loaded with cloths at the moment, I wonder if that will hold true until the end of the Huge Mix Up.<br><br>Some parts for tools. Shelter. Medicine (a local witch or two would suffice). Food. Water. Some books. Interesting conversations. After that life is all bonus!<br><br>When I think about it we are still very abundant with our necessities. I would run myself ragged trying to save and use even a sliver of what gets wasted today.<br><br>People doing crazy stuff. That is the big thing, it is the most unpredictable. Weather doing crazy stuff is a close second, but around here that would be drought, so I am trying to hedge heavy on that hazard.<br><br>Right now I work a lot for little. But the land owner I work for is low down the ladder too. Importantly I am respected by the land owner. Respect is huge, I wouldn't give it up to make $30 an hour making terraces for someone else. It may not be my land, but I have much freedom over designing and experimenting.<br><br>Everyone, hone up your skills that produce something basic, clean up the messes of our society lurching, or skills that support those who do. Look into yourself, to see in what way you can offer guidance or education to the deserving poor (the other side of the coin from last week's noble oblige). See also what limits on that there are in your character, emotional or meaning blockages, probing the limits with thought to how fixed they are. Check over things, make sure to address those matters that cannot be helped during a crisis.<br><br>The future is unknown, but to mark the 10th year of TADR I think that a refocus of ones own life in relation to taking an active and beneficial role in the Huge Mix Up is a good way.<br><br>Here is a Third Story of Privilege. It often isn't earned. But it can be earned! Nobility can be founded in acting virtuously, beyond ones obligations to benefit the people and land around you. What is virtue? What benefits for whom? Those are good questions, try something you imagine to be most promising of what is within your reach, and may Nature Select her own.<br><br>We cannot be certain, life is funny. A week ago I crushed my pinky finger with a sludge hammer. Turns our fingers are really good at healing! But, it messed up many hopes. A long time still until it is completely healed. Who knows what breaks next? We try, and we are happiest trying to do what seems cool! I mess up alot building terraces. But when the dirt falls down it isn't damaged, and a shovel put it back up again just as easy as the first time. I hope roots will hold it, maybe not, might have to start over if a big rain comes.<br><br><a href=#c1182320789976696453 title="comment permalink">4/27/16, 9:33 PM</a><br><br>

Start descending the mountain now, or face being thrown down off it headfirst by events. <br><br>Joseph, thank you. I've been watching the Trump campaign with some interest, but as yet I have no idea what exactly he's likely to do if he wins -- and neither, I suspect, does anyone else, including Donald Trump. This strikes me as a good thing, because we know exactly what Hillary Clinton will do: pursue the same failed policies as her predecessors until they run this country into the ground. <br><br>Cherokee, as far as I know, back when tuberculosis was common and hard to treat, you had sanitariums in just about every mountain range in the European-settled world. As for the divergence between producers and consumers -- why, yes, and we'll be getting to that in detail as things proceed. <br><br>Repent, I'm delighted to hear that the New Age circles you inhabit have grasped that -- back before 2012, I used to hear from a lot of people who insisted that utopia was about to arrive, and a recognition of the interdepedence of Yin and Yang was not an argument they were interested in hearing. <br><br>Aron, thank you. <br><br>Ghung, I ain't arguing. I could have gone for an academic career, with the attendant salary, benefits, and respectability, but decided that I would rather be poor and write what I wanted instead. So far it seems to be working out tolerably well. <br><br>Toomas (and Jay), no, that's not what I meant by "Burkean conservative," and I'd argue that Stanlis' take on Burke is idiosyncratic and not really representative of Burke's thought. The Christian notion of natural law, in fact, is in many ways just the sort of abstract ideology of right against which Burke aimed his sharpest barbs. What he was trying to do, as I understand it, was to ground politics in the concrete realities of history rather than hauling it up into the realm of timeless abstraction, as the <i>philosophes</i> and their heirs were so prone to do.<br><br>It's very hard to make any kind of generalization about Pagan spirituality, but one theme that has deep roots in Pagan thought is precisely a lack of interest in the kind of moral thinking endemic to the Abrahamic religions -- the kind that always comes down to "thou shalt" (or even more typically, "thou shalt not"). You can read Aristotle's <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> from cover to cover without running into any preachment in those terms; the same is true of the moral maxims of other ancient Pagan writings -- say, the Old Norse <i>Havamal</i> or the Old Irish <i>Audacht Morainn</i>. These latter, rather, express their ethics in terms of "do this and that will follow." It's an ethic of informed freedom rather than an ethic of obedience to edict. Thus a Burkean conservatism of the kind I'll be outlining in a future post or series of posts -- one that takes history as its basis and looks toward the amelioration of current problems on a pragmatic basis, rather than trying to force-fit the historically conditioned realities of a society into some kind of abstract notion of goodness -- has a great deal in common with Pagan thought (and also points of contact with some of the other traditions of thought I'll be bringing into play, of which Oswald Spengler may be the most notorious at the moment).<br><br><a href=#c7179180906539361002 title="comment permalink">4/27/16, 9:58 PM</a><br><br>

With regard to <i>Into the Ruins</i>, I'm delighted to hear it -- once it's out, let me know and I'll append something about it on that week's post. <br><br>Genevieve, they don't own everything. They don't have to. The salary class controls the distribution of goods and services that flow into the US by way of the tribute economy, and since so little is produced here, that gives them their power. Once the tribute runs short, things will change. <br><br>Fudoshindotcom, I have to say -- given most of the corporate attorneys I've met -- that just isn't an image I needed in my imagination! ;-)<br><br>Carl, I'm getting that impression too. "Smug" isn't the word I would use, though -- "sneering" fits the bill better, in my experience. <br><br>Mark, thank you! The thing is, once you're headed in the right direction., i.e., down the mountain, you can drop all the wasted activities you once focused on climbing, and take the downhill route a step at a time. <br><br>John, nah, you've misunderstood me. The fact that there's always going to be privilege in any human society doesn't mean that steps can't be taken to mitigate the negative effects of privilege on the less privileged! Quite the contrary, it's by acknowledging that it's always going to be a problem, bringing it into the light of day, and figuring out ways to hold it in check, that privilege can be tamed and its impacts ameliorated. More on this in a later post. <br><br>Mister R., that's broadly true. I meet very few old-fashioned liberals of the pro-civil rights, pro-grassroots organization, "let's roll up our sleeves together and make America a better place" sort. That's unfortunate, as a resurgence of that kind of pragmatic liberalism could fix a lot. <br><br>Toomas, nah, it's fine -- you'll notice that I don't blink when other regular readers mention their blog posts or announce Green Wizards meetups. <br><br>Ray, and of course that's crucial to keep in mind. Nobody needs a modern American middle class standard of living, and the sooner each of us who has one collapses out of it, the better they and everyone else will be.<br><br><a href=#c7933382572535523811 title="comment permalink">4/27/16, 10:14 PM</a><br><br>

That needed to be smashed. <br><br>I'm looking forward to next weeks fiesta (and, a truly festive occasion, it is.)

The bubbling pot of spaghetti sauce. It's a great literary theme. The rise and fall of great families. I recently watched the film, "The Magnificent Ambersons" (1942). Oh, the hubris. The self entitlement. I can't say the rise and fall of the family, gave me any pleasure. In some ways, it was like a traffic accident. You don't want to look, but it's hard to look away. I see the same thing in the place I've lived, since 1983.<br><br>The prosperous families with social clout. Usually, a little empire built on small businesses or resource extraction. And a very frugal way of living. The children and grandchildren squandering it all on big houses and toys from ATVs to fancy boats. The world changes, hard times come and it's all blown away. But, I suppose it's sometimes a matter of choice. Either walk down the mountain on your own terms, or fall or be thrown off.

I personally welcome the physical activity, emotional freedom from pure mental stress and looser social atmosphere. Of course transitioning to another social class at 45 was difficult. In my first labouring job several years ago I used to read classics during my break. Now I do that at home. Without my yoga and biking to work all the years I could have never managed this transition anyway. This physical discipline came by way of my father who did simplest hard labour over 40 years but was actually smart enough to make money on the stock market for decades and invest in a bit of real estate and have a nest egg. He was limited to some classics he read in his youth and the french he learned in his quebec youth though. My mother lacked physical discipline and resembles buddenbrooks, magic mountain types. Mixed blood makes for good results I think. Always keep your eye on the ball. What is the ball? the goal in life? Family expectations define individual pursuit of happiness goals. In my case Imixed fatherly physical discipline and mother's love of languages and culture to emigrate to Europe, marry a russia/german, have trilingual kids, invest in real estate, do import export business and follow my personal pisces karma which brings us to JMGs other blog. My older brother were less intellectual, being closer to father,had less education and stayed wage class in hometown USA. Luck admittedly helped me out as I got some inheritance young and was able to get a European passport. So a mixture of luck, culturally inherited and personal capabilities plus family help, friendly employer, wife's excessive native intelligence got me so far. Take out any card and the structure built up over decades would have fallen down. Another career, another country, another wife. I read an article that Americans are using lots of antidepressamnts, are a lot more obese. Education, health are all going down faster due to the exploitation being more radical, systemic than elsewhere. Going against the tide is hard in food deserts without public transport, walkable streets, etc. All my neighbors after five years in new housing tract are getting 2nd cars. In Hamburg I can do without it. Saves money, improves health. In western, southern USA or suburbs generally this choice is impossible. Car is lifeblood. Commute long, family life short, fast food on freeway, equals overweight, depression, medication, mass shootings, high divorce rates, comic book film fantasies turned into real life neo con adventures. So international problems start with liveable detail,human nearness. Inertia through culture against massive suburbia, junk food transition is high in old world. Experiments can end badly. Wal mart, goldman sachs, geography of nowhere, student debt to lifetime servitude,living on credit cards is all social engineering from profit hungry people. <br><br>Social welfare industrial state is collapsing here too.EU will end badly, not WW3 like 1940s but disorderly. Stagnation, decay is our future. Buddenbrooks writ large. Living off capital, not interest is a disease. But the total destruction on purpose of the population as in America is extreme. UK is a bit more like that. Models vary.<br><br><a href=#c2062213985277274265 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 12:41 AM</a><br><br>

None of my colleagues are suggesting that absolute equality is either desirable or possible, and certainly none of us support any reduction of inequality that is based around violence or totalitarianism.<br><br>Your theme of privilege is great though and I wondered if you might be bringing in to the discussion the theme of aspiration.

The "wage class and the investment class both suffer" – I'm not sure what you're referring to when you say the investment class is suffering. Maybe they're having trouble finding "bankable" investments – but does that really count as suffering? Soon after, you say that "an economy based on the breakneck consumption of natural resources tends to concentrate influence in the hands of those who control resource flows directly or indirectly, and in today’s America, once again, these tend to be disproportionately members of the salary class." But really, members of the "salary class" don't actually "control" much. They're working for someone else – that's why they get paid a salary. If they have a job that involves natural resources, that doesn't mean they're actually in control of setting policy. What they do is generally just implementing policy, or tweaking it around the edges – the accountant of the king's treasury is not to be confused with the king. Petroleum engineers at an oil company (much less marketing people) aren't "controlling the flow of natural resources," they're just going to work and doing their job.<br><br><a href=#c3864648262932664914 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 2:25 AM</a><br><br>

This blog jumpstarts my Thursday mornings better than a cup of strong tea. <br><br>Steve, you point out that "it appears that his [Trump's] statement of several months ago that American "wages are too high" has disappeared down the memory hole." I've noticed an eerie phenomenon among virtually all Trump supporters I've heard from: They tell us what they think Trump means, not what he actually says. So if they are questioned about his deportation claims (as I heard on the news one day), his supporters say, "He didn't really mean that. He just means that a temporary measure will be necessary to get the immigration system back into shape." I've heard similar exegeses of every other statement Trump's made -- he doesn't mean THAT, he just means [insert milder form of what the speaker hopes for]. <br><br>Genevieve, your point about the practical incompetence of the salary class is a good one; sadly, my experience (I teach at a community college and volunteer in a women's shelter) is that many of the wage class, too, don't know how to cook or make practical things. Home economics has been replaced by "consumer science"(What a term!), all-day institutional day care has replaced the natural apprenticeship of parent and child, junk food and junk clothes are cheaper and easier to provide than home-made versions of either -- how would anyone acquire practical skills? It's a sad situation, but of course there are resilient people in every class who will welcome a challenge and learn what they need to.<br><br>Mr. Greer, I appreciate your insights into Pagan spirituality. I am myself a devout Christian, but life and (I would like to think) prayer has led me to a similar conclusion about many of the Bible's seemingly prescriptive sayings: that it may be wiser to take them as descriptions of the inevitable unfolding of universal patterns as created by God than as mean-spirited fatwas. So Jesus says, "To those who have, more will be given; from those who have not, even what they have will be taken away." This saying disturbed me for some time, but after many decades of life it strikes me more as a description of the way life, the universe, and everything work than a commandment: Jesus is not poised to snatch stuff away from the needy but simply explaining a hard reality of life as it exists. I suspect that the same may be true of many of the commandments -- the "law" of gravity does not say that if you jump, God will punish you by letting you fall; in the same way, the law that as you reap, so shall you sow is not God saying, "Ha! I've got you now, selfish mortal! Time for some hardship." I am, of course, speaking of the spiritual application of these "laws," not the civil one that was part of the Old Testament arrangement. I realize that the original writers and readers of the Bible may not have seen them in this light, but I still find myself within the fold of Christian thought and tradition, though in one of the more remote corners, perhaps!<br><br><a href=#c880746719811638967 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 4:58 AM</a><br><br>

However, I'd like to know more about how the investment class has been suffering. I suspect I'm misunderstanding something, but the statistics on wealth suggest that those who rely on income from investments rather than wage or salary are actually doing quite well.<br><br>And I don't doubt that many statistics related to economic matters are cooked as a matter of course, but I do have a tough time buying into the notion that they could be cooked so badly that the statistics on the growth of inequality and the stretching of the long tail of wealth could have been <i>completely</i> invented. Exaggerated, sure, but if the ten wealthiest people in the nation (all of them investment class if I understand your taxonomy correctly) are not nearly so wealthy as they are portrayed in the media, certainly they have at least the means at their disposal to get the word out about how badly their wealth has been exaggerated.<br><br>Finally, I think it's clear from the Mossack Fonseca leak and numerous wrist-slaps administered to large investment banks for laundering drug money that the investment class is tied in to an invisible and unreported criminal economy of unknown but certainly quite large scale -- which means that much of the wealth of the investment class is unreported in the first place. Now, it's certainly possible that the salary class is actually the one benefiting by laundering money for violent criminal organizations, but it's not immediately obvious to me how that is. I'd appreciate any insight you could provide.<br><br>To sum it up in a one-sentence question: given all the overt wealth and privilege of the investment class, and the evidence for an even greater degree of wealth and privilege that is obscured through black market connections and tax havens, in what sense has the investment class suffered?<br><br>-DL<br><br><a href=#c550212561696642827 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 5:40 AM</a><br><br>

I am referring of course to the migrant crisis and the end of an EU without internal border controls. In the last half year I have seen Swedes and Danes go from thinking the problems were temporary to a deep realization that something has changed permanently. The bubble has burst. Reality is setting in. The only real distraction is watching this race with amusement. I would not be surprised, to be honest, if the EU doesn't fall apart within the next year or two. If the UK leaves, I expect Denmark, Sweden, and Greece to follow, and Italy and Spain may not be far behind.<br><br>One of the things I have noticed from the elites is that they tend to focus on others' obligations to them, and rarely really the other way around unless they have power to gain from it. So Greece cannot get a bailout but they are expected to run most of the refugee camps and enforce the border laws, or as an alternative let Germany "help" (and by that I mean pay to call the shots). In times of plenty that might be feasible but in instead today all we get is a blame game. Oh, and German threats to kick Greece out of the EU.<br><br>Similarly I watch Americans talk about how the EU needs to bring in more refugees and note the same thing. Denmark, perhaps the most anti-immigrant nation in the EU (right up there with Hungary) has done everything they can to avoid taking in refugees and still managed to take in way more than the US in absolute number. So here we also have the empire (the US) insisting that their client states clean up their messes. And so there is a *lot* of racism that develops.<br><br>Europe is undergoing one of these steam bubbles you mention at the moment. The old neoliberal center is being de-emphasized and a new center is forming around communitarian nationalism (I daresay something similar can be seen between Trump and Sanders).

We might be wealthy globally, but apart from moving into tents (which we've done before, but our kids are older now), there just doesn't seem to be much way to downsize with prices for everything being what they are. I'm having trouble figuring out how to go further down the mountain, I just don't know how to do it. Our diet is already whole bulk foods--oatmeal every morning; toast for lunch; brown rice or whole wheat pasta or bulk quinoa (quite affordable at Costco) for dinner, with roasted bulk frozen veggies and sauce. It's still an outrageous amount of money a month. Our house is barely furnished; I find what I can on the side of the road and once in a while the thrift stores have something that's not overpriced (ten bucks for a dresser). We're sleeping on sleeping bags until we can save up for a mattress, which seems unlikely to happen anytime soon. <br><br>I just have to focus on our garden this year, and hopefully the possibility of being able to buy a cheap house eventually. We declared bankrupcty to get rid of excess debt, so hopefully that will be an option in another year and a half. It's ironic that downsizing seems to me to be difficult when you don't have the money to do so.<br><br>I do have to say that Trump has me listening to his economic message. Slapping huge fines/fees on companies that outsource labor? Makes sense. Susan Sarandon spoke about the revolution coming much quicker to the US if Trump is elected (http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/29/susan-sarandon-trump-might-be-better-for-america-than-hillary-clinton.html)--but if he manages to make a positive difference to working class folks I think that bubble might not pop the same way it would with four more years of the same.

God wasnt kidding when Isaiah was told: I create good and create evil. In everyday life, all people were recognized to have yetzer tov and yetzer hara, both good and bad inclination. Unlike Christianity, it was recognized the hara is not something you can get rid of. The idea is to channel it into something that at least does no overt injustices or harm to the community. The classic example given is someone who enjoys shedding blood. The are encouraged to work in an industry like a meat market rather than killing wildlife, strays or people. You can use your hara to benefit your community in some way and not be a nuisance to social order. A lot of SJWs are using their ruthlessness and manipulativeness to at least try and do some good with it. :)<br><br>As for the shall-nots, that seems to have come in with the ascendency of YHVH, the warrior king male aspect. Genesis admits that back when El Shaddai was the main manifestation of the Divine, Adam and Eve learned good from evil by eating the fruit of the trees of knowledge and were expected to go out and live their lives without a written contract of thou shalts and thou shalt nots. That came much later. <br><br>As an aside, it is interesting to me that Eve ate first, and society was originally matriarchal and had a sharing type econony, if anthropologists are to be believed. If you take the story as an archetype, Men ate later, then came into power with weapons and coinage and control over land. Utopians would say we have reached the end of that model and the return of a caring nurturing female sustainbable energy based world is near. That seems to be just the myth of progress in disguise...<br><br>Kabbalah symbolizes balance and in a way provides many paths between nodes for people to find their own path - there is not just one way to the top, so to speak. You can take a fully yin path or a fully yang path or wander all over the place. It is not coincidental that kabbalists recognize the feminine aspect of the divine in ways rejected by the western mainstream. We have gone too far the other way.<br><br>This spills over into modern life with the idea that might makes right and that money is the measure of success and that excessive exploitation of other people and natural resources is not just necessary but desirable. It describes failing to be salary class as failure, period, and condemns wage workers as conquered peoples who deserve their fate due to their weakness. The fact that not everybody can get an office job, that indeed society cannot even function without the types of jobs wage class people do, is also a refutation of their distorted utopian ideal, and they can't see the obviousness of it. By refusing to acknowledge that every such job is necessary and deserves a living wage, they make it impossible for the economy to find real balance.<br><br><a href=#c1951750272807178715 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 6:27 AM</a><br><br>

I have worked in Malaysia.<br><br>The crowning achievement of antipoverty policy in the US has been that we have managed to substitute consumer goods for two things, namely other people and productive property. Africa and Asia are both diverse continents but at least in Indonesia, even if you are poor, you have a degree of security in housing and food not present in the US. Water is a bigger problem (a lot of the water poor people boil and drink is polluted and this causes health problems, but hey, look at Flint, Michigan). Additionally the worker protection laws (like in Bangladesh) aim at democratizing access to capital, not democratizing access to big screen television sets. So poverty is qualitatively different.<br><br>So no I won't say that poor people in the US are elite. They are in terms of consumption of consumer goods, I will grant you that. But in terms of security of necessities, the system in the US is one of the most oppressive towards the poor that I have seen anywhere in the world. I would argue that even the way that poor people in the US might be globally elite is actually a source of oppression for the poor in the US. The poor Indonesian can get a job at a sweatshop, make wages not high enough to put food on the table but at least that helps out her family, but at the end of the year she is entitled by law to a bonus payment which is likely large enough to buy a noodle cart for her brother. Thus the wages may be low, but the protections that are there turn the wage class into small scale investors. The result? Two out three Indonesians are self employed (in Bangladesh it is closer to 90%). The money will then be paid back and she will likely go into business for herself. That is a just economy.<br><br>In contrast the American low wage earner is one paycheck away from the street and has no prospect of helping a family member start a business, No capital. No ownership of anything productive. Nothing but poverty and wage slavery.<br><br>So I think we have to be careful. Poverty in Sudan is not the same as poverty in Botswana. Poverty in Indonesia is not the same as poverty in Guatemala. But in terms of the things needed to have a good life, American poor people are not very high up the ladder.<br><br><a href=#c7404531358795234836 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 7:23 AM</a><br><br>

Deck chairs are for the privileged. Not for the 3rd classed ones. Even, as you so nicely describe who is sitting there. Left wing privileged, chatter boxing about equality, but ridiculing that ideology with themselves comfortably seating themselves in their privileged position. Right wing privilege, pompously shouting about how brainy and big-penised they are, but their bragging reflects how undeservedly they have stumble by sheer luck into their privileged position.<br><br>Let me turn to, despite privilege being somewhat a taboo to talk about or openly associate oneself with it, that privilege nevertheless is being tremendously desired. Those deck chairs are clearly the image of what it is all about.<br>· Once, they are comfy.<br>· Second they give you better access to sex. Natural law; multiply yourself. Good so, if with such exposed privilege that is easier then.<br>· Last but not least you are nearer to the life-boats. As on the Titanic the privileged had been so in fact. Check the survival rate and compare to the 3rd classed ones. Significant would be an understatement! So survival is best achieved in a privileged position. Guess who we are descendant’s from. Our predecessors have been privileged once quite regularly.<br><br>So, that is, why privileged was, is and ever will be desired again and again. It is one, if not the evolutionary advantage. So everyone, stop being ashamed of it and enjoy the fate, that gifted you with your privilege ... and ... make the best of it for yourself and for others.

It seems we've had this conversation a hundred times, and though it's softened somewhat in its apocalyptic furor, it's still where things go.<br><br>This time, though, I just kept thinking about the various managers, sales reps, PR teams and so on that I do grunt work for at my job, and that led me to laugh much harder than I usually do at the prospect. I had promotion at work last year that transferred me from the staffing company where I’d been working with the warehouse and workroom staff, to doing the same work with a lot more direct interface with clients at a PR firm, and I’ve since gotten a glimpse of the truly wealthy that I’d never imagined I’d have. After seeing things like a serious conference over the possibility of shutting down the entire office over a broken air conditioner until repairs were completed ("I swear, it's like... 80 degrees in here!"), seeing someone come to the brink of tears after finding out that we were out of the espresso roast coffee and they'd have to cope with house blend for two days, and once spending a whole afternoon in giggles with the property manager scouring the kitchen in vain because a client had reported seeing "an ant," and having to make a physical store run for a client who was in a panic over discovering that the supply delivery had brought tablets, rather than gel capsules of her favorite headache medicine, the last dregs of credibility for paranoia about the capability and malice of America’s aristocracy is gone forever. I definitely feel like one of those sanitarium servants attending to the patients by day, and heading back to the real world and real problems of the city on afternoons and weekends.<br><br>It's also been interesting listening to the people around here as this election season has brought a new sense of unease to the environment. Most statements about politics are in low wavery voices accompanied by nervous tittering, by the end of the day, the breakroom television has been turned from the default news stations to the food and travel channels because they “just can’t bear to look at it anymore” and my repeated insistence of "call me old fashioned, but I don't discuss politics in the workplace" every time someone tries to drag me into a conversation about “oh isn’t it terrible that people are actually voting for him?!” (referring to Trump, of course) is starting to look awfully suspicious. Of course, the talk about international vacations and McMansions continues, as well as the drama every time the supply delivery brings chocolate chunk snack bars instead of chocolate chip snack bars (I've wryly joked, talking my work with friends and family, to send an angry mob after me to snap me out of it if I ever turn into one of these people). But of course, there’s a darker angle to all that too. These people aren't bad people. They're clueless of course, and think what they have is normal, and don't even think about the gulf between their 6 figure salaries, and my life on the bare cusp between salary and wage living.

Russia's current massive resurgence has everything to do with shedding all of these peripheral freeloaders in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Russia's weakness during the 1990s, following the collapse of the USSR, has much to do with the fact that it was run by traitors such as Gorbachev and Yeltsin, the Western consultants who told them exactly how to rob Russia blind, and the oligarchs they empowered and coddled.<br><br><a href=#c7803121298945344937 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 8:09 AM</a><br><br>

It doesn't show the whole picture, though, as it considers only one side of the equation - income. That has to be balanced against the outgoings needed to have a comfortable standard of living in each part of the world.<br><br>I don't think I'm saying anything that is new to you though, since the US wage class are in the main part of the 1%, yet still clearly have legitimate grievances. This incomes/outgoings disparity is also an interesting driver of so much migration and outsourcing, where (more or less of) the income available or expected in one location can be played off against the living standards of another.<br><br>Getting involved with your blog has been a really interesting ride for me, as a person of the left.

In Changing the Subject, he examines the changes that he observes in himself and others—the distraction when reading on the screen; the loss of personal agency through reliance on GPS and one-stop information resources; an increasing acceptance of "hive" behaviors. "An unprecedented shift is underway," he argues, and "this transformation is dramatically accelerated and more psychologically formative than any previous technological innovation." He finds solace in engagement with art, particularly literature, and he brilliantly describes the countering energy available to us through acts of sustained attention, even as he worries that our increasingly mediated existences are not conducive to creativity.<br>It is impossible to read Changing the Subject without coming away with a renewed sense of what is lost by our wholesale immersion in the digital and what is regained when we immerse ourselves in a good book."<br><br>In my current life I'm trying to limit my time on email/Internet to only certain times during the week (giving me enough time to still read the Archdruid Report, for example), and spend most my waking hours offline.

That is the belief that there is some cataclysm right around the corner that will completely upend the divisions, leaving former wage workers on top of the new social hierarchy, and former salary workers grubbing for scraps. This fantasy is nice, and has a long, long history, dating back at least to Matthew's account of Jesus's remarks on a memorable day next to the sea, and probably further, but is all too often just that, fantasy. <br><br>JMG and readers should know well the power of consciousness-altering magic, and recognize its practitioners in the cadres of managers, directors, coordinators, and so on that make up the salary class. I have a management degree, and while the vast majority of the classes were focused on the minutiae of administrative systems and the details of the magic rituals (in the rather dull forms of statistical analysis, performance evaluation, etc.) needed to manipulate them, the pure management theory classes were clearly introductions to the kind of rawer magic needed to reach into the heads of others and take some control of their consciousness. The slippery but very real rules to changing consciousness in business take all sorts of names, like "managing up," "creating consensus," "game theory," "changing the paradigm," "social entrepreneurship" and so on, but they represent real skills that don't disappear when circumstances change.<br><br>I don't mean that privilege is "earned," whatever that means, or that it is unshakeable, but that the same methods that many (not all) salary class types have used to attain their current position in the current order are easily transmutable to a new order. Obviously the details of econometrics are nonsense without the current economic order, but the ability to convince others to join your organizational scheme? Timeless. And I don't mean the eerie charisma of the cult leader, just the boring, everyday skills of the entrepreneur. The ability to create a vision in someone else's head that makes them more likely to do what you want and then to create organizational structures that reinforce those visions and behaviors is management. (Many of the Arch-Managers refer to a split between "leadership" and "management", intentionally creating tiers of value in order to enhance the prestige of higher rungs and make demi-gods of "leaders", but that is a faction to which I don't belong.)<br><br>And management is a skill that has survived every cataclysm so far.<br><br>Thank you for reading, and to JMG for continuing to shed some light on the silliness infesting far too much of our public discourse.

I'm quite aware of HRC's shortcomings, but would a Clinton presidency pursuing "the same failed policies as her predecessors" bring down the USA faster or with far more collateral damage than a Trump presidency would? I'm not sure I'm willing to risk Trump on that basis. Plus there's always the possibility that Bernie Sanders' campaign has taught Clinton a few vitally important lessons about the mood of the electorate and that she might just modify some of her policies in light of those lessons and make some real, substantive changes that would help people.

Occasionally I'm moved to ask a question, but this week I twice found myself thinking "that's not quite right". <br><br>The first point that stopped me short was the spaghetti sauce model - it may be true on the west side of the Atlantic but considerably less so in the UK in particular. There is very very little new entry to the privileged elite. Just enough to keep the rest of us thinking that someday I, or my children might make it in by luck or talent or sheer chutzpah, but basically our pan has long since gone of the boil and a crust has formed through which nothing rises.<br><br>In fact I wonder if your model is even true for the US any more. From afar it looks like your privileged elite are pretty much the children and grandchildren of the previously privileged. <br><br>People and families do sink as privilege gets ever more concentrated and extreme but I do wonder how accurate your model of continual churn is even for your country. It was easier to breakthrough in the 16th Century in Europe, and perhaps in the 19th Century in the US, but in a mature and declining civilization one of the classic problems is that social mobility upwards all but ceases - the elite becomes self-perpetuating.<br><br>The other problem I had was the implication that it is the unsustainable nature of the exploitation that creates the privilege that causes its downfall. For sure the limits to growth are an added dimension this time around, but there have been plenty of previous occasions when a privileged elite has sleep-walked into oblivion, usually taking several other classes with it, without necessarily hitting any limits other than becoming detached or alienated from the conditions on which their privilege depends.<br><br>Your sequence of posts a year or so ago describing the operation of the imperial wealth pump provided for me a more general description of why implosion becomes inevitable as the elite ends up eating itself.<br><br>Planetary limits are certainly providing an extra dimension this time, and start to look like they may well make the question of how and why an elite loses control irrelevant.<br><br>However part of our problem perhaps is that if the planetary limits had not been reached then this particular elite would not yet have reached the condition for its collapse. A 'normal' end to civilization typically results in an interregnum of a couple of centuries or more whilst the successor gets its act together - but the succession is implicit in the collapse of the old order.<br><br>So the effect of planetary limits may be to force a collapse before it would naturally occur, and with the succession not determined. I guess that makes the Green Wizard task of preserving a useful body of practical knowledge even more important.<br><br>The chuntering of the wage class finding expression in Trump, Corbyn, Sanders, BoJo et al seems to have nothing to do with acknowledging planetary limits to privilege - as you point out a $38k household income puts you in the global 1% - in the UK that is equivalent to less than 2 adults on minimum wage earn. The chuntering is of a class who seek to replace the old elite with a new elite making the same old planetary mistakes.<br><br>It may be interesting, but it is no part of a solution to the crisis which lies beneath.<br><br><i>RogerCO</i><br><br><a href=#c6520969159226421211 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 12:27 PM</a><br><br>

In most wage jobs you are expected to work even if you're sick, unless you bring a doctor's note, which is more problematic when you don't have health insurance. I turned in 5 w2's and 2 1099's last year in taxes. The difference between $20,000 in wages and $20,000 salary can be worlds apart.

Privilege by your parents' social status being perhaps the most common, but also other privilege. It would behoove us all, especially those of us raising the next generation to consider what to teach them about who ought to be privileged, in what ways, and what the responsibilities are that go with having privilege. Women and children first is an old one, speaking of the Titanic, as is honor your elders. Popular among my set is a line from Spiderman that all our kids know "With great power comes great responsibility", a modern phrasing of noblesse oblige.<br>Should we offer privilege to people in certain fields? Perhaps midwifes should be protected from homicide charges in the event of childbirth deaths? Farmers protected from being drafted for militia service? What about religious privilege?<br>An interesting little example: the Water Master here cannot be charged with trespass: he has the right to enter and inspect any land for illegal and/or improper use of water at any time. He can't do anything else--can't check that you're only growing legal crops, or that your field hands are legal, for example.

Now it is "saved up" in a flashy but impractical Mcmansion or soon to be worthless vacation home at the beach or in the desert or swampland of Florida.

My wife, who's rather more literate than I am, mentioned that there's also an entire genre of Victorian English and American novels on the same theme. <br><br>Godfree, of course. The fact that privilege always exists doesn't mean that it's abused with equal vigor in every society -- just that every society either has to figure out ways to ameliorate its effects, or deal with the consequences of leaving it to run wild. <br><br>Ed, the situation over here isn't just a matter of more drastic exploitation -- there are also the economic consequences of global hegemony, which you can also trace in the social history of 19th century England and the like. But it does seem to be worse here than in many other industrial countries. <br><br>Greybeard, I'm glad to hear that your end of the leftward scene has acquired that sort of common sense. I've had enough brushes with the utopian-idealist end of the left, though, to know that the sort of thing I described in my post is very much alive and well in the contemporary American left. Your analysis of aspiration is interesting, though the ghost of one of my Latin professors is itching to point out that your etymology's off -- <i>aspiratio</i> is from <i>ad</i> + <i>spirare</i>, "to breathe toward" or, as we would say, "to pant after." The image of greyhounds chasing a mechanical rabbit does come to mind!<br><br>Alex, yeah, I expect to get tooth marks all over my ankles for this.<br><br>Mike, it's very common for people faced with the specific class analysis I'm using to take "investment class" to mean only the very upper end of the investment class, and "salary class" to mean only the lower and middle part of the salary class, as you've done here. That's not what I mean. If you get most of your annual income from return on investments, you're in the investment class, even if your income is fairly modest. Many retirees are in the investment class; so are people who followed the advice of a once-popular book, spent ten or fifteen years stashing away a lot of money, and now live on that instead of working. The bulk of the investment class doesn't have access to the financial jiggery-pokery of the very rich, and they've been hit hard by the very low rate of return on safe investment we've had for decades now. <br><br>Similarly, the salary class doesn't just include the petroleum engineers and the marketing people -- it also includes the CEOs. While individual salary class members may have only a limited role in setting policy, collectively the salary class does the lion's share of this. Furthermore, the last half century or so has seen a spectacular shift of power in the corporate sphere from boards of directors (elected by investors and thus beholden to the investment class) to salaried corporate executives, whose compensation packages have soared into low earth orbit as a result. That's the context for my suggestion that the investment class has lost ground relative to the salary class over recent years. Note that this doesn't mean that they're as badly off as the wage class -- simply that there's been a shift in wealth and influence that needs to be taken into account.<br><br><a href=#c5336743721205110779 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 6:22 PM</a><br><br>

Still, I've got some other things to talk about first. <br><br>Bruno, the ongoing process of slow collapse has been speeding up quite a bit recently, and yes, that's shaped some of my tone. The choice of more controversial subjects? That's happened partly because I've covered most of the uncontroversial ones, and partly because my readers haven't gone shrieking off into the distance when I started bringing up edgier topics. I think people really are ready to hear this stuff. <br><br>Leo, so noted. I personally find Clinton even more troubling -- venal, incompetent, and utterly committed to policies that are running this country into the ground. <br><br>Earthworm, yes, you could take the metaphor in that direction!<br><br>Damaris, oh, granted, it's possible to take the apparently prescriptive passages in the Bible that way, and arguably wiser to do so. I'm sure you're aware, though, that by and large they have not been taken that way. All too often, rather, they've been turned into demands to shout at other people -- and this, of course, despite Jesus' forceful injunction regarding motes in one eye and beams in another! Mind you, I'm not saying that a morality of "if/then" is better than one of "thou shalt" -- each has its strengths, its problems, and its besetting sins. I simply meant to point out the fact that you can't really build a politics of natural law on the basis of Pagan tradition, but a Burkean politics of history is another matter. <br><br>Fudoshin, oh, I get that. It's just that corporate attorneys aren't particularly edifying spectacles, and neither was <i>Riverdance</i>! <br><br>Dan L., you'll want to read my response to Mike further up the comment thread. The short form is that you're treating the very top end of the investment class -- the sort of people who have access to Mossack Fonseca-type gimmickry -- as though it was the whole of the investment class. The vast majority of people who get most of their annual income from investments are nothing like so wealthy, and many of them have been clobbered financially by the steep decline in returns on investment in recent decades. <br><br>Scotlyn, exactly. Do you know the five stages of the Discordian historical cycle? If not, they're Chaos, Discord, Confusion, Bureaucracy, and Aftermath; Europe's deep in the fourth stage now, America's stumbling into the fifth. I may just have to do a post on that!<br><br>In the meantime, many, many congrats on becoming car-free! It really does open up a world of possibilities. <br><br>ASR, up here in poor and rural Allegany County, it was Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump by a mile. <br><br>Mikep, I wonder if they realize that all this just guarantees the neo-Nazis a hearing outside the circle of self-proclaimed respectability. <br><br>Chris, I've been watching that as well. Has it occurred to you that the US is using Europe as a borderland, comparable to the American Southwest, in which migrating populations can be absorbed without penetrating too close to the imperial core? If Juhana's right, warband formation is already well under way in Europe, so Toynbee's analysis remains right on track.<br><br><a href=#c7862275231517419087 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 6:46 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not saying that it's easy being poor in America; it's harder than it was when I made less than the poverty line, and that was hard enough. My point is simply that it's even harder elsewhere. <br><br>Ahavah, there's a pragmatic streak all through the Abrahamic faiths, of course. It's just that there's also the other aspect -- to be fair, this seems to show up in all prophetic faiths. There may be something in the experience of being a prophet, and being ignored by most of your listeners, that encourages simple formulas and a tendency to want to shake people until their teeth rattle! <br><br>David, it's a lesson I have to keep learning, too. The journey is always one step at a time. <br><br>Chris, of course it's complex to measure the relative condition of groups of people in different cultures, environments, etc. I was simply using income as a rough guide. <br><br>Johnny, thanks for the recommendation -- I'll put it on the get-to list. <br><br>Toomas, my immediate thought was the Allan Sherman Institute for the Incurably Goyische, but I'll happily await other suggestions. <br><br>Rita, and of course Buddhism -- like every other religious movement -- promptly worked out ways to develop its own formal hierarchies and systems of privilege. it really is inescapable. <br><br>Johnny, the only James I've read is <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, which was one of the assigned readings for the course of study that got me consecrated as a Gnostic bishop. (<i>Long</i> story...) He's on the get-to list. <br><br>Barrymelius, the Russians had a popular saying in the Yeltsin years: "Everything Marx said about socialism was false, but everything he said about capitalism was true." Not the first time that somebody saw very clearly what was wrong and then offered a hopelessly dysfunctional plan for fixing it! <br><br>Toomas, that's interesting. I don't have a lot of exposure to the complexities of Catholic thought; it's good to hear that the Aristotelian mode of ethics has gotten some attention there, and anybody who has grumpy things to say about Kant's moral theory is welcome company!<br><br>Hubertus, so long as "making the best of it" includes not using it to harm or disadvantage other people, I suppose so. <br><br>Eric, yep. I've had quite a few opportunities to encounter people at that level of the salary class, and a few chances to mingle discreetly with those higher up -- a writer sometimes has such things happen -- and the impression of utter fecklessness and cluelessness is the thing that has stayed with me.

This differs so completely from everything that I've read on the subject that I'm going to want to see evidence. <br><br>SV Koho, no question, this election is quite a spectacle. I sometimes think the only way to make it better is to go all-out Roman, arm the candidates with gladiator gear, and give the thumbs down to the fallen. <br><br>David, that's a fascinating comparison, and makes me wonder if the wheel of Samsara has any connection with the medieval European wheel of fortune, which diagrammed the social churn in a memorable image -- the figure rising says <i>regnabo</i> ("I shall rule"), the one on top says <i>regno</i> ("I rule"), the one going down says <i>regnavi</i> ("I ruled"), and the one on the bottom says <i>sine regno sum</i> (hard to translate, "I am powerless" is probably closest). <br><br>Matt, oh, granted! It's a complex thing -- and of course people can have legitimate grievances that have nothing to do with their income level. I quite understand about the blogosphere; I pick and choose my blogs carefully, and avoid most comments pages, as I have limited patience with trolling and the rest of it. <br><br>Pygmycory, the Ukraine is a good test case for how to do a lot of things wrong. Some of the southern republics, of the kind Gary Shteyngart parodied so brilliantly in <i>Absurdistan</i>, might be better examples in general, as they share mineral wealth and sparse population with your country. <br><br>Escape, thanks for both of these. It fascinates me that all of a sudden the media is willing to talk about the divergence between the wage class and the salary class. Either I chose a good moment to launch into that conversation, or I have more readers in the opinion-manufacture industry than I thought!<br><br>Mister R., that's a valid question. Some of them are investment class and some of them are salary class. It depends on whether most of their annual income comes from investments, on the one hand, or kleptocratic compensation packages on the other. <br><br>Pygmycory, thank you for getting what I was trying to say. <br><br>Ssi grower, thank you!<br><br>Stu, "lack of interest" is a more powerful force in the history of ideas than I think most people realize. The ancient Greeks and Romans, for example, by and large could care less what people thought about the gods. They simply weren't interested. If you did things that showed disrespect for sacred things, that was quite another matter, and would get you exiled if you were lucky or killed if you weren't; <i>asebeia</i>, sacrilege, was a death-penalty offense in Athens, for example. But heretical ideas? They simply didn't care. In the same way, the rhetoric of moral hectoring is popular in some traditions and just not of interest in others.<br><br><a href=#c1227547236163444978 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 7:50 PM</a><br><br>

Where the right seeks allies, the left seeks scapegoats, and glories in how many people they can alienate from their cause. You mention that white women and gay men are now being lined up in front of the circular firing squad; white woman and gay men have been significant constituencies of support for the left.

I'll put Birkerts on my (lengthening) get-to list. <br><br>Benjamin, while management in one sense or another will no doubt survive, it's unwise to conclude from that fact that (a) the people who currently fill managerial roles will keep them, or that (b) the explosive metastasis of management at the expense of productive labor, the dominant feature of the US economy since the end of the Second World War, is sustainable. I'd encourage you to consider what happened to those countless thousands of managerial professionals employed by the Roman Empire when Rome fell -- hint: they were not immediately hired at their current salaries by the invading barbarians. I'll be discussing this at quite a bit of further detail as we proceed. <br><br>Gottfried, what that shows me is that Trump is succeeding in expanding his base outside his initial wage class support. That's one of the reasons I think he has a very good chance of winning in November. <br><br>NS, and I'll just second my comments responding to this point above. ;-)<br><br>RogerCO, of course the replacement of one set of privileged people with another isn't a solution to the underlying collision of industrial society and the hard limits of a finite planet; I hope nothing I said suggested that it was.

The shifts in the structure of privilege, rather, are factors in the crisis of our time that many of my readers may find useful to keep in mind, not least because their capacity to deal with the widening spiral of crisis may be rather sharply affected by sudden changes in effective status and access to resources. <br><br>Jessi, a very good point. <br><br>Mgalimba, thank you!

Yes, exactly, and this touches on some issues I'll be covering in rather some detail in an upcoming post. <br><br>Siliconguy, one of the major changes in American society over the last couple of decades is that the salary class is being split into a privileged affluent half and a much less privileged and poorly paid half, and the latter has only just really begun to grasp that its interests no longer lie with the affluent half.

Ours works about forty hours a month in the summer, eight in the winter.

The dominant force is a nominal co-operative processor, Fonterra. It is owned by farmer shareholders. My brother is employed as a wage worker and his class are treated with contempt by the management. His bonus last year was an Easter Egg. I kid you not. This for meeting production targets. The Salaried managers got cash, some in very large lumps. Wage slave morale adjusted accordingly.<br>Right now farmers (the investor class) are being paid below the cost of production, while the management are claiming they made a record profit. Some of the more cynical observers are suggesting the profit is an illusion designed to deliver contractual bonus payments to the managers.<br>Debt levels in the industry are high, and the salaried mangers have been talking up the industry through a period of supply shortage and good prices, which has now been over corrected due to a big increase in European production co-incidental with the removal of subsidies and the Russian embargo. There has been a recent purge of an excessively bloated management structure, but within my brothers part of the organisation there are still a number of individuals whose role remains a complete mystery.<br><br>Those who do the real work and take the real risks get shafted while the salaried class collect their salaries, benefits, perks and make the decisions about who gets what. <br><br><br><a href=#c2614951678462534168 title="comment permalink">4/29/16, 1:05 AM</a><br><br>

Congratulations !<br>This is one of the media that have made me realize how different the USA can be from Europe... and why reality here has never been like what we are used to seeing on TV or in movies.<br>But I get the weird idea that, for most of the people living in the USA right now, reality is just as different from what is shown on the glossy screens.<br>And yet at the same time, this blog manages to, both at once, feel so American and somehow always hit home with its insights.<br>On some deeper levels, we are two Christian industrial societies, with all the common particularities that it entails behind the divergent pathes we took across History.<br>The more you talk about America, and the more I feel how different and yet how so similar we both are.<br><br> Regarding this week's post, and the magic mountain, I guess it boils down to one simple factor : actual physical proximity between members of different classes do enable the priviledged to not just empathize with but also participate in the other classes' daily lives. And human nature being what it is, that participation can manifest just as a scornful attitude, or just as mundane help.<br>What is gnawing at the social fabric like moths on a rampage is the isolation programmed by the arrangements of daily life. The car culture has done that to perfection. The consumer culture has also managed to insulate the primary economy from the rest of society.<br>This tendancy to abstraction is also driven by the logic of the wealth pump : isolate externalities elsewhere far away.<br>A society where the ressources needed to create that isolation are dwindling away is a society where sooner or later all classes of society have to walk elbow to elbow. This is what happened in World Wars and the military, to some limited extent. A common idea here is that our mandatory military service period has at least that advantage, that even if it proved often a waste of time for people (like, guarding clothlines under the rain), at least it provided people from a broad range of social backgrounds an opportunity to socialize and live alongside on a daily basis.<br>We'll see how this plays out in terms of social dynamics.<br>But the simple idea of rubbing shoulders with the lower class provides a simple, practical and meaningful concrete first step towards LESS, for those who are too afraid of the idea of an integral lifestyle change.<br><br><a href=#c3073183682990443250 title="comment permalink">4/29/16, 2:13 AM</a><br><br>

With 4.5 million whites out of 55 million total, the government will be African for the foreseeable future.<br><br>The "previously disadvantaged", to use a popular term, now control the government, the treasury, the civil service, the police, the defense force, the law courts, the education system, most municipalities, and the many state-owned enterprises like the railways, the harbors, the airports, South African Airways, the national electrical utility Eskom, the Post Office and telecommunications backbones, and access to mining rights, fishing rights, and many other rights.<br><br>In short, it was a genuine handover of power from a dominant to a subordinate group.<br><br>And the result? Actually, not much has changed, to the dismay of many radical lefties.<br><br>A few Africans cosied up to the big corporations and became very wealthy. Others have gained wealth through government contracts of dubious legality (the "tenderpreneurs"). Many thousands have advanced through secure government jobs. There are now more blacks than whites in the middle class.<br><br>The government has built more than a million homes, tarred streets, provided electricity and water connections, and vastly increased pensions* and welfare payments. <br><br>In business, there are affirmative action programs, racial quotas, and preferential tender rates. Entry-level jobs like store clerk, bank teller, and receptionist, which thirty years ago were all white, now are overwhelmingly staffed by black people.<br><br>So Africans have made huge strides. Yet if you listen to talk radio, especially late at night, you will hear a parade of Africans complaining that nothing has changed. Because whites still live in the nice suburbs and hold the top jobs. Because the privilege of a good education, inherited assets, and very few indigent family members needing support, allow whites to get and keep a larger proportion of their income, despite black and white earning equal salaries.<br><br>And the lesson from this?

I was not planning to comment as I'm not home and don't know if I'll have trouble posting. I wanted to respond to what RogerCO said at 11:34 pm. After reading Rebalancing the World and Daniel Quinn's stuff and also Jane Goodall, I've come to the opinion that Roger is correct. I do get a bit tired of how people constantly think we are hardwired to behave as chimpanzees, although it is definitely down there! But - last common ancestor 12 million years and we have changed a lot. Democracy is the natural human value. It is done by pretty much all hunter-gatherer societies I have read about. Leadership is there, usually wisely chosen, but they do not have much brute power. And yes, voluntary redistribution of wealth is also a common feature. <br><br>So what happened? In my opinion it went wrong when we became civilized. Whether it is some kind of fall or just a growing process I am not sure. Whether there is hope that we will overcome it I am not sure. But I do note that with civilization, we have actually regressed away from democracy and now use actual chimpanzee bodily postures that (so far as I can tell) were jettisoned by the human race long ago. I am referring to kissing of hands, bowing and scraping before the alpha male, and also giving the alpha males right makes right power.<br><br>What causes people to regress? Some kind of emotional trauma. At least, when children and even adults are feeling very bad or insecure, they can regress to infantile behaviors. I am not sure if it was a bad transition to civilization itself, or a world trauma as I think occurred at the Younger Dryas, or both, or just an evolutionary process.<br><br><a href=#c8440587551651823295 title="comment permalink">4/29/16, 7:46 AM</a><br><br>

Unfortunately, I don't have references, but this is what I was hearing from people in the Russian Far East and from various -stan dwellers who were travelling around on business in Russia in the late 1990s. The USSR sent lots of adventurous young people out to the undeveloped periphery and they also allocated a lot of resources to getting nomadic tribes to settle into European-style communities and supporting them in a lifestyle that was not sustainable over the long term. When the USSR collapsed, that support ended. Enough of the tribespeople remembered how to live off-grid that a fair number of them just gathered up the reindeer, shrugged and went back to their traditional ways, a few have tried to make a stand in their modernized digs by attracting in adventure tours, and quite a number took to alcohol and other forms of suicide.<br><br>I haven't been back there in over a decade, but my impression is that aside from restoring pensions and making businesses more viable by reining in some of the worst corruption, they have not allocated resources to the periphery like they did when it was a social ideal. Certainly they extracted resources from the periphery. One example I know of is a mine in southern Buryatia that closed when the USSR imploded because it was economically unsustainable. The workers were left on their own, and continued mining the ore, producing the metal (I forget which) and trying to sell it, with individuals averaging about a dollar a day for their efforts.

This entire series on the dialogue around privilege has been informative and fascinating for me. <br><br>Recently I've been struggling with homelessness mediated by my substantial class privilege. This has amounted to me staying with a friend in Western Massachusetts for some time as well as my family in Eastern Mass. My situation is complicated by having just gotten a job in the western part of the state. This relates to the Magic Mountain part of the discussion - my parents, having wealth, means that I can buy things light fruit trees, herbs and whatnot and plant them all around their property. I do a lot of public plantings in Western Massachusetts, but never have any budget, it is incredible to just talk my family and then buy three peach trees and plant them that day! What a difference from working at farms for plant credit, or transplanting nettles and elder from the woods! I've been meaning to get solomon's seal for over a year now. Today I went to the garden store and bought half dozen plants and put them in a shady part of the lawn. In a few years I'll have amply root stock to propagate far and wide. This is unspeakably thrilling to me.<br><br>While I acknowledge the problematic ways my family lives, at least some of their wealth can be used to make a little cushion on the way down the magic mountain. Also, I'm excited to be connecting with the neighbors! One family is Jewish and I'm carpooling with them tonight to Shabbat, which is so, so exciting for me. I'm excited to connect more with my neighbors and am interested to go to a new synagogue. Relatedly, my friend I've been staying with in western mass and I had a radical Seder where we had nettles and yellow dock root as part of our maror and and discussed food justice (globally, "the bread of affliction" is the food of the poor and exploited. it is white rice, tortillas and frybread.) and examined our privilege. We also been having an ongoing conversation about tzedakah and tikkun olam and how that informs and motivates us to donate our time and energy towards public planting of edible and medicinals as well as doing plant walks, herbal workshops and other education to help empower people to have the tools to get on the LESS train. We are, of course, concerned about the larger fall from the mountain and wish to help cushion the collective. Given the political situation here in the states that may turn out to be impossible, but I'd rather go down planting!!<br><br><a href=#c4768691844032039008 title="comment permalink">4/29/16, 10:24 AM</a><br><br>

Since you are thinking about exercising the Right to Return, make sure the conversion ceremony is performed by an Orthodox rabbi; if it's performed by a rabbi from a more liberal denomination, the PTB in Israel might not recognize it as valid.<br><br>Expect to have to undergo a part time course of study for up to a year before being permitted to convert. That is a good idea as you need to know what you are signing up for and what you are leaving behind. Expect the rabbi to question you very closely about your motives for seeking conversion and to try to talk you out of it. These are just the dragons at the temple gate. Feel free to rabbi-shop if you live in a place where there is a selection. Rabbis, including Orthodox rabbis, differ enormously in temperament, senses of humor, and what they think is important.<br><br>If it turns out that your Jewish blood is on your father's side of the family, you might have to undergo conversion anyway before making aliyah, because Orthodoxy only counts matrilineal descent.<br><br>If you were to make aliyah (emigrate as a Jew: literally means "go up"), the Israeli government will send you to Hebrew immersion school (Ulpan) for free. But Israel is a very different place than the U.S. and I don't advise burning your bridges until you have lived there a while and know you can handle it.<br><br><a href=#c4250451092100070762 title="comment permalink">4/29/16, 10:37 AM</a><br><br>

But this posting has really shaken my tree so to speak. I never thought of myself as ‘privileged’ even though before retirement I was a member of the Salary Class or was for the last half of my working life. I was a member of the Wage Class prior to that. And now I find that I am not only a member of the 1% but am living on top of the mountain of privilege. It has been a difficult shift in perspective and consciousness. <br><br>On the positive side my anger at those I perceived as affluent and privileged has dissipated. It is hard to remain angry at a group after finding that I am a member of that group. Now I have only disgust at my own blindness and pity for fellow members of this group. The evidence was always right in front of me but I chose to ignore it. <br><br>However I don’t think I will be ‘staying on the mountain’ so to speak much longer. The pension fund that is 75% of my income is in trouble and I doubt it will survive the next financial impact which I feel is not far off. After that I will make what ever accommodations I need to the changed circumstances. Or I will perish. Neither options particularly disturbs me.

As for central heating and so on, you'll notice I said 'at the moment'. I've never had AC in Canada, but that isn't essential up here. Not having window screens in a basement suite can be a problem due to rodents as well as mosquitoes, and yes, we do get mosquitoes in Canada. <br><br>Since the building was full of holes, the rodents got in anyway no matter what I did with the windows. The squirrels were sort of funny, but the rats were too much, especially since their droppings kept falling out of the ceiling on the fridge and the kitchen counter. I couldn't afford to move out of my parents' basement (and yes, they did charge rent for much of this time even if it was low), and they were unwilling to set traps in case of harming squirrels, so I stuck up plastic with tape to keep them out of food prep areas, and was super careful to keep all food in rodent-proof containers. The stove didn't work so I had a hot plate and a toaster oven that couldn't be used at the same time without blowing a breaker. It worked, mostly. The rodent problems went on for many months, until they started having mouse problems upstairs.<br><br>Heating is a much bigger deal than AC here. I've always had some form of heat, but sometimes it has been pretty sketchy. This is a problem at -9C. I got problems with the windows freezing shut, frequent chillblains off the concrete floor, and the cold aggravating my fibromyalgia symptoms. There were also mold issues inaccessible behind the shower, but at least it had a working shower.<br><br>I was pretty glad to have a roof over my head, and pretty scared of losing it.<br><br>I've never had a car, and I'm not planning on it.<br><br>The place where I am now is better than the place I described.

I can truly say that your essays, and the wide ranging dialogue among the commenting community have greatly influenced the way I live my life, in material and immaterial ways.<br><br>Re privilege: yes, always a constant in every society; in some societies manifested by status rather than material goods. Loved the magic mountain trope: it reminds me that these days, privilege includes being able to live in places where the air is reasonably clean, water drinkable: petcoke is not being piled up near by, nor is the new trucking facility with the resultant poisonous diesel particulate matter located next to the neighborhood elementary school.<br><br>I confess to being a little surprised that the discussion of privilege is considered controversial and something kept quiet. Maybe this is because I know a few community activists in Chicago working to improve their neighborhoods, and it's very clear the power and privilege structures they are dealing with. Very out in the open, you might say. On both sides. Also, it seems to me that anyone discussing income inequality, from Thomas Pikkety to the Occupy folks to the Fight for Fifteen movement, to academic analyses of the effect of wealth on US policy and law and much else, have more-or-less been talking about this for a few years now--but it's really, finally, at last coming out into the open with this election cycle. I look forward to reading the continued discussion in this space.<br><br>To me, privilege partly involves a level of material and emotional security, if not great financial wealth--enough food, clothing and decent shelter, a fair amount of personal safety plus a resilient family structure and some personal freedom. (These are things in increasingly short supply, of course, hence the uproar.)<br><br>By these terms my upbringing was privileged. We children were taught that "the world does not owe you a living" and "from those to whom much is given, much is expected." Giving back to the community was expected and we were required to learn practical skills as well as do well at book learning. We were also taught to treat everyone with respect, not just members of our own class. Ethics and integrity were always more important than financial success. Frugality was a virtue. I never <i>didn't</i> have an awareness of the role of privilege (and the complexities implied by the term). Now that I think about it, it was, even then, a very old-fashioned way to be brought up. <br><br>Yet my husband and I have raised our own children the same way. <br><br>My own writing has been deeply influenced by the archdruid's, as in my latest post <a href=http://www.resilience.org/stories/2016-04-28/ethics-and-ecosystem-interactions-why-reconciliation-ecology-matters rel=nofollow>Ethics and Ecosystem Interactions</a> .<br><br><a href=#c3992997378924058911 title="comment permalink">4/29/16, 11:16 AM</a><br><br>

Here's a quote from one of the posts, with a link. The linked post contains further links to the other essays. As Bardi indicates, there was definitely a privileged class. <br><br>"We tend to see a steady state economy as something very similar to our society, only a bit quieter. But Edo Japan was very different. Surely it was not paradise on earth. It was a highly regulated and hierarchical society where it would have been hard to find - perhaps even to imagine - such things as "democracy" or "human rights". Nevertheless, the Edo period was a remarkable achievement; a highly refined and cultured society. A society of craftsmen, poets, artists and philosophers. It created some of the artistic treasures we still admire today; from the katana sword to Basho's poetry."<br><br>http://cassandralegacy.blogspot.com/2016/04/the-cuckoo-that-wont-sing.html<br><br><a href=#c6959950736775041962 title="comment permalink">4/29/16, 11:30 AM</a><br><br>

There was increasing demand for feed for livestock and what was missing was a capacity for corn growing. (Corn production however has increased recently after 2000 – see the next link.)

As someone mentioned, it is a process of 1-3 years. Circumcision is still required for men. They will not do a conversion to someone who is married to a non-Jew who is not also converting. Either the whole immediate family converts or you're ineligible.<br><br>However, if you make aliyah and your conversion is not with an orthodox Rabbi (and even if it is with a modern orthodox rather than an ultra orthodox rabbi in some cases) your conversion will not be recognized by the Rabbinate. One of the reasons I'm not interested in moving there is that my husband is a conservative convert. That means the Israeli Rabbinate would not consider us married, would not consider him Jewish, would not allow him to be buried in a Jewish cemetery, etc. <br><br>There is a difference between having the right of return, which anyone with a Jewish grandparent or a conversion with any branch of Judaism is legally entitled to have, and actually being legally considered a Jew for family court purposes once you reach Israel. The family courts (births, adoptions, Jewish status, marriages, divorces, and burials) are all under the control of the ultra orthodox and they do not tolerate non-orthodox conversions for any reason, nor families that have been secular or atheist. And even if your family has been practicing Judaism for generations, you have to have the right documentation, three generations worth at least, which is nearly impossible since the holocaust for many families. For a male convert married to a native born Jew, though, their kids would still be considered Jewish even if the marriage is nullified. <br><br>If they reject a woman's conversion, her kids are considered non-Jews even if they were born after her conversion, and her marriage to a native Jew is considered null and void (rather like Catholicism, which simply does not recognize state marriage certificates for Catholic parish members, or certificates from clergy from some other branch of Christianity).<br><br>So aliyah is not for the faint of heart. Even people born in Israel have this problem, not just immigrants. Thousands of young couples have to go out of the country to cyprus or greece to get married, because the state will recognize a marriage from abroad for tax purposes, inheritance, etc. But the Rabbinate will not. <br><br>There are groups fighting this monopoly on status rulings, of course, but as long as the political situation requires other parties to work with the UO, nothing substantial is ever going to change.<br><br><a href=#c9078322152144985291 title="comment permalink">4/29/16, 3:39 PM</a><br><br>

Seems enrollment has fallen for the last couple of years or more at most such schools. It's become more pronounced here in Illinois because of the budget crisis; state money to public institutions was abruptly cut off, and the less selective public schools are suffering seriously and furloughing faculty and staff. Chicago State, in the South Side ghettos, may fail entirely. The state government did recently get around to approving a fraction of the usual funding to the state universities for this fiscal year only, after letting them go without funding entirely for 10 months, but the future looks bleak.<br><br>As for the small private colleges, they had been playing a game of competitively raising tuition rates. People had been treating the college tuition "sticker price" as a sign of status. In the language of economics, tuition turned into a Veblen good: the demand curve ran in reverse, so that higher prices led to higher demand. Colleges that tried to cut tuition suffered losses and status and saw decreasing enrollment, so an arms race developed that made the bubble even more pronounced.<br><br>In fairness, the actual price to attend those colleges was usually considerably lower than advertised: most students would get at least some "financial aid" from the colleges in the form of grants, offsetting some of the sticker price increases. The rest was of course made up of loans. So they raised prices dramatically, but offered rebates for some of it once they were in.

The most obvious of the former is birth, but it gets more complex for the latter. During exigent circumstances, like war, a portion of previously unprivileged peoples are granted temporary privileges. Citizens become soldiers and are treated accordingly, at least until the war ends. Those temporary privileges can certainly become permanent, but it isn't necessarily so. <br><br>That's what makes the rise of charismatic leaders so dangerous for the current set of privileged, because the first order of business is rearranging the distribution of privileges in a way more favourable to the charismatic leader. The change is permanent. <br><br>This also opens up an interesting option for the commoners. During periods of social upheaval it becomes very possible for commoners to increase their privilege by a) organizing with other commoners to create a new circle of privilege, or b) use their particular skills sets to bargain for more privileges.<br> <br>Regards,<br><br>Varun<br><br><a href=#c1882996865260377114 title="comment permalink">4/29/16, 3:54 PM</a><br><br>

The great twelfth century Rabbi Mosheh ben Maimon, aka Maimonides, who was born in Spain and died in Egypt when those places were ruled by Muslims, wrote something called the Golden Ladder of Charity.<br><br>http://www.panix.com/~jjbaker/rmbmzdkh.html<br><br>Rambam ranked the various ways of giving charity according to how much they spared the dignity of the recipient. Giving someone charity in such a way that the giver does not know who the recipient is, and the recipient knows who gave but does not have to look them in the face and ask, is ranked above the middle. Giving grudgingly and only when asked is at the bottom and arranging for someone to have a job so they can support themselves is at the top.<br><br>In Maimonides' time and place, Muslim and Jewish scholars (and a few Christians) studied and discussed religious matters together.

I found Quinn's books specious -- it's long been fashionable for people in complex societies to fantasize that people in technologically simpler societies are paragons of virtue, without any of the social problems of more complex cultures. Anthropological research doesn't happen to bear that out, but the fantasy remains. Democracy, far from being natural to human beings, is fairly rare; it has to be constructed and then guarded against any number of forces that tend to tear it down, and history shows that eventually every democracy falls. The tendency on the left to insist that democracy is somehow automatic in human beings is a core reason why leftist groups are so bad at democratic process -- they don't grasp the fact that democracy doesn't come naturally and thus requires constant maintenance, so you get government by clique or an endless series of quarrels that end up tearing the group to shreds. <br><br>Phil, thank you for this!

For some reason all the alliums are going ape in the garden this year, and I have a veritable forest of garlic, courtesy of your bulbs. (Yum.) Many thanks!<br><br>Adrian, thank you. Privilege is like sex -- if it's openly discussed it can be dealt with in a healthy manner that avoids a lot of problems; if it's kept in the closet and treated as a taboo subject, things can get very twisted indeed. <br><br>Pygmycory, you're most welcome. <br><br>Bob, there I disagree. Debt is simply a system of arbitrary tokens that are used to manage the distribution of actual goods and services. It could be replaced with a different system of tokens -- say, metal-based currency -- and once the turmoil of the transition was over, things would go on more or less as they had been. Crucially, the choice of a token system doesn't affect the two pillars I discussed -- the global dominance of the US and the reckless consumption of natural resources -- as these could both function under any system of tokens you care to name. <br><br>Yinyura, I think it would have to be "regno" rather than "regnum" because, unless my memory plays me false, the object of "sine" takes the ablative. <br><br>Brian, hmm!

I've been called a lot of things but gutless isn't one of them. I've said it before and I'll say it again: If I'm gonna die poor and in the street, it might as well be in the homeland as here. And, if I can take a knife meant for a Sabra, all the better. I must have some kind of knack for languages because the Army sorted out me and this other guy, and we went into this room where they taught us, saparately, a "synthetic language". We came out and conversed in this language. I can glottal-stop with the best of Polynesians, and as far at the ckhckhckhckhckhckh thing yeah can do that too. I am "ami" in Hebrew, how cool is that? Oh, I'll answer: Very cool. I know about ulpan, but plan to have a fair amount of Hebrew under my belt before I ever get there. Look up the "Aleph Beis Song" on YouTube and never underestimate the power of a rabbi with a guitar. It's a good way to learn the Hebrew alphabet for Anglos.<br><br><a href=#c7325635094114848294 title="comment permalink">4/29/16, 7:32 PM</a><br><br>

Forget the idiotic film whose only resemblance is its title, the book itself talks a lot about how societies have to make radical changes downwards in order to survive. The US Army is reorganized into something resembling a Civil War-era army; former 'cubicle mice', casting directors, copyright lawyers and the like have to go to classes to learn real life skills from what were their former peon servants and tradesmen whose prospect frightens some more than the zombies themselves. Eternal privileges associated with whole classes of people vapourise as a rock-solid way of life ceases to exist - you get the idea.<br> Any chance, by the way, of down the track doing a post on education? Not on how it stands at the moment (there is too many fish in that particular barrel to be shot at) but on how it should be done for our generation onward in order for us to cope with a centuries-long contracting economy and lifestyle. I keep on thinking that it may resemble a 19th century style of education but that may be simply a lack of imagination on my part.<br><br><a href=#c2995522330830671596 title="comment permalink">4/29/16, 7:35 PM</a><br><br>

Anthropological research doesn't happen to bear that out, but the fantasy remains. Democracy, far from being natural to human beings, is fairly rare; it has to be constructed and then guarded against any number of forces that tend to tear it down, and history shows that eventually every democracy falls. The tendency on the left to insist that democracy is somehow automatic in human beings is a core reason why leftist groups are so bad at democratic process -- they don't grasp the fact that democracy doesn't come naturally and thus requires constant maintenance, so you get government by clique or an endless series of quarrels that end up tearing the group to shreds…”<br><br>In most discussions with people, I observe an oversimplification of complex situations. That one mentioned, I find in all talk about how people will live together in changed circumstances. Even, I saw, it doesn’t matter, which ideology one is accompanied with. Them speculating, how their ideal society will flourish, but generally what hinders in every day life is ignored and kind of fairy-tale happy ending context be imagined. So left-wing thinkers just sadly ridicule their idealistic approach, by even starting in their actual gatherings, not so seldom them cliquing together and tear one another apart in endless series of quarrels.<br><br>What I see is, that a council debate need skills more complex. Easier it is, for a person with unenlightened self-interest, to push oneself with force into a group. The strongest is going to be followed for a time automatically indeed. So, if there is no space and resources, to build up the know-how, needed for group leading, single leaders are the evolutionary preferred first choice. They need much less knowledge and assistance to work. Therefore they can easier succeed.<br><br>However, I would not agree, that in history, democratic towns, city-states and confederacies, as history shows eventually falling. You could easily twist the argument around and say, history shows that eventually every dictatorship falls.<br><br>Instead I see human societies being quite complex fabrics. Them oscillating between the extreme positions of organizing themselves from only single leadership to total equal group leading. GMG, do not fall into the trap of over-simplifying now the opposite position. I see your assumption of democracy being automatic, as false. Neither so is autocratic rule automatic or even the major ruling body. In my view it’s a mixed intermingled dynamic, whipping from one state to another back and from. Complex and complicated.<br><br>Giving historical example; As a catholic Christian I see the church’s community structures over the last 2000 years. Whereas orders do have a mixed processing of decision-making. From choosing leading figures to functionaries there is a mixture at work from majority vote, over consensual agreement to abbot decisions. Either or, they can all work hand in hand.<br><br>Giving contemporary example; Living-communities I visited or informed myself about in detail. They show either different ruling structures from consensual decision-making to leaders giving general or detailed instruction. Often over the time changing their ruling body in either direction is common. So it is a floating process. Never fixed eternally to one ruling body.<br><br>I agree, that people fantasize about simpler societies being free of the social problems of more complex cultures. Instead democracy has to be constructed and then guarded against any number of forces that tend to tear it down. History shows that eventually they are teared down. However they are build up again and again all over.<br><br>I disagree, that democracy is fairly rare. They are not on the verge of extinction. But there is an ongoing struggle between the ruling forces for dominance. Never one side is going to succeed forever!<br><br><a href=#c6837385016581496892 title="comment permalink">4/29/16, 10:52 PM</a><br><br>

The Murdoch media chose to side with the establishment and hyped the smearing of the 96 people, of all ages and backgrounds, who were literally crushed to death in overcrowded stands.<br>This week, a small victory has been chalked up against this class superiority behavior as the police force involved was found to have been at fault. This paves the way now for those who were in charge to be appropriately prosecuted for the actions, the subsequent defamation of the football fans, and hopefully perversion of the course of justice.<br>And whilst the whole of the media celebrates this long overdue victory, the press of the Murdoch empire remains steadfastly silent.<br>It is interesting how this microscosm of events in the world so perfectly illustrates everything that has been written about class in the last few weeks, and disturbing how much it pervaded, and continues to pervade, British society as it does in your descriptions of American society.<br>Perhaps, as you point out here, it is hard-wired into our behavioural nature.

It depends on whether most of their annual income comes from investments, on the one hand, or kleptocratic compensation packages on the other. "<br><br>I'm thinking along the same lines as Mister Roboto, this group is in some sense a Thing, even though it cuts across any particular definition of social class. For one thing, it's hard to make a clear distinction on the income source for many of them, since telephone number salaries are usually accompanied by generous share option schemes, and many senior executives can flit from engagement to engagement with varying balances of income. <br><br>Given this flexibility, my sense is that there is not a strong new/old money type distinction in this group, partly because their self-image promotes the ideas of leadership and entrepreneurship across the board. They also seem to be quite happy increasing each other's wealth considerably, whether derived from ownership or salary, and seem to have been very successful in massively increasing the gap between those at the top of organisations (whether owners or salaried executives) and their average employee.<br><br>This business and wealth elite also wield a great deal of concentrated power, either directly by their actions in small groups at the top of multinational corporations who can affect thousands of lives with the stroke of a pen, or through the intensive lobbying of governments and so on. Ties with influential people from the ranks of politics are further cemented with the revolving door syndrome where civil servants rotate between government jobs and private companies and consultancy firms, and elected politicians holding executive positions in organisations ("it keeps us connected to the real world").<br><br>For me, this seems to indicate a greater commonality of purpose and interest than is provided by the investment/salary distinction, and certainly sets them apart from the other members of those classes, like pensioners and lower-level functionaries.

Let's look at the constituent Soviet Republics themselves. Moldova, for example, fell into near anarchy during the 1990s. All those subsidies from Moscow were gone and their already modest standard of living gave way to massive poverty. Still, it was also one of the main suppliers of agricultural goods in the Soviet Union. And let's not even speak about Ukraine. <br><br>As for those "Eastern European freeloaders" - I can't speak for other countries, but Romania was basically pillaged in the 1940s and 1950s through "SovRoms:"<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SovRom<br><br>In 1958 the last Soviet troops left our country, unlike in most other Warsaw Pact members where they stayed until the Cold War was over. Most of what was consumed here was locally produced, and most of that want into exports by the 1980s, to pay off the country's foreign debt. And it was paid in full, at the expense of a severely impoverished population. Then, 1989 happened...<br><br>JMG, I'm watching your country's elections with much interest. Donald Trump has repeatedly said that he's willing to make a "new deal" with Russia, and that has significant implications for our region. Especially for those here who think that the U.S. is somehow obliged to spend millions of dollars on our security, just because we say so. I have serious doubts that he's willing to walk his talk though. He seems to have a long track record of saying one thing and doing the exact opposite. <br><br>Meanwhile, Russian jets keep making close approaches on U.S. military vessels in the Baltic Sea, while our prime minister wants a permanent NATO fleet in the Black Sea. I'm wondering for what, though? So that they can keep telling the Russians that they are "seriously concerned about their irresponsible actions?"

I'm being funny, people. Honestly!<br><br>Anyway, I heard that particular Russian tale at the recent funeral of my wife's uncle. The now deceased uncle was one of those guys that makes everyone else look bad as not only was he an architect, but he picked up languages easily, music had multiple degrees etc. Anyway, because of his age and the Cold War, he was fluent in Russian and also Spanish and a multitude of other languages as well as music all of which he achieved with a lot of work, but he also had a flair for making things look easy. A tough act to follow for sure.<br><br>So, the story that was told in the eulogy was that he travelled to Russia several decades ago and waited patiently in the line for customs to allow him entry into Russia. The person in the queue ahead of him was of Cuban origin. Clearly the customs person and the Cuban national were having some difficulties communicating and there was no love lost between the two people of different origins.<br><br>At that point the uncle stepped in and acted as a translator between the Russian customs guy and the Cuban national. The sentiments that I have read here in the comments above were also expressed by the Russian customs guy and that was a long time ago. The uncle diplomatically avoided mentioning those Russian concerns to the Cuban national and he merely translated the very basic administrative details which the Cuban national had to follow in order to enter the country. All was soon good and in order.<br><br>With that problem out of the way, the Russian customs agent apparently treated the now deceased uncle with courtesy and respect and allowed him into the country.<br><br>I can only relate that particular story as it was told to me a few months back.<br><br>My gut feeling about the concerns expressed in the previous comments was that investments can initially offer a good return before eventually souring and perhaps those people are referring to the end game and not the initial returns. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect an empire to expand for no gain because it simply costs real wealth and the adventures all have to produce a solid return, but eventually all investments fail. That’s entropy.<br><br>I suspect that you have attracted some very interesting customers in your readership! And the opinion-manufacture industry are also perhaps bored, suffering from extreme hubris and possibly looking for an edgy perspective? Certainly I have noticed several weird coincidences recently, but I'm prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt.<br><br>Oh yeah, whilst I'm writing about unmentionable topics. <br><br>This 1% meme really annoys me - and not from the perspective that you write as I totally agree - welfare is an effect of surplus wealth as is 401K's, tax breaks for the wealthy, superannuation, investment returns etc... It drives me bananas reading about that stuff because I've travelled to third world countries and I've seen how people live there. We really spend an inordinate amount of time outsourcing those responsibilities to someone or something else, because when people talk about food stamps as well as the rest of it, what they are actually saying is that someone or something else owes them a living. My understanding is that no one owes us a living and that distribution of wealth that we all enjoy in first world countries is certainly not being shared in other countries. I dunno, the whole thing seems very weird to me as if somehow we all got lost and ended up worrying about our entitlements instead of what we can offer and/or produce.

Without getting too elaborate, allow me simply to point out that the English word "sin" is a translation of the Greek "hamartia." The term literally means "missing the mark," as, for instance, when shooting an arrow at a target. <br><br>This way of conceptualizing sin differs fundamentally from that of Catholicism and Protestantism, and paves the way for a more flexible, less rigidly absolutistic practical and pastoral approach to human moral flaws. (Fundamental differences in the Eastern and Western Christian conceptions of Original Sin are also very important here, but too complicated to address within the confines of a blog comment.)<br><br>Second, there is currently an epic revolution going on with regard to this nexus of moral issues in the Roman Catholic Church. Pope Francis very recently released a new apostolic exhortation, Amoris Laetitia, in which he basically reverses the traditionally rigidly absolutistic Catholic condemnation of divorce and remarriage as simply a species of adultery.<br><br>The consequences of this development promise to be far-reaching and profound in their effects. Many traditionalist and conservative Catholics (not quite the same thing) feel profoundly betrayed by Pope Francis, and he is being widely (and correctly) accused of introducing Situation Ethics into the very heart of Catholic moral teaching. And Situation Ethics amounts, in essence, to an objectivist moral system that can be flexibly adapted to the nuances of particular circumstances - that is, it is "flexible" in the sense I think you are getting at, and not rigidly absolutistic. <br><br>At the same time, Situation Ethics is not a form of relativism, but merely recognizes that objective moral truth depends upon the unique and unrepeatable nuance associated with each particular and concrete moral circumstance. As such, all attempts to universalize the objective moral content of any given particular concrete situation into sweeping moral universals are bound to over-rigidify morality in the precise manner that is endemic to traditional Western Christianity in both its Catholic and Protestant forms.<br><br>One might say that, after over 1600 years of the rigid moral absolutism of the imperial papacy (which began with Pope Damasus in the late 4th century), Pope Francis has finally corrected the Catholic conception of sin to accord with the one that has been the truth all along - namely, the Eastern Christian conception of sin as captured by the root meaning of the term "Hamartia."<br><br>Pope Francis' recent Exhortation - indeed, his entire papacy to date - has also elicited an unprecedented crisis of authority within Catholicism. Pope Francis is leading the very people who take Catholic Magisterial authority seriously as an alleged mouthpiece of the Holy Spirit to begin harboring grave doubts about that particular faith conviction.

I found Quinn's books specious -- it's long been fashionable for people in complex societies to fantasize that people in technologically simpler societies are paragons of virtue, without any of the social problems of more complex cultures. Anthropological research doesn't happen to bear that out, but the fantasy remains. Democracy, far from being natural to human beings, is fairly rare; it has to be constructed and then guarded against any number of forces that tend to tear it down, and history shows that eventually every democracy falls. The tendency on the left to insist that democracy is somehow automatic in human beings is a core reason why leftist groups are so bad at democratic process -- they don't grasp the fact that democracy doesn't come naturally and thus requires constant maintenance, so you get government by clique or an endless series of quarrels that end up tearing the group to shreds. "<br><br>Human beings are social mammals, yes, and share some characteristics with them. I don't even think there are nonsocial primates. But when we use such phrases over and over, it tends to take away fresh thought. Human beings are quite a lot more than social primates, and as I said, 12 million years has wrought some important differences, language for one.<br><br>I think it is a very interesting topic. What are human beings and how has their evolution made them unique? I do not idolize non civilized human groups. I am sure that among them is great individuality and differences in thoughtfulness, kindness, and intelligence, just as with us. I've read about laziness, fecklessness, cruelty, even murder. And if it is a tenet of the left that democracy is natural to humans, I have never heard it. The thoughts I have about it are largely my own. When reading some things, the point was not about these topics directly. But I have noted that in reading about anthropological commentary, it is a repeatable tendency that while you have leaders and mild differences in status, there is not any absolute authority of the "Off with his head!" kind. When I read Jane Goodall I was struck with amazement when she wrote about the physical bodily postures that beta male chimps would adopt when submitting or afraid of an alpha. I immediately recognized that these are done to the pope and to kings, for example. And I wonder, did the native Americans ever display such postures? I am asking. Maybe they do. I find this significant. <br><br>I did find some aspects of Quinn's books unlikely, such as his supposition that the peoples of the American southwest simply decided to walk away from civilization. We now know that there was a drought cycle at that time which no doubt was the cause.<br><br>It would seem that the big problem humans have with maintaining democracy in the face of complexifying its society is mostly a problem of numbers. When you haveatribes in which all the elders know intimately the characters of the young adults, it is not hard to know whom to trust with what sort of responsibility and to largely prevent incompetent leadership. <br><br>I don't think I have any particular unrealistic hopes, since I find the human condition somewhat despair-inducing. But like you say, plenty of people lead very meaningful lives under all sorts of vicissitudes of history, and which I am doing. I DO wonder if perhaps we might eventually improve, integrate our tribal selves with our civilizational/intellectual selves and spiritual selves. <br><br><br><a href=#c2072231198253417786 title="comment permalink">4/30/16, 7:51 AM</a><br><br>

I've certainly had to release a lot of attachments concerning my priorities. That being said I've struggled with homelessness in one form or another my entire adult life. it does wear me out, but then again I'm an herbalist. For the past two months or so I've been taking eluthero tincture everyday and I've been watching with surprise and amazement as the dark circles under my eyes disappear - even with all this stress! Sarsaparilla helps me tone and coordinate my endocrine system and normalize energy levels. Lemon balm does me well to reduce my sympathetic excess (raised heart beat, sweaty palms etc), while peach leaf helps me come down, sleep, and deal with hot flashes. Of course, there are ample nettles, burdock, chickweed, cleavers and violet leaf currently which I take daily, which are excellent to ground me and build up my reserves. So while the stresses I'm experiencing aren't new my skills and coping mechanisms are much more refined and help me be more resilient.

But I continue to appreciate posts and comments alike (tho it might take me a week to read them all). I can certainly agree with the idea of clueless privilege - many of the poets I meet with are middle class (ie: they spend more monthly on clothes or books than I do on everything) and recently the vacation trips to Europe or wherever are interrupting our weekly poetry gatherings. I try and bite my tongue when these discussions are held. When I hear them complain about their problems, I sigh… I doubt any of them has a week’s water stored, and food seems to be mostly prepared meals (organic, of course). But I can’t hang around with the wage class, either – the ones I meet scorn literature and history (<i>useless!</i>) and are full of anger at the “lesser races” who have taken the jobs they honestly wouldn’t do (like lawns and picking the local crops). Pretty much only the Green Wizards combine economic simplicity with educational sophistication. So, thanks, and congratulations on 10 years of wonderful blogging!<br><br>One thought I’ve had a lot when people talk about “wealth” – many “undeveloped nations” have a real wealth of knowledge and living with Nature, and if we weren’t bleeding them dry, would probably be fine with their lives even if it amounts to “$2/day” because money isn’t how they judge wealth (that’s not talking about their rulers who have been truly poisoned by the Western idea of wealth and luxury). Chris Travers’ comments in this regard are very interesting. I’ve never travelled in the world, so I don’t know, but what I see in some videos is a different kind of wealth and access to basics than we have. Of course, climate change is causing disasters in many places, and if we weren’t stealing their resources to fix our climate change crises, we’d be in almost as bad shape as them!<br> <br>And to the commenters talking around the “privilege” of the lower US classes, remember also that for now it’s extremely expensive to live here (I see you’ve acknowledged that in comments, JMG). I was astounded when I shopped at a large chain the other day (I rarely go in them) – it seems that even the cut-rate store prices have jumped and “basics” are incredibly spendy! So – for now, it’s tricky to simplify. And I say that as someone who’s now below that 1% mark JMG postulated. For some services, it’s all or nothing – you have the money to live in a house or apt (with the first/last, utilities, appliances – can’t keep food in a window cooler there! – etc.) or you’re on the street; and that is expensive too, unless you want to lay down and die. As someone else mentioned: <i> It's ironic that downsizing seems to me to be difficult when you don't have the money to do so.</i> I agree – that’s what I’m running into. <br><br>As an aside, I can’t believe you introduced the whole spaghetti sauce meme without a shout out to the Pastafarians! LOL! The Flying Spaghetti Monster may be all that can save us! And just in case folks thought Oregonians weren’t weird… um… fun-loving, I was following a license plate yesterday: “THULU” – couldn’t fit the C, but we get it.<br><br>I had a nice visit recently from a fellow Green Wizard who’s been reading this blog for years but says he’s never commented. William, I think you should comment – your statements were insightful and I think you can contribute. It’s fun here in the comments section! :-) <br><br><br>From an older topic, re: that it might be helpful to envision the world’s issues other than in non-fiction, I’ll be having a full-length book of poems published in October, entitled <i>Elegy For the 21st Century</i>, including one of the best poems (I think) I’ve ever written, “The Love Song of G Dubya Bushwack” – with apologies to T.S. Eliot.<br><br>Thanks again for 10 years (I've been reading for 9).<br><br><a href=#c6998527468783616094 title="comment permalink">4/30/16, 12:48 PM</a><br><br>

Those who do not learn from history..."<br><br>The Hungarian-American historian John Lukacs has argued that the main motivating emotion of the radical Left is fear, while the main motivating emotion of the radical Right is hate. He argues that fear, while it can produce acts of aggression and persecution (as in Stalinist Russia and Maoist China), tends to produce a defensive and reactive mindset. He argues that even the brutality of Marxist regimes is motivated more by a desire to do unto their enemies (real and imagined) before their enemies can do unto them.<br><br>By contrast, he argues that hate is an emotion that is easily transmuted into a lust for revenge, power and conquest and therefore is a more powerful motivator for those who seek power.<br><br>"Where the right seeks allies, the left seeks scapegoats, and glories in how many people they can alienate from their cause. You mention that white women and gay men are now being lined up in front of the circular firing squad; white woman and gay men have been significant constituencies of support for the left. How effective of a coalition do you think they can build when it's gotten to the point that, say, only disabled lesbian women of color are welcome in progressive circles?"<br><br>Eric Hoffer notes in "The True Believer" that when we hate someone, our first instinct is to look for allies. I think Lukacs distinction makes sense here when combined with Hoffer's insight, while the left's tendency to look for scapegoats and call out those on their own side who are suspected of being insufficiently pure could be explained as an instinct that stems from fear, just like Lukacs argues.<br><br>It's worth noting that while the Left continues to engage in the sort of circular firing squad behavior we have been discussing on the other blog and has been busy alienating key allies like gay men, white women and Jews, the radical right in many countries has been reaching out to those same groups.<br><br>Figures on the far right in Europe like Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders have been reaching out to the gay community over concerns about the homophobic tendencies of Islamic fundamentalists and the sharp increase in gay bashing in European cities with large Muslim immigrant populations. There was a recent poll that showed if national elections in France were held tomorrow, more than half of France's gay population would vote for the Front National. <br><br>It's worth noting there are a number of leading figures on the far right, like Jack Donovan, who are openly gay and this also makes it easier for the far right to reach out to the gay community as the Left turns on gay men.<br><br>Likewise, the explosion in rapes and other acts of sexual violence directed against non-Muslim women in European cities with large Muslim immigrant populations and the refusal of the senile elites in the EU to even admit the problem exists, much less deal with it, is driving white women into the hands of the far right. Every time an atrocity like Cologne or Rotherham happens and every time the left insists that those who object (including rape victims who come forward) are racist and Islamophobic by definition, it increases the appeal of the radical right to white women. <br><br>Figures like Wilders and groups like the English Defense League have also been reaching out to Europe's Jewish community, again using concerns about Muslim immigration and Islamic fundamentalism to built alliances. Wilders has established himself as an outspokenly pro-Israel politician who spent time living in a Kibbutz as a young man and emphasizes his ties to right wing Israeli politicians like Avigdor Liebermann and Natan Sharansky, while the EDL has a Jewish Division.<br><br><a href=#c8679267597989615722 title="comment permalink">4/30/16, 12:58 PM</a><br><br>

They, or their family might even own the land containing the garden. A hundred and fifty years ago, more people in the US were self-employed than they are now.

Then again, it might also be that I'm a bit tone deaf to descriptions of societies, because 'Gone with the Wind' came with a similar feeling - engaging, even relateable characters, but a baffling and almost obtuse society.<br><br>On the subject of privilege, I find it interesting that I am far more open to acknowledging my privilege as someone born in the West than as a member of the western middle class. I suspect it's a combination of my privilege as a born Canadian being much more apparent and the dialogue around that privilege being much less acrimonious. Even though my privilege as a white male is never as apparent as when I travel abroad, I've yet to meet someone on these travels who feels entitled to attack me simply for having it. A side effect of the western 'no privilege here' mindset perhaps.<br><br>It's much easier to develop a sense of noblesse oblige when the people one has an advantage over aren't being reflexively belligerent.

Where you stand on the social ladder isn't purely a matter of class, or race, or gender, or annual income, or what have you; it's all of these things taken together. My discussion of salary class and wage class is largely a way to point to a division that public discussion in America has generally ignored in recent decades -- a division that seems to be having a huge impact on our current national politics just at the moment. <br><br>Alex, I'll be discussing all that as we proceed. <br><br>Ursachi, that was what I heard. Clearly there are two very different sets of claims in circulation here, and it may take quite a bit of digging to extract the facts. As for the US elections, I don't imagine anybody knows what Trump would do, not even Trump! I suspect much of the enthusiasm for him comes from the fact that everyone knows exactly what Clinton would do: her foreign policy is identical to that of George W. Bush, and we all know how well that turned out. <br><br>Cherokee, worrying about access to the gravy train is a common occupational hazard of living in an imperial society with plenty of tribute flowing in from conquered provinces. It'll be a while before it sinks in that the gravy train has run off the tracks...<br><br>Nestorian, yes, I've heard that about Eastern Orthodox morality before. That said, the point I was trying to make wasn't a distinction between absolutism and flexibility, but between the sources of moral knowledge. Is a moral choice a matter of knowing and following a set of moral laws, rigid or otherwise, handed down by a deity? Or is it a matter of balancing the claims of often incompatible virtues in a situation where no choice can ever be without its downsides and its reasonable alternatives? The concept of <i>hamartia</i> presupposes that there's a single target at which to aim, and from which divergence can be measured in some sense -- but what if ethics is conceived, as it was by Aristotle and Plotinus, not as hitting a target but as carving a statue -- starting with the rough block of ordinary human behavior and shaping it in accordance with a sense of proportion and virtue until it becomes something great? At that point we're in a wholly different world. <br><br>With regard to the situation in the Catholic Church, you're quite right -- a major watershed is approaching. The terrain on the far side hasn't yet been determined, but I suspect some of it will be very rough indeed. <br><br>Onething, as I see it, what 12 million years and the development of reflective consciousness have done for humanity, in political terms, is that we aren't forced to accept the baboon model of social organization. Most of us do, most of the time, but under the right circumstances, with a lot of hard work, we can have something like democracy instead. We didn't stop being animals, or mammals, or social primates, when we became human -- humanity is a fragile, unstable, bug-ridden but spectacularly creative layer over the top of the firm foundation of the animal, that allows us to modify that foundation in certain ways, under certain circumstances, for a while. You're right that this is a very interesting topic!<br><br>Violet, glad to hear it. We've got a patch of Solomon's Seal three feet by four feet in the back yard now -- that was one plant with two stems when I got it five years ago, and now it's a junior forest. And nettles, burdock, chickweed, cleavers, and violet all grow there too, which makes me feel as though I'm on the right track. ;-)<br><br>Nancy, no off topic at all. Is Ran still around? It's been a while since his essays were all over the peak oil scene. <br><br>DaShui, a classic example of noblesse oblige. No, you wouldn't see Elon Musk or Bill Gates doing anything of the kind!<br><br>Mustard, funny. <br><br>Jeanne, that or the sound of water gurgling on the lower decks...<br><br><a href=#c5642617283149731477 title="comment permalink">4/30/16, 7:42 PM</a><br><br>

You must live middle-class or live in the street. I've met people living in the street who had a retirement income of maybe a grand a month, but could not find a place to stay. I think I hooked up one guy, a Navy vet, with services, at least I don't see him on his regular sleeping bench any more. Another guy, another Navy vet, was toyed around with by the "helpful" agencies but he's given up. The city of San Jose has 7000-odd people sleeping on the street on any given night. <br><br>Bob (farmer?) McGregor please don't hit Peter Rabbit with the rake! Anyway, yes, there are different kinds of poor. Most people will not panhandle, and even less people will come up with cat toys, coffee-bean bracelets, ojos de dios, bundles of rosemary, or finally, "awareness" ribbons, all hustled with a fine line of patter. Pretty much, being self-employed at the survival level is illegal in the US. A thing out where I live is the illegal temale seller, who will be in a parking lot of a large store and will say to you as you walk by, "temales-temales" and if you are smart, you buy some because they are good. But they get busted regularly. Thou Shalt Work Corporate Or Else. <br><br>Yellow Submarine - You guys need to find your present-day Martel The Hammer because you need him.<br><br>Shane W. - I lived in Gilroy California for a few years and it's a "Mexican" town, and since I am somewhat tan I blend in, gringo enough for the gringos and moved with zero friction in the most "Mexican" areas, so people confided in me: Mexicans are going home. I was once at a huge garage sale, a large Mexican family had been financed what's essentially a mansion, and now the economy was crashing, and they were selling off everything, they even had a AGA stove. They looked very bewildered. Deer-in-the-headlights look. Just one family of many; at least in Mexico they have some kind of family; US society is atomized and it's every man for himself. Even against your own family. I lived on a "permaculture" place there in Gilroy but what essentially happened is, like Dan'l Boone, I "settled the wilderness" (the place was kinda messy) and now all these other people live there and as I perceive it, fighting like cats in a sack. But I got by on very little money there; one year I calculate I only made $1500 cash money.

Very insightful post as usual<br><br>As another commentator pointed out, to own a social privilege is not a human feature, in most of the human history, as an specie, the humans beings have no privileged social status; of course they are not equal, but there were not abstract contracts or any coercion that allow a privilege system to exist and last, as is the case of the hunters-gatherers, where the anthropologist cannot see clear social or status differences between them<br><br>It is with the "cereals kingdom" in Middle East, Center America an Far East, where the easy accumulated and durable grains of wheat, corn and rice allow them to be used as money and then be managed by the few as taxes and/or debt as a way to shackle people, in order to built complex civilizations, which are essentially privilege systems<br>Also the militarized chiefdom has a privileged system based on coercion and force from an aristocratic class<br><br>In a gift economy, as those of the hunter-gatherers, who receive more is who give more, and "more for you is more for me", because every person is inside the "gift circle". The best hunter as no reason to allow the meat of the hunted animal to be rot, to "accumulated" it, but to "make a gift" to the others, as a mean to receive good gifts from them in the future.

So, if my neighbour has a leg broken, in a gift economy both he and I lose because there are less “gifts” in circulation; but in a monetary economy I keep a “competitive advantage” over him and I can have more metal pieces than him, so I am richer. That is the way a competitive system is always associated to a monetary system based on scarcity and the progressive destruction of the bonds in the group<br><br>The same way was used by all colonial system in the world, the first act of Julio Cesar in Galia was the tax “pro-vincae” (“for the defeated” in latin), as a way the conquered people pay the army that subjugated them, and at the same time allow the same worthless metal pieces to be used in abstract markets as a “universal means of exchange” that allow even more worthless metal pieces (coins and debt) to be poured into the system to sustain and increase the privilege of a few romans. <br><br>Now USA issues the main part of the money globally in circulation, so all of us pay an “imperial tax” (“seniorage”), because we are provinces (“pro-vincae”) of it.

The concept of hitting a mark, or else missing it to varying degrees, applies to a chisel just like it does to an arrow. The sculpture that results after a lifetime of chiseling is either maximally exquisite or not - again, to varying degrees - depending upon the sum total of on- or off-the-mark chiseling that has gone into it.<br><br>As for the sense of proportion that makes the resulting chiseled statue something great, in the Christian tradition, that ideal is referred to under the rubric of holiness, or sanctity. That has been my personal ideal of moral striving for a quarter century - virtually my entire adult life. In principle, that way of conceptualizing a moral ideal is not incompatible either with the modality that I think you have in mind (correct me if I am wrong) - namely, one rooted in Aristotelian virtue ethics. <br><br>The major difference between the Judeo-Christian holiness ideal and that of Aristotle himself (but not necessarily of Christian advocates of Aristotelian thought) consists in which virtue is accorded primacy in the ideal. For Christians, that is the virtue of humility, but Aristotle himself is on record as rejecting humility as a virtue. <br><br>Based on what I know of pantheism/polytheism, it may be precisely on the matter of humility that there is also a fundamental divergence between pantheism/polytheism and classical monotheism when it comes to identifying the principal virtue that ought to guide the chiseling of the ideal statue. This divergence originates in the differing metaphysical foundations for morality in belief systems which posit the reality of a creation ex nihilo versus those that do not. If, ultimately, we come from nothing due to the sheer gratuitous gift of a divine Creator, then that necessitates a different sort of relationship to Ultimate Reality than if we do not ultimately come from nothing, and the exact nature of that relationship to Ultimate Reality necessitates the primacy of the virtue of humility.<br><br>[continued...]<br><br><a href=#c3336832250288372412 title="comment permalink">5/1/16, 6:33 AM</a><br><br>

I think that in many cases in daily life that is indeed the case, but I definitely will grant that there are circumstances in the messiness of ordinary life where a reasonable case can be made for multiple conflicting targets, none of which entirely match up to the ideal. <br><br>In the end, though, I do not think that the second sort of situation fundamentally upends the aptness of the moral metaphor suggested by the term "hamartia." The messiness and ambiguity of lived experience as it frequently presents itself can be accommodated within the hamaratia paradigm - perhaps by located the target to be aimed at in such instances one level of moral analysis above that of the immediately messy circumstance.<br><br>If you think about it, that is exactly what Pope Francis was trying to do in his new Exhortation when it came to divorce and remarriage. He would say that in many cases, allowing divorce and remarriage, while ostensibly a "missing of the target" with respect to the goal and purpose of marriage, is in fact a "meeting of the target" on a higher level of moral analysis because it better satisfies the requirements of the law of love for all concerned in that particular, morally messy circumstance.<br><br>In the Eastern Christian tradition, that pastoral approach is captured by the distinction between acribeia - the letter of the law - and oikonomia - the application of the law to the concrete, messy realities of actual life. <br><br>The other major area where we perhaps disagree is on the question of objectivism versus relativism. As I said before, my rejoinder to conservative and traditionalist Catholics is that situation ethics does not necessarily imply a capitulation to relativism. In point of fact, Christians are in a position to have their objectivist ethical cake and eat it in a flexible and non-rigorist fashion - a la Pope Francis and Eastern Christianity. But I know from what you have written in the past that you are not bothered by the specter of relativism in quite the same way as classical Christians are.<br><br><a href=#c8735200104673713323 title="comment permalink">5/1/16, 6:34 AM</a><br><br>

I suspect the problem is further compounded by the fact that those very wealthy individuals who do have a sense of noblesse oblige tend to focus on the world's very poor, who also happen to lack a voice in public discourse. A noble's obligations used to be to his workers and community, but exhortations to 'think globally, act locally' mean very little to a member of the highly mobile modern elite. Consequently I suspect it looks like the wealthiest have abandoned their obligations when in many cases, they've simply widened their scope and focused on the areas with the most acute pain.<br><br>Yellow Submarine, I have a slightly different analysis of the political wings' respective motivations, and I'd be interested to hear what others think of it. I never understood what separated the political right from the political left until I saw a succinct summary in a book on writing of all places. The author suggested that right wing people wanted the state to act as a father, while left wing people wanted the state to act as a mother. This kind of Freudian-level gender bias seems to me to tie together the disparate beliefs that characterize these groups. From a Buddhist perspective the major disturbing emotions then wouldn't be aversion and fear but aversion and grasping, which seems more in line with the rhetoric I encounter. Both groups after all display and encourage quite a bit of fear, just of very different things; The Left thinks right-wing fears of violent outsiders are overblown ('A given American's much more likely to be killed by a traffic accident than a terrorist') while The Right thinks left-wing fears of economic insecurity are overblown ('finding a job's not so hard if you're not lazy'). Of course, having a bias for masculinity, the right would also prize bravery much more highly, which might give the appearance of a more fearful left. But I think in actual fact, while the left fears the absence of the desirable much more than does the right, it also fears the presence of the undesirable much less. I must admit that the current 'circular firing squad' behavior of the left is not well explained by this narrative, unless it is simple greed for the dwindling supply of 'rescuer' positions.<br><br>I find it noteworthy that while the right is seeking allies among homosexuals and Jews, the left is also working very hard at attracting Muslims, even when it comes at the cost of alienating large demographics like homosexuals and Jews. I don't think it is a coincidence that this is happening at a time when the leader of the Catholic church seems determined to return it to its collectivist roots. It might be that religious fundamentalism, long harbored by the political right in the West, is on the move. <br><br>Interesting times indeed...<br><br><a href=#c8383692425548328827 title="comment permalink">5/1/16, 11:01 AM</a><br><br>

That's what I'm currently contemplating. Why do they believe in progress so much? Is it simply that the left believe in the transcendence and the right in the apocalypse? It makes me realise I know very little political history, and it would be good to learn more, but I can't understand why you 'can't' just believe in a more equal society (not equal or anything to that matter - perhaps 'less unequal' is more realistic) without automatically believing in progress? Just today I picked up a book by someone I quite like who I've followed online for 4 or 5 years. And now on actually reading his book I find him saying things such as "apathy, cynicism, and the refusal to believe in the possibility of progress are major obstacles to change," leaving me feeling exasperated. He's one of those who's grasped that civilisation is on the brink on collapse, but believe that human ingenuity will bail us out. Because as he says, there are already solution to the issues of energy generation without relying on nuclear, oil or coal. I despair!<br><br>I realise I need to look into more depth at the roots of left and right wing thought, but perhaps what Trump is showing is that left and right politics is dead. And then I look at what left and right are supposed to stand for, and I realise neither of them really represent me anymore. If I had to be placed on that scale, I'd be on the left, but there are definitely things that are part of the typical left wing view that I don't subscribe too. Of course it's a binary scale, and perhaps that's where the flaw is. <br><br>These are clearly just musing, and something for me to reflect on, as I don't feel like I've grasped it yet.<br><br>As far as the new classifications of societal hierarchy you've proposed in this series, I think it's become true for the UK too where the old-fashioned working, middle and upper class classifications are no longer adequate.<br><br>And coming back to the author I quote above - he's very clearly labelled himself as the rescuer - how convenient then that he should only believe in progress and human ingenuity. He has the most to lose after all being firmly of the salary class - so how could he possibly believe in anything but continuing a more equitable version of industrialised society. The fact his thoughts seem to be full of contradictions, he has to be oblivious to. Perhaps I'm getting a bit closer to why the affluent left has to believe in progress and perhaps that's why the working or wage class are giving up on the left (in the UK at least, as I realise in the US you haven't had a real left-wing option for a long time).<br><br><a href=#c2524595838860522123 title="comment permalink">5/1/16, 1:14 PM</a><br><br>

I’ve been an avid reader for about 9 years though not much of a poster. Your thoughts and those of your commenters have helped me find direction and forge a path ahead with my family. We've made great strides away from an inflated lifestyle that would burst as spectacularly as any financial bubble, though there are still many places where we are reliant on the system in ways that could be grinding in the right circumstances. We’ve also had a few epic fails, as my daughter used to call them. I'm given pause to take stock and notice how far we’ve come, too, so I guess there’s a balance. We’ll keep working on it.<br><br>I don’t make a lot of money, but am privileged in that I can maneuver and navigate pretty easily the explicit laws and implicit cultural requirements of our society. I was moved by Sharon Astyk's writings some years ago on what it actually means to be poor in America and have been attempting to articulate for myself the intangibles that account for this ease of movement and while I am not able to do that here I am keenly aware that these intangibles are not mine because of some action or nobility. Yet people who don’t benefit from the same intangibles or in the same way are often blamed for that or at least for not rising above it. (What?@#(&amp;@*!)<br><br>The mechanical rabbits remind me of some of the social justice conversations taking place today that I happen to overhear that focus more on the symbols, or words, than the reality they’re meant to represent. Don't get me wrong, I like symbols and make use of them often. Talk is useful, too, but I’m not very good at these deeply tangled conversations and don't always spy the agenda that seem to determine the terrain soon enough to keep from getting mired.<br><br>On an herbal note, I’m overjoyed to read about everyone’s herbal adventures! Violet, I am so grateful for Eleuthero right now, as I was recently taught it can raise the bottom of depletion up nicely. Gail and Violet, it makes me laugh that we had to plant Nettles when most people are trying to get rid of them, but we have plenty of Violets, Chickweed, Cleavers, and Solomon’s Seal, too, at least in the areas that are harder for the deer to reach.

The strangely-folded headscarves and voluminous dresses with up to twelve petticoats (totally unsuited to a hot desert country) are actually the way the German missionaries' wives were dressed back in the 1900s when Namibia was known as German West Africa.<br><br>We had a Herero secretary in our office. She dressed in modern Western clothing. She told us that she didn't get on with her mother in law, but she would always be grateful that the old lady didn't demand she wear traditional dress. When we said surely she could wear whatever she wanted, she said no, their custom was that the mother in law can tell the bride what to wear, and she would have obeyed her even though she didn't want to. She said there would be too many repercussions from going against custom, her husband would be unhappy, it just wasn't worth it to disobey.<br><br>@ One Thing<br><i>"Democracy is the natural human value.

This makes sense, since I visited Czechoslovakia "back in the days", and spoke to people who visited Hungary. The standard of living was, more or less, on a normal European level, and thus presumably higher than in the Soviet Union. Also, the living standards in the Soviet-occupied Baltic states was higher than in Russia proper, one reason why many Russians migrated to the Baltics. This doesn´t sound like classical imperial exploitation! <br><br>However, Soviet relations with the Third World seem to have been different, with the Soviets entering into unequal trade agreements with many nations. Also, there were Vietnamese guest workers in the Soviet bloc, including East Germany and Czechoslovakia. (Cuba could be an exception - for political reasons, the Soviets did subsidize the Cubans, a bit like the US is subsidizing Israel). It´s also possible that Soviet Central Asia functioned as an "internal colony" of the Soviet Union - I´ve heard different versions concerning that. Some claim that they, too, were really subsidized! <br><br>One of many reasons why the Soviet Union collapsed was probably that it didn´t make enough real profit to pay for all the subsidies...<br><br><a href=#c1204192307102050355 title="comment permalink">5/2/16, 5:07 PM</a><br><br>

I noticed the huge gulf in prices between cars bought from owners and cars bought from dealerships. I realized cars, and most of the ridiculously expensive items these days are all bought with credit. I think the use of credit and debt inflates prices to ridiculous proportions, which explains how both debt and prices of things bought with debt have spiraled so far out of control. It now frightens me to notice how debt-fueled purchasing is creeping into purchasing smaller more personal items like phones. (And I'm not talking about just shopping with credit cards here, I mean places like AT&amp;T will finance the purchase of your phone and turn it into a monthly payment instead of a one time purchase, and now prices are of course going to ridiculous levels.)<br><br><a href=#c2636698796383240116 title="comment permalink">5/3/16, 9:33 PM</a><br><br>

Thank you for gracing us with your pick-me-ups on Thursday and Friday. By Sunday evening, I am in the doldrums, wading through Monday and Tuesday as if through sticky molasses. I often cannot make much sense of what is going out "out there," and you elucidate things.<br><br>HEDGE SCHOOLS, MEDITATION, AND ESSAY WRITING<br><br>Hedge schools of 1700s and 1800s Ireland are a good example of how supplement kids' educations got performed in olden days, although in those days the schools seemed to have been for boys only. NEW hedge schools would be for girls and boys. "Hedge" refers to outdoors but were held mostly in houses or barns. I think this is the way childrens' educations are heading. Just because formal education will collapse doesn't mean that kids don't get educations.<br><br>Essays. I graduated high school in 1970 but have found that I never learned (1) how to write an essay. There is hardly any help for people, speaking from my age of 63, who want to re-learn the basics of writing. Over two years, I kept asking "What don't I know?" discovering that sentences are what I need to learn. Sentences are the backbone of English, so I have been partaking of the book "It Was the Best of Sentences, It Was the Worse of Sentences" by June Casagrande. My second step is to learn (2) how to write research papers. I am having to cobble together my own courses because there is very little offered online. I was shocked that courses are offered in almost every OTHER subjects except fundamental English writing for English-speakers. If a person is English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL), there are zillions of programs getting lots of funding but oddly, nearly nothing for English-speakers (WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD). Now is not the time to speak on the vast disparity of resources going to non-English speakers (foreigners) vs. English-speakers (natives) in the U.S.<br><br>When you mentioned knowing two or more languages, I am lucky if I can manipulate the ONE language I am familiar with: English. I have a sense of how limiting the one language is, but it is "all I got," so to speak.<br><br>There is a big difference between people practicing senility and people practicing what could be mistaken for senility: sitting meditation. There is nothing inherently wrong with staring into space. What is important is what you do with staring—what you do with space—and what you do when perceiving both. When I stare into space, I often perceive infinity or nothingness, which panics the general populace, and staring into space (or staring at the back of my eyelids) helps keep my mind sharp. But then again, I have a decade of training in meditation behind me. I do not need to be entertained — I just "close the eyes." Anything of Buddhist meditation will do. I feel sorry for saps who stare into space but are unable to take advantage of the terrific view ("nothing"). Meditation is a way to get beyond language. Meditation and writing are a good one-two punch.<br><br>(continued)<br><br><a href=#c41999923912707004 title="comment permalink">5/26/16, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

Why can't I remember? I can't recall giving essays a second thought — like ever — until recently. Whether or not I was taught how to write essays is lost to time. Learning how to write an essay is basic "writing," so I mean to learn now. Never too late.<br><br>In a way, I am attending my own elder version of "hedge school."<br><br>Education in the U.S. has not collapsed completely yet, although when I was in school, it was downright dreadful (upstate New York). Hedge schools for kids are not in vogue yet, but I am convinced hedge schools will happen. I am surprised that I hear nothing about hedge schools popping up in the U.S. In Wiki, it says hedge schools were taught in Ireland during the 1700s and 1800s, teaching English and Irish; and the "three Rs" (reading, writing, and 'rithmetic-arithmetic). Some hedge schools taught Irish bardic tradition, Latin, history, home economics. Parents made hedge schools exist. There are a lot potential teachers available today who can teach today's hedge schools.<br><br>I will read The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. I know the gist but have not read the book.

The fruits of this struggle (if successful) confer considerable advantages: They can provide the security of relative abundance by providing one with the power to divert resources and the labor products of others to your own use. And the beneficiary of all this abundance may easily avoid any conscious awareness that their affluence and security is a a product of theft and violence, since there is a broad set of assumptions and obfuscations to prevent such an eventuality. <br><br>On the other hand,IMHO, the cost is very high--for most such people, though maybe not all. There are pleasant and comfortable ways to be born or drift into such a position more or less by accident, without making social position the focus of ones life. But even in cases like this that I've had the opportunity to observe, some sort of crisis generally comes along, which the lucky beneficiary of affluence is unprepared to grapple with, which painfully exposes their juvenility and lack of character. And if there is never a serious crisis, they simply sink blithely into lifelong juvenility. <br><br>I've also noticed that those born into relative wealth and social position tend to view these things as the supreme good of life and devote themselves to collecting the many and varied badges and social validations of their position, to the exclusion of just about any other line of endeavor. Such badges can be houses, clothes, cars, season tickets to the opera or theater, memberships in clubs and social organizations, and on and on. <br><br>They are peculiarly stunted in the matter of self-direction and (dreaded expression) "self-actualization." In other words, even in the best-case scenario, social position is in many ways a negative--at least where the alternative is not crushing poverty and want.<br><br>In the worst-case scenario, where striving for social position and to further advance social position becomes the focus of life, almost all the good of life and the good of self-development must be sacrificed to it. You get a Maude Muller scenario, where, "She lived for fashion; he for power," and the sense (if every human sensation has not been blunted) of life wasted and living foregone. <br><br>In other words, the pursuit of social position--or even it pleasant accidental acquisition--is something of a curse. I would urge strongly against pursuing it. And if you happen to have it effortlessly, I would strongly urge you to seek your sense of self elsewhere, and to engage with life at another level. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c3391574235407505159 title="comment permalink">6/10/16, 6:04 AM</a><br><br>
