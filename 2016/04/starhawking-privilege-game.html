<div class=MsoNormal>
The last two posts here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, with their focus on America’s class system and the dysfunctional narratives that support it, fielded an intriguing response from readers. I expected a fair number to be uncomfortable with the subject I was discussing; I didn’t expect them to post comments and emails asking me, in so many words, to please talk about something else instead. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Straight talk about uncomfortable subjects has been this blog’s bread and butter since I first started posting just shy of ten years ago, so I’ve had some experience with the way that blog readers squirm. Normally, when I touch on a hot-button issue, readers who find that subject too uncomfortable go out of their way to act as though I haven’t mentioned it at all. I’m thinking here especially, but not only, of the times I’ve noted that
<a href=../../2009/05/end-of-information-age.html>the future of the internet</a> depends on whether it can pay for itself, not on whether it’s technically feasible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Whenever I’ve done this, I’ve gotten comments that rabbited on endlessly about technical feasibility as a way to avoid talking about the economic reasons why <a href=../../2015/04/the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html>the internet won’t be able to cover its own operating costs</a> in the future of resource depletion and environmental blowback we’re busy making for ourselves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s not just hard questions about the future of the internet that attracts that strategy of avoidance, mind you. I’ve learned to expect it whenever some post of mine touches on any topic that contradicts the conventional wisdom of our time. That’s why the different response I got to the last two posts was so fascinating. The fact that people who were made uncomfortable by a frank discussion of class privilege actually admitted that, rather than trying to pretend that no subject so shocking had been mentioned at all, says to me that we may be approaching a historical inflection point of some importance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, frank discussion of class privilege still gets plenty of avoidance maneuvers outside the fringe territory where archdruids lurk. I’m thinking here, of course, of the way that affluent liberals right now are responding to Donald Trump’s straightforward talk about class issues by yelling that he and his followers must be motivated by racism and nothing else. That’s partly a standard bit of liberal rhetoric—I’ve discussed the way that the word “racist,” when uttered by the privileged, normally functions as a dog whistle for “wage class”—but it’s also an attempt to drag the conversation away from what policies that benefit the affluent have done to everyone else in this country. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In some parts of the current Neopagan community, that evasive maneuver has acquired a helpful moniker: “Starhawking.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With apologies to those of my readers who may find the behavior of one of America’s smaller minority religious communities uninteresting, I’d like to recount the story behind the label.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Here as so often, a small example helps clarify things; the reduced scale of a social microcosm makes it easier to observe patterns that can be harder to see at a glance on the macrocosmic scale. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those who haven’t had any contact with the Neopagan scene may not know that it isn’t one religion, or even a group of closely related religions; rather, it’s a grab-bag of profoundly diverse faiths, some of which have less in common with one another than Christianity has with Shinto.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their association in a common subculture comes not from shared beliefs or practices, but solely from a shared history of exclusion from the religious and cultural mainstream of American society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These days, something like half of American Neopagans participate in some flavor of eclectic Paganism, which emerged out of the older British traditional witchcraft in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Most of the rest fall into two broad categories: one consists of older initiatiory traditions such as the British traditional witchcraft just named, while the other consists of recently revived polytheist faiths worshipping the gods and goddesses of various historic pantheons—Norse, Greek, Egyptian, and so on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a great deal of talk about inclusiveness in the Neopagan scene, but those of my readers who know their way around small American subcultures will have no trouble figuring out that what this means is that eclectic Paganism is the default option almost everywhere, and people from other traditions are welcome to show up and participate, on terms defined by eclectic Paganism, so long as they don’t offend the sensibilities of the eclectic Pagan majority. For a variety of reasons, most of which are more relevant to my other blog than this one, those sensibilities seem to be getting more easily offended of late, and people from the minority traditions have responded in a variety of ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some have simply walked away from the Neopagan scene, while others have tried, in an assortment of forums, to start a conversation about what has been awkwardly termed “Wiccanate privilege.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One such discussion was under way at a large San Francisco-area Neopagan event in 2014 when Starhawk put in a belated appearance. For those who aren’t familiar with her, she’s one of the few genuine celebrities to come out of the US Neopagan scene, the author of <i>The Spiral Dance</i>, one of the two books that basically launched eclectic Paganism—the other is Margot Adler’s <i>Drawing Down the Moon</i>—and a notable political figure over on the leftward end of the spectrum. According to people I know who were there, she proceeded to insist that the conversation should not even be happening, because all Pagans need to unite to save the Earth. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, there were plenty of other conversations going on at that event that had nothing to do with saving the Earth, and neither she nor anyone else seemed to feel any need to try to silence those conversations—just the conversation about privilege.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s Starhawking: the rhetorical tactic of insisting that some other issue is so important that the privilege of the speaker must not be discussed. To be fair to Starhawk, she didn’t invent it; it’s all over contemporary discourse in America, quite often in contexts where the stakes are considerably higher than they will ever be in the Neopagan scene.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Madeleine Albright’s recent insistence that every woman in America should vote for Hillary Clinton or fry in hell comes out of exactly the same logic. Issue A in this case is the so-called “glass ceiling,” the habit of excluding women of the privileged classes from the upper reaches of power and wealth. Issue B in this case is the fact that putting Hillary Clinton into the White House will only benefit those women who belong to the top end of America’s class structure, since the policies Clinton has supported throughout her political life have brought impoverishment and immiseration to the vast majority of American women, i.e., those who belong to the wage class and the lower half or so of the salary class. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When Starhawking comes from the leftward end of the affluent class, it’s almost always framed in terms of another kind of bias—racism, sexism, or what have you—which can be used, along the lines detailed last week, to blame the sufferings of one underprivileged group on another underprivileged group. When it takes place on the other end of the political spectrum, as of course it does all the time, other issues are used to drown out any discussion of privilege; among the favorites are crime, Christian moral theology, and the alleged laziness and greed of people on public assistance. The excuse differs but the rhetorical gimmick is the same. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the things that makes that gimmick viable is the ambiguous nature of the language that’s used to talk about the various candidates for Issue A. “Crime,” for example, is a nice vague abstraction that everyone can agree to oppose. Once that agreement has been obtained, on the other hand, it descends from the airy realm of abstraction into some very questionable specifics—to note a relevant example, none of the politicians who boast about being “tough on crime” have shown any interest in locking up the kleptomaniacs of Wall Street, whose billion-dollar swindles have done far more damage to the nation than any number of muggings on the mean streets of our inner cities. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the same way, words like “racism” and “sexism” are abstractions with a great deal of ambiguity built into them. There are at least three things conflated in labels of this kind. I’d like to unpack those for a moment, in the hope of getting a clearer view of the convoluted landscape of American inequality. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The things I want to pull out of these portmanteau words, and others like them, are privilege, prejudice, and acts of injustice. Let’s start with the last. Police officers in America, for example, routinely gun down black teenagers in response to actions that do not get white teenagers shot; a woman who gets hired for a job in the US today can expect to get, on average, roughly three-quarters the pay that a man can expect to get for doing exactly the same job; two people who love each other and want to get married have to run a gauntlet of difficulties if they happen to be the same gender that they would not face if they were different genders. Those are acts of injustice. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Prejudice is a matter of attitudes rather than actions. The word literally means pre-judgments, the judgments we all make about people and situations before we encounter them. Everybody has them, every culture teaches them, but some people are more prejudiced—more committed to their pre-judgments, and less willing to reassess them in the face of disconfirming evidence—and some are less so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Acts of injustice are usually motivated by prejudice, and prejudice very often results in acts of injustice, but neither of these equations are exact. I’ve known people who were profoundly prejudiced but refused to act on their prejudices because some other belief or commitment forbade that; I’ve also known people who participated repeatedly in acts of injustice, who were just following orders or going along with friends, and didn’t care in the least one way or the other. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then there’s privilege. Where prejudice and acts of injustice are individual, privilege is collective; you have privilege, or don’t have it, because of the categories you belong to, not because of what you do or don’t do. I’ll use myself as a source of examples here. I can walk through the well-to-do neighborhoods of the town where I live, for instance, without being hassled by the police; black people don’t have that privilege. I can publish controversial essays like this one without being bombarded with rape and death threats by trolls; women don’t have that privilege. I can kiss my spouse in public without having some moron yell insults at me out of the window of a passing car; gay people don’t have that privilege. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I could fill the next ten posts on this blog with a listing of similar privileges I have, and not even come close to running out of examples. It’s important, though, to recognize that my condition of privilege isn’t assigned to me for any one reason. It’s not just that I’m white, or male, or heterosexual, or grew up in a family on the lower end of the salary class, or was born able-bodied, or what have you; it’s all of these things and a great many more, taken together, that assign me my place in the hierarchy of privilege. This is equally true of you, dear reader, and of everyone else. What differentiates my position from yours, and yours from everyone else’s, is that every station on the ladder has a different proportion between the number of people above it and the number of people below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>There are, for example, plenty of people in today’s America who have more privilege than I do, but there are vastly more people who have much, much less. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Note also that I don’t have to do anything to get the privileges I have, nor can I get rid of them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>As a white heterosexual man from a salary class background, and the rest of it, I got assigned nearly all of my privileges the moment I was born, and no matter what I do or don’t do, I’ll keep the vast majority of them until I die. Ths is also true of you, dear reader, and of everyone else: the vast majority of what places you on whatever rung you occupy in the long ladder of privilege is yours simply for being born. Thus you’re not responsible for the fact that you have whatever level of privilege you do—though you are responsible, of course, for what you choose to do with it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You can, after all, convince yourself that you deserve your privilege, and the people who don’t share your privilege deserve their inferior status—that is to say, you can choose to be prejudiced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You can exploit your privilege to benefit yourself at the expense of the less privileged—that is to say, you can engage in acts of injustice. The more privilege you have, the more your prejudices affect other people’s lives and the more powerful your acts of injustice become. Thus advocates for the less privileged are quite correct to point out that the prejudices and injustices of the privileged matter more than those of the unprivileged. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On the other hand, privilege does not automatically equate to prejudice, or to acts of injustice. It’s entirely possible for the privileged—who, as already noted, did not choose their privilege and can’t get rid of it—to refuse to exploit their privilege in this way. It’s even possible, crashingly unfashionable as the concept is these days, for them to take up the old principle of <i>noblesse oblige</i>: the concept, widely accepted (though not always acted on) in eras where privilege was more openly recognized, that those who are born to privilege also inherit definite responsibilities toward the less privileged. I suppose it’s even possible that they might do this and not expect lavish praise for it, though that’s kind of a stretch, American culture today being what it is. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
These days, though, most white heterosexual men from salary class backgrounds don’t think of themselves as privileged, and don’t see the things I enumerated earlier as privileges. This is one of the most crucial points about privilege in today’s America: <i>to the privileged, privilege is invisible</i>. That’s not just a matter of personal cluelessness, or of personal isolation from the less privileged, though these can of course be involved. It’s a matter of enculturation. The mass media and every other aspect of mainstream American culture constantly present the experience of privileged people as normal, and just as constantly feed any departure from that experience through an utterly predictable set of filters. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
First, of course, the experience of the unprivileged is erased—“That sort of thing doesn’t actually happen.” When that fails, it’s dismissed as unimportant—”Well, maybe it does happen, but it’s no big deal.” When it becomes clear that it is a big deal to those who have to cope with it, it’s treated as an occasional anomaly—“You can’t generalize from one or two bad examples.” When that breaks down, finally, the experience of the unprivileged is blamed on the unprivileged—“It’s their own fault that they get treated like that.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you know your way around America’s collective nonconversation about privilege, in the mass media or in everyday conversation, you’ve seen each one of these filters deployed a thousand times or more. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What makes this interesting is that the invisibility of privilege in modern America isn’t shared by that many other human societies. There are plenty of cultures, past and present, in which privilege is right out there in the open, written into laws, and openly discussed by the privileged as well as the unprivileged. The United States used to be like that as recently as the 1950s. It wasn’t just that there were Jim Crow laws in those days formally assigning black Americans the status of second-class citizens, and laws in many states that gave women second-class status when it came to a galaxy of legal and financial rights; it was all over the media and popular culture, too. Open any daily newspaper, and the society pages splashed around the difference in privilege between those people who belonged to the elite and those who didn’t. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For a complex series of reasons rooted in the cultural convulsions of the Sixties, though, frank talk about privilege stopped being socially acceptable in America over the course of the second half of the twentieth century. That didn’t make privilege go away, of course. It did mean that certain formal expressions of privilege, such as the Jim Crow laws just mentioned, had to be scrapped, and in that process, some real injustices did get fixed. The downside was the rise of a culture of doubletalk in which the very real disparities in privilege in American society got fed repeatedly through the filters described above, and one of the most important sources of those disparities—class differences—were shoved completely out of the collective conversation of our time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The habit of Starhawking is one of the major rhetorical tools by which open discussion of privilege, and above all of class privilege, got thrust out of sight. It’s been used with equal verve at all points along the political spectrum from the far left straight across to the far right. Whether it’s affluent liberals insisting that everyone else has to ignore their privilege in order to get on with the task of saving the Earth, affluent conservatives insisting that everyone else has to ignore their privilege in order to get on with the task of returning America to its Christian roots, or—and this is increasingly the standard line—affluent people on both sides insisting that everyone else has to ignore their privilege because fighting those horrible people on the other side of the political spectrum is the only thing that matters, what all these utterances mean in practice is “don’t talk about my privilege.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That sort of evasion is what I expected to field from readers when I started talking about issues surrounding class privilege earlier this year. I got a certain amount of it, to be sure, but as already mentioned, I also got comments by people who acknowledged that they were uncomfortable with the discussion and wanted me to stop. What this says to me is that the wall of denial and doubletalk that has closed down open discussion of privilege in today’s America—and especially of class privilege—may be cracking at last. Granted, <i>The Archdruid Report</i> is well out there on the cultural fringes of American society, but it’s very often the fringes that show signs of major social changes well before the mainstream ever hears about them. </div>
<br>
If it’s true that the suppression of talk about privilege in general, and class privilege in particular, is in the process of breaking down, it’s not a minute too soon. The United States just now stands in the path of a tidal wave of drastic change, and current patterns of privilege are among the many things that bid fair to be upended once it hits. We’ll talk about that next week. </div>

I am not sure what social justice types imagine they are going to accomplish, especially in places like where I live, where homosexuals are likely more common than nonwhites, without a healthy conception of what privilege is. Too often discussions where privilege comes up, it becomes a silencing tool, just as in situations where privilege is unexamined the same thing occurs to opposite parties.<br><br>I don't like the "white men are the least privileged of all" tools, but at the same time I refuse to respect those who insist I (white, heterosexual, upper salary class parents, male) simply remain silent while they deliver their 'remedies' for fixing the issue of privilege. I don't really think any progress will occur until all sides are willing to sit down and talk and the privileged willingly surrender some of what they have.<br><br>I find the current atmosphere here in Canada to be fairly toxic, where openly racist, violent members of minority communities are given a voice to spew what would be called hate speech if I said it. It cannot possibly lead to any sort of reconciliation or progress when a despicable minority of the oppressed manages to sour things for everyone, usually for personal gain.<br><br>Ultimately, I think the ball is in the court of the privileged, but it is critical that a middle path between bigotry or acquiescence is found. It's somewhat telling that the only voices that get much media time are those of bigots or sycophants - the majority of us, I hope are willing to make some fairly modest sacrifices to live in a better country but refuse to accept culpability for injustices that in many cases, happened before our ancestors even lived in the country.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c9154480126442624722 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 4:29 PM</a><br><br>

My initial response is "Yes ...but". Where do those groups such as Black Lives Matter or the Social Justice Warriors fit into your schema? These groups use their claimed lack of privilege to, in fact, extract more privileges than are ever afforded to other (in particular, white) communities. They claim only white people can be racist (conveniently overlooking the racism and homophobia openly displayed amongst blacks and, not infrequently, Hispanics) and make other equally outrageous remarks with impunity. If a white person were to make similar remarks they could end up in legal hot water or worse. Witness the hoo-haw in Britain recently over a Twitter post made during an online debate. Likewise, women can knowingly make false claims (most damagingly, claims of rape) and they're simply slapped on the wrist while the wronged male is left to try to overcome this slander - which will follow him the rest of this life. Ditto for false claims of sexual abuse of a minor - especially of a boy. I absolutely agree we need to talk about class and privilege issues (the need is just as acute here in Canada) but I think we need to come clean and admit that there's lots of facets and nuances to these issues.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c7546508199097025625 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 5:04 PM</a><br><br>

I will admit, quite openly, to my discomfort as I become aware of my level of privilege, particularly that due to class. As an analytical, data-focused type, I have run my numbers and have a good sense of where I lie in the economic distribution. (In regard to some of the other dimensions, I am fortunate to have a very mature teenage daughter who has been able to walk me through the spectrum of gender identities and sexualities, otherwise I'd be rather lost. We do not have conversations that mainstream society would deem "normal," I'd expect.)<br><br>I am encouraged by your interpretation of the data you're getting in the feedback. We, as a society, desperately need to begin making very different choices from those we've made this far. I have seen little evidence elsewhere, but you have a good track record in my experience, so I am hoping that proves true here as well.<br><br>Side note: I finally located the bubble quiz and took it. In my case, I think it was fairly accurate. I scored a 38, which was interpreted as a first generation upper middle class person of middle parents. My mom was a public schoolteacher and my dad was career Navy (entered enlisted, retired commissioned), and I am a technical professional in the utility industry.<br><br>Side side note: I don't have the link, but apparently Piers Morgan wrote a piece in the Daily Mail that essentially agreed with your assessment of a Clinton-Trump general.

For example, at one time in my area people in wheelchairs and mothers pushing strollers couldn't use public transportation because none of the able-bodied men who ran the service thought to put ramps on trains and busses. They weren't callous and uncaring so much as unaware.<br><br>Also, I think the image of clearly ordered ladder, with privilege being abstracted to a quantity, is flawed. In some cases people in opposite categories have significant privileges over one another, and so the balance is best described not by asking <i>how much</i> privilege, but rather <i>what kind</i>. The young and the old come to mind, and much more controversially, men and women. (There are a few consolation prize privileges for black people, poor people, gay people, and disabled people, but the difference of degree between the case of race and that of age is so great as to effectively be a difference in kind – which of these the case of gender is more similar to probably varies from place to place within the USA.)<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c15115430009285630 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 5:30 PM</a><br><br>

The process of money creation for instance is one such taboo topic that can't be publicly discussed EVER. That money is loaned into existence, and then has to be paid back with interest is in my opinion the greatest single problem of the human economic experience right now. This social arrangement requires the economy to grow every year just to keep up with the interest on the old money that was created in the past which needs to be paid back in the now with interest.<br><br>This issue is often regarded as one of the primary causes of the Lincoln and JFK assassinations; both of them tried to introduce interest free money.

But perhaps I'm not as perceptive as you. <br> I would say thank you for the frank talk. I feel I am a privileged person and in more ways than birthright. I think. Here's why: I was born into a white, protestant, middle class family. Even though my family has it's societal quirks (homeschooling, pretty strict religious upbringing, etc) I never knew what 'poor' or 'underprivileged' was even after an event occurred that left my family most lower middle class with significant medical debt. I thought we were poor at that time, but in comparison to truly poverty line people...no.<br> When I went to college I was suddenly a minority, even though my skin isn't. I was a female attempting to get an engineering degree in a time when female participation in said degree was less than 10% at my chosen school. They couldn't welcome me and my tuition money in eagerly enough. In my case my status played to my favor I think. Strictly from an educational point of view, anyone who was MORE of a minority than me (males and females of minority race) benefited when trying to pursue an engineering degree via scholarships and a school that was highly motivated to raise its diversity percentages for the glossy pamphlet. But of course first any minority applicant to the school have to overcome whatever obstacles they were born into that prevented them from being the typical candidate that applied to that school in the first place. I noticed that some of that welcome changed after school. For example, I was hired into a company along with some of my classmates. Their race suddenly affected them negatively and in some cases prevented them from getting special clearances for things they actually desired to do career wise. To this day they think they walk around with a target on their back because of their background, whereas I don't. And I think it's kind of true - even if we are on the same economic scale wage wise, they aren't exactly on the same social scale...that's a rudimentary way of describing differences and it might not be exactly what you're talking about, but it is what i have observed.<br> Thank you for mentioning this "affluent conservatives insisting that everyone else has to ignore their privilege in order to get on with the task of returning America to its Christian roots". That is something I've been talking about with my still conservative family values voting republican friends AND my more leftist friends. I will let you guess which group I get more traction with. I say it troubles me greatly that 'Christians/Conservatives' are trying to enforce laws that (ex:defund planned parenthood) that make THEM more comfortable and establish rules about how others have to live their life without any thought to how much harm it might be doing the people they are putting these rules on. Denying all the people in any lower socio-economic scale than you access to affordable, preventative health care is insane. These people don't inherently have the same way of living that you do NOR THE OPTIONS that you do. So cutting away at the few options they do have, in the name of your beliefs is destroying the societal fabric that you rest your privileges on,and frankly, just asking for those people to rise up against you. <br>All that to say, I am quite thankful that you're bringing up the topics of class, privilege and what's going on political wise across America right now. I find it fascinating, albeit sometimes a little hard to swallow, but ultimately I think I appreciate your insight. Please keep up the good work!<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c9056836562350173274 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 5:52 PM</a><br><br>

I grew up in Hawaii and frankly, living on the Mainland as I do now, still blows my mind. I can walk into a bank, walk into a store, walk into the DMV, etc without having to think about my race and how the service I get will be worse. I can hang out at the beach. I can walk down the street just about anywhere - and do, as I find the Hispanic neighborhoods my fellow whites think are so scary, are really not bad at all. In fact, I'd be in more danger in a neighborhood populated by whites of similar socioeconomic status - they tend to be very angry people. I can register my car and not have the process take 2 months because of the WASPy last name Dad passed down to me. I can get a PO box and not be told there are none available. I can actually shop as opposed to dash in and out, at a store and not get followed around. <br><br>For those not in the ruling group, it's just constant hassles, not a few isolated cases. It's as bad or worse than I'd experience if I moved back to Hawaii. All the things I cite are things that happened to me, and that's just the shallow end of the pool. <br><br>Being in the privilaged group means not having to think about one's privilage any more than a fish thinks about the water it swims in. <br><br>BTW I prefer to think of what you describe as "Albrighting", the center-left version of "Trumping" which in both cases mean, "Vote my way because I look like you and make noises that give the illusion I have your needs in mind - ignore the fact that I'm filthy rich".<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c341834205278803931 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 5:55 PM</a><br><br>

We are all kin, of course, and a lot more connected ancestrally than we often acknowledge. <br><br>Is it an accurate picture of reality to see that a large fraction of Americans see the people they encounter through an interpretive lens that assigns those people to one or another of some number of genetic-ish buckets like "white", "black", etc. I know that most anyone will quickly label me "white"... maybe I am 10% Native American ancestrally, but the cultural links are mighty tenuous... so I know that I am "white", even if I think the whole concept of "white" is an illusion.

[For the class itself the privilege is inherent in the same way as race/gender etc.] In America meritocratic arguments, often bogus, are used to justify these newly acquired privileges. I think it may also be a factor in the suspicion in which social climbers are generally held as they haven't had a chance to learn to soften and polish the use of their new found privileges as have people coming from 'old money.' This was even noted on the degrees of Oxford students of old who came from the then new bourgeois classes and had their degrees marked S.nob (Sans nobilitas). Perhaps this explains some of the hostility toward the Clintons (much of it deserved in my opinion) who seem to be especially egregious in their abuse of their recently acquired privilege.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c5195877696013053011 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 6:18 PM</a><br><br>

I know I have balked at accusations of privilege, especially when the context of the accusation was that it made me guilty of the other two. <br><br>Maybe I am, I know I have prejudice, even a few racial ones, I won't be over specific, but there are at least two ethnicity which I have an emotional reaction to. I don't get hung up on these reactions, and as they are prejudices in my self which I am aware of I am glad on each occasions which they can be over come in person. Though I seek the exceptions to them, I don't deny the feeling that exists before the choice to overcome the feeling. I also have big class prejudices which can be nasty toward each of the four main classes which exist in your schema. The most dominant prejudices I have, the ones I choose to put the most stock in, are about a person's tastes and values; there are certain dispositions which I am much more predisposed to than others. Though I resist thinking 'better' or 'worse' and 'higher' or 'lower', trying to limit my prejudice to compatibility with myself. For example I have little use spending time with people who speak in sit com quotes, though once I was one of those dweebs.<br><br>Still, back to my first line of thought, in the contexts where I have been accused of privilege and an accompanying prejudice yet my prejudices scarcely lined up with the accusations. Not knowing how to identify the tangle of the three made such situations very very upsetting. Because I knew I had privilege, but I knew I didn't have the prejudices I was being accused of having, but I didn't know how to sort them from each other.<br><br>Though in the context of privilege I think of Blake "One law for the lion and ox is oppression." And from that I think that a privilege for an lion could be an injustice for a ox. The privileges we have then have a further layer of how each individual values or resents them. I mean just that a hierarchy of more and less privileged can conflate as much as it clarifies. Take my white privilege, for instance. Many of the doors my whiteness opens to me are repugnant, though they still may be counted a privilege in so far as I remain free to not walk through the doors that are open to me. I haven't found a door locked by my whiteness, though in aiming to be downward mobile, I have found some doors jammed, but not so much a bit of stubbornness wouldn't open it. Being male is certainly more complicated, it gives me several advantages, but also comes with many expectations which are objectionable: truly I think gender is in an era of crisis and that for all it is used to define which groups we can belong to. There are many kinds of masculinity, and the mask must be updated to fit the expectations of the circle is among, the other genders face this as well, in different ways.<br><br>I think the point I am making is more of a web of privilege than a chain, to evoke images from ecology. That every group we each take part in come with many privileges and injustices, but their importance is then dependent on our intents and what circles we are it. For the lower class whites they enjoy privilege with many institutions, but harsh judgement from others. For the most privileged they are dog meat in some of the circles I know.<br><br>I am especially fortunate, I don't know if this counts as a privilege or something else, in my chameleon voice, I can blend in many many circles, often with folks who could not follow me as I go from one group to another. So of that is from my race and gender, must of it is from how I talk, how my accents flow with those around me, and how I can speak with people from many circles. In short from my education, which I was privileged to have access to, but unlike most other privileges it can be thrown away, I have seen it happen.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c68573471477912755 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 6:43 PM</a><br><br>

I remember the eighties and the nineties as a young homosexual man, and that had at least something to do with why I was (very misguidedly, I will admit) so bitter for such a long time. But even though heterosexist privilege is still there, it is, at least for the time being, on its way out. That's why the defenders of heterosexist privilege are starting to sound so cornered and vicious, my personal favorite example being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBDbGyv6SIQ" rel=nofollow>"kill the gays" fundamentalist Christian dominionists</a>. My big personal concern about collapse is if it will perhaps make marching LGBT people into the closet fashionable again.

You're right, though, that this fallacy also deserves attention. <br><br>Justin, that's what I was trying to address in talking last week about the Rescue Game. A great deal of what's made the whole subject of privilege so toxic is the way that every attempt to talk about it becomes an excuse for Pin the Tail on the Persecutor. <br><br>Pygmycory, a very interesting few years. The huge and unmentioned reality of downward mobility is one of the signs that crisis is very, very close; more about this as we proceed. <br><br>Look Sie, I didn't claim that there aren't plenty of facets and nuances about the issue of privilege. That said, if you really think that white guys like you and me have less privilege than the various other groups you've mentioned, you need to get out more. As I noted, privilege is invisible to the privileged, and I promise you that women, people of color, etc. are far more often disadvantaged by our privilege than we are by theirs. <br><br>Leif, excellent! Exactly -- that's another way of talking about <i>noblesse oblige</i>, the recognition that every privilege imposes a corresponding duty to use that privilege for the common good. You're right that that awareness has been almost entirely erased from contemporary discourse, with disastrous consequences. <br><br>David, glad to hear it -- and you're fortunate to have such a daughter. Thanks for the heads up about the Daily Mail article! <br><br>Dudley, I plan on getting back to it in due time, but I have a couple of other things to write about first.<br><br>Aias, oh, granted, there's actually a lot more that can be extracted from the portmanteau in question, and the ladder image is a very rough simplification of a complex reality. It's helpful, though, because there really are sharp quantitative differences between, say, the number of people over whom a middle-aged white guy from a salary class background like me can expect to exert privilege, and the corresponding number for, say, an African-American or Latina woman from a poor family, and that's a point that to my mind very much needs making. <br><br>Cherokee, I'll definitely have to schedule time for a talk with Blind Freddy if I ever have the chance to visit Australia. He's obviously very much on top of things. ;-) The idea of privilege as unearned wealth...that's good. That could be a very useful analytical tool. Hmm...<br><br>Wizard, a nice crisp metaphor. Many thanks!<br><br>Repent, I see discussions of money creation all over the place on the internet, so I have a hard time thinking of it as anything like the kind of taboo you've suggested. As for interest free money, have you noticed that the world's central banks seem to be heading that way right now, with zero or negative interest rates rapidly spreading through the world economies? A post on money, perhaps as a followup to my discussion of the topic in <i>The Wealth of Nature</i>, might be a useful post here, but I'm not sure you'll be pleased with the angle I take.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c6515019329528994626 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 7:13 PM</a><br><br>

In fact, I would offer that the Wiccanate privilege concept was a dog whistle of its own, it was seen as such, and is now in the bucket of crazy stories people tell about past conferences.<br><br>Privilege is about unearned power. As you rightly point out, all of us are born into a particular set of privileges and they aren't something we can alter through our actions. 'Wiccanate privilege' in this case was actually earned power -- Wiccans put in the time at interfaith events and showed up to co-create inclusive Pagan events. They earned that power earned through participation in the larger religious discussions taking place in and outside Paganism. A lot of sweat equity goes into creating a conference or getting wider recognition of a religious group.<br><br>What makes "Wiccanate privilege" a dog whistle is that the individuals bringing this 'privilege' up were identified as trying to push aside those who had created something interesting and take it over in the name of inclusivity. That's the downfall of many activist and anarchist groups, of course, because the desire and mission around inclusivity makes this a particularly exploitable avenue. I can only speculate as to Starhawk's motives for saying what she said, but my guess would be as an experienced activist, she can tell when people are going down that road and has no problem with speaking out to stop that in its tracks.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c6999418912716602947 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 7:32 PM</a><br><br>

A man who is doing well in life can generally expect to do better than a woman in the same position.<br><br>But let both of them be the victim or sexual violence or domestic abuse, and the situation changes drastically: the woman will face some horrendous treatment by people accusing her of lying or asking her what she did to cause it, but she has a much better chance than the man of finding support from friends, family, or at least public shelters.<br><br>The man will likely be simply ignored, or even assumed to be the perpetrator, because in our society the mentality is that <em>it just can't happen to men</em>, and almost no resources are allocated to help men who experience those sorts of crime.<br><br>There seems to be a larger pattern of "women aren't allowed to reach as high, but men fall harder," which itself seems to unfold from the old patriarchal scheme of female hypoagency and male hyperagency: men are the doers, women are the done-to. A man who falls is suffering the consequences of his own actions, but women need to be protected from those consequences (since either (a) a man must have done something to hurt her or (b) anyway, she's only a woman and can't be expected to have done any better).<br><br>I'm lead to conclude that the issue of privilege is much more convoluted than we're normally allowed to talk about.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c5793922023694434804 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 7:42 PM</a><br><br>

To my mind, that kind of reflection is one of the things that will further the conversation our society so desperately needs to have. <br><br>Kutamun, yes, it's a specialized form of the red herring fallacy. <br><br>Alex, that's a useful perspective, precisely because most white Americans have never lived in any place where their skin color wasn't a source of privilege, and I suspect very few can imagine how that would work. <br><br>JimK, oh, granted, race is a social construct. It's a social construct with immense impact, but its connection with biology is complex and somewhat distant. One of the reasons most Americans learn precisely nothing about the 200 years or so of North American history between Columbus and the late Colonial period is that that's when the modern American concept of race was constructed, largely as a way to drive a wedge between indentured servants of European origin and slaves from Africa. A lot happened here between Columbus and Ben Franklin that nobody wants to talk about -- I've been researching some of the details for the third <i>Weird of Hali</i> novel, and it's been really eye-opening. <br><br>Candace, oh, granted. The funny thing is that there really is a class war going on, but it's the upper half or so of the salary class that's declared war on the wage class, and so far, they've been winning. <br><br>Peakfuture, heck of a good question, to which I have no ready answers. <br><br>rcg1950, acquiring class privilege is a complicated thing, because those who are already members of a given class will routinely use any available tool to exclude those of lower classes -- think of the way that nouveau-riche social climbers have always been treated by old-money families! I tend to think of social climbing as the equivalent of "passing" -- the way that light-skinned African-Americans in the Jim Crow era used to pass for white when they could, as in the jazz standard "Sunny Side of the Street." <br><br>Ray, I've had the same experience. It was as a result of such things that I launched into the reading, research, and conversations that led to the unpacking in question. <br><br>Cherokee, a very good point! It's not just other humans that are unprivileged...<br><br>Mister R., for what it's worth, my guess is that the shift now under way is a lasting one. A great deal of the old system of privilege was founded squarely on certain very popular modes of Christian morality -- not, I should stress, the morality that Jesus himself taught, but a set of opinions he had foisted off on him by later theologians (and which, to judge by his reactions to corresponding notions in his own time, he would have rejected with quite some force.) Christianity is rapidly becoming a minority religion in North America, and the moral consensus that once derived from Christianity's majority status is crumbling even faster than that majority status. I probably need to do a post on this sometime soon.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c773369855130404211 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 7:44 PM</a><br><br>

The best thing to be is of pure Japanese descent, with ancestors who came over in the late 1800s to work on the plantations and then started a store, and now your family owns a bank. There are also whites who came over in the 1800s and sucked up to the Hawaiian nobility, who generally didn't care about their commoners any more than our nobility cares about us. The Hawaiians had come up with a society that shared a lot of characteristics with feudalism, so the Brits found them very easy to understand as a society - and how to fleece them too. The Americans joined right in, and eventually annexed the place. So there ended up being huge amounts of land acquired by these whites; they talk about "the big 7" which are 7 families that were able to gobble up land. Meanwhile the Hawaiians were being devastated by disease, despair, petty warfare, and emigration. As per usual, only about 10% survived and this seems to be the typical figure for stone age societies we gobble up. Intermarriage has also done its part toward the near-extinction of the Hawaiian people. <br><br>But back to those land-owning, early-in whites. The ones who still have money, land, and power are those who have kept their lineage pure, and if you ever got to meet them (I knew an old Wilder spinster as a kid, very nice lady, imagine "Lacy Davenport" out of Doonesbury) you'd never suspect they were of stock that had been in the islands for many generations. They are also members of the elite, and to find them you have to go to Punahou, a whites-only school for most of its existence, or the Pacific Club, Rotary, etc. <br><br>Being Hawaiian isn't a very good thing in Hawaii unless you're a member of the ali'i, the nobility, and you'd go to Punahou, or Kamehameha School, which is Hawaiians-only and by that is meant the right kind of Hawaiians. Your pidgin-speaking Hawaiian kid who grew up in Kalihi is going to be lucky to get a job at the docks. But if you're the right kind of Hawaiian, with the right kind of educated English you learned at Punahou or at a Mainland prep school, the world is your oyster. <br><br>The third power group is the Chinese but again, the right kind of Chinese. The ones who own buildings and land and so on. Ideally they will have none of the local tinge to their English, and they try to stay out of the spotlight but they are movers and shakers. <br><br>Everyone else just kinds of scrabbles along. Different categories tend to be done by different races, with a lot of the better-paying work out of limits for whites. Of course you can be white or anything and just start a business, although how difficult and time-consuming and expensive the paperwork is may differ, along with how often you get inspected and fined. A little old Japanese guy who sets up a car-repair shop, even if he's working-class as hell, is going to have no problems. A white SAE engineer who wants to start up a car repair is gonna have problems, maybe a fire because "he left oily rags around". <br><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c8702877336035821292 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 8:00 PM</a><br><br>

On the Mainland it seems to come down to sheer skin color, and accent. While I had a black friend who was the "right" kind of black with perfect English and from a solid upper middle-class family, and who got handed money in buckets for doing the same as I did in college, same classes and everything, got handed great jobs while I had to work hosing down dog kennels and mopping floors - all this while carrying a class load - statistically almost all blacks in the US are really getting the short end. Indians are tolerated, the darker kind of Middle Easterner really gets the stink-eye and worse, and Asians are liked/disliked depending on their paleness. The US has a major case of Japanophilia because they're nice and pale, and we think Koreans are pretty great too. As you go darker on the scale, Viets and Cambodians, the hassles go up. Accent and properness of English matters a lot too. Essentially if you are light-skinned and your English is good, you're gonna be OK. <br><br>And the vast majority pretend this isn't going on.<br><br>Because my dad was an English major at an Ivy and I grew up reading a ton of books, it seems it's impossible for me to fall to the utter bottom. Goodness knows, I've tried, and there's always been some middle-class or upper-middle-class friend who's scooped me up. If I talked like an Okie, I'm sure I'd be sleeping under a bridge now. As Orwell observed, accent really matters. I'm fairly light-skinned, and that plus my accent seem to be a sort of safety net a lot of perfectly smart and capable people don't have. And it's *not* something I can just step away from - the other evening, my boss's wife, who's from a working-class background, said something in a way I could not conceive of. I really wish I'd written it down. I would have to study working-class English to be able to speak it. <br><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c3978724433438809532 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 8:07 PM</a><br><br>

When they first came, they were very low on the class ladder, would take just about any work, like meatpacking, street cleaning, you name it. Like I experienced growing up and living in Hawaii, lots of places would not rent to them, lots of places would not hire them, they were "fair game" for abuse, etc. But over time, they rose up by working hard and getting educated. It helped that most Jews in the US came over from Europe so they were light-skinned, and a few generations took care of the English. But up until very recently, the post-WWII era, Jews almost never intermarried, and up until I was born, I think even later than that, it was perfectly acceptable and legal to exclude Jews from housing, house purchase, jobs, etc. It was not cool to be Jewish. <br><br>So when Mom and Dad married, Mom, who was quite tan, passed herself off at Navajo Indian! And we were raised believing we were olive-skinned because we're part Navajo Indian. Mom tried her best, trying recipes out of Sunset Magazine... She even did fry bread once and it wasn't the most horrible thing she made.<br><br>I have since looked into my ancestry which until very recently was only cool if you were Scottish (or wanted to be) in the US, and it seems I am in all probability Jewish. The "protective lie" Mom taught us made me a damn liar. That's how weird and hypocritical and passive-aggressive the race/class system is in the US. <br><br>I am in the process of tracking down verifiable information on this because if it's true I'm seriously considering moving to Israel where at least they're honest about these things. <br><br><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c5314103662817533249 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 8:24 PM</a><br><br>

I think I probably come at this from a very different angle to most people though. It's interesting to see that the more things change, the more they stay the same. The irony of a lot of these discussions is that they resemble a lot of the Christian self-flagellation and pearl clutching derived from original sin and universalist ways of thinking. Other groups of people simply don't think in these terms. Yet a lot of white liberals have a real blind spot in this regard.<br><br>I live and work in Asia and I'm married to a local. I'm often privy to some interesting conversations from Asians (both here and with Asians I know in the West). On the whole, people in the country in which I live generally don't have any problem at all with being very clannish or having a circle of trust, quite often based upon what would horrify people in the West as being based upon all sorts of privileges. They're very hierarchical. Privilege is not a bad word for them.<br><br>Where I find this very interesting is in the transformations currently taking place in my home town. Essentially, a new cognitive and financial elite is being imported, and they have no qualms about using talk of privilege against those already there without accepting any criticism of themselves. For instance, an enormous property bubble, in large part propped up by the intersection of policies that privilege Baby Boomer investors and a massive amount of money flowing out of Asia (China in particular) is creating real social tension. Recently, there were complaints about locals not being able to afford houses. Suggestions that the second half of the equation mentioned above (Chinese money) be addressed were immediately shut down as racist. The Chinese have figured out how to play that game perfectly, despite having no qualms about being very insular and engaging in their own privilege. White liberals have absolutely no response to this so far.<br><br>It's going to be interesting to see a couple of developments from here. The first is how downwardly mobile white people born into the (upper) middle class (many of whom are extremely liberal) are going to react when they are continually displaced in their own positions of privilege by Asians who don't regard privilege as bad. People on the left are going to end up hoist by their own petard in a very big way in coming decades. This is fundamentally because of the irony that although the thing they fear most in the world is being labelled a racist, they can't imagine that anyone else in the world isn't secretly a white liberal; at some level, that is a fundamentally racist belief, yet they are completely unaware of it, which suggests that it's a very privileged belief. The cognitive dissonance when this is pointed out to them is quite interesting to observe.<br><br>The other issue is that because white liberals so often frame everything in terms of race, Aborigines are likely to end up getting a pretty raw deal. Asians will (and do, though not openly so much yet) shrug their shoulders and say that it was white people who wronged Aborigines, not them.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c2546732295365305430 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 9:08 PM</a><br><br>

(I spent five years doing a great deal of interfaith work when I lived in Oregon, and at this point agree with those who see it as a mug's game.) Similarly, when you that people in the minority traditions in Neopaganism were "identified" as trying to take things over, who was responsible for this "identifying" -- and what benefit accrued to them from doing so?

We were taught to have very clear English. Of course the family plummeted like Skylab starting in the mid-70s and I got the poverty experience too. But the good accent stayed, my reading books that are assigned in colleges, for fun when I was 11, hell a few years ago I was astonished that a friend of mine didn't know who Sergei Rachmaninoff was. It's a weird place to be. <br><br>JimK - You and I both know that almost every conceivable piece of paper in the US will have the "race box". Renting, car insurance, surveys, it's not on the front of my driver's license but I'm certain it's encoded in the barcode-y thing on the back. For those folks overseas, everyone wants to know your race here, but noooo, we're not racist. <br><br>Mr. Roboto - Please, please, learn the difference between baited and bated, just as a favor to me?

Indeed, lots of mail-order marriages back in the day. <br><br>I just sent off my 23andme test a couple of days ago, and I'm going to go with what that determines first. Fortunately, for the purpose of testing, if I'm Jewish I'm Ashkenazi and they were genetically isolated for a long time so there's a very distinctive genetic "signal" so I'm gonna know if it's yay or nay. Likewise, I believe the Navajo are of a distinct type that's probably pretty easy to determine. <br><br>In the 1920s and 1930s, when my mother was growing up, it was really cool to be Navajo - they were hugely romanticized. My mother was more olive-skinned than I am and she had to say she's *something* and Navajo may have been easiest to pull off - say she's Armenian and someone's gonna say "Oh, what town, I've got relatives there all over" etc. Lots of books and magazine articles romanticizing the noble Navajo would have given her plenty of material, and there were not a lot of Navajos around Los Angeles. <br><br>However, her maiden name, and tracing back, are all probable Jewish names, she used Jewish expressions a lot, there were a lot of Jewish ways of thinking - again unquestioned by me until I started researching, like an utter reverence for books, you feed your animals before you feed yourself, bunch of stuff like that. And there was halvah. I was recently astounded to learn the folks I work for have never had it. In fact it seems almost no one's had it, and to me that's like never having tasted chocolate. I grew up with it as a treat. Of course I hunted down the one health food store within 30 miles where I could get it, and got some and brought it over. They found it quite interesting.

It is good isn't it? You started me thinking about the subject from that perspective when I heard you speaking in a podcast (I forget with whom) about the misuse of the concept of social station as a social control mechanism. And I reckon that you are correct in that assertion, however my gut feel - after much consideration - was that the concept of station originated as a meme to assist with the control of individuals consumption and that would have arisen in a society with very limited resources (i.e. Earlier times). It would have been of some benefit as someone’s gain is someone else’s loss in that sort of society. <br><br>However, by the time that the meme of station was being used to control classes of people (by then individual local relationships have been replaced with geographically wide and impersonal abstractions – like today) the level of wealth inequality was obscene and no one thought to question who defined what constituted the perquisites of a station and was that a reasonable expectation.<br><br>Dunno. Anyway - You started it!!! Hehe! ;-)! Oh, I do so amuse myself!<br><br>Oh yeah, whilst we are conversing about ideas from the very fringe (an nice place to be): I rarely watch television (less than half an hour a week - if even that) but the other day I did watch a program which is way out there on the zeitgeist (it is nice to know what is going on). The show was based in New York, and I've noted that many shows originating from that city have characters and storylines that exhibit mental health issues (just as an interesting observation) and particularly so for comedies. Anyway, a few of the characters were displaying signs of obsessive compulsive behaviour and it got me wondering about that behaviour and the relationship to ritual.<br><br>You see, I was sort of left with the impression (and I'm not 100% sure of my thoughts in relation to the insight) that the sort of obsession being displayed by the characters in the story was a form of learned ritual that had either gone wrong or was rendered inappropriate due to a change in circumstances but was unable to be stopped or altered to reflect the new circumstances. Dunno, but there felt like something deeper in that. What do you reckon?<br><br>The Aboriginals believe that if the correct rituals are not performed (and most of their activities are steeped in ritual) then their very souls and the landscape were at peril. It seems like a rather astute thing to realise, because as a species we really do love our patterns and if they go wrong... Again dunno.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c7729723154122087757 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 10:50 PM</a><br><br>

In a society pervaded by the Rescue Game, it takes clear thinking and wariness to stay out of it. <br><br>Roger, the global decline of white privilege is one of the things we're going to be talking about next week. You're right that a lot of people on the leftward end of things are going to be left flailing at empty air as that happens. Their unwillingness to deal with issues of privilege is based on an extreme case of the invisibility of their own privilege, and it has quite literally never occurred to them -- and can't be gotten into their heads with dynamite; I know, I've tried -- that they really are hugely privileged, and the end of the system they claim to hate will be the end of their privilege and the cozy lifestyles and abundant options that come with that. That's one of the reasons that some clarity on the subject of privilege is so useful just now. <br><br>Alex, that's fascinating. There seems to have been a lot of open space between "white" and "black" at various points in American history, and those people who could fit into that wiggle room via olive or light brown skin, etc., tended to shift identities remarkably often and remarkably well. Are you at all familiar with the history of the Melungeons and other so-called "triracial isolates"? (The term's of dubious value, because race is a social construct and they weren't particularly isolated, but a lot of them have some mix of European, African, and Native American ancestry.) There was a lot going on between the lines and outside the mainstream categories in American history. <br><br>James, yes, that's a good example of Starhawking in action. Privileged white women like to insist that sexism is the only form of oppression that matters, because that allows them to divert attention from their own privilege. What does the sign you mention say, after all, if not "The oppression I suffer is much more real and importantthan the oppression African-Americans suffer"? The logic of the Rescue Game is all over that sort of thing. At the same time, as I noted, the fact that the narratives are dysfunctional and toxic doesn't mean that the phenomenon the narrative (mis)describes is unreal. <br><br>Nancy, most feudal societies have a custom of fostering the children of the aristocracy out to other families, where they function as unpaid servants -- think of the pages and handmaidens of the Middle Ages, who did a lot of day in, day out scut-work, from tending horses and cleaning armor to the endless round of spinning and sewing that kept a household in those days supplied with clothing, linen et al. It was a good custom, as it kept the offspring of the privileged classes from developing the sense of entitlement, the lack of meaningful skills, and the general fecklessness that so many of their equivalents have today.<br><br>Jbucks, maybe so. The problem is that so many people will have to give up on the fantasy that they are entirely responsible for their own good fortune!<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c2362566197410701690 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 11:10 PM</a><br><br>

I like hearing your overall impression of the comments and e-mails. Moderating to maintain a civil dialogue involves inevitable bias, so we see lots of people eagerly engaging in the discussion, which is nice!<br><br>I'm not certain when Japan's explicit hierarchy came to an end, but I think it was the beginning of the Meiji Era, when Japan abandoned feudalism and took up industrial capitalism. There was some recognition then that people in rural areas would end up at the bottom of the totem pole if they didn't get with it and urbanize themselves quickly. At that point in time, by law all the former privileged samurai lost their status and the protections it afforded them, and my impression is that it was extremely common for each former samurai family to have one drunken Uncle Joe who piddled away the entire family fortune, because one of the perqs of that class had been pride in ignorance of basic accounting. There was a strong sense that everyone was equal now--well, except for the Koreans and burakumin, and that it would be individual strengths that would make the difference between success and failure. But it was the end of World War II when the American ideal of complete equality was adopted (while ignoring the usual outcast groups), and the myth is much much stronger here now than in America. And I think they really tried to make "equality" happen here. Recently there has been an effort to include women too in the hopes that it would stimulate the moribund economy.<br><br>Thank you for bringing up "noblesse oblige." In the contexts where I've heard the term, its meaning was unclear to me, seeming simply to be "privilege." I didn't realize we actually had a term for what is one of the central concepts of Confucianism, which embraces hierarchical society as a necessity for stability, but demands magnaminity from the privileged, inviting condemnation where that does not occur. This was so strongly ingrained that it survives so-called "equality." Roles in society are currently interchangeable to a large degree, with anyone qualified being given a leadership role on occasion for practice, and then assigned that with increasing frequency as they move up the age/experience hierarchy (which is still observed and acknowledged, but I've seen it under assault too). When I led ecotours to Siberia, the Japanese made it clear to me that as leader, I was to accept no privileges at all beyond the prestige of the position. It wasn't that I was a "worker" for them (though some may have seen it that way--a few were quite abusive), because I was volunteering. It was explained to me that as "leader" I had to put my followers' needs and sentiments ahead of my own.<br><br>The abolition of inequality has been a noble undertaking despite the impossibility of the goal. I think there are a number of factors involved in the total denial of the new reality of destitution amid affluence, though. Shame at not making it is the biggest, and sheer terror among the better off at their own helpless vulnerability must come second.<br><br>And now, completely off-topic:<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c4865718349198503318 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 11:25 PM</a><br><br>

I don't try to kill them unless there's an army of them intent on setting up camp in a planter, so I observed her--or in this case, probably him, because the next thing I noticed was that the ant was a cleverly disguised spider. <br><br>I've seen ant mimics before, but they are usually obvious from the way they move. They are adapted jumping spiders, but this one moved like an ant. It tapped along with its two front feet looking like antennae and wandered about aimlessly. The only time it gave itself away was when it encountered a dead aphid and went circling around it sideways as if to calculate how to attack until it decided it wasn't worth it. Also, every few seconds it would drop its pedipalps to the ground. These were quite large, so I speculate it was a male, and when they were held close to the head, they strongly resembled an ant's jaws.

As a citizen of a western industrial country (even as hit by crisis as Greece is) I feel I have more privileges than, say, a citizen in a third world country. On another subject (I am not starhawking, I am just pointing attention to an illusion that we can all keep our privileges), I remember your prediction that the next energy bubble will be the photovoltaics and your post about it. Last week, I read two articles on Oilprice.com from its editor James Stafford and I believe that the next energy bubble will be a close relative of PV: the Lithium (Li) battery. The articles:<br>http://tinyurl.com/zhh2nqm<br>http://tinyurl.com/zu6z8mn<br>These articles have all the hype (Li as the new gasoline and “White Petroleum”), cheerleading and money pouring that similar fracking articles had when the fracking bubble started inflating. Just search the web for “TESLA” and you will see the same tone. I said that Li battery is a close relative of PV because it covers the serious disadvantages of PV, their intermittency (via battery storage) and their inability to provide liquid fuels for transportation (via batteries for electric cars). So, it may be a combination of a PV and Li batteries bubble but I am pretty sure that it will have Li as a basic bubble raising agent.<br><br>The main reason I believe that Li will be another energy bubble is the same as for oil: depletion.<br><br>Physics Professor Tom Murphy calculated the needs for a USA battery at 335 billion KWh (2 TW total US electr. consumption to replace fossil fuels and go all electric, 7 days backup power) in one of his excellent Do-the-Math articles:<br>http://tinyurl.com/os8ngya<br>He concluded that the total known Lead resources are not enough for a USA Lead battery alone (and he didn’t calculate the Battery Depth Of Discharge factor which doubles or triples the needs).<br><br>What about Li? I searched a little (the engineer in me couldn’t resist) and found a similar answer:<br>Theoretical weight of Li per KWh = 0.1 kg / KWh which derives from 10 kilowatt-hours per kilogram of Li (http://tinyurl.com/k2x83ev). For 336 billion kWh we need 33.6 billion kg = 33.6 Mt (million metric tons) of Li. Practical weight of Li per KWh (http://tinyurl.com/p6sgocq) = 0.376 to 0.564 kg/kWh calculated using the 5.323 weight relation of LCE (Lithium Carbonate Equivalent) to Li (from page 9 of http://tinyurl.com/zb5zfce). So, we need 126.4 to 189.5 Mt of Li.<br><br>From USGS (http://tinyurl.com/hc2ha6t) world total estimated reserves: 13.5 Mt. Identified Li resources in the United States total 5.5 Mt and approximately 34 Mt in other countries.<br><br>Therefore, all the world Li reserves (economically extractable resources at present prices) are not enough to build a US Li battery. Not even all the world resources cover the needs of USA alone. I am sure new Li resources will be discovered as the price of Li is quickly rising because of new demand. But the new resources will need more energy to be extracted like… Déjà vu!

In India the very first conversation any two people have is used to determine what societal position both people inhabit and what behaviour is required by either party. The manifestation of this 'caste' and more and more 'class' privilege is crude, but at least nobody is lying to themselves.<br><br>The other thing is that all leftists totally reject the simple reality that cooperation of the privileged is essential to reforming structures of privilege. Most of them insist on demolishing all structures of human relationships in some radical frenzy, to be replaced with what, exactly? The pigs taking over from the previous human owner (in Animal Farm), of course.<br><br>There are many examples of noblesse-oblige or a moral exhortation to mitigate injustices on the part of the privileged. The decades preceding independence, where Gandhi used his privilege to reinstate the concept of upper-caste duty was far more successful in removing caste prejudice than the period after. Now, the traditionally privileged are resentful of the barriers placed on them because of reservation, are not willing to engage with their prejudices or the manifestation of priviledge, are cast as 'persecutor' by the leftist ends of the media, and subsequently used by the other side for votes. Has caste prejudice improved since the 50s? Very little, because killing the concept of moral duty through reservation set up the conditions for extreme cultural resentment that we have now.<br><br>YCS<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c6073119294693016191 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 1:43 AM</a><br><br>

Though I lived a few years in the US, the following observations are from here in NW Europe. Talking with the salaried class of my parent's generation (50-60) presents an utterly different picture than talking with my generation (30-40) or even more so the following generation(20-30). Listening to my parents they seem to perceive the world solely as a victim. E.g. "Life is sooo hard I only get xyz pension." (20-40: "I probably won't get a pension anyway", 80+: "We lost everything in the 2+ wars but I am better of than I was as a kid."). I can't think of a single time and place in history where &amp; when on average people were better of than in NW Europe in the 2nd half of the 20th century. I think this also explains the vitriolic discourse surrounding THE REFUGEE CRISIS. It is simply a rationalization for a distribution fight. How else can you justify screwing everyone else over who is not as privileged, whether it be in your own country and more so in regards to the vastly larger unprivileged classes in the "global south" (who now starts now already as far north as Greece).

For instance, as a white man I have a lot less to fear to fear from law enforcement than people of color.

You can use identity politics for aggressive purposes to seek support from different groups, but you can also use it to spread a sense of collective guilt, as a way of disciplining that group you claim to represent and want to dominate. Concretely, wealthy white liberals can tell the white working class to stop complaining about lack of jobs, economic security, the export of jobs etc. because they are in some sense "privileged" just because of their skin color. No matter how ludicrous this may seem logically, it has functioned as a device for maintaining power and domination within the white community. It's the increasing reluctance of the poorer parts of that community to accept being disciplined in this way that is behind the rise of politicians like Trump and Le Pen, and which is causing panic among those for whom the privilege argument isn't working as well as it used to.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c291518737415077602 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 5:28 AM</a><br><br>

(I can't comment on the accuracy of his account because I have zero first hand info)<br><br>I played a major leadership role OA - facilitating, strategic planning, and introducing dynamic governance, which is a form of consensus we adopted. I was elected (to my surprise, as I wasn't even seeking the position) as the delegate from the general assembly to the council. I was honored, but what I didn't realize is that I was becoming a target as a person of authority and privilege. Of course the image stuck quite well for a few people because I am a white male from upper middle class. <br>A certain activist in the movement started disrupting Councils and belligerently speaking out of turn and ignoring/defying our consensed upon process, and vehemently accused us of hierarchy and oppression. I spoke for having him removed from Councils or at least holding to our agreement that he be a silent observer as he was not a delegate. I was attacked by a few members as being a privileged dominating white male. The whole experience became so disruptive that I soon left the movement as I recognized that we were going nowhere.<br><br>What is interesting about this to me is that the Occupy movement was based on fighting the privileged dominating white male influence. But I think what happened is that so many people feel ultimately powerless over the true dominators that they end up picking a target who is closer and more vulnerable. It just seems that people want to keep playing out the roles of oppressor/oppressed in what ever situation there is. <br>I think another important aspect of this is the concrete action vs. protest debate. For example, there was a group organizing a protest to the Duke nuclear power plant construction. My take was that we would be better off spending our time and energy organizing a solar panel collective to stop paying electric bills to Duke, than to carry signs and shout at buildings. To me, this sidesteps the oppressor/oppressed dynamic and focuses on working together for something positive.

Indeed, I think there's a lot of scars on the American psyche being reopened these days. We thought we killed the idea of privilege with heavy doses of peace and free love at the end of the 60s. It's not coincidental that the ideology of libertarianism arose at that time. Using the language of freedoms and rights rather than responsibilities, we set up a Douglas Adams-style "Somebody Else's Problem" field around the "bad parts" of our culture, one that remained extremely stable up until 2010 or so. And those who shattered that field, often using the Internet, did not envision a society of peace and love, but one powered by guilt and original sin, those horrible Catholic demons we thought we had gotten rid of decades ago. Once again, we must take responsibility for our decisions and question our own inclinations -- but not for the greater glory of God, only for "optics". One can see how this might make bitter hypocrites and ironists of us all... but maybe we can build on that theme next week.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c7857217163037583103 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 7:03 AM</a><br><br>

I have a friend who talks about the need to “complexify the seemingly simple” and I want to try to do so in this conversation. I’ve tried to have some of these discussions with BLM students at the University I work at with limited success so far. They mostly just avoid me these days because I make them “uncomfortable.”<br>So here are a few ideas that I want to throw out in the discussion for consideration:<br>1. I think some types of privilege can be earned. I’d say class privilege for sure can change as a person’s financial means change over time. My grandparents were barely educated. My folks were 1st generation college students from seriously poor rural backgrounds. They grew up hungry. They moved into white collar careers, successfully invested and now have very privileged upper middle class lives. When I was young we were still poor renters and homeowners in very poor urban neighborhoods. By the time I was in high school we were pretty affluent and were able to move to an affluent urban oasis. Now I am a college professor. As our class position changed over time so did our privilege. Things are very different for me socially now than when I was poor white trash. However, there still are some things from my background that still stick to me. Maybe it’s the way I move or the way I talk but I’m often mistaken as someone from a different social group. I remember in grad school walking into a conference with about 100 other people and being asked by the speaker if I was there to work the projector. LOL!<br>2. I was a systems ecologist for a time and I’d like to make a second point based of ecological principles. Just like adaptations are specific for certain environments I think certain kinds of privilege don’t translate well to other environments. For example, I was a white kid who went to predominantly black schools where being white was a big disadvantage. White kids were verbally harassed on a daily basis. Physical abuse was really common and generally a white kid could expect to get slapped around, punched, or beat up on a weekly basis. You couldn’t tell anyone because stabbings occurred even at the middle school level. You also needed to run to and from sporting events to keep from being mugged if you were white. In addition, white kids were often excluded from certain programs in the name of diversity. It didn’t matter that the president of the US was white to my daily life just like it doesn’t matter that the president of the US today is black to many minority students today.<br><br>Well, these ideas didn’t go over well with folks on my campus. I’d be interested in feedback here. Comments?<br><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c7609260042608148974 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 7:11 AM</a><br><br>

Warbands are supposed to be made up of the internal and external proletariat right? And those would be groups low on the privilege ladder. <br><br>The claim in Europe is that all Muslims are low on the privilege scale because they’re a minority religion, often non-white and experience prejudice. Since jihadists come from that religious group, their privilege status, prejudices and injustices are relevant. But that doesn’t quite fit the situation of Muslims (as a cultural/ religious identity) globally in areas where they form a majority – as in, for example, Egypt, where as a majority religious group they’re the beneficiaries of privilege above, say, Coptic Christians.<br><br>Since many European-born Muslims identify themselves with a global religious community rather than, or more than, a European nation or culture, the question of what scale at which to look at privilege is tricky when it comes to religious privilege or lack thereof.<br><br>In the process of decline warbands can and do overthrow the older order of privilege. So their particular prejudices and injustices do matter a lot to those of us who’d end up at pretty low down their alternative order of privilege (as women, non-muslims etc.). That seems sensible to me but it conflicts with what you said. It’s not only a current but a future threat that is likely to seriously affect our lives – yet it comes from an apparently less privileged group and at present its scale is far less than, say, those killed by western bombs in Muslim countries. That’s making it almost impossible to talk about since people will say, as you have, that the prejudices and injustices of more privileged groups matter more because they affect more lives.<br><br>But I know you’ve said elsewhere that an alternative to collapse due to warband incursions is a declining civilization being subsumed by another. A revived Islamic caliphate seems the most likely contender over here by far. And I think the jihadists aren’t ‘barbarians’ in the sense you discussed in the posts about civilization and barbarism. They just represent a different culture. So are they really warbands or are they part of the process of one civilization subsuming another? Or somehow both? <br><br>And if Muslims are a less privileged religious group in Europe, how do we deal justly with the fact that some of them would like to replace our current order of privilege with another – one which most of us would object to for reasons that have nothing to do with wealth? It seems to me that even if they are less privileged at present, their prejudices and injustices, as with those of warbands, does matter more to some Europeans than many of the prejudices and injustices carried out by apparently more privileged groups. Nothing to do with the relative ethics of one killing innocent people here and the other killing them ‘over there’ - purely from the point of view of self-preservation – literally and culturally.<br><br>The peasants of the Roman countryside probably suffered more from warbands after Adrianople than many of the wealthy living in cities did. And most of the refugee Goths probably never attacked anyone - they were genuinely fleeing the Huns and included whole populations– yet the warbands came from their group. <br><br>Your future utopia fiction was very helpful in that respect, but for Europeans the whole question of religious privilege takes on a broader significance as part of the mechanism of our decline.

The opinion was yet another complaint about so-called solar farms being built in our area and their effects on property values. Quite many of our 'privileged class' citizens have expressed their dismay over how their neighbors, generally local farmers, have used tax incentives to install solar arrays on their marginal or useless plots of property with no regard for the resale values of wealthy, usually retired, transplants' ostentatious homes. The first thing that comes to my mind when I read these opinions is <i>"rich people's problems"</i>. <br><br>It's clear that the entitled class in our area has no concept of how they've driven up property values and land taxes for all of us, or that the mostly working class land-owners in our county may merely be trying to hang onto land that has been in their family for generations. These thoughts simply have no place in their narrative. One "opinion" actually called out these land owners for not selling out to developers before land values crashed, @2008, never considering that it was over-development that helped crash over-inflated property values in the first place.<br><br>I won't get into the benefits, or liabilities, of connecting these solar arrays to our local grid; it's a different discussion, but it's clear to me that whatever inevitable clash of classes was previously masked by better economic times is surfacing in our area. This should be interesting to watch going forward, this dance of musical chairs, as a full spectrum of citizens try to hold onto what they perceive as their wealth and privilege while their comfortable narratives become challenged in many ways.<br><br>Anyway, many thanks for the weekly doses of clarity. At least some of us get it.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c5299152292105798959 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 8:01 AM</a><br><br>

Fountain.<br><br>Great post, JMG. I'm 67 years old, and I've said since I was 5 or so that a discussion and recognition of class issues was sorely needed. I'm from an OLD southern white family (1624 Jamestown, moved south to coastal NC) and my stepfather was a Burr (as in related to Aaron). We had all the right class markers for an older version of class, along with an earlier noblesse oblige sense of duty. <br><br>However, my of my brothers, two of us were on the Autism Spectrum (not identified) and were unwilling and in some sense unable to play the social games needed to remain "in class." None of us cared to deal with the whole debutante thing, for instance. All of us were to varying degrees downwardly mobile, as the new salaried classes took pre-eminence. <br><br>Not fitting one's familial class can be deeply disturbing both for one's family but for one's course in life. Privilege for me manifested in my only being homeless twice! (true, but intended as a joke as well since I have lived undeservedly well otherwise) I've lived among various "underclass" whites and native americans and I can tell you that prejudice certainly can be found anywhere.<br><br>One thing you don't seem to mention (I may have missed it) is the priority certain kinds of social skills take even over "born" class issues. Example: I went on a job interview where I was grilled about my social connections. When it was determined that while I had the right name and background otherwise, I wasn't able to identify now was I willing to exploit my supposed class connections, I was dropped even before the interview ended. Remarkable feeling. So, yes, it's a very complex and painful conversation. <br><br>I seem to recall that Martin Luther King, Jr. wanted to have a conversation about class (however defined), back in the '60s, to move beyond the use of race and address deeper (!) issues. Shortly after that became common knowledge (or so it seemed to me at the time) he was assassinated. Maybe the ice is breaking.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c455095045155815454 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 8:18 AM</a><br><br>

What's next? The soft/hard debate? The F/U debate? Whether or not working with spirit guides is cultural misappropriation? Be careful, you might just turn into a Pagan blogger ;-).<br><br>More seriously though, one of the more interesting things relating to the concept of privilege, that may very well relate to the push-back you've been getting, is the fact that over the last 3-5 years, privilege has become an extremely popular part of the collective conversation. Nearly everyone discusses it, training courses for volunteer nonprofits, teaching certification, or for work in social services usually start out by having students read the original Peggy McIntosh essay from the '90s that started bringing the concept back into public discourse in academia and sociology, and then using that essay to examine privilege in their lives and how they can use that knowledge in their work. And then, within the last 3-5 years, as social media and the thoughtless sharing of memes and online op-ed pieces began taking over as the primary way Americans talk about the issues, the entire concept of privilege began to descend into a way of playing the game you addressed last week, and possibly of playing a few other games as well, one of which, is of course starhawking. Someone talks about a systemic social disadvantage they face, and the usual response is a mass wave of "but check your privilege!" and the whole conversation shuts down.<br><br>Privilege is beginning to be extremely awkwardly discussed, and widely, for the first time in a very long time right now, but what's emerging out of the debate, is a situation in which privilege is an accusation to toss around in order to say "hey, get in line and behave!" (http://qz.com/644985/privilege-is-what-allows-sanders-supporters-to-say-theyll-never-vote-for-clinton/ ), or, when the conversation has actually managed to get pushed in a useful direction, not daring to step beyond "awareness" as the sole acceptable solution: (http://occupywallstreet.net/story/explaining-white-privilege-broke-white-person )<br><br>I think that's part of the source of the pushback you're getting here, usually you say the things everyone things or fears, but nobody actually talks about in public... and people are caught like deer in the headlights, ready to either nod and say "yeah, I always suspected as much," or panic and stick their heads in the sand. With Privilege, it’s a topic that has spent a few years now being discussed to death, turned into various political battering rams, or into circular loops with no real ending. So people are thinking “oh no, someone’s talking about privilege again?” And they’re already clenching down for fear that you’ll either be shouting “check your privilege” to people as code for “get in line and stop thinking about your own problems,” go into a “privilege exists” PSA that offers “acknowledging privilege exists” as the end solution, or will go with the right-wing version and start shouting about how privilege doesn’t exist at all and is just an excuse used by moochers who can’t get by in life. You’re taking the most uncomfortable road, and saying “yes, if you’re literate enough to read and understand this essay and have access to a computer screen and internet connection to read it from, you’ve got privileges, and that’s not something to apologize for, but with privilege comes responsibility.”<br><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c2895979207994780656 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 8:30 AM</a><br><br>

Part of the narrative in America seems to be that class inequality exists, class identity doesn’t, and therefore class falls in a different category from the social identities acceptable within the spheres of American identity politics where privilege is an accepted conversation. On the affluent right, wage class jobs are treated as first steps to gain a footing in the process of pulling oneself up by the bootstraps (“I worked in a factory all through my 20s, it gave me character, and I invested my money, now I’m a CEO!”), anyone over 30 in a wage class job is viewed as failures or underachievers (“see the garbage man son? Study hard, or you’ll turn out just like him!” “that slacker can’t get anything better than burger flipper? He doesn’t deserve higher pay, I bet the joke will be on him when they replace him with an electronic kiosk and force him to get a real job.”). On the left the bootstraps narrative still prevails, but it’s society’s duty to do the bootstrap pulling: “we need better funding for education and more affordable college education to give young people opportunities to advance in cutting edge 21st century careers (i.e. desk jobs)” “we need a higher minimum wage so that low wage employees can support themselves and lift themselves up into ‘better’ jobs.” And by and large, for much of America’s recent history, the two narratives seem to have run in tandem with each other, the wage class consuming media that normalizes the middle class lifestyle and working to either attain it themselves, or ensure that their children achieve it (even back in 1960, when there was a huge working class movement, Steinbeck made the observation that America didn’t really have a self-identified proletariat, and that most of the self-identified working class revolutionaries were actually of the salary class intelligentsia). What you’re saying that’s so challenging is that the American Working Class has stopped seeing itself as elites facing momentary setbacks, but has in fact developed a class identity all its own, and begun advocating for itself for the first time in nearly a century. The narrative of the working class has changed, abandoning the usual bootstraps narratives of the mainstream but simultaneously running right on past all the various forms working class revolutions are –supposed- to take towards policies completely counterintuitive to those expectations and carrying various values self-proclaimed class advocates out there will inevitably find quite unsavory. I’m reminded in a way, of the discomfort among some of the people I knew in the activist community who were doing work with the African American community here in Baltimore around the time of the protests last year and the year before, as they were forced to learn that many of the people in the communities they were working alongside were in fact, extremely religiously conservative, and that their usual “religion is the root of all evil” mindset was not a way to win allies, and that just because these communities were working towards a common goal on this issue, they didn’t necessarily share the same values regarding the various other goals of the activists (LGBT rights, feminism, environmental justice, etcetera). It was an interesting culture clash to watch.<br><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c6658898655886178 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 8:30 AM</a><br><br>

There are few who understand the true purpose of fostering as it was in 'ye olde dayes', and it merits bringing up. My feeling is that this is a good thing, and sorely missing from modern society, especially in America and China. In both American and Chinese cultures, insulation has become the norm, rather than instruction and understanding. The same thing has happened to apprenticeships - because knowing a thing is not the same as understanding it and how it fits alongside the myriad other things that make up life.<br><br>Both China and America are insular, rather than expositive (coining word to mean 'exposed to a thing'). There exists books of rhetoric and even laws passed, but the cultures remain insular. I saw this traveling, where Americans and Chinese that travel are shown and allowed access to only certain aspects of any given culture.<br><br>Example: In Malaysia, most people eat with their fingers, and that is the way it is. Yet on my first few trips there, I was never once put in a position to be exposed to this. Likewise for my Chinese traveling partners. We were simply not allowed to know this, being only met at restaurants where utensils were the norm or else at hotels where they were the norm. It was only when we went on a plant tour (larger concern trying to buy a small company) and there was no other place to eat that we found out how the Malay do it. None of the 4 of us balked - we just washed our hands, went through the serving line and sat down and ate with out hands. <br><br>There were Malays staring at us the entire time, and being nudged not to stare frequently. Our thoughts were, "their culture, their country, their ways" and we forged on. Of interest to us all was the effect this had on our return to the plant, where the locals suddenly wanted to talk to us and show us why they did things in a certain way, and asked if we knew a better way or wanted to know how we did it in America and China. The locals were suddenly less conscious of the whole class thing, simply because we bowed to local custom. It made the entire trip amazingly enjoyable and enlightening.<br><br>One example of many, but I still insist that the lack of going 'walkabout' in other cultures and classes is a big problem in solving this dilemma, and the reason for this is, IMHO, the pace of life required to be 'efficient' and 'profitable'. And the culture of instant gratification promoted by consumption economics.<br> <br>In our modern world, only us old guys finally understand that the notions of efficiency and profit are hobbled by the privilege and class issues - breaking them down and exposing people to these is the only way to get the point home. Exchange of trust and ideas is what makes for a better world and better working relationships. Privilege is not going away, but noblesse oblige needs to make a comeback. Noblesse oblige imparts a respect that has gone missing in the world for a few centuries, IMO.<br><br>That was the purpose of fosterings and apprenticeships - and we have done away with both in the modern world. The only way to resolve this is to acknowledge it and accept that there will always be privilege, but it does no need to mean disrespect or lessening of what others do or bring to the table. Maybe it is time to hold on to parts of what we have made and reach back to revive some things we tossed into the dustbin of history?<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c3234324809742259574 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 9:02 AM</a><br><br>

I always thought that body size is a categorizing device for many, that it is an advantage to be of medium height and size because you can be under the radar, neither a threat nor be seen as a pushover, that if one is to have full freedom to circulate then you want to defy easy categorization. It also helps to be unremarkable in hair length, clothing, and vocabulary, in effect forcing people to read you other ways. <br>I think it is possible to fall out of one's class even if it is working class. By wandering along the periphery of other classes and cultures you can become adept at tweaking your speech, body language, and which parts of your composite whole you share to get along with most people, but not enough to ever fit in. You can reach a point where you don't belong to any class because your perceptions are such a unique jumble of experience that trying to explain one's culture would be futile.<br>If people are honest with themselves, we are all to some degree in this condition, so that the only way to get to something truly interesting in people is to keep listening and withold judgement as long as possible. <br>In the nineties I was a truck driver for awhile and my helper was a guy who had a background and temperament and interests remarkably similar to mine, except that he was a black guy and I am white. We both came from working class towns and we were both avid readers, so we had great conversations. It was almost like a controlled experiment to see how a black guy and a white guy, with everything else the same, would have to navigate the world. He had to be hyperaware of the impression he made, to avoid being seen as a thug. He was more neatly dressed than the job required, and the tone of his voice and his vocabulary shifted much more than mine, in response to new people. <br>I think it's interesting that although in public we are class oriented, in the privacy of our own skulls we may be in another class altogether.<br>This all seems very relevant to the theme of this blog because as resources tighten up the social mores may tighten up as well, so that resisting stereotypes will be even more of a survival skill than it is now.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c6080026456087655156 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 9:15 AM</a><br><br>

Certainly, they were not worked for by their owners. They are the accumulated benefits handed down to the current generation by their ancestors, who didn't work out of an ethic of vocation, but through the need to accumulate a bulwark against fate. The rise of the Prussian model of the welfare state has <i>temporarily</i> (it's a Ponzi scheme) obviated the need for this to be a central drive for every adult. An awareness of privilege does not imply a willingness to concede it, and outside the modern West an explicit caste or color system perpetuates it. Only the nation state has leveraged tribal (kin) loyalty to the extended tribe, and only by imbuing the nation state with a national "character". <br><br>The "privilege" debate only works to transfer status within groups who agree they share a national character. Once you disavow a shared identity and go to a civic nationalism, the discussion makes no sense, because you are discussing redistribution between groups who have different inheritances. <br><br>In fact, those of us who keep an eye on Gramsci's children wonder if that is the whole point of replacing a "rights" model with a "privilege" model.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c2887909456616826073 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 9:31 AM</a><br><br>

Both my parents were immigrants from England with university degrees. <br><br>One step-parent finished highschool late, and the other not at all. One of the two was proudly working-class Canadian, the other was another English immigrant with a banker father. Things varied quite a bit between my two families over time, depending on how people's health was doing, who was working and so on. One half was a gay couple, one of whom was trans. The other half was conservative Anglican. This was in the 1990s. It was confusing, and as I was an only child, I got a lot of attention from my four parents, all of whom seemed to want different things from and for me. <br><br>I went to university and came out with a degree. I was lucky enough not to have debt, due more to parental help than to anything else. But my health was falling apart and I developed a work injury that worker's comp refused to admit was work-related. I quickly ended up unable to work a significant amount, with no/ludicrously low and patchy income and the great recession incoming. I moved back home to save money/try to recover, then away again to try to find adequate work, since there wasn't much in the small town my mom lived in. That didn't work out. Over all, it was a nightmare 5 years before I ended up on disability. Things are much more stable now I have a reliable income source.<br><br>As for accent, I'm canadian-born with an english accent. I tend to get reactions along the lines of 'when did you come over','wow you sound smart','I don't understand your accent', or 'I love your accent','where in England are you from', or 'your accent is so cute'. Overall, it is probably a source of privilege as an adult where it was a minor source of harassment as a kid.<br><br>I'm very obviously white, and am physically small.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c7695706980468369938 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 10:43 AM</a><br><br>

I see this in stark terms--I view these people as the true zombies our popular culture is enamored with, the "living undead", or rather, the "living soon to be dead". Personally, I'm trying to steel and callous myself towards these people for the day when the rightly deserved consequences with the pitchfork and the guillotine arrives. I know there will be a lot of wailing, gnashing of teeth, but I personally view it as a matter of survival of not getting bogged down in people suffering the consequences of their own action, but it is terrifyingly frightening how lethal these people's cluelessness will be.<br>Regarding class, the South had a wonderfully explicit feudal class system that was slowly and systematically destroyed from Reconstruction through the Civil Rights movement, that contrasted well with Yankee America's class and race hypocrisy. As an internal colony, that class system has been replaced over the last 40 years with mainstream Yankee class and race hypocrisy. When I see Southern politicians "dog whistling", unlike others, I see that as adopting Yankee norms--the North perfected the art of racial "dog whistling" while the South was much more explicit. It would have been nice had race been settled in the South via an explosive, settling conflict like it did in other feudal, slave-based plantation societies in the new world, rather then the slow-burn, nothing fixed, internal colony, cultural destruction, reality of the post Civil War South, but that goes in the bin of "might have beens"...<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c5124655017551508947 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 10:49 AM</a><br><br>

Several commenters have mentioned the DNA tests that are available, now. I've been thinking of springing for one of those. Just to satisfy my curiosity as to a few family "legends." There's the semi-mythical Italian branch of an otherwise Finn/Norwegian part of the family. Of course, the Laplander (Sami) branch is documented, but ought to provide some interesting twists. I have a suspicion that the claimed "pure German" branch who lived around Odessa has a lot of interesting add mixtures. <br><br>I've watched a few of those shows, that I got from the library, that explores the backgrounds of B and C list celebrities (with a few A's thrown in, to draw a crowd.) Always interesting to hear the family legends, that don't pan out. Claiming Native American roots seems the most popular. Cherokee seems to be the default "tribe of choice." I suppose there's some kind of romanticized cachet, to that. Though, i doubt any of them would care to march off to the Pine Ridge Reservation. (Which is not a Cherokee reservation, before someone calls me out, on that.) Those never seem to pan out, but usually, something equally interesting pops up. Of course, the holy grail for genealogists is a connection to royalty. Or, at least a rock star or super model. :-). Which, I suppose, is all about status and class.<br><br>I'm pretty sure I come from a long line (and, long lived) collection of farmers, carpenters and miners.

I wouldn't disagree with anything in your above paragraph, though, and it is interesting that he says hand/eye coordination. This is an indication of a healthy neurological system. But I'm not just talking about success. What struck me about the bubble test we did last week was how many questions dealt with things like attitudes and tastes and preferences in entertainment. I guess if you're born into privilege and a salary class family then you're expected to do likewise. Yet many people for various reasons do not. Sometimes they are emotionally impaired. Sometimes they just march to a different drummer. Probably the smartest person I know, with a perfect 1600 on his SATs, dropped out of UCLA and became a plumber, because he's just not interested in the white collar game.

I completely understand the discomfort people feel with what you've said in them, and not because I disagree with your characterization of people like me, but rather because what you say is <i>so friggin' uncomfortably <b>spot-on</b></i> to the mostly-below-the-surface narrative that goes on in my head, and not-at-all-below-the-surface narrative that spews without apology from the mouths of people to whom I am very close. <br><br>This in particular from your first of these three posts hit home: "<i>fat, pink-faced, gap-toothed Southern good ol’ boy in jeans and a greasy T-shirt, watching a NASCAR race on television from a broken-down sofa, with one hand stuffed elbow deep into a bag of Cheez Doodles, the other fondling a shotgun, a Confederate flag patch on his baseball cap and a Klan outfit in the bedroom closet.</i>" To anybody who may not be as close to this as I am, this would probably seem to be exaggerated for rhetorical flourish, but let me say it's not at all exaggerated. Had you thrown in something disparaging of how we (atheists, of course) view their approach to Christianity, you could have been quoting almost verbatim more than a few Facebook posts I've seen...<br><br>I'm not pointing fingers at anybody but myself and people I know, so hopefully nobody else takes this as an indication of how I think of them. I think, however, what separates me from most of the people I know like this is that I was raised the son of a lower middle-class wage earner and spent a solid chunk of a decade 16-25 years old working for (near minimum) hourly wages before the next 20 years brought me to my status today as part of that upper half of salaried people you speak of. While my memories fade, I haven't lost enough of that to time in order to disassociate myself from the hourly workers entirely, and somehow I maintain enough self-awareness to catch myself in the middle of the narratives you have so deftly described here.<br><br>By all means, JMG, please keep 'em coming. Please keep 'em uncomfortably spot-on. I'm looking forward to seeing where you go with this from here.<br><br>Something occurred to me as I read this today, regarding your contention that we can't get rid of our privilege. While I agree we can't get rid of it, we can perhaps reject it. I was comparing your "Collapse now and avoid the rush!" as a rejection of the way things are to <i><a href=http://engl210-deykute.wikispaces.umb.edu/file/view/omelas.pdf rel=nofollow>The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas</a></i>. In a way I see this passion for Trump and Sanders not as an embrace of any specific set of policies either endorses, but two sides of the same coin of a collective rejection of, a collective walking-away from, the status quo. I wonder how that thought might strike you.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c3552256455386564240 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 11:54 AM</a><br><br>

It's David Graeber's "Debt". Not sure if you are familiar with Graeber and/or his work, but he explains from an anthropological perspective how each and every one of us are born into a social debt--monetized over the course of human history going back at least 5000 years. Allow me to quote:<br><br><i>We are all born with an infinite debt to the society that raised, nurtured, fed and clothed us, to those long dead who invented our language and traditions, to all those who made it possible for us to exist. In ancient times we thought we owed this to the gods (it was repaid in sacrifice — or, sacrifice was really just the payment of interest — ultimately, it was repaid by death). Later the debt was adopted by the state — itself a divine institution — with taxes substituted for sacrifice, and military service for one’s debt of life. Money is simply the concrete form of this social debt, the way that it is managed. Keynesians like this sort of logic. So do various strains of socialist, social democrats, even crypto-fascists like Auguste Comte (the first, as far as I am aware, to actually coin the phrase ‘social debt’). But the logic also runs through much of our common sense: consider for instance, the phrase, ‘to pay one’s debt to society’, or, ‘I felt I owed something to my country’, or, ‘I wanted to give something back.’ Always, in such cases, mutual rights and obligations, mutual commitments — the kind of relations that genuinely free people could make with one another — tend to be subsumed into a conception of ‘society’ where we are all equal only as absolute debtors before the (now invisible) figure of the King, who stands in for your mother, and by extension, humanity.</i><br><br>https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-debt-the-first-five-thousand-years<br><br><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c3423250727160313147 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 2:50 PM</a><br><br>

This friend had become a lawyer and was once complaining to my ex that he was broke. Ex said, "Richard, when you say you are broke you mean you need to call your broker to sell some bonds. When I say I'm broke I mean the electric and the gas bills are both due and I have to decide which to pay and which to try to put off." This friend had learned a little about the differences between himself and the truly poor during a short stint as a social worker. He noticed a tendency on the part of his clients to avoid opening mail--they did not expect an envelope to contain good news--just a bill or a denial of benefits, or a summons or other bad news.<br><br>My ex himself is an interesting example of intersection of classes. His father had been the illegitimate son of a female concert pianist. He was adopted by his stepfather and educated as an engineer. At one point he was in charge of the WPA in a rural part of Arizona. (My ex is proud of the fact that his dad refused to segregate his work crews by race as demanded by some of the participants. If they were all out of work he figured no one could claim to be better than the man next to him based on color.) My ex's mother was the daughter of a German merchant family who fled Russia after the Revolution. She was a school teacher and later administrator. However my ex didn't go to college because his father was disabled by a heart attack back before health insurance, etc. Instead he trained as a surveyor and was a construction company supervisor when we met. Good pay, but not the same class as teacher and engineer. At one point he was a partner in a small construction company which played "the skin game" for government contracts. He had a contractor's license and his partner was African American, so the company qualified for contracts set aside for minority owned firms. Later he managed to drop into the underclass by developing drug problems and doing prison time.

This social ideology has birthed the social justice warriors (SJWs) of modern college campuses. The term SJW is almost exclusively used as a put-down these days on account of the unpopular mindset associated with it.<br><br>According to the PC SJWs, the existence of the privileges you outlined in this post means that if you are white in this society, you personally are racist because you benefit from white privilege; if you are a man, you personally are sexist because you benefit from male privilege; and if you are heterosexual, you personally are heterosexist because you benefit from straight privilege. While these forms of privilege certainly exist and awareness of the fact that they exist should inform one's conduct in terms of avoidance of racist, sexist, and homophobic attitudes and behaviors, I don't think I agree with those PC statements anymore.<br><br>For one thing, these statements imply that the individual is irrelevant and the only thing that matters are groups or collectives. If find this idea as absolutist and nonsensical as the counter-notion promoted by Ayn Rand that groups and collectives don't matter at all and there is only the individual. In this crucial regard, PC has its roots in the New Left thinking of college campuses of the late sixties and early seventies, which openly admired and imitated the ideology of Chinese communist dictator Mao Zedong and his Cultural Revolution. I really do think you can see those totalitarian roots in the social attitude of those who cleave to SJW orthodoxy.<br><br>And while these forms of privilege still exist, they are on their way out, however frustratingly slowly. A good way to bring about the retrenchment of the prejudiced attitudes that go along with these unjust privileges is to prescribe a cure that is as bad in its own way as the disease. That is the main reason I ultimately decided to reject PC thinking. There is really too much to describe about what makes PC ultimately stand for Poor Cure, but I will say the mindset has become so rigid, intolerant, absolutist, and victimhood-fixated that it has become entirely contrary to human nature and as such will likely fade away the way fundamentalist Christian dominionism is starting to do.<br><br>Though I suppose a Randite or a neo-reactionary (AKA alt-right) person reading my posts on Tumblr would accuse me of being a "light-beer" version of PC because I probably do have somewhat more in common in my overall mentality with the PC people than I do with those Randites or neo-reactionaries. I would certainly appreciate hearing your thoughts on the matter as you probably have more influence on my evolving attitudes than any other thinker on "teh Internetz"!<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c3908416440587015108 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 4:12 PM</a><br><br>

The equivalent of eating with a fork but holding it upside down. (We'll leave that weird way in which some people somehow pick the food up correctly with their fork but then somehow stuff the food into their mouth with the fork upside down - I don't even understand how that works.) For one thing, if you're eating with your hands, always use your right hand. <br><br>Body size - At least in the US, the people doing the hard work tend to be small. 5'4" is probably the median, and a lot are smaller. It seems the taller the person, the easier their occupation. It seems from what I've read of Orwell, it was the same in England too. It's an odd sight to me, seeing a bunch of big tall people standing around while these little Hispanic guys are hustling around busting their butts, like at a construction site. <br><br>Bated/baited - I'm afraid people are using "baited" because they've seen others use it that way, or because they're thinking in terms of their breath literally being baited, like they just ate some sardines, or maybe some kim chee. But "bated" is much more interesting to know about as it's an English word that comes from falconry. A falcon is trained to stand on our glove, and is secured by a couple of soft leather strips around its legs called jesses. You hold the jesses in your gloved hand. Well-trained falcons may not need such carefulness, but younger ones and ones in training, can be skittish. So sometimes they'll try to fly off, and are restrained by the jesses, and this is called bating, or you'd say the falcon is bated. It wants to fly off, but is halted. Now imagine your breath that falcon - isn't that nicer than sardines?<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c4678500253005352499 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 4:23 PM</a><br><br>

I have read that the closest we have come to a modern separate sub-species, or race, of sapiens were the Tasmanians, who were geographically isolated for almost long enough to diverge. Thinking of race as a sub-species is interesting because various types of wolves, dogs, dingos, jackals and coyotes are all sub-species of canis lupus. (I guess coy-wolves are, too, and I think I saw one last week.)<br><br>JMG, this post reminded me of Travels With Charley, in which Steinbeck talked about having a hired man at one time. They got dirty working outside, but needed supplies. Steinbeck wanted to just go to the store, but his worker said, Oh No, we're not rich enough to go out all dirty like this.<br><br>It also reminded me of Split Infinity, in which the serf Stile was able to increase his privilege with time and good performance.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c8466322861333793526 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 4:30 PM</a><br><br>

However, a couple of times I was actually accused of being English! Rather resentfully too. This was in Arizona, where there are a surprisingly large number of English retirees, and I think my accent sounded a bit like that of the royals, that's to say the upper-class, and he resented that. I tried to convince him I was not English, and I'm not sure I succeeded. <br><br>As for getting into disability, congratulations. Getting on disability is the new American dream for the 90%. The reason for this is, if you know you have steady money coming in, you can go live anywhere. You can literally buy some junk land and build a cabin, or just move to some underpopulated city like Saratoga Springs, NY, and you know you'll be able to live. Moving to such an area without a financial safety net is NOT advised. I've been out in Arizona (lived with a friend who I paid "rent" to with half my food stamps) and in a good month, made $100 or so, in a bad one, $5. It's that bad out there. Food stamps are a way of life in flyover country. This is why the advice everyone spews to leave California is stupid - there are no jobs out there. At least I have work and a place to live there. Going to Minnesota and living in a hole in the ground would be much much worse. If I were able to get disability that would be a real game-changer though.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c2270795339968593795 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 4:33 PM</a><br><br>

Or at least eliminating an aristocracy. One of his main points was that eliminating formal class distinctions ended up leading to widespread dissatisfaction. Dissatisfaction with ones place in let's call it the social order. People were forced to or often eager to strive to rise to some higher level and for those forced to, eager to and even those who didn't bother trying, the majority ended up dissatisfied. All this constant striving ended up consuming a large part of the energies of people so they could not just get on with their lives and just accept some common sort of contentment.<br><br>This is a profoundly conservative idea, with a catch. You see the very best definition of Conservative is the belief that society and for that matter government should be lead by an elite class, an aristocracy. However no American conservative can acknowledge that. While America totally avoided a formal heredity based aristocracy in every place locally and then nationally the upper class became composed of the wealthy. Government was not taken over directly by the wealthy but rather those eager so serve them. With the stipulation those serving usually never acknowledged even to themselves that they were serving the rich, those who owned the bulk or assets. At first that was land and real estate and then financial assets.<br><br>It's true that Americas so called left and its liberals have a schizophrenic association with privilege but Americas conservatives have an equally strong schizophrenic association with class. They simply deny that class exists, all the while working to insure the current monied elites gain more wealth and power. <br><br>Even in the old slave South it is mandatory to deny that class has any bearing on their 'conservatism' despite the regions former embrace of Americas only pure class system, and nostalgia for large aspects of that system that exists to this day, or it’s bastard child Jim Crow. Conservative take umbrage at nothing as much as the charge that they are acting out of class driven motivations. In fact as stated above conservatives deny the very existence of class either as a former or current reality or even a theoretical one they seek too advance.<br><br>This opposite pole of liberalism is I think more to blame for "..frank talk about privilege stopped being socially acceptable in America over the course of the second half of the twentieth century". I mean an ancient if not the most ancient of political ideas, that society should be ruled by a tiny elite, is denied by the very people dedicated to that self same idea. <br><br>If liberals had then or now admitted they are privileged they would have instantly been subject to withering attack by conservatives who would have successfully brand them as inauthentic Americans, or some such, and worse, I am sure you can fill in the blanks. <br><br>Admittedly there are other branches of Conservatism and Liberalism but I believe the root of America's isms dating from its early days is that conservatives have denied the very existence of the thing they believe in most. That the country should be ruled by an elite and a class system is best.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c6205115900402682466 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 4:41 PM</a><br><br>

One of the things that makes writing this blog a pleasure for me is the quality of the audience that it's attracted. <br><br>Of course there are a few exceptions. I'd like to thank the several white straight salary-class guys -- i.e., people like me -- who took it on themselves to demonstrate my point that privilege is invisible to the privileged, by going on at length about the occasional situations in which they get treated like, oh, women, or people of color, or gay people, or wage class people: that is, when their feelings aren't respected, their explanations aren't wanted, and their interests aren't considered. Yes, that does happen. I'd encourage you to imagine getting that sort of treatment 24/7, which is what people less privileged than we are generally have to deal with. <br><br>I'd also like to thank the various people who took it on themselves to demonstrate last week's points about the Rescue Game, by trying to use this post as an opportunity to talk about how everything wrong with the world is the fault of some group of people they don't like, such as Jewish people. I don't think any of my other readers need more examples of how to play that dysfunctional game, though. <br><br>With that, let's go on to comments. <br><br>Cherokee, not sure if you've read this, but New York City has a stunningly high rate of mental illness -- it's been a while, but I seem to recall that something like 40% of the population is basically nuts. Having been there, that makes perfect sense to me. ;-)<br><br>Alex, the thing I'd point out is that human beings are also xenophiles -- attracted to people who are different than they are -- and so the tendency to form local varieties has been powerfully shaped by an opposite (and at least equally strong) tendency to mate with people from elsewhere. One of the things that's coming out with the recent spread of DNA testing is just how much of a melange we all are. Race is a social construct, not a biological reality, and certain historical forces -- which I'll be discussing in an upcoming post -- gave that social construct a brief and inglorious heyday. Those historical forces have nearly had their day, and I expect the entire concept of race as a source of privilege to sunset out in the couple of centuries ahead of us. (This is why, for example, in my deindustrial-SF novel <i>Star's Reach</i>, pretty much everyone in 25th-century Meriga has light brown skin, and stories about the old days when there were "white people" and "black people" make schoolchildren scratch their heads.) <br><br>Patricia, as far as I know, every feudal society in history had the concept that the privileges of the aristocracy were balanced by duties and responsibilities to those lower down. Human beings being what they are, that concept was as often as not honored in the breach, but the idea was there. Confucian thinking comes out of China's first feudal age, the Warring States period, and enshrines a great deal of thoughtful reflection on the values of what, in the time of Confucius, was already a waning era; it's not hard to see why it became so popular in feudal Japan, which had the same traditions! <br><br>I agree, for what it's worth, that the dream of equality was a noble one. Like so many abstract ideals, though, it worked out very poorly, producing societies that are just as caste-ridden as before -- it's just that the caste system is covert, and so no longer induces any sense of responsibility in the privileged. Mind you, as industrial civilization winds down, that'll take care of itself -- I'll have more to say about that next week. <br><br><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c7188793682994741744 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 5:03 PM</a><br><br>

However, before you say I am denying a simple fact and that I have just proved your point that privilege is invisible, what I mean by this is that I am tired of being assigned privileges I don't have, because while I am white heterosexual male, I am also Eastern European, living in Eastern Europe, and happen to be materially relatively affluent professional. There was no wage or salary class to be born into in 1980, only communist party members, passive non-members and a handful of dissidents. As far as income, the differences were ridiculously small. As the cards were being reshuffled in the early 1990s, both merit and ruthlessness played an important role in which of the new emerging classes you'd become. Seen from the dogmatic part of the left in the West today, where race and sexuality seem to be stubbornly valued as more important than other kinds of categories, I should feel guilty for white man's imperialism, colonialism and racism. But the net flow of the wealth pump in my country is moderately negative in favor of countries further to the west... So we are included in the West as far as expected self-mockery, but excluded as far as profit from the actions for which we should feel guilty. If privilege is collective, then the collective can be broken down to so many subcategories that you come pretty close to a handful of individuals. These no longer fit into simple ideological obsession of the western left to point at a certain cool category du jour and use quotas and affirmative action to prop them up. Usually, you end up with new injustice rather than compensation for old injustices. As for not being able to change the privileges, just take moving to another country within the EU, which is easy enough. The sum of people's prejudices towards me would certainly change.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c5006830599988079296 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 5:30 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, exactly; affluent white people making poor white people pay for benefits to poor people of color has been the name of the game for decades now. <br><br>Swift developer, you might want to start by looking up the meaning of the words "privilege" and culture in your favorite dictionary, online or otherwise. No, privilege is not the same thing as "culture;" culture is one of the features that is used in some societies to assign differences in privilege. <br><br>Cassandra, yes, I've been tracking the lithium boondoggle for a while now -- thanks for the convenient set of links! We'll be talking about green energy in more detail in a later post. <br><br>Maxime, that's good to hear. Once the concept of privilege gets pried loose from the Rescue Game and recognized as a simple fact in human social life, which has to be counterbalanced in order to manage some kind of equity in human affairs, there's much that can be done. <br><br>TCS, I'm sure it does look weird to Asian eyes! The problem with the Left -- as Edmund Burke pointed out trenchantly more than two centuries ago -- is that it tries to make human social life conform to an assortment of abstract notions that have no grounding in history or actual experience, and trying to force a society to conform to arbitrary human concepts is as reliably disastrous as trying to make an ecosystem do the same thing. I really should do a post one of these days about Burkean conservatism as political ecology...<br><br>Mat, of course it's a distribution fight. The bitter reality is that there aren't enough resources on the planet to give everyone a comfortable developed-world lifestyle, and so distribution fights are going to be the shape of the future as we proceed. That's another reason why frank talk about privilege is needed now!<br><br>Greg, excellent! Yes, exactly -- privilege is invisible because being privileged mostly means that you're spared a galaxy of inconveniences and insults, and since you don't encounter those, you don't realize that other people do encounter them. Thus the outrage of straight white salary-class guys like me when, on occasion, they get treated like people lower down the ladder of privilege: it never occurs to them that this is how others are treated every single day of their lives. <br><br>MigrantWorker, that's a useful analysis. I'd go even further and identify the primary payoff of privilege as a matter of identity -- the privileged person builds his or her identity around being privileged and being able to expect the various perks and benefits of privilege, just as the unprivileged person very often builds his or her identity around not being privileged and having to bear the burdens and insults of that lack of privilege. One's sense of one's identity is an extraordinarily powerful thing, and when a wide enough gap opens up between someone's actual experience and what their sense of their identity leads them to expect, various kinds of craziness often ensue. <br><br>Yeast, yes, and I've discussed that at great length in an entire series of posts here already -- you'll find them summed up and rewritten at length in my book <i>Decline and Fall</i>. <br><br>Cathy, the starting point here as elsewhere is a piece of advice I've given many times already: "Collapse now and avoid the rush." I'll expand on that further as we proceed.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c8626963760400335124 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 6:29 PM</a><br><br>

It's a very good postulation, but to me it does not account for some observations: <br><br>Seeing in the news a few years ago, the aftermath of some horrible tornado in one of the southern states, and people were digging out their stuff, and you could tell they were neighbors and friends, but what struck me was they were either quite black or quite white. There was no cafe-au-lait in sight. There are probably strong cultural taboos there.<br><br>There are insular groups like the Ainu in Japan, perfectly free to mix with the Japanese and they have apparently, a bit, but they remain distinct. Distinct groups like this are all over the world.<br><br>Even within one "race" if there are societies that are stratified, the nobles end up looking very different from the commoners because - I can't think of one that isn't - traditional cultures like the Hawaiians are obsessed with genealogy, at least among their ruling class. <br><br>I agree that race is a social construct, although animal breeders talk about "landraces" and that's really what races are. But it comes down to genes, and certain people who have a history of living in a certain area and intermarrying within that group will have genetic markers that indicate they're related to people in that group. <br><br>Science/medicine have had to face the uncomfortable fact that there are some "racial" realities. Pima Indians have to watch their diet because they evolved to be very "thrifty" and on the standard American diet they get *very* overweight. Most of the best sprinters come from one area, marathoners another. It's made the news lately that certain heart medications that work pretty well for Caucasians, don't work nearly so well for those of African descent. If you're trying to help your patient, you have to know this. <br><br>I do not believe in superior or inferior. I might be an astronaut but is a bushman living in Africa any less happy than me? He's probably happier.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c6245831282809371436 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 6:36 PM</a><br><br>

I'd stay there if I were you. <br><br>I'm not having an especially hard time as Americans go. It's just that things are that bad here. I'm in the middle of the fabled "silicon valley" and companies are being caught right and left smuggling in foreign-trained tech people and paying them what they'd get at home plus a free place to sleep in a dorm and free food. So, if I'm Joe Blow from India and I can get my same $2-something an hour plus free rooming and free rice and lentils, plus get to see America, I'm gonna go for it. But not only is this illegal but it forces everyone else's wages down. We have an utter ton of homeless people and most seem to come from a tech background. There are big homeless encampments all around here and the gov't will come through and clean 'em out, including people's personal papers, medicines, etc and they just pop back up somewhere else. <br><br>Mental health care is, for the poor, back to pre-Bedlam times. If you're mentally ill you just live in the streets, a target for anyone who feels like attacking you. <br><br>Medical care is hard to get. Theoretically I have it since I have an Obamacare card. In reality I have to make an appointment months ahead to see my regular doctor then, since it's very far away, I have to have the money to take the bus out there the day before and stay in a hotel room, then walk to the Dr's office. So I suppose things will just hang until they're an emergency - preventive care is only for the rich here. <br><br>There is public transportation here and it's OK, it's a mile walk to it though. <br><br>People are very standoffish. They're a bit nicer than they are in Southern California but that's not saying much. The only way to get acknowledged as a human being is to be a member of a "tribe" such as ham radio (although I like to say there's not much community in the ham radio community at least not here) or some hobby, sport, church, something like that. <br><br>But those really aren't tribes; there's a saying that goes, "Home is where when you show up, they have to take you in". Regular Americans don't do things that way. If you're a relative and you show up at their door because you've lost everything, they'll tell you to get lost. A real tribe, you're in it, thick or thin - and in return, the members of the tribe who are doing well have an obligation to help those members who are not doing well. That's in direct opposition to everything our society stands for.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c4796570646683276320 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 6:54 PM</a><br><br>

What they used to call in the Black Community as "passing", along with the connotation of falsely partaking of privilege you were not <i>entitled</i> to.<br><br>But I got a particularly rude lesson in the reality of privilege being a spectator to one of the few howling screaming fights my parents ever had in my presence. My father, who is of French/German/Anglo ancestry commented once to my mother that as a former Communist in the early 1950s, he could identify with the Black Experience of institutional persecution. <br><br><b>She read him the RIOT ACT.</b><br><br>My father, of course did experience persecution, but he could, if he so chose, cut his hair, shave his beard, put on a tie, tidy up his language... and he was <i>good to go</i> as a fully-vested member of society. My Mother, mixed Native American/Black/ and a bit some of the finest families of Virginia, or Mississippi... No matter how elegant and eloquent she was, and she was surely elegant and eloquent - could never, EVER shed her dark skin. She would always be first perceived, and often solely as a Black Woman. Most White people never even <i>noticed</i> her Native blood, or saw anything beyond a Black Woman, permanently part of second-class America.<br><br>That scene has stayed with me ever since. But still, they had the courage ... and love, to be, and stay together. And the good sense to ditch Chicago for the more enlightened New York City. I'm glad I grew up in a swirling working-class melting pot instead of a segregated checkerboard. Black Square. White Square. <i>NO brown squares.</i><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c2818504748084888309 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 6:55 PM</a><br><br>

I'll go back and take another look. <br><br>Davidchuter, exactly. When affluent white people wax rhapsodic about all the awful things white people have done, you can bet that they're trying to divert attention from their own privilege and covertly (or not so covertly) redirect the hostility of people of color onto other disadvantaged people who have light-colored skin. That's Starhawking of the classic sort. <br><br>Robert, I wasn't there, of course, but that sounds to me like a perfect example of what I described last week as the Circular Firing Squad end of the Rescue Game. Since nobody wanted to take on the real problems, and no Persecutors were showing up to give the game an impetus, the other players identified you as a Persecutor on the basis of your gender, skin color, and class status, and bullied you until you left. No doubt they turned on someone else next. That's the way the game is played, and until that stops being the heart of contemporary activism on the left, it's going to prevent any actual change from happening. <br><br>Rita, of course it's okay -- the article says much of what I've been trying to say about the covert role of privilege in liberalism, from a different and useful angle. Thanks for bringing it to my attention!<br><br>Jay, I haven't read Ignatiev -- I'll have to remedy that. As for your second point, I'd take it even further: in the future ahead of us, not even those who are currently on top of the privilege ladder will be able to have the things they think of as essential to their lifestyles. More on this next week!<br><br>RPC, not a bit. There's a savage irony in watching "Christian" politicians today espousing exactly the attitudes and behaviors for which Jesus condemned the Pharisees of his day to eternal damnation. I gather their Bible study somehow never got to Matthew 7:21 -- "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven." <br><br>Avery, very nicely phrased. Yes, indeed, we'll get into that in due time. <br><br>Soccer13, those are both valid points, of course. Class in America is somewhat flexible on the basis of income, though "somewhat" is the operative word here -- as you've noted, there are class markers that stay with you, and you can only rise so many steps on the ladder before those further up begin to make an effort to exclude you. As for the second, privilege is always contextual, and in a sufficiently complex society there are always subcultures inside which the ladder of privilege runs differently. White kids in mostly black schools are in one of those subcultures; so are Neopagans, of course -- the ladder of privilege there has a fair amount in common with that outside the Neopagan scene, of course, but there are additional divisions based on religious affiliation and the like. <br><br>.Mallow, that's a huge and complex question, not least because a given system of privilege functions within a single culture, and when you've got a bunch of competing cultures cheek by jowl, you've got a very different situation. The western end of Eurasia and the Mediterranean basin are both well into the process of warband formation, which complicates the matter even further, but here again, this is something that'll take at least a post of its own. (Which I was already planning to write, if that's any consolation.) <br><br>Ghung, that's a great example -- many thanks.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c2316266003588561931 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 7:24 PM</a><br><br>

So I'm reading this book about him and it mentioned that it was a custom for well-to-do Jews to invite a poor Jew to dinner on Fridays. I was astounded by this. Why, why in the world??? In the world I grew up in, the rich wanted the poor kept away from them, not invited to dinner! <br><br>Now if there's any group who has a million rules, it's the Jews and they have all kinds of customs like that. It's very very different from the Calvinist society the US essentially is. <br><br>But feudalism was also tribal in that, you had chunks of land, you had serfs, who had more holidays than just about anyone does now (certainly more than Americans) and your land did well if your serfs did well. You were all in it together. And if you were a bad manager, well, the Church would lean on you, and belief in hell was a real thing. <br><br>I guess what it comes down to is, the social system of the US values money. Money is the ultimate measure of good. Not only that, but the US is doing its best to get the rest of the world to think that way. Other societies valued wealth too, from the Maasai to the Navajo, but they didn't let anyone go hungry - feeding the poor was the best way to show off. Jewish society values learning, and being ethical. Some societies like the Inuit and the Tlingit, actually valued giving stuff away. The poorer you made yourself, the richer you were! <br><br>I guess the difference is, the US type society is the only one I can think of that blames the poor for their circumstances out of hand, and considers it a positive thing to make them poorer.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c8313409315938336472 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 7:24 PM</a><br><br>

I'm amazed that you respond to so many posts so thoroughly. I find myself in a quandary of wanting to have an in-depth discussion and realizing that you have way too much on your plate and I am one of many responding. Oh well. But I wanted to make the point that while, overall, your assessment was correct, the reality was more nuanced in an essential way. Sure, I was bullied by a handful of people that needed a Prosecutor. But a good 95% or better still respected me and supported my voice and realized I was in integrity and service. What really allowed the disruption was a sense of guilt on the part of so many, triggered by the cry of "You're oppressing me just like our enemies". It was paralyzing. I didn't leave because of bullying - I left because too many others allowed bullying and the game. And, of course, the hand in hand focus on protest over practical action. <br><br>Another related topic I am supremely interested in is what I consider - in homesteading, intentional community and permaculture circles - throwing the baby out with the bathwater. The baby is leadership with integrity and service, (and in my experience, healthy yin masculine expression) the bathwater is rampant male dominance and aggression - perverted yang masculine, no yin in sight. And by yin I mean a container for collective needs and feelings and human potential. I am convinced issues of perverted masculine/feminine and yin/yang energies are at the core of our modern dilemma, along side the commodification and abstraction of value of everything. <br><br><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c1223035988928001008 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 8:52 PM</a><br><br>

Their unwillingness to deal with issues of privilege is based on an extreme case of the invisibility of their own privilege, and it has quite literally never occurred to them -- and can't be gotten into their heads with dynamite; I know, I've tried -- that they really are hugely privileged, and the end of the system they claim to hate will be the end of their privilege and the cozy lifestyles and abundant options that come with that. That's one of the reasons that some clarity on the subject of privilege is so useful just now."<br><br>I'd posit that you could replace the word "left" with "right" in that quote and retain its validity. Not only can rich people be both liberal or conservative in disposition, but you can also be poor and retain more privilege than someone of greater economic status by virtue of biological markers. <br><br>I'm not sure if I'm alone in this, but I feel like there has been a larger partisan slant to the recent posts on this blog or perhaps its the comment section that is coloring my perspective, either way, things feel less neutral around these parts of late.

I'll be getting back to collapse in the near future, but the issues of class and privilege interface with the collapse process in important ways, so it's not wasted space. <br><br>Unknown Clark, that's an important point. Privilege, again, isn't just a matter of class -- it's class plus race plus gender plus a galaxy of other things, including neurotypicality or the lack of it. (I have Aspergers syndrome, so have run up against that one a few times myself.) That is, privilege is always individual, contextual, and intersectional. <br><br>Eric, exactly. Tolerably often, the people who shout "Check your privilege!" the loudest are the ones who should be paying attention to their own (ab)use of privilege; the invisibility of privilege doesn't just affect straight white guys, after all! It may be the most difficult route, but it seems to me that it's only when we get past the distortions of the concept of privilege on both sides of the political spectrum that we can deal with privilege as it actually exists, and take steps toward building features into our society that will ameliorate its negative impacts on the less privileged. <br><br>As for your second point, yes, and that's just it. Both the left and the right abandoned the wage class and then tried to pretend that they were still speaking for those lower down the ladder of privilege. Now the wage class, with its back to the wall, is finally waking up to the necessity to speak for itself and define its own agenda, and both ends of the affluent elite are flailing wildly, trying to cope. I'm glad to see this happening now, via the electoral system, because it's precisely when the bulk of society has been disenfranchised by a corrupt political system that demagogues flourish and autocracy becomes likely. <br><br>Tokyo, good. The wild card in play this time around, of course, is that the resources needed to "level up" the rest of society don't exist, and so "leveling down" is the only available option -- and yet it's the option that terrifies the affluent classes the most. My slogan "Collapse now and avoid the rush!" is relevant here as well!<br><br>David, oh, granted. There'd be a reason to raise an eyebrow if Sanders were proposing a discussion of class that was limited to rich white guys, but of course he's not -- it's just a central theme of the Clinton campaign to parade Hillary's gender as a way to deflect attention from her exceedingly high place on the ladder of privilege. If you want to engage -- and there are good reasons to engage, when you're not just getting sucked into the Rescue Game -- challenge the characterizations. Pointing out Clinton's privilege is a good move, but so is challenging the Clintonistas' facile dishonesty about who supports Sanders. Oh, and since they always use the same thoughtstoppers, learn to anticipate those and knock them down in advance. That's how the game is played!<br><br>Redscott, thank you! Yes, exactly. <br><br>234567, why, yes -- when "progress" has made things worse, it's a perfectly valid move to bring back something that was discarded and put it back to use in place of some newer and shoddier replacement. That's one of the core concepts of this blog's project, after all... ;-)<br><br>Other Tom, true enough. Class is a complex thing, and there's wiggle room available for those who are able and willing to use it -- not everyone can, of course. In the same way, all the other markers that are used to assign privilege can sometimes be finessed.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c6696873277287219236 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 11:01 PM</a><br><br>

That's a facile oversimplification of a far more complex reality, unless you agree that part of that "bulwark" consists of arrangements that allow one group to exploit other groups by force or fraud. This latter isn't the whole picture of privilege, of course, but it's a very important part, and pretending that it's not heavily involved renders any analysis of privilege vacuous. <br><br>I suppose you could claim that your ancestors' acts of violence and chicanery against other groups in society are to be credited to you as their heir -- but once you admit that, haven't you just provided ample justification for the claims of those further down the ladder of privilege that you should be held personally responsible for the abuses their ancestors suffered at the hands of yours? You can't have it both ways; either your privilege is unearned by you and therefore you're not responsible for the acts that brought it into being, or you deserve your privileges and therefore you also deserve to be held accountable for the acts that created it in the past. <br><br>Hal, thanks for the link! I hadn't seen the article yet. <br><br>Clay, I'm delighted to hear it. I get the impression, from comments like this, that a lot of younger people are much more attuned to the realities of privilege than most of their elders are. As time goes on, that could have some very positive results. <br><br>Sven, I score extremely high on IQ tests. That's partly because I'm good at aping the proper salary class modes of thinking, and partly because back in elementary school, I began to work out a set of algorithms for getting good scores on multiple choice tests, and as a result I reliably score far higher on multiple choice tests of all kinds than my actual knowledge and skills would otherwise justify. The conclusions I draw from this are, first, that IQ tests determine how well you conform to the salary class stereotype of what intelligence is, and second, that multiple choice tests are very easy to fake out and do not provide a valid measure of anything. <br><br>Aias, thank you! I'll put it on the get-to list. <br><br>Shane, I didn't mean my reference to the cluelessness of the salary class to apply only to liberals, you know. It applies across the board -- and it's a reflection of a very ancient and widely applicable principle: the unprivileged tell the privileged what they think the privileged want to hear. Plenty of Southern plantation owners, for example, seem to have honestly believed that their slaves were happy with their lot, since it was easier for the slaves to play along with that fantasy and reap the benefits of relatively lax oversight than it was to 'fess up to the reality. In the same way, I'd encourage you to reconsider your apparent notion that the blindness of privilege only applies to the people you don't like...<br><br>Lew, I've been thinking of the same thing. My family has its share of legends, too, including a Lakota farmhand and the farmer's daughter, which isn't quite as common as the Cherokee princess great-grandmother; I have a lot of curiosity about just how tangled and murky my family's ancestry actually is (I suspect quite a bit). <br><br>Tag, I haven't read it -- I'm embarrassingly behind on my English classics. I'll add it to my get-to list, though. <br><br>Chris and Asr, thank you both! I admit seeing that in Vox was a bit of a shocker, as Vox always struck me as the epitome of smug liberal glibness.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c965089892799976530 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 11:21 PM</a><br><br>

"The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas" may just deserve a post of its own; the response it suggests has its own problematic features, but that's a conversation for a different day. What I'd say, in very short form, is that we may not be able to get rid of our privilege but we can refuse to exploit it to the detriment of the less privileged, and we can use it deliberately to help the less privileged -- not by "rescuing" them in terms of the Rescue Game, or by imposing our own ideas of what they need on them, but by countering the attempts of other privileged people to exploit their positions of privilege, and by using our privilege to help the less privileged accomplish what they want to accomplish and say what they want to have heard. That concept needs more development, but I think it's a step in a more constructive direction. <br><br>Matt, here again, the men who do that aren't getting rid of their privilege -- they're the ones who make the choice, after all. What they're doing is refusing to exploit their privilege, and to me, at least, that seems to be at least a very good start. Yes, there are benefits; exploitation of privileges builds walls between people, which a refusal to exploit can begin to tear down. There's a long discussion here of I-It and I-Thou relationships, but that will have to wait for some other time. (As for your offlist comment: in my view, that's not a word that should <i>ever</i> appear in polite discourse. If you'll resubmit with appropriate edits, I'll gladly put your comment through.) <br><br>Renaissance, it seems obvious to me, too -- but to most people in the industrial world, it's anything but obvious. For that matter, peak oil seems like the simplest sort of common sense to me -- you can't take an infinite amount of oil out of a finite planet, duh -- but an astonishing number of seemingly intelligent people don't seem to be able to grasp it at all. So the work continues...<br><br>Gottfried (etc.), I haven't read Graeber, though he's been on my get-to list for a while. <br><br>Unknown Rita, thank you for the illustrative examples! All good points. <br><br>Atilio, I wish I had easy answers. It's taken me quite a few years to begin to become just one of the local eccentrics, and I had the advantage of membership in Freemasonry, which is very large and active here in Cumberland. Still, I'll see if I can come up with anything to suggest. <br><br>Mister R., my take is that the social justice movement has become locked into the Rescue Game so deeply that it can't extract itself, and will continue the game until the last round of Circular Firing Squad is over. The notion that every white person is racist because they benefit from white privilege, for example, is a classic bit of game logic -- remember that in the game, once the role of Persecutor is assigned to a group of people, everything they have ever done and will ever do becomes a deliberate act of persecution, for which they can be bullied by the Rescuers and Victims. Of course the difficulty here is that if every white person is a racist, and will always be a racist, why should any white person bother to make the attempt not to be racist, when by definition they must always fail? That's where you see into the heart of the Rescue Game, with its covert rule: the game must go on forever, and nothing -- especially not any actual improvement in the conditions under which the Victims live, or any actual change in the behavior of the Persecutors -- must be allowed to get in the way of its continuation.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c4326591034688466743 title="comment permalink">4/21/16, 11:42 PM</a><br><br>

The very best definition of "conservative" is someone who wants to conserve what already exists. A penchant for elitism is common to some versions of conservatism, especially those with continental European roots, but by no means to all -- and a great many ideologies going from liberalism to the far left explicitly seek elite rule of one kind or another. I really do need to do a post sometime soon about Burkean conservatism, don't I? <br><br>Danogenes, I'll definitely want to take a look at Frank's new book. Thanks for the heads up!<br><br>TomK, I said repeatedly through my discussion that I was talking about the United States. If you live somewhere else, you've got a different set of privileges, and a different way of assigning who gets how much privilege. <br><br>Fudoshindotcom, exactly. Since the condition of the privileged is presented as normal, those with privilege assume without thinking of it that everyone else has the same privileges they do, and it can be very hard for them to grasp the fact that this just isn't so. Yes, combine that with greed and you get a really ugly mess. <br><br>A D, exactly. "Meritocracy" sounds so good on paper! It's like assigning rank based on who can run a race fastest, when everyone ignores the fact that some people have lead weights shackled to their feet. <br><br>Blueback, thanks for the link. <br><br>Alex, ordinary genetic drift and a bit of natural selection, perhaps with occasional interbreeding with closely related species, accounts for all the genetic variability among human beings quite nicely, yes. Of course there are some societies where interbreeding is relatively discouraged; there are plenty of others where it's not, and even where it is, the amount of genetic exchange can be pretty spectacular -- there are very few white Southerners, according to data-backed accounts I've read, who don't have some African ancestry in the last 300 years or so. Then you place the complex social construct we call "race" over the top of this, and the fit just isn't very good. <br><br>Samurai, that's a story worth pondering. Thank you. <br><br>James, I don't mind at all. Yes, it's a very challenging time to be male, and the use of absolute moralisms by various interested parties to promote an assortment of Rescue Games and grubby political maneuverings doesn't help at all. The process by which established patterns of privilege break down is <i>always</i> a mess!<br><br>Robert, thanks for the clarification! One of the reasons I've decided to talk about the Rescue Game explicitly, and get that concept into circulation, is that I hope it'll help counter the maneuvers of the bullies who like to use it. As for the tangled mess around the masculine and feminine principles, no argument there at all -- in the Western world, certainly, it's right down at the core of the mess we're in, and I suspect it'll take a long age of struggle and suffering to get that finally straightened out. <br><br>Anthony, so noted! It's been my experience that people on the right tend to admit their privilege and then claim that it's justified, while people on the left deny that it's there. Neither position is defensible, and both are in for a world of hurt as the basis for American global privilege and the perks and benefits thereof go away -- but I suspect the impact will be different in the two cases. Still, I'll try to be more evenhanded as we proceed; the gods know there's no shortage of good hard knocks to be handed out to either side.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c807209925938400545 title="comment permalink">4/22/16, 12:06 AM</a><br><br>

I wish I could remember the title but it's got a feather on the cover. He concluded that the only ethical thing is to make little enough to not pay taxes. Kind of like how I live, where I pay all right, but I'm not sure much at all is actual income tax; my payment is going into social security and medicare.

If you are Fijian royalty, you are going to know your genealogy for hundreds, maybe thousands, of years. Same goes if you are a Japanese noble. European Jews were a very inbred group for hundreds and hundreds of years. Intermarriage was very rare before the post-WWII period,exactly when my parents married, and even then, I think it only happened because her father had died and they'd lost everything, and I think she was willing to grasp at any life ring. Trust me my dad's folks were not happy about this! Aside of the treat of quite a number of genetic diseases particular to Ashkenazim, if you think you are one and want to find out by means of DNA, the signal is pretty distinct. You don't get ambiguous results. Believe me I checked all this out before I shelled out $200 for the test, especially on my income! Then if I'm wrong I get to say, Oh, guess I'm Armenian/Navajo/Godknowswhat, better get into the cuisine. And if I'm right, in other words I "win", then I get to shell out more money to have a real genealogist trace my background because it's easier for me to pay them and just make some extra money to do so than to do it on my own. <br><br>Then I'd get to prepare to learn a language which although I think it has a really cool alphabet, and probably live like a college student, very modestly, but at least in a place that actually reminds me of the Honolulu that existed when I was little (Tel Aviv). <br><br>Everyone thinks it's a sand pit over there but it's like Hawaii.

They would say that differences need not become divisions. <br><br>Europe generally doesn’t share the US denial of class. We don’t have a native equivalent of the American Dream meritocracy thing. But that means we can demonstrate the danger of going too far in the other direction – of obsessing about class as a source of privilege at the expense of all others.<br><br>One problem that arises is that people begin to insist that differences should not become sources of division. This is partly a strategic concern because divisions weaken the working class. <br><br>It’s also partly an ethical one but that aspect comes from half-understood, subconscious Christianity I think so it’s a total mess. It’s an insistence that division among humans is bad per se and that unity is good. One of the worst accusations to be thrown at someone is ‘causing division’ while ‘uniting communities’ is a good thing. No one questions the logic of this. <br><br>It’s actually quite narcissistic. They’re lacking in healthy personal or group boundaries. In theory they recognize the idea – as in the dreaded Safe Spaces. But in practice it’s the opposite. You can see it at the micro level where they find it extremely difficult to exclude people who are obviously disruptive and damaging and instead they’ll endlessly appease them. They do exactly the same at the societal level. <br><br>The quest for unity means that the left condemns any attempts by one part of the working class to point to differences it has with another part and to seek to remain divided on that basis. This is explained away as failure to understand their true, objective interests. Those interests of course can only be materialist – economic and political – because socialism is basically materialist. The idea that other forms of privilege, other identities, other interests (like religious ones) can be more important to people and can actually motivate people’s actions, just doesn’t really register. ‘False consciousness’ they’d call it. <br><br>Money and power (in the form of class) is assumed to be the real motivation for anything. Beliefs, worldviews, religions, are viewed as merely rationalizations/justifications for the pursuit of materialist ends. The reality that people will in fact sacrifice power and wealth for what they believe does not compute. <br><br>So, for example, in northern Ireland it’s quite true that working class Protestants and Catholics had common interests economically as a class. But there were other aspects of privilege at work there that mattered to people more than that: imperialism and sectarian privilege. Working class Protestants and Catholics had very different positions on those aspects of privilege and that affected their lives hugely. <br><br>In Europe, the left spends much of its time complaining that the working class refuses to ignore other divisions in favour of class. So, for example, at every terrorist attack they’ll helpfully remind everyone that more people die from poverty or something. Jihadists are then force-fitted into a class analysis where their motivations must relate to money and power. <br><br>Mallow<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c221777631842405059 title="comment permalink">4/22/16, 2:41 AM</a><br><br>

They now have buses segregated by gender in Germany, special women-only parking places near stations and gender segregated times in swimming pools. Women report changing their behaviour by not going out clubbing as much, staying with a group or with male accompaniment, not taking late trains, car pooling rather than using public transport alone etc. Of course this is officially either denied or claimed to be nothing to do with the recent wave of migration, Cologne etc. Sexual harassment of women and persecution of LGBT people by migrants is blamed on overcrowding and boredom in refugee centres. Moral relativists describe it as a ‘cultural quirk’. Absolutely anything other than recognize the existence and importance of cultural and religious divisions.<br><br>Likewise with religiously-motivated violence against Sikhs, Christians, Ahmadis, apostates, Muslims who drink and sell alcohol, women not veiling etc. Some readers may not be familiar with what’s happening in Europe these days. An Ahmadi was recently killed by a Sunni muslim in Scotland for claiming he was a prophet (and doing so as an Ahmadi). Leaflets urging the killing of Ahmadis are distributed in London, including in a mosque, by a sectarian genocidal group affiliated with the mainstream Muslim Council of Britain. A Sikh temple was bombed by Salafists in Germany. A man was murdered for being an apostate. A Kurdish kiosk selling alcohol and two trans women were stoned and muslims drinking in public have been attacked. As have unveiled Muslim women. All in Germany. <br><br>Jews are leaving France in unprecedented numbers for Israel as a result of rising antisemitism – no one is allowed to say so but the increase is coming from the Muslim community (of course it has also always existed in Europe). No one really cares about that because it’s viewed as just misdirected political opposition to Zionism which can be resolved with a little education or something. <br><br>Christians are attacked in refugee centres and LGBT people have had to be provided with separate accommodation because of the level of persecution against them. No one wants to do that for Christians because that would be all Crusadery or something. That’s seen as misdirected political anger at Syrian Christian support for Assad. <br><br>The fact that religion can and does divide the working class is simply denied. Everything is blamed on class and race even within subcultures with completely different ways of assigning privilege. Intersectionality in practice is limited on the left to basically class, race and gender issues. No other forms of privilege are acceptable topics of conversation. If other parts of the world can avoid following our example please do so!! <br><br>Mallow<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c8903906984246714978 title="comment permalink">4/22/16, 2:41 AM</a><br><br>

Could I be super cheeky and repost it here please?! <br><br>Have you any suggestions for how one would go about applying that to migration policies? <br>Western Europe is completely mired in the Rescue narrative on the asylum/refugee system which is now colliding with the reality of mass migration. <br><br>At present, migrants pay €10k to fly directly to Europe with false papers from, say, Afghanistan – a sum that most Afghans will never see. In other words, it disproportionately benefits the more privileged globally, rather than those it was intended to help back in 1950’s Europe. <br><br>I’ve started a campaign trying to put forward a compromise position that could be politically acceptable. It starts from the premise that the needs of current residents of a country should form the basis for setting and implementing limits on migration. If taken seriously, that ‘should’ create political space for an open discussion of who benefits and who loses, and in what way, from various forms of migration. <br><br>It would include, for example, people’s need for decent pay and safety from terrorist attacks to be taken into account in migration policy. That would of course breach EU laws but the EU’s existence and membership are moving targets and such international law is far more a matter of politics than law. I’d expect those trends to continue.<br><br>Then, subject to those limits, I’m saying that refuge should be offered directly first to those most in need of it around the world, not those most able to physically reach a European border – which is the current limit in practice. <br><br>That would cut out the people smugglers, drownings etc. In theory it should also hugely reduce the security risks – because it would focus on people whose real identities and ages can be established (most now destroy their documentation because the system incentivises that) and because, contrary to the Rescue narrative, terrorists are far less likely to be found among that group. I think that flows from the nature of oppression and persecution.<br><br>This element does involve playing the Oppression Olympics. But it seems to me that there are contexts where it’s appropriate to do that. Providing refuge is more a form of charity for those who can’t really help themselves than it is (or should be) a form of solidarity with people who are better able to take care of themselves. <br><br>Engaging in it is also almost politically necessary because a majority of people from all classes do want to help those fleeing war and persecution so the retention of the spirit of the asylum system is necessary. <br><br>I’m trying to redress the balance for wage class people in a way that can be accepted by enough of the political class to be implemented. From what I hear from wage class people, most want to help genuine refugees but, rightly, don’t trust the current system to do that, and they don’t want to be disproportionately burdened with the costs as they presently are. Some seek a shutdown of the whole rotten system, some a total ban on Muslim immigration etc. <br><br>Whatever about the ethics of those positions, I just don’t think they’re remotely achievable in the present political climate here. I’m uncomfortable about putting forward a position which won’t simply amplify those kinds of demands but which I think has far more chance of succeeding in achieving the outcome they’re looking for, because I know how the political classes work. What do you think? Anyone have thoughts on it? <br><br>Mallow. <br><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c1132437140451884412 title="comment permalink">4/22/16, 2:47 AM</a><br><br>

Indeed, I have noticed your focus is on the United States. I consider your first post of 2016, as well as your two previous posts as some of the most informative pieces on US politics I have read. As an outsider reading them, I can't help but look for analogies to trumpism here at home, to make it less off-topic for you: <br>the pauperized Trump voter can be compared to Central and Eastern European (CEE)voter who, post 1989, expected to gradually achieve western European worker standard, but never made it and never will. The US salary class can be compared to the new middle and upper middle classes in CEE, they are our post-1989 globalization winners, along with the oligarchs. The new middle and upper middle class tend to hold views similar to US liberals, but numerically, they are a minority. The current migrant crisis only exposed this. From the EU-elites (academia, media, mainstream politicians) point of view, who look down on CEE countries, kind of like the US liberal elites at the 'red' states, we are now xenophobes who refuse to accept our share of MENA migrants and refugees. These elites want to impose their views on heterosexual white male privilege and guilt on us. (Never mind the migrants themselves refuse to be distributed to CEE anyway...) The ratio of globalization losers to winners within our societies is, thanks to the wealth pump directed from the east to the west, simply different from western Europe. That is why local Trumps already are in power, to a different exent in the various countries. That is why I expect a profound change towards disintegration of the EU. And as for economic future of (north-)western European countries, they should look at us or to the European South. Not, as the religion-of-progress-believers would have it, at the CEE and the South becoming like (north-)western Europe in the future.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c1309223604905702135 title="comment permalink">4/22/16, 3:08 AM</a><br><br>

Cruz's Christian Dominionism w/the Goldman Sachs wife seems to be the poster child for that. I'm recalling your post about Atlantis and Pseudoconservative Satanism right now. It's just that recently I've encountered front and center in my life more of the liberal variety of cluelessness/death wish.<br>Ginger or not, as a white person from the South, I'd be highly disappointed if testing didn't show that I have my "one drop" in there somewhere. I'm pretty hopeful that there's at least some "miscegenation" in my ancestry. Odd how it isn't "miscegenation" when whites &amp; natives mixed...<br>Regarding the election and elite cluelessness, I've noticed a number of articles in the MSM sneering about how Trump just "doesn't get" the whole party delegate selection process. I'm thinking that they just don't get that Trump is deliberately crashing their party and intentionally transforming things. It'll be interesting, in the Chinese curse sense, as this plays out...<br>Regarding Malaysia and "walkabouts" with the locals, I've had the exact same experience here in the U.S. w/migrants. It really amazes me how invisible migrants are in our society--if you have bronze skin and speak Spanish, you simply don't exist except as an invisible hired hand here. It reminds me of stories I've heard where the part of the reason the South lost the Civil War was because they spoke freely around their slaves, treating them as nonexistent, not even considering that they could spy for the North. I've had amazing responses in the migrant community by violating this "white invisibility" rule, by speaking Spanish, knowing rudimentary Mexican &amp; Central American geography--Mexican states and their locations/climates. Even remembering people's names and their children's names. All basic stuff English speaking people expect, but Spanish speaking migrants are normally (not always) literally floored when you break the "invisibility rule" and treat them as individual, real human beings. And BTW, I've been using Spanish with native speakers since high school--you CAN get enough out of basic schooling, but you have the supposition that you CAN speak and understand people, and, even more importantly, that the people you are talking to have something important to say--which is why most Americans get so little from language classes in school...<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c8281039453777793743 title="comment permalink">4/22/16, 4:29 AM</a><br><br>

The debate was triggered by mooted political decisions about legislation restricting immigration.

I was outraged to the point of writing a nasty letter to management; she shrugged it off ("this literally happens to me every time I go into a store"). And then in the library a couple weeks ago the alarm went off as I went through (the books weren't properly demagnetized or whatever that security thing is) and the staff member asked me why I was stealing. I wasn't sure if he was joking or not, but I was angry: How dare you accuse me! because... I'm white! I'm not used to this... I'm used to being given the benefit of the doubt because of my skin color. It's amazing how much those of us with privilege take for granted.<br><br>I'd just like to recommend a book: Grace Matters, by Chris Rice. It's about a white and black community in the south working towards racial reconciliation, I believe in the 1980s-90s.

In an article she wrote for the the Winter 2015 issue of Permaculture Design magazine she says "Privilege is hard to see when you have it, because a lot of it consists of what doesn't happen to you. Because I have white-skin privilege, I get in the car and drive to the grocery store, and don't get pulled over by the cops. I walk around the store and do my shopping, and no one watches me suspiciously. I lose my wallet in Mexico, go to the consulate, and they issue me a travel document without question." Later in the article she said "Acknowledging that I have privilege doesn't mean I have to sink under the weight of guilt. Nor does it invalidate all that I have genuinely earned in life. It just means admitting that the playing field doesn't start out level." So perhaps an isolated event in San Francisco doesn't really define how this woman treats the issue of privilege.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c5195254242382761383 title="comment permalink">4/22/16, 8:43 AM</a><br><br>

Rene Salm, for example, makes the startling claim that Nazareth didn’t exist at the time Jesus supposedly lived. He backs this up with a detailed examination of the archeology around “Nazareth,” and finds it shoddy. “Early Christianity,” in the sense of the Gospels and Paul, is a construct of the second or third generation, and possibly later.

There are three major roots: the New England Puritans, the Jamestown planters and the Scots-Irish. The Puritans were mildly anti-aristocracy for socio-religious reasons - it was the British aristocracy that was trying to stamp them out. The Jamestown planters were pro-aristocracy, while the Scots-Irish were fanatically anti-aristocracy and anti-large-government. It’s easy to see why - they lived on the border between England and Scotland, and had a history of being trampled underfoot by English armies heading North to beat up on the Scots, and Scottish armies heading South to return the favor.<br><br>The mix looks incoherent because it is incoherent.<br><br>@JMG<br><br>About “everyone in Meringa had light brown skin.” That’s not the way the genetics of skin color works. Every once in a while the tabloid press goes ape over “black and white twins.” It actually makes a decent classroom genetics exercise, because the vast majority of the difference in skin color comes down to variation in exactly four genes, each of which is classically dominant/recessive. The only way you’re going to have an even skin tone through a population is if one version of each of those four genes becomes fixed through some mysterious process. In the time frame in the story, that’s unlikely to happen.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c2175496254529931496 title="comment permalink">4/22/16, 9:02 AM</a><br><br>

I've been curious about that for a while, and I suspect it will make a few things clearer for me. There is so much to disentangle, between privilege, doing your "duty", actually conserving things, and walking away from business as usual. Trying to see my own privilege is not easy, and I can see evidence of my own enculturation not to discuss it or class going back to my youth. The irony is that what it comes down to for most of the privileged in the United States is that <i>to truly do one's duty in light of our predicament</i> is to walk away from one's privilege as best as one can. For <i>what else</i> is collapsing now <i>but</i> to walk away from the trappings of privilege and the ways of subsistence that perpetuate it? Sure, there are aspects of privilege that we can't abandon, but the pride and entitlement, as well as the guilt and shame (for not living up to the standard one is expected to meet), <i>not to mention the willful ignorance</i> are aspects that can be. The trick, it would appear, is to do so without getting wrapped back into the sticky web of the rescue game: How do I collapse now without becoming a de facto persecutor, because in my failure to be upwardly mobile I am somehow betraying the system? How does one 'collapse now' and not have their integrity be usurped? It is a helpful tool as I plan my path forward to not allow myself to think of myself as a victim, or a rescuer.

In fact there's even a monument, a sort of table thing, on Paseo de San Antonio, a car-excluded walkway, with that written on it and it's also actually embedded, in brass, on the walkway, a quote by Cesar Chavez about how he spoke English to the bosses and Spanish to his fellow workers. The English/Spanish divide is entrenched, and yes, I think the average English-speaking employer would no more ask his Spanish-speaking workers about their families than he'd ask his forklift about it's. <br><br>Leo Knight - That's the book all right. <br><br>Phil Harris - The amount of "race-mixing" that happens now is a function of industrialization, cheap air tickets, TV/radio/internet, etc. If we're de-industrializing, and I think we are, it's going to go back to distinctive "looks" in different areas even if there was a lot of prior mixing in the old "golden age when men could fly". <br><br>Matt &amp; Jess - I was pointedly followed once here on the Mainland, by a tall black security guy in the Safeway here.

To my mindset, it seems so counterintuitive. But this post has made me realize that my Salary Class (perhaps even egghead intelectual class) mindset has made me blind to the realities of the minority classes (not necessary wage class). The liberal salary class has made honesty, and transparency in political dealings something of a mantra because we can afford it. But members of more disadvantaged groups don't have this luxury. They have to gravitate towards political figures that they believe will protect them regardless of how squeky clean that person is. With the spectre of Trump or Cruz on the horizon it is only more reason to support any powerful figure that might be on your side. While from my view, Hillary is corrupt, a warmongering neocon, and defender of the worst of establishment abuses, to the democratic who is disadvantaged by race , class or circumstances she is an O.G.* ( as my son from my earlier post would say). Like the neighborhood crime boss, she represents benevolent power ( to some) and a consistancy they can trust. * Original Gangster in rap parlance.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c6410205878534621090 title="comment permalink">4/22/16, 3:28 PM</a><br><br>

Reminds me of a post John Scalzi wrote four years ago (http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is/) which I mention only because of the difference in the comments. Don't know if that's due to a different audience, or what you mentioned about a change in times, but John's post engendered much more resistance to the idea.<br><br>Mister Roboto - when you talk about being anti-PC... I think that's because the PC response you mention is a surface response to this recognition, one that wants to assign blame. But as Scalzi points out, privilege isn't what you've earned - it's what you are born with. You didn't ask for it, and it can't be taken away from you. Your only choice is how you respond to it.<br><br>I would make that same point to Shane's comments about how the "liberal salary class" somehow "deserves" what might be coming. Well, Shane, only if you can "deserve" a consequence for an action you did not actively participate in. I tend to believe that responsibility and authority go hand-in-hand.<br><br>As a woman, I am not as high on the privilege scale as some (though just one level down), but if we broaden the boarders beyond our own culture, as an American I'm about as high as they come. So I try to keep my own focus on what I can do to erase those barriers that privilege creates. Admittedly, it doesn't seem like much, but recognizing the issue is an important part of it. I like Chris' point about stepping away from privilege - though here, it's hard to do. No matter what, I'm still white, and still straight and, at this point in time, still receive benefits from that.<br><br>Trish<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c2235408352476986186 title="comment permalink">4/22/16, 3:55 PM</a><br><br>

(ha, ha, lovely analogy eh? Sorry - it just came to me, er, this morning.)<br><br>I know I have it, although almost all of the time, I can't see it. OTOH, I've experienced too many glimpses, glitches in the matrix to disregard it or convince myself it's not there. As fellow commenters have said, the one or 2 times as a white person, you're followed around in a store like a presumed thief, or denied service even though you're the next in the queue, cash up front instead of credit or good faith….small slights that you know less privileged people experience consistently. I find myself latching onto those, fascinated, as they draw back that veil of my own privilege, what would it feel like to go through life with those every single day? It's hard to grasp through, as I know I'd be infuriated - but that in itself is also due to my expectations - based on my privilege! AARGH!<br><br>At the same time, we can see clearly the privilege of others, that they themselves cannot or will not see. I think the cloak of invisibility is partially due to the nature of the thing, it is truly hard to see your own - you can only know intellectually it is there, you can't FEEL it. It's often the lack of abuse, not anything tangible. I think the other part, however, is a willful ignorance of it. Who WANTS to smell their own morning breath!? Who WANTS to feel their unearned, undeserved elevation? Some of us do because we are obsessives for truth and reality, but IMHO, most people just don't want to know. Their lives are fine, why look for what could be trouble?<br><br>Personally, I am born a Libra, gifted or cursed to see both sides, and seem to have somehow straddled two or more 'worlds' my whole life, (too long and boring to explain in full.) I understand exactly what you are saying. I get it. I also understand why my (very) privileged acquaintances and fellow white expats don't see it at all. <br><br>Honestly, I'm terrified of the future. Collapse is going to be brutal. What I don't see is how anyone can say "Time to grab the popcorn!" like it's going to be fun watching other people getting torn down and destroyed, while 'we' sit on the sidelines, perfectly untouched by the earthquake and tsunami. I don't see anyone getting out of this unscathed.<br><br>Not sure, but this may be my last comment for awhile. Boxes filling my flat. We are moving today. Probably moving again in 2 months, (home to the States? don't know.) The ground is already rumbling under my feet. For my family, I THINK that earthquake is already here. <br><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c3553623430593825591 title="comment permalink">4/22/16, 4:17 PM</a><br><br>

Although my understanding is that the skilled political operatives will make certain that they don't directly conflate the two, for example Obama will make mention of the statistic, and will make certain to talk about equal pay for equal work, he generally doesn't seem willing to directly state that women in equal jobs get paid 79% of a man (current stat).<br><br>I'll just point out that the stat is questionable on its face. Knowing what we know about corporate America, when confronted with a brand new workforce, equal in size and training to there current one, which was willing to work for a quarter less pay than there original, do you think they would a) Give thanks to the patriarchy, and praise his mighty schlong, or b) Ruthlessly exploit this in order to crush male wages, thus destroying the gap? Personally I have to go with b) or at a stretch c) both.<br><br>That of course probably wouldn't apply to the highest end jobs which are acquired by personal connections, but I personally don't really care whether the parasitic class possessed of penis unfairly earn more than the parasitic class without.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c7219655835203155232 title="comment permalink">4/22/16, 4:26 PM</a><br><br>

I once saw an funny incident demonstrating this point and the effect that it had on on the people around them. <br> In my salad years I once went to apartheid-era South Africa and was traveling to Natal by train. Sharing my compartment were a couple of young blond-haired young men - Boer descendants almost certainly going by speech and manners. A Japanese guy entered our compartment (with the obligatory camera paraphernalia), smiled, and took his seat.<br> It was my understanding at the time that Japanese were, for reasons of their history, regarded as honorary whites so took their seats with the whites. Remember, this was at a time when the blacks had their own central train station separate from the whites in Johannesburg (guess who went to the wrong train station to pick up his train not realizing, or willing to believe, that there were actually two main train station?).<br> You could see the glances that these boys gave the Japanese guy that there was a bit of cognitive dissonance going on but these were good boys and were not going to make anything of it. Still, they looked as flummoxed as if they had opened a door only to find a blank wall there.<br> Upon reflection, I suppose that claiming privilege, even subconsciously, will always be with us as people are in the end tribal by nature. I wonder if the only way it can be made acceptable is to tie it directly in with competency. That is, you could claim the privileges that go along with being a leader but only if you have a proven track record of leadership. Being made leader because of race, religion political beliefs, etc would simply not hack it. You would have to earn your privileges. Just a thought.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c342797623896182906 title="comment permalink">4/22/16, 6:37 PM</a><br><br>

The enlightenment push to do away with class and stratification does not take into account human nature, and, much like rationalism, damages human society by forcing it to do something it cannot do: eliminate class &amp; social stratification in civilizations.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c5588924904302288435 title="comment permalink">4/22/16, 7:40 PM</a><br><br>

That's all the more reason to find ways to ameliorate the negative effects of privilege on the less privileged, of course -- it's the same logic by which we look for treatments for hereditary diseases. "It's innate" does not equal "it's good," after all. <br><br>Alex, oh, I know. I've had a lot of fun at peak oil gatherings, when one of the participants (almost always a white guy from the middle to upper salary class) starts rhapsodizing about how wonderful it will be when we're all living simple lives in sustainable ecovillages without modern media, etc. I wait for a lull, and then point out that he could have exactly that lifestyle today if he wanted it. The usual result is backpedaling on a heroic scale. <br><br>Davidchuter, I think the term "privilege" is useful enough that it's worth trying to rehabilitate. It's not the same thing as power, though of course there are overlaps -- and if we had to stop using any word that's been exploited and debased for political advantage from time to time, we'd have a hard time talking about most things! <br><br>.Mallow, your comment about boundaries seems very perceptive to me. I hope the European left manages to shake itself out of its current trance, or Europe's probably going to have to make an unwelcome choice between Shari'a and a resurgence of fascism. If I were a fascist demagogue, I'd be rubbing my hands together with glee at the current situation -- the political leadership of most European countries is allowing the emergence of a situation that the vast majority of people in Europe will find intolerable, while blocking any attempt to resolve that situation from within the system. That's a situation tailor-made for a putsch. <br><br>With regard to your broader question, hmm. I don't know that I have anything to offer; so much would depend on the details of opinion, and on who's getting hurt how badly and in what way by the current fiasco. Anyone have a suggestion? <br><br>TomK, it wasn't a dismissal, it's a statement of my own limits; I've never lived in central or eastern Europe, or anywhere else outside the US, and the last thing the rest of the world needs is one more clueless American telling other people what's what! From what you've described, you've got several different levels of privilege overlying each other -- there's one hierarchy within your own country, and over that the broader hierarchy of the EU, in which some countries (or the privileged classes thereof) are decidedly more equal than others. That's a situation most countries get to experience, and the US will be doing so in the years ahead. More on this next week! <br><br>Phil K., that's exquisite, and earns you tonight's gold star. <br><br>Shane, interesting. Out West, marriages between white people and Native Americans were definitely considered miscegenation back in the day. Are you familiar with the role of the villainous half-breed in Western literature? It's a relic of that. <br><br>Phil H., thank you. I ran across it years ago -- I think it was in a James Tiptree Jr. story -- and it explains a lot about human mating habits! <br><br>Matt and Jess, many thanks for the story, and the book recommendation.

The very short form is that you need to know the scoring system first off -- is your score the number of right answers you give, the number of right minus the number of wrong, the number of right minus one-quarter the number of wrong, or what? You choose a different strategy depending on how much a wrong guess will cost you. I scored absurdly high on a national math test in high school, which was right minus wrong, by refusing to guess; if I didn't actually know the answer, I left it blank. Most of my classmates didn't do so, and got clobbered by their missed guesses. <br><br>Next, you always work backwards from the proposed answers, not forward from the question -- it's often easy to figure out that several of the possible answers can't be right, exclude those, and go on, and it's also very often easy to figure out what you need to know to decide which of two or three answers is the right one, and focus your calculations on figuring out that one detail. There are a lot of other angles -- for example, most teachers don't actually randomize the letter of number assigned to the right answer, and when you've taken a few tests they've written, you can usually figure out the unconscious pattern they tend to use; different teachers tend to focus on specific kinds of questions, and you can figure out what you need to cherrypick out of their lectures and the textbook, etc. It sounds complex, but once you learn how to do it, you can get through the public schools with a reasonably high GPA even though you spend every class session ignoring the teacher and writing bad fantasy fiction -- glance up every so often with an intent look on your face, and they'll think you're taking notes.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c3320468312861821075 title="comment permalink">4/22/16, 8:01 PM</a><br><br>

No doubt Colonel Boycott and Charles Lynch both did things other than the ones we all think of when their names come up, too. <br><br>John, my dad has a master's degree in educational psychology, and we've discussed the matter at length, so yes, as it happens, I know some of what goes into IQ tests. Your comment about the tests being culture and value neutral show that you've missed my point completely. What is this thing called "intelligence," after all? Psychologists can't define it in any objective way. As a result, the tacit working definition, the one that underlies IQ tests and a great deal more, is that "intelligence" equals "that particular set of thinking skills that the salary class values." It doesn't matter how much neutrality you try to put into the test if the thing for which you're testing is a selectively chosen set of human mental skills. <br><br>It so happens that I've had the chance to meet a lot of people who aren't good at the kinds of mental skills that people in the contemporary American salary class value. Some of them have been really, really limited where those skills are concerned. What I've noticed consistently is that the great majority of them had different mental skills -- skills that today's salary class-centric culture doesn't happen to value, but that have plenty to offer on their own terms -- and many of these people had those other skills to an extent I never will. The current model of intelligence, as embodied in IQ tests, misses that completely, and the discourse that treats "intelligence" as an objectively defined, value-free label covers over that missed understanding with a thick larding of intellectual arrogance. <br><br>I'll have to look into the situation with skin color; all I can say is that I meet a lot of mixed-race kids where I live, and a very, very large majority of them are the same cafe-au-lait color I imagined for the people of Meriga. <br><br>Pygmycory, by all means adopt a pirate into the family, then! Every family needs a pirate ancestor. <br><br>Shane, got it in one. I read a while back that the reason Louisiana dropped the "one drop" rule is that activists did some digging, and found out that a very large number of the state's richest and most nose-in-the-air white families had at least one drop, and very often quite a bit more than one drop, of African ancestry tucked away there in the family tree. They went public with this, and called on the state to reclassify all the families in question as black. The legislature immediately changed the laws in question.<br><br>Nancy, every society has some justification for its system of privilege, and when one justification gets shot down, another quickly gets cobbled together. Social Darwinism was popular for a while, and in mutated form, still gets the more than occasional airing in the form of claims that our society is really a meritocracy in which the rich and influential have risen to the top by their own ability. (As exhibit A for the other side of that argument, I present George W. Bush.) The Calvinist theory is actually a religious (or pseudoreligious) version of that: the rich are rich because God has rewarded them for their virtue.

It'll be put into place because public order has gone missing in action in a time of social chaos and pandemic violence, and personal loyalty to a competent leader is the one glue that succeeds in uniting a force large enough to stop the killing and plundering and allow some semblance of settled life to continue.

I have a dark suspicion that people living there may believe that what they see is the whole world - and that is not good.<br><br>Anyway, I mentioned your reply to my wife who pointed me to a recent and thoughtful article which discusses this very issue: <a href=http://www.dailylife.com.au/dl-people/dl-entertainment/the-trouble-with-millennial-sitcoms-20160417-go8d6c.html rel=nofollow>The trouble with millennial sitcoms</a>.<br><br>The problem is that whilst I understood that the show was meant to be funny, to me it wasn't. To my mind, it comes across as a drama based on the possible lived experiences of young people in that city. It touches on class issues because, people in the characters race and social class are not meant to be having those sorts of issues. And I deeply suspect that the mental health issues on display in the show have arisen due to the cognitive dissonance between life expectations for that class of person and the characters lived reality - and that is apparently funny to some people. As someone who experienced a "recession that we had to have" as a very young adult, I don't find that the show is particularly funny. It is an interesting show, although it would be nice if they somehow remembered to tell a coherent story, but one cannot ask for everything.<br><br>The article touches on the very subject of class and expectations - which is relevant to this blogs essay - and links to another article which was basically summarised into the concept that: "conversations about millennials that claim to reflect the plight of an entire generation are actually code for the failure of a middle-class ideal." Fascinating stuff and I respect the fact that it is being discussed elsewhere. What do you reckon about that?<br><br>Hi Cathy from Winston Salem,<br><br>I realise that you were replying to JMG, but I thought that you may appreciate a little bit of additional info on ritual.<br><br>You see from my perspective we employ ritual every single day, although we may not realise it. For example, getting up and going to work every week day is a ritual which many of us undertake in order to ensure that tomorrow is much like today. Interesting stuff, huh? <br><br>Anyway, overtime some rituals descend into what we understand today to be superstitions. For example, I'm currently reading a lovely story about northern Italian peasant olive farmers written by an English Lady (Annie Hawes - Extra Virgin) who was actually there. In an amusing side story she talks about the difficulty of convincing the local cafe owner to provide her and her sister with a second espresso coffee (a worthy task!). The café owner, in addition to the various locals, are very reluctant to provide her with that second coffee and they explain to her that a second coffee would close her stomach, which would be a bad thing. Everyone knows that a second coffee will do no such thing and so we treat that belief as a superstition. However, in a land where coffee may be expensive and in short supply, that belief is a good thing as it acts to curb peoples natural bent to over consumption.<br><br>Your task is really to think about what rituals work and what don't given your circumstances and then act accordingly. ;-)! And remember to change those rituals if circumstances change. That is not as easy to do as you would believe!<br><br>Hi Calm Center of Tranquility,<br><br>;-)! It's not easy to do is it and of course we have to ask ourselves the awful question: What is in it for us to continue as things are?<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c974552249676214700 title="comment permalink">4/23/16, 2:59 AM</a><br><br>

And in most European countries, there have been laws since the 1960s that prevent employers offering the same jobs at different rates to men and women. So a supermarket cashier will earn the same irrespective of what sex they are. Maybe it's different in the US. Or maybe this is another of those elite liberal issues - what do we want?

While I lived in Swaziland in the 1990's, there was a civil war in Mozambique winding down after 17 years. The UN set up refugee camps for millions of people feeling that war in Swaziland and South Africa, just over the borders. I attended a couple hour long talk and question session with the head of the UN Refugee Center there at the time and he said the reason they set up the tent cities is the intent is temporary housing so people can go home, refugee is a temporary status and the goal is to get people back to their home country as quickly as possible. <br><br>Europe doesn't have a refugee crisis using that definition of temporary because I don't see the intention of any of the people coming as returning to their home country in a year or two.

I know many people are flat out afraid to discuss the issues of race, and other prejudices, and privilege. It's a touch subject. A subject easier ignored. But it is obvious that it needs addressed. Just the same as we try to avoid the issues of racism and privilege in our society, we use those same tactics to skirt issues dealing with the environment, economy, and frankly any other ideas which are not business as usual. It's unrealistic to expect these issues to be solved if not confronted. Perhaps I missed it, but have you any suggestions for making this discussion discuss-able? Or for convincing others to admit the issues even exist? <br><br>I can't help but think that these problems exist because Western society, and America in particular, has lost touch with the feminine.

Though I spent the majority of my two years there “na roça” of Minas Gerais, in mostly rural, some semi-urban, but all impoverished areas, I spent the last part of it in Belo Horizonte. My initial experience of race related issues was “Wow racism kind of doesn’t exist here, people talk so freely about color and they have so many words to describe every shade of coloring”. But then I was sent to work in a very wealthy suburb followed by a very wealthy part of B.H. and the white/colored divide was palpable. This was further impressed on me when my Mother and brother came to pick me up at the end of my stint and we stayed with a well off family in B.H. who by coincidence we had met in Utah because they were our neighbors at the University family housing where my Dad went to school when I was young. They had a ranch in the mountains that we visited and when I pointed out areas in which I had worked and lived as we passed them, the family was shocked because they were areas in which they wouldn’t even tolerate the thought of stopping the car.

This explains (to me) why there is so much fear and anger about police-on-black violence, when black-on-black violence kills so many more. It's not the number killed last year that makes Black Lives Matter, it's the number that might be killed in a decade to come. It's the knowledge that black-on-black violence is terrible, but self-limiting. The power of a murderous state (in colonial North America, Armenia, Cambodia, Rwanda, Germany, Stalinist Russia, etc.) is not self-limiting regarding the murder of minorities.<br><br>When the genocide gets rolling, physical appearance is the quickest way to separate the "us" from the "them". If skin colors differ, that'll do, but if skin color isn't enough to discriminate, then other features can be found.<br><br>Jared Diamond's writing on the Rwandan genocide (in "Collapse" as I remember it) says that tribal affiliation (Hutu vs Tutsi) was a way to define Us vs Them, but only after the ecosystem had failed to support the population (due to drought) was it necessary to define Us and Them.<br><br>Gene Logsdon wrote on his blog (some months ago) that Germans between WW-1 and WW-2 came to believe that they were threatening to exceed the carrying capacity of their environment.

'What Lynnett Said'! <br><br>As an artist, having worked in Theatre and other visual arts most of my life, I can attest, there is actually a very fine line between 'Starving Artist' and 'Hobo', and the reception and reaction of different classes of people, depending on where/ in what context they meet you is astoundingly sharp and different. It's definitely not the full picture, but still, a very good education how the other half live and get treated, no matter which half you came from. <br><br>I can remember in my 20's/theatre days being feted lavishly by elites -patrons of the arts in a few US cities with opening night parties and balls in which we were indulged and encouraged to fill our tummies, mouths, pockets and handbags with as many hors-de-ouvres as we could carry home, These patrons funded the theatre. Why they wouldn't just allocate those monies to our paltry salaries instead, I don't know. They wanted to meet and mingle with the artists, actors and designers, the tech crews were not invited. They thought it was hilarious that we really did pinch as many petit-fors as we could. The late great comedian, Jerry Stiller used to steal muffins for me from craft services. I also remember for, well, all of my adult life, until we moved away from the US, living in the 'unsafe', dodgy neighborhoods. Dodgy for an outsider, not too bad if you're an insider, really. I also remember thinking, "It's a good thing our phone got turned off, now the bill collectors can't call us, Ha!!" Top-Ramen for .25 cents per meal, boiled with discount, day-old veggies!; clothes, blankets, even news papers on top of me to sleep in the freezing cold, (inside - no heat.) (Newspapers are utterly worthless as blankets, BTW.) Tons of other examples and anecdotes. Living in those dodgy, (non-white) neighborhoods, I think it was impossible not to feel a part of it. As I said, I know I have certain privileges, but as an earnest Social Justice Warrior, I never thought I was fighting for "them", I was fighting for "us". I think that has become ingrained in me now. I don't support Black Lives Matter because I want to save some others, I support it because I'm a mother of 2 teen boys. It makes me viscerally terrified to think of it. Although mine are white and less LIKELY to be shot by some trigger happy yahoo who shouldn't be wearing a badge; I'm not convinced. There is really nothing solid to stop them shooting mine as well if they run out of targets, if mine present themselves as 'the wrong kind of white' on that given day. <br><br>So, thanks, Lynnett. That kind of clarifies for me why I feel so schizophrenic about my own station or class in life. I've spent my lifetime putting the camera on and taking it off. Maybe that makes seeing my own privilege even harder?<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c386069748892678455 title="comment permalink">4/23/16, 4:05 PM</a><br><br>

It actually does have a definition, but it's wonky: it's a particular statistical abstraction derived from factor analysis in psychometry. In other words, yes, it's the thing tested by an IQ test, but it's a statistical "factor," meaning it correlates with particular statistical aggregates from of non-related data sets. Of course you could dispute whether it's "real" or not, and separately, you could dispute its importance or relevance.<br><br>As conformed by the mostly dismissive if not derisive comments above, many think IQ isn't real. But to say that, it seems to me you have to contend with three things: First is factor analysis, which is uncontroversial in almost every other science, second is its stability of measurement, and third is correlation with more directly measurable factors, such as high school graduation rates.<br><br>You have to explain why factor analysis is perfectly uncontroversial in fields from sociology to metallurgy to quantum mechanics to climatology, but why the same methods of factor analysis are invalid in psychometrics. For example the recent discoveries of the Higgs boson and of gravitational waves are entirely factor analysis---- the amount of data collected at the LHC is on the order of zettabyte/day (a million million gigabytes per day). The "discovery" of the Higgs boson was not an observation, but a profoundly intricate exercise in data analysis--- so yes the Higgs boson is a "factor": a statistical abstraction which simplifies multiple observed correlations in data aggregates. Correlation of measured IQ is tight with many other measures: if your IQ is under 80, there is virtually no chance you'll finish high school. If your IQ is under 95, there is virtually no chance you'll get a degree at any university. If your IQ is under 115, there is virtually no chance you'll earn a medical degree or a Ph.D. Your IQ at age 20, even accounting for wealth and ethnicity, is a good predictor at age 40 of many aspects of privilege we're discussing. The point is that IQ measurements are both stable and predictive. To me, that makes IQ real enough to at least be an issue to consider.<br><br>The reason I'm jumping in to this particular ring is that it seems to me that intelligence is an immense source of privilege, particularly in our current cultural configuration, and is something beyond simply class (if you're born wealthy but your IQ is 85, there is still almost no change you can get a college degree, and you're even unlikely to finish high school).<br><br>In a discussion of privilege, dismissing IQ out of hand seems to be a mistake, particularly in a technological society which immensely privileges the ability to manipulate abstraction.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c9186095974351603875 title="comment permalink">4/23/16, 4:22 PM</a><br><br>

I think one of the places the rescue game has played out most strongly is in the environmental movement.I worked quite a bit at environmental organizations in the 70s. In the summer of 77 I was on the Greenpeace boat, the Rainbow Warrior trying to stop Norwegian &amp; Icelandic whaling in the North Sea. We had put in to port at Lerwick in the Shetlands.<br>A couple of friends &amp; I went to the pub, as one does,where we met a Norwegian biology grad student who was sailing his sloop single handed up around Iceland and Greenland:a very nice guy and quite an accomplishment. He mentioned that he had been on the Norwegian sealing fleet as a biologist observer the preceding summer and that he was so horrified that he would like to help Greenpeace in any way he could. As this was one of their main campaigns and he had inside information, we were quite excited about it. When we went back to the boat, we quite excitedly told the commissar ( I'm sorry, but I can't think of another name for his position) about our meeting. He looked at us in disgust and said" I wouldn't even speak to anyone who had been on the sealing fleet" So, once one had been designated a persecutor, one remained a persecutor. The attitude would have seemed to fit quite well in the inquisition or the soviet purges. I'm afraid my career in the environmental movement didn't last much beyond that point. The commissar's position might have been toward the extreme end of the spectrum, but it was not untypical.<br>cheers, Steve<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c551137926286636558 title="comment permalink">4/23/16, 4:29 PM</a><br><br>

In general, the sort of person who cares about the state of coral reefs on the opposite side of the world is nearly always the sort of person who either could afford to fly there to go SCUBA diving or the person who expects that the high-paying job they will surely get sooner or later with their university degree would enable them to do so.

I'm suggesting that it's been selected out of a much broader range of human mental abilities and given its current status as a marker of privilege because, as I've said repeatedly, it represents the current salary class notion of what high mental functioning happens to be.

However, most of the tests are biased towards English-speaking people who grew up in Western civilization. That's why I favor tests like the Cattel one which, while still using some English here and there, has a lot of basically, puzzles. I was so hungry that day, no breakfast as had become as common as not in those times, and I'd had to take the bus downtown. I only remember some triangles but I remember telling someone the questions felt like learning to tie a square knot for the first time, behind your back. They were kind of fun. <br><br>I wear my 162 proudly and have not thrown my MENSA acceptance form, but I must say this: I barely exist, at the US poverty rate and with no running water. I know and have known a lot of people like me, high-IQ but either born into the wrong class, family fortunes gone the way my family plummeted into poverty, or just plain can't stand the bullshit. <br><br>However, if your IQ is 85 or 90 and you are rich, you'll get tutors, private schooling, and they'll teach you to row or play field hockey. In fact, at a gym I used to go to in Costa Mesa, California, I befriended a big and muscular, dull, but pleasant fellow, who I later recognized in a book as a noted rower.

I was born after WWII but well before the great shift in manners that began in the 1960s. In those days women were regarded as the weaker sex, which barred them from taking certain jobs or riding on the outside of cable cars, but as compensation, men were expected to extend certain courtesies to them. If a man had been taught proper manners when he was young, he would automatically:<br><br>1. Stand up and offer his seat on the bus to any woman who boarded.<br>2. Open a door and hold it open for any woman who was approaching it, whether he knew her or not.<br>3. When entering an elevator, stand aside until all the women and children had entered; the same on exiting.<br>4. If traveling by automobile, the man would open the passenger door, wait for the woman to seat herself, shut the door, walk around to the driver's side and get in, because a woman never drove herself if a man was available.<br>5. When walking with a woman on a sidewalk, take the position nearest the street. Hold his umbrella over her if it rains.<br>6. When sharing a meal at a restaurant, help the woman off with her coat, hang it up on a hook or the back of her chair, pull the chair out, wait for her to sit, ease the chair back in, and then seat himself.<br>7. Remove his hat when entering a dwelling where women are present (because the home is the female domain).<br><br>Some of these courtesies were and still are extended to the elderly of both sexes, and to people with a cane or crutch or carrying packages. The basis being the same, that in a civilized society, the weak and elderly receive protection from the young and strong. <br><br>For the most part these courtesies were due to all women. OTOH, some men made a distinction between "ladies" who should be treated chivalrously and "women" who didn't deserve courteous treatment. For men who made that distinction, the manners, dress or skin tone of the gal in question might decide the matter.<br><br> <br><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c4016962692244363105 title="comment permalink">4/23/16, 9:58 PM</a><br><br>

In fact, you're not alone because I actually feel a little bit sad for people experiencing the sort of day to day problems that are narrated in that show. The writer (and originator) of the show has been touted as the voice of her generation - and that may well be the case, certainly she is very switched on. The show from my perspective is documenting a decline in the perquisites of her generation and I haven't found that story to be at all funny.

A tidy bit of work that. He also holds a PhD in science and I have no idea what his PhD was all about. None. It did involve a lot of rats and that seemed to be a good thing to me as rats can be a serious nuisance, but on reflection it was possibly not good for the rats themselves.<br><br>One day many years ago, he was standing in front of a lemon tree here which had a huge number of bright yellow fruit hanging off it and he said to me that: "Australia has to import oranges because we just can't grow citrus here." Now I like the guy, but he was way serious in that assertion and I was so gobsmacked by his assertion that I was left utterly speechless and without an appropriate response. I mean what do you say to that?<br><br>Look, all I'm saying to the commenters here is that if it makes your phallus feel big that you have personally scored a high IQ in an otherwise arbitrary test, then good for you. To my mind it's an arbitrary test and I don't believe that the many real problems that we are facing as a society can be addressed by sitting on ones laurels and day dreaming about a high IQ score.<br><br>I wouldn't join a group like Mensa even if they offered me free membership.

I have a friend who trained to be an account in the 1970s. He went straight from school at age 16 to a local accountancy firm and was fully qualified by the age of 22. He related to me that over the years since he noticed that qualification entry levels to accountancy training programs kept getting higher and higher. In his time it was ‘O’ levels, then to ‘A’ levels (taken at age 18) and then to a degree (age 21). This was confirmed to me by a client in 2000. His son was trying to get on to a graduate accountancy program with the big London firms, but was not getting even an introductory interview. The father was very wealthy, his son had gone to a top private school, achieved very good grades, then when to Cambridge and achieved a 1st in a BSc. Apparently you now require a degree in accountancy to even get a look in the door. The son did eventually get his graduate training position but only because his father had contacts with the firms due to his business interests. The point of the story is that competition at the top end of the salary class has become very intense since the 1970s, and the belief among them that they have earned their position by merit and hard work has a basis in reality for them, and conversely they do not see the privileges they have that they can at least play the game to which most are excluded. Only the big accountancy firm’s offer training today, the smaller local firms will only employ qualified accountants.<br><br>JMG you have pointed out in the comments that race is a social construct. I would like to give you a prime example. In the UK many official documents require a form answered stating your ethnic group for purposes of monitoring diversity issues. My father is Irish, born in Northern Ireland. Does he tic the White-British box or the White Irish box? Further my father’s older sisters and his parents were born in the Irish Republic so would count as White-Irish. He could claim an Irish passport as his father was born in what became the Irish Republic and could therefore claim White-Irish status. One family, two ethnic labels, nonsense!<br><br>Further I see the White-British tic box disappearing soonish. I work in a 16-18 age sixth form college in a prosperous town, nearly all white and heavily salary class. In enrolment week my job is to photocopy the Learner Agreements. As it is a boring job I took to sampling the nationality entries on the forms. Ten years ago there were some stating ‘British’ rather than English, five years ago few stated British, and last year I did not come across one stating British. This included those whose names were of East Asian, South Asian, or African origin. They had also all put down English rather ‘British’. It used to be that when the political and chattering classes talked about the British they really meant the English, which riled the other nations in the UK. Not anymore. Even PM David Cameroon in his address alongside President Obama referred to himself as European, as British, and as ‘English’! I am seeing more separating out of the English and British identities, with the self-declared British being a small minority from private schools, elite universities, the upper salary class, the military and older age groups. I see the British identity either fading away, or suddenly dropped because it has become the defining word for a very unpopular class!<br><br>Keep on writing JMG<br><br>Regards Philip<br><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c3228960606069345063 title="comment permalink">4/24/16, 7:19 AM</a><br><br>

That's why Plessy v. Ferguson was such an odd case, b/c there were all sorts of times in Louisiana where light skinned people had privilege and were not considered "colored" or "as colored" as darker people. Eventually, though, as you mentioned, Louisiana did adopt a classification system more like the rest of North America. Maybe others know more about this, or know what to cite--I know I heard or read it somewhere.<br>I've always thought that the South was more "colored" in culture than the rest of North America, and that the South's sharp distinction in culture came from its African influences. There's just no way that the South resembles Northwestern Europe, despite its claims of English/Scottish heritage--it is not industrious, it is not reserved/standoffish/cold, it is not disciplined--it's laid back, hospitable, easy going way of life is more in keeping with the global South than with Northwestern Europe. It's interesting to me that the stereotypes placed on the South (lazy, corrupt, tribal, traditional, slow, backwards) are the same stereotypes placed on countries of color in the global South.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c3038225820413493051 title="comment permalink">4/24/16, 1:37 PM</a><br><br>

I was just barely 18 when I took the test and as mentioned, I thought it would help me get a job somehow. It's a real bunch'a nerds though and not necessarily in a cool way. The last time I went, in the late 90s, it was because a chess nut friend of mine was a member and I decided, why not? The people (mostly) weren't a bunch of unemployed misfits but had solid jobs like programmer, nurse, etc. But several were in awe of me because I bought and sold stuff on Ebay and made my living that way.

Ferguson, society got organized on a black/white scale and the "one drop" rule and all that. So lots of people who did not consider themselves black, were now black and had to live in the "black" areas and could only do "black" occupations etc. This is the kind of background guys like Jelly Roll Morton came from. His family was appalled that he played that "low down" music and he kept it a secret from his family as long as he could. <br><br>Another example is something I was reading, not sure if it was Noam Chomsky or one of his "fellow travelers" but they were going around with some activist from S. America, here in the states. The S. American guy was dismayed at how he was being treated, as he was, while fairly light, brown skinned. It was explained to him that it's because he's not a white guy, and the guy said, "But back home, I *am* the white guy". <br><br>I've related how being white in Hawaii is not a bowl of cherries, and I've always thought of myself as white, but - and this is the funniest thing - it's taken me a long time to realize I'm "white" rather than white. It started with my learning to be careful taking photos of electronic surplus for Ebay listing, in that, if I had to hold something up, I had to take great pains to keep my hands out of the picture because somehow, in the viewfinder, my hands look very brown, and the guy I work for is not that brown. OK, I figured, that's just "tan". Then, I was in a cafeteria where it's often crowded and you sit with strangers at the table, and I ended up eating and talking with this Chinese guy, and the subject of ethnicity came up and he told me, "You're not white", and so I said, "Well, then, what am I?" and he kind of peered at me and said, "Italian?". The final straw has been that we've had something like a real winter here and between that and getting essentially no sun for months on end now, I'm still brown. So, in a place like Hawaii, I'm white, and in places like the Mainland sun belt I'm "white enough", and I suspect that in the pale North, I'd be "ethnic". <br><br>BTW getting back to the old-stock ruling families of Hawaii, I was trying to look up dear old Miss Wilder, my childhood friend who lived around the corner, with her Steinway grand and membership in the Pacific Club, where we went to lunch once. Miss Wilder was elderly, and was a member of the Wilder family, one of these ruling families. I could not find her; being an old spinster they may not have been proud of her but if you look up the Wilder family you'll find pictures of 'em all at the beach etc and they have kept their family lineage "pure". They've been in Hawaii since the mid-1800s and there's been no acquisition of melanin.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c1172031750864815141 title="comment permalink">4/24/16, 4:27 PM</a><br><br>

For example, I remember reading that the typical member of an isolated Papua New Guinean or African tribe would usually score in the 60's, which is a score reserved for the least intelligent 2% or so of Western civilization. I have a hard time believing that there is actually anything wrong with these people's brains (especially because very genetically similar humans who have spent a few generations in civilization get 'normal' scores). It is likely just that the kind of brain activities civilized people learn to do (lots of symbolic manipulation) predispose one to high performance on a test like the one you shared. I have no doubt that like nearly every other characteristic of the human organism that there are slight racial differences that are outweighed by individual genetic variation and further modified by epigenetic factors and individual life history factors.<br><br>I'm a fourth generation white European symbolic manipulation professional. I would certainly hope and expect that I'm better at it than a tribesperson from Papua New Guinea, but trying to extract some sort of "my gray matter is better than yours" superiority from it is pathetic - I might as well tell the tribesperson that my car is stronger than him.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c8932123305404833481 title="comment permalink">4/24/16, 5:29 PM</a><br><br>

Comparing New Zealand to Australia, for example, shows big differences along the lines you noted, despite the similar European-dominated history with about the same degree of suppression/oppression of the native tribes, to where they hardly play any role at all in modern society. <br><br>My husband, Shinobu, has long felt closer to my relatives in the American South than those from the North, despite a continuing underlying reality of racism (which we never personally encountered, but heard about second hand). He reacts viscerally to the hypocrisy of the northern half, who pretend to do good, all the while scheming. Japan is nearly identical in climate to the American South, so i wonder if that has a lot to do with "sensibilities." I began thinking that in a colder climate, you might need to scheme to survive, but OTOH, Shinobu loves our Siberian friends, where it appears that nine-tenths of the people do not "scheme," which frankly surprised him. So, yes, I am just speculating, but if we look far enough north, it may be that the climate is so harsh that trust and cooperation become essential again, whereas in northwestern Europe, where the cold is ameliorated by the Gulf Stream and they have had the resources to develop a long-term civilization, scheming skills became and remain critical to survival.<br><br>I suppose the good news is that if the Gulf Stream ever shuts down, as they say it might, Europe will quit being such a menace.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c9093544410892062560 title="comment permalink">4/24/16, 5:32 PM</a><br><br>

The writer David Wolfe wrote a short piece about stock-car racing in the South, in the 1960s, when it was just starting to get a bit of respect. He pointed out that even having a car was still a pretty new thing. I remember reading some book written in the 1960s about "poor" people in Appalachia and they were hunting, fishing, growing their own crops, etc., and only did a little - could only do a little - for "cash money". Your husband is naturally gravitating toward people who haven't been immersed in this modern "all for one and every man for himself" culture that we're in now. Frankly, reading that book, it sounded to me like the folks in Appalachia didn't have it so bad, and now I realize they were living the life those of us who are "collapsing early" strive for. <br><br>Again on IQ tests: I was barely 18, my life was collapsing around me - even faster than it had been - and I think I'd heard of MENSA trough OMNI Magazine, a geeky periodical of which I was fond because I didn't know any better. Yep, I'm the idiot who, when they described this new thing called a "Rubik's Cube", thought it was a contest to figure out how it worked, freehanded a rather nice exploded diagram of the unseen device's guts, and actually got it right. They sent me a nice letter on silver(!) paper telling me it was not a contest but the drawing was very nice and thanks for being a reader etc. etc. I had no idea of eugenics, social Darwinism, or the kind of negative-sum society we'd devolve into. I just thought somehow it might help me get a job. I was not going to have a place to live shortly, and jobs were exceedingly rare. I worked at the Baskin-Robbins and at the gas station. <br><br>From what little experience I have at farming, it just takes being organized, doing at least a little bit every day, knowing how to observe things like bugs and plants and what the birds are doing, take care of your animals, etc. I lived on a "permaculture" place for a while and I learned a lot, but more and more people moved there and we "farmed" more drama than anything else. Someone told me about this phenomena once, the analogy being the volunteer fire department. You start a volunteer fire department, and all kinds of capable, gung-ho people join, and things are great, but of course you're going to get some troublemakers and all-around sourballs too. So, some of the more capable people get tired of the drama and leave. And as people get "filtered" through the volunteer fire department, it fills with more drama and the people who are on the ball get tired of the drama and leave, and pretty soon you have a bunch of drama-mamas who don't have much else to do, and it's just No Fun. That's why I'm very wary of places like Dancing Rabbit and so on.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c7807172526688012572 title="comment permalink">4/24/16, 8:53 PM</a><br><br>

I grew up at that border between farm and town, kept chickens and rabbits, had a garden, hunted and fished with my dad. My husband's folks are teachers, high school and kindergarten. He grew up near the line between urban and village, kept chickens, had a garden, hunted and fished with his dad. He immigrated to the USA from Western Africa as an adult. We had pretty similar childhoods in many ways: same social class.<br>So, we'd been married a couple years, and we were renting a place with a little spot we could have a garden, and we had the usual vegetables. He was juggling our toddler and our infant, and I was canning tomatoes in a boiling water bath, as I'd learned from my mother as a kid. Sauce, I think. He watched me, for a while. And then he said, "Why the (profanity) did the Peace Corps volunteers never teach us to do that?"<br>His people had to buy canned tomatoes imported from Europe. In spite of growing excellent tomatoes, no one ever offered instruction on how to preserve them. Now boiling water bath canning is pretty easy to do safely: it can be done in any pot big enough over any heat source that gets it hot enough. There's absolutely no reason to not teach it, except that there's no profit in teaching it. And probably, nowadays, there are precious few Peace Corps volunteers who ever learned.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c8274321122425984424 title="comment permalink">4/24/16, 10:28 PM</a><br><br>

That's all the more reason to find ways to ameliorate the negative effects of privilege on the less privileged, of course -- it's the same logic by which we look for treatments for hereditary diseases.“<br><br>I’m thinking of ways that a culture and society can ameliorate the negative effects of privilege on the less privileged.<br>One obvious way is through the “rule of law”. Laws limiting working hours of children during the industrial revolution, laws prohibiting slavery, the Miranda warning given to suspects by police, etc. Of course the downside is that the privileged tend to write and enforce the laws, but even so, the process does work at least some of the time in societies that are not completely corrupt.<br>Another way is through the less privileged organizing themselves into groups that can push back against abuse of power by the more privileged. Unions are a prime example. Temporary groups can be formed to boycott businesses whose owners exploit customers and workers.<br>And another already mentioned is “Noblesse Oblige, the French phrase literally meaning "nobility obliges". It denotes the concept that nobility extends beyond mere entitlements and requires the person who holds such status to fulfill social responsibilities, particularly in leadership roles.“ This depends on an inter-generational tradition, training, and expectation of certain kinds of behaviours of the part of the more privileged. In the past, I believe this was part of the concept of a personal “code of honor”. In turn, the idea of honor is connected with the idea of shaming. If one did the dishonorable thing, one was publicly shamed by one’s peers. This can be a powerful force if used correctly.<br>Does anyone have anything to add to this thread?<br><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c314285185820118345 title="comment permalink">4/24/16, 10:31 PM</a><br><br>

First, I am living proof that being a member of Mensa can be a fluke and in no way guarantees you're going to be successful or wealthy. I got in by virtue of taking the Duke TIP program SAT when I was 12 and got a score that got me into college twice (I never took it again) but that didn't stop me from getting pregnant at 16 and pretty nearly ruining my life completely. This leads to the class issue. Neither of my parents finished college, and we were not wealthy by any stretch of the imagination. In Jr High I figured out that being smart wasn't particularly helpful when having money was what really counts. I realized I was not part of the "in" crowd and was never going to be, nor did I particularly want to be. For the heinous crime of having no interest whatsoever in fashion or gaming of any other acceptable topic, I was and still am a social outcast because if you're wealthy, you can get away with it. If you're not, you can't.<br><br>Someone mentioned how the Jewish community invites people over for Friday night dinner. Here in Lexington, where I have lived since 1989, I and my husband, who has also never graduated college, have never been invited to the homes of the wealthy elites here. And it's not because they're afraid we're not kosher enough - as the mashgiach at our shul, I can assure you in this liberal community, most of the wealthy families don't keep kosher and don't know how. No, it is strictly a society (not just the Jewish community but all of Lexington) that is heavily stratified by class. <br><br>We are not wealthy primarily because once I did get my feet under me again, I quickly got sick of playing the status game. My first degree is in architecture, but back in the day that was a big old boys network and though they were happy to hire me to do doc prep, secretarial work &amp; bookkeeping, nobody would hire me as a draftsperson or designer. Disillusioned, I became a stay at home mom for several years. We had one car and no frills. When the kids were all school age, I decided to go back to college and try something different. This was in 2003, and I got a degree in Philosophy with minors in linguistics and religious studies, planning to teach humanities. Well, I graduated in 2007, right as the financial crisis was starting in earnest here and schools cut humanities teachers almost completely out of their programs. Strike two. <br><br>So now I decided the world sucks and I need to help make it better, so I became a SJW in my own way, by doing bookkeeping and admin services for small nonprofits and local NGOs. Many of my clients can only pay $10 or $12 an hour, and I wasn't interested in money grubbing anyway. (I was never interested in keeping up with the Goldsteins, another crime.) <br><br>So my work brings us to race. I wanted to help with the black lives matter movement. Although I can easily pass for white (my dad was a scot irish non jew) my maternal lines DNA test showed me to be 92% MENA and 8% sub-saharan African, as my grandmother's maternal line came originally from Morocco, apparently. She, my mother and my oldest son am have beautiful olive Mediterranean complexions. My sister and I look like death warmed over, though, and it quickly became obvious that BLM didn't want my help because I was not black enough. (It seems to me they have arrived already at the circular firing squad stage, they are quite willing to shoot down help.)<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c6581019778407631612 title="comment permalink">4/24/16, 10:43 PM</a><br><br>

Then the second week of April my middle son lost his job and had to move back home. Last year we downsized to a small house with a good yard for gardening, so we had to drop everything and begin building (with our own hands) a room for him in the basement. So I was particularly busy, because we are one of the few who still believe home is where you absolutely take family in. <br><br>On a side note, we live about three blocks from the city homeless shelter, and I often wonder where are the parents, siblings or children? (I doubt seriously all of the homeless are violent drug users...) But someone mentioned most Americans would slam the door and I think they are correct. Americans no longer believe they have any obligations even to their own family if it would inconvenience then in any way.<br><br>Anyway, guess which two of my clients completely disrespected my boundaries set forth in the email about not contacting me unless it was an emergency (which in the bookkeeping work would be a nasty-gram from the IRS or the FBI kicking in your door)? 1) the wealthy white lesbian business owner who is also president of a local nonprofit, and 2) the wealthy white male gay judge who likewise is a nonprofit org pres. They are both high up on the local SJW scene.<br><br>The lady's org serves in part the undocumented immigrant community, and of course hired a girl who speaks Spanish but is now leaving the org. The girl said to me recently: who decided to do this program? Did anybody ask the Latino community if this is something we want? And thinking of JMG's words I have realized I was caught up in the rescue game. This org needs to raise $150,000 a year min to operate. When I ask myself if that's the best use of that much money for the local community, the answer is definitely no. But the wealthy SJW wants to do it, and she got all her wealthy friends to donate. Some of which I know from shul, people who would hardly give me the time of day, much less invite us to their home. Their concern for the less well to do is an abstract thing to them, that gets their names in newsletters.<br><br>So Saturday night we hosted what my friend and I called the Seder of Outcasts, people who regularly attend services but are not invited by the elites. It was partially pot luck, and we all had a good time anyway with Haggadot I borrowed from shul so we could all be on the same page, 16 of us. And I thought to myself: here are the people who really understand and who can adapt to what's coming, even if they can't believe it just yet. The big donors will be paralyzed and perplexed. I have decided to try and disengage from several of my clients and focus on getting my home and garden up to snuff. I can't save the world. It doesn't want to be saved. I may not even be able to save myself.<br><br><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c904650559134172135 title="comment permalink">4/24/16, 10:44 PM</a><br><br>

Does IQ measure something that actually exists, and that correlates closely with certain kinds of success in today's society? Of course. Is that one set of mental abilities the only valuable thing that human beings can do with their minds? Not at all -- it's just the set that today's salary class values, for the usual culturally conditioned gallimaufrey of reasons. <br><br>Alex, yes, just as Ted Cruz has to hire dates. <br><br>Cherokee, your friend standing there in front of the lemon tree is, I think, the best single metaphor for today's educated cluelessness I've yet encountered. Thank you. <br><br>Nancy, as I argued in a post here <a href=../../2015/07/the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-two.html rel=nofollow>a while back</a>, one of the things that sets modern urban life apart from any previous mode of human existence is the nearly complete exclusion of the feedback from nature with which our species evolved. It wouldn't surprise me at all if one result of this is that a very large number of people exposed to that setting simply went gaga. <br><br>DaShui, I hope he is. I chose a position on the fringes of contemporary society because that allows me to say absolutely anything I want, but the downside of that is that more respectable voices have to give what I say a signal boost if it's going to have any kind of large scale effect. This last month or so, it does seem as though I'm getting that signal boost!<br><br>Philip, thank you for the heads up! When national identities begin to reshape like that, it's a useful warning sign that the nations themselves will follow in due time. <br><br>Alexes, granted, but there's another issue that needs to be kept in mind -- the tendency of the privileged to think that they know what the unprivileged need better than the unprivileged do. That way lies a dozen different brands of failure. From my point of view, the privileged need to learn to listen to the unprivileged -- it's something that, by and large, we're not very good at -- and work with them rather than for them. Oh, and remember that not all unprivileged groups are segregated in urban settings; many are segregated in rural ones...<br><br>Donald, that seems like a useful first approximation. <br><br>Alex Blaidd, hah! Nicely put. <br><br>Shane, the South also shared the same economic role as the rest of the global South, as a plantation-economy source of raw materials for factories elsewhere. Knowing that your role in the global economy consists entirely of being exploited for the benefit of rich people in a distant country does tend to encourage a laid-back attitude toward work. <br><br>Blueback, did you expect anything else? The US occupied Britain in the early 1940s -- yes, there was a war going on, and the British by and large accepted our overlordship in place of the imminent alternative -- and it's been one of our imperial possessions ever since. Of course the US is going to clear his throat and tell the natives what they can and can't do; the British did exactly the same thing with their overseas possessions back in the day, after all.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c8848245725940449204 title="comment permalink">4/24/16, 11:24 PM</a><br><br>

There was a Saturday Seder at the local Reform shul that I considered going to, but I was not feeling well, and frankly, I'd like to wait until the DNA test thingie is done, because I was told *so* many stories... Maybe I'm Armenian by way of Germany? Or ... Italian? I want to think I have a leg to stand on if I show up. The local Reform place is probably pretty much OK, having been founded in 1860 or so and most people are pretty down to earth here in this area. There's always Chabad, too, as we all know. <br><br>Home is where when you show up at the door, they have to take you in. I have tons of WASP relatives no doubt, but they'd not lift a finger to help me if I were homeless. On my mom's side, the possibly Jewish side, there was just her and her sister, both gone now. I suspect families dying out is going to be a real thing like in Orlov's collapse-Russia. Well, in Israel, if you are family, they have to take you in. If I were Irish (you can move there if you can prove you are) I'd be skedaddling for there. <br><br>In the US, people are kind of disposable. You can be a war hero, an outstanding athlete, any number of things and if you hit hard times, you'll end up homeless. Normal societies don't work this way.

We're a rather oddball group of people, most of whom are lower-middle class or below. This adds up to a certain amount of trouble with finances, but also a different feeling and way of functioning. There's a useful amount of mutual support, ranging from the fact that if anyone knows you aren't visiting family and don't have family locally you WILL get invited to christmas or thanksgiving dinner by someone, to food available for take-home at church to anyone who wants it, to emergency help with groceries if you can't afford it, or one time when someone got evicted suddenly an email was sent round by the pastor asking for a place for them to stay that night, or a ride to the vet for someone with a pet and no vehicle.<br><br>I really like it there, and I've gotten more involved than I was at my previous church. I've made some good friends, and consider myself blessed to go there.<br><br>There's a mildly amusing story about how I started going there. I'd just moved cities, and had been thinking that I'd like to get involved in community gardening, and also that I hadn't been happy at my previous Anglican church. There was this church just down the street, and one day I was walking past when I noticed someone building what looked like boxes for raised beds. So I asked him 'is that a raised bed?', and he said that yes, it was.<br><br>The next sunday was Easter, and I didn't have a church yet, so I just turned up. I started talking to the pastor, and by the end of the conversation I'd volunteered to run the garden that was being built, since they didn't have anyone and I had some skill with food gardening and the interest. Five years later, I'm still point person for the garden, although this year it looks like there will be more help, which is great.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c3000726881685083768 title="comment permalink">4/25/16, 12:18 PM</a><br><br>

When I served in the 90's it was a lot of high school teachers in math and science, business skills, or HIV education. Would food preservation be helpful? Sure probably. But given the subsistence level most people are live at, the lack of doors with locks, and a culture where accumulating a storage of food is seen as selfish and would get one run out of the village, no, food preservation wouldn't be anything people would actually use. <br><br>Now all that said, volunteers often create extra projects to do with the people they live with. Those projects rely on the volunteer getting funding on their own and providing all their own man power and materials, but they do happen. This is how villages get water, schools get libraries, and many many children get shoes and tuition paid for school (school isn't free in the third world).<br><br>With the Peace Corps each volunteer in each country has a very individual experiences and it is common that volunteers are frustrated by what they can do or accomplish, or the thing they are supposed to be doing seems so worthless in relation to what the people actually need.

It recalled for me a recent diversity training that I attended where we spent a good bit of time looking at the issue of privilege which was quite eye opening. It made many in the group feel like fish raising themselves out of the water and seeing the water for the first time. We might catch glimpses of privilege every once in a while, but we tend to move on and not think about it.<br><br>The other thought that I had related to Graves' Spiral Dynamics and the rise of the green "cultural creative" meme which first became prominent late in the 20th century and some say is now a third of western society (or more). This worldview sees a world where everyone is valued, all needs must be considered and anything that smacks of hierarchy is looked on with disdain (even though such a viewpoint is hierarchical in the roots of its thinking). In other words, such individuals tend to think "my (better) viewpoint says that everyone is equal and anything that operates in the world towards inequality is to be fought and destroyed so as to ensure the equality". Such individuals have worked towards civil rights and bend over backwards to ensure they are seen as someone seeking equality and justice and wants to distance themselves as much as possible from being called "racist". These are the people that Bill Maher went on about at the end of his show the other night. Yet, most of these people are able to evolve to such a level of thinking because of this system that created their privilege and advantages in life. If they think too much about privilege, it brings up the system's inherent hierarchy that they run from....only this time, they have no power to change it (if they wanted to).<br><br>Thank you for raising the issue. Yes, it is the fringes where real change starts, keep up the good work.<br><br>Mark Gilbert<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c3825208977676775146 title="comment permalink">4/25/16, 2:24 PM</a><br><br>

It was pretty staggering wasn't it? Feel free to use that example too. Even today, I still have no idea how to respond to such an outrageous claim.

That the wealthy Jewish people who never invite you over "Don't keep Kosher and don't know how" means they've essentially sold out to the greater WASP culture. There's a saying I'm sure you know, "The Jews have kept the Sabbath and the Sabbath has kept the Jews". There are also those who say assimilation is doing what Hitler was doing. I tend to agree. Now, I can understand why my mom married my WASP dad - her father had died when she was 12 or so, her family was collapsing, and they may have already not been very observant. So here comes this guy with a bright future, and who was verbally super-sharp, a thing I've come to realize is very rare among the general population, and who takes her out to dinner a ton etc... But you end up with a situation where only one of of five kids has any suspicion or interest in whether they might be Jewish at all. Or any serious thoughts of if so, moving to Israel which is the Jewish people have prayed for for thousands of years. <br><br>Keeping the customs means keeping in the tribe. I have no doubt that if I kept the customs and were in a hard place, if I showed up at my local Chabad house they'd find a place for me - not let me sleep in the street. I might be given a job like doing everyone's laundry, but I'd have a place. And that's the difference between how people traditionally live and our atomized society. If I move to Israel as a Jew, they provide months of Hebrew school, a place to live, job help, all sorts of stuff because that's what you do for a member of your tribe. It's not all milk and honey there but it appears to be a hell of a lot less harsh than life in the US. <br><br>The reason I've become so active on here is I'm not sure how much longer I'll be around.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c4744238472539336859 title="comment permalink">4/25/16, 3:53 PM</a><br><br>

One big difference is at the Synagogue, you either learn the Hebrew liturgy very quickly or you will have no idea what's going on during the prayers. The Temple services have far more English. But apparently in Lexington, that is not the real reason for the two separate congregations in what is actually a town with a fairly low Jewish population. You see, the immigrants who founded the Temple were German-Western European, and the immigrants who founded the Synagogue were Russian-Eastern European, and they didn't get along. <br><br>I often wondered since the early days how the European Union could last, since the two sides are so culturally different. People seemed to think everyone in Eastern Europe just wanted to be Western, when that was never really the case. They wanted western style economic control of their fate, but didn't want the full package of Western culture. It's very much like the strange idea that Middle Eastern people are chomping at the bit to ditch their family and tribal obligations and adopt "democracy" (not real democracy, but the oligarchy backed version of American politics), and Western cultural values (like throwing unwanted relatives even in your immediate family to the wolves, so to speak), and to expose children to a sexualized and violent atmosphere. Ummm, no. <br><br>In the last few years I wonder how much longer the United States can last for much the same reasons. Those of us who recognize the lack of value in materialization, the unsustainability of the American standard of living, and the myth of progress are simply worlds apart from those who don't, and I don't think the gap can be bridged by "education." Learning the hard way is now inevitable, because Americans simply * do. not. care. * about others if it means leveling down, as someone above put it. They won't do it. <br><br>I refuse to believe people are disposable, so I will always at least be an Economic Justice Warrior, even if the whole PC thing runs completely amok. But there's really not much we can do now. Climate change is honestly past the tipping point. My plan now is to be an island of stability that my friends and family can come to if they want, not to try and educate everyone into sensibility and get them to change.

No plastic wrapping, it can't be food! Where I was living there for a while, it was great - I'd get up, feed the "animules", go pick a bucket of greens and "off" tomatoes and stuff for my chickens, and I'd often pick something for myself shortly afterward, maybe a few choice collard leaves, or some such. If I wasn't going to cook them until the evening, I'd just put 'em in a cup of water, which makes me wonder if this is the origin of the flowers-in-a-cup thing. I'd often pick myself a salad, and while working in the garden, weeding and such, I'd nibble here and there, and if the plums etc were in season and I was working hard, I'd take periodic "fruit breaks".

(However, in Hawaii, there's a little slug that likes to walk across fruits and veggies, and if you don't worry about that you can get "rat lung" disease which is very bad.) <br><br>Ahavah - Yes, if I am Jewish in fact, I'll work on learning Hebrew. I always thought the letters looked cool since I was little, and I know it's a very different language than English. But I think I could hack it OK. My understanding is that Reform was a pretty radical thing, in fact if one documentary I watched is correct, some Reform temples were even taking their Shabbat on Sunday. The idea was to blend in better in the new country. But there's always that not-so-fine line, in that when you blend in too well, you lose your identity. <br><br>James M. Jensen II - Frankly I'd rather see scientists and mathematicians and intellectuals on our money, as apparently Austria and perhaps some other places have. Seeing Leonhard Euler on a bill was pretty amazing.

A legal system only functions if it’s enforced, if a society consents to it and feels it’s basically legitimate. Europeans have come to take that underlying basis of law for granted while it’s actually being eroded – by the immunity of the wealthy (Panama etc), lack of consent (EU law, all secular law for sharia-proponents) and failure to enforce (incitement to domestic violence, child abuse, genocide, anti-semitic crimes and treason have been proven to be being preached in many mosques. Few, if any, are subject to appropriate legal sanctions because of their status as a minority religion.) People are noticing this and therefore losing the faith that is the basis for the current rule of law. <br><br>The advocates of sharia law on the other hand suffer from no such disconnection from reality because they don’t seek to separate politics from law in the first place. That gap in understanding is part of the reason why Europeans are facing fascism or sharia. Those two are the only ideologies at present whose advocates are unified by the fundamentals underlying any rule of law – and in particular the willingness to enforce at any cost. It’s not that Europeans will choose to abandon one system and adopt another (although mass migration and demographics in, say, France, will ensure there’s an element of that – see the demographics of the under-5’s there). It’s that they will continue as they are now to remain passive and treat any talk of a threat as racist scaremongering or a potential future problem that they can put off thinking about. <br><br>A motivated minority that is unified and understands power is all it ever takes to transform a society – this is as true for fascists (who are a minority and always were) as it is for sharia supporters (who are also a minority). The only reason a double standard is applied where fascism is seen as a legitimate danger while sharia is not is that one is the preserve of a religious minority. That’s not rational and is a kind of racism of lower expectations.<br> <br>It only takes one extremist who kills an Ahmadi for claiming to be a prophet to have a chilling effect on the next would-be self-proclaimed prophet – particularly from that religion. Muslims beaten on the street for drinking will think twice before drinking in public again. The liberal Muslim who’s been campaigning against the extremists in Glasgow mosque has received death threats for that. That will very effectively silence others who might speak out. Women in Germany, Sweden and Austria are already changing their behaviour ‘voluntarily’, just as, say, Egyptian women do, by covering up, segregating and avoiding public spaces – in accordance with sharia-related norms. It's already happening. <br><br>Mallow<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c5394179773863475228 title="comment permalink">4/26/16, 3:22 AM</a><br><br>

Women and Jews are the canaries in the coal mine and are being abandoned by the rest of society on this. People are falling back on individual solutions – car pooling for those who can afford it, hiding your bible as a Christian in a refugee centre, moving to Israel for Jews, paying security guards at Jewish kindergartens. This is all happening without a murmur from the political mainstream other than more anti-racism campaigns. <br> <br>Vigilante enforcement will be quite sufficient to impose a theocracy as long as that attitude persists among the majority of the population. That’s how the revolution in Iran happened, it’s how it happens everywhere. Although civil war in Europe is the most likely option to start with. <br><br>Most news from Germany and Austria is not being translated into English so English speakers have little idea of the reality there. Wealthier people are also insulated because they can generally avoid having refugee centres placed in their neighbourhoods, they use private schools and don’t rely on public transport etc. Observing the success of the AfD and FPO is a fair indication of what’s happening – bearing in mind that these are two countries that have long resisted being sucked back towards fascism. They didn’t all turn racist/fascist overnight. People who formerly voted left are now voting for the only parties that are willing to face reality. <br><br>This is the response I got from (I think) a dutch guy when I said the success of the FPO was related to the problems with immigration and the response to them:<br><br>“there are no real problems related to immigration in Austria, there are real problems related to racism and capitalism in Austria. and if you claim otherwise, yes you are a racist. no tears for volkisch krauts. been there, done that, seen the deathcamps.”<br><br>That comment is pretty much the standard centre and left position – and it’s why the fascist will win.<br><br>Mallow.

"We are as gods : back to the land in the 1970s on the quest for a new America" by Kate Daloz. <br><br>"Between 1970 and 1974 ten million Americans abandoned the city, the commercialism, and all the inauthentic bourgeois comforts of the Eisenhower-era America of their parents. Instead, they went back to the land. It was the only time in modern history that urbanization has gone into reverse. Kate Daloz follows the dreams and ideals of a small group of back-to-the-landers to tell the story of a nationwide movement and moment. She shows how the faltering, hopeful, but impractical impulses of that first generation sowed the seeds for the organic farming movement and the transformation of American agriculture and food tastes. In the Myrtle Hill commune and neighboring Entropy Acres, high-minded ideas of communal living and shared decision-making crash headlong into the realities of brutal Northern weather and the colossal inconvenience of having no plumbing or electricity. Nature, it turns out, is not always a generous or provident host--frosts are hard, snowfalls smother roads, and small wood fires do not heat imperfectly insulated geodesic domes. Group living turns out to be harder than expected, too. Being free to do what you want and set your own rules leads to some unexpected limitations: once the group starts growing a little marijuana they can no longer call on the protection of the law, especially against a rogue member of a nearby community. For some of the group, the lifestyle is truly a saving grace; they credit it with their survival.

Assimilation is the triumph of corrupt and selfish Western values over traditional values, and it affects all sorts of people, not just Jews. The younger generations growing up in America really don't see that there's anything wrong with Western culture because they've never really known anything else. It doesn't even occur to them that other people are amazed and even a bit horrified at the callousness of society in the West. It's not just a lack of noblesse oblige, but in fact NO level of society now has any idea that they have our should have responsibilities and obligations for anyone but themselves. Even the SJWs of America are for the most part not willing to do what it takes to really change things, which is one point of this week's ADR post. And if the wealthy will not lead by example, why should anyone's else makes any changes to their lifestyle? At that point it becomes obvious that austerity is only for the poorer classes, not the wealthy. Resentment keeps anything from really changing.<br><br>It's the same with assimilation. They ask: Why shouldn't we go shopping on Shabbat? They don't believe in a personal version of YHVH or El Shaddai who pays attention to what they do or don't do, much less who may call them to account for it someday. And in the age of multiculturalism they don't see that the old cultural Jewish way has any more value than any other way. Judaism had become a glorified social club, yes even the ultra Orthodox. <br><br>Did you know is that the Federation used to supply a local doctor for the community, and a lawyer? Give pensions to widows and orphans? Provide a library, hook up young people with apprenticeships, help with the costs of weddings, arrange burials... Jews used to look after our own, but now we don't. Federations all over the country are basically a joke now. Even the "old guard," boomers, never consider that the Federations should still be doing these things or will ever need to do so in the future. The Western fend-for-yourself culture (and, ironically, the govt will take care of the poor and elderly mindset) is so taken for granted nobody questions it. Our Federation actually refers people to Catholic social services if their situation is dire. It's shameful. American Jewish communities can't survive for the same reason American communities can't survive - by the time they realize the errors or their ways it will be too little too late. If they realize it at all. I'm not holding my breath on that. American culture in every form is a monstrosity that needs to die: materialism, consumerism, selfishness, arrogance, exploitation of others... And almost no redeeming qualities.

Someone in this comment thread said that Western class of astrologers, I mean of course social scientists, see everything trough lenses of economy and class. They don't see religion as commanding narrative that it truly is. Nationalism is one religion connecting Europeans to their tribes, Christianity is other, more battered but older shared identity. In my hood, there is strong presence of African Christians. They are working in same places as I do and went to same schools as I did. Some have married into my family. Christian identity is very strong conjunctive factor. Without it this blending would be impossible. Even today, at my workplace, I overheard as one of my native workmates asked from our new, Cameroon born apprentice about his church affiliation. That was connecting factor, common ground for them. Other is football. Many play in local team, and even greater numbers support local team in arena. New revivalist Christianity is making a huge comeback here, but it's those small sects that gather following: neokatechumeni, followers of Lestadius and such. It is not my cup of tea, but I feel respect towards them. Strength in unity and all that. Main protestant church is just rotting carcass barely standing. But those sects truly have impact on local community, as have sports clubs.<br><br>For these new, Mohammedan newcomers only conjunctive is football, and most fundamentalist disciples of faith try to forbid even that.

Society gets burned out on various causes eventually, and they start to lose status in the hierarchy even if they have great merit. It's called donor fatigue, among other things. Problems that seem unsolvable eventually aren't just because people get tired of them, not because they were never unsolvable in the first place. <br><br>For a while now, the LGBT community has been "on top," that is, their cause has attracted more support, power and money than some other social justice causes. Now that gay marriage is the law of the land, though, other causes are vying for the top position. The pushback against private businesses having to accept serving gays is not going to get as much support because deep down, it's an uncomfortable concept. Think about it: I do bookkeeping and annual filings for nonprofits. What if the KKK wanted me to work for them? What if a group that opposed women's rights, or rights for religious minorities, wanted to hire me? Am I obligated to work for them? Even die hard progressives realize the knife cuts both ways, and when push comes to shove, a business that doesn't have government contracts should be free to choose their own clients. So that "cause" is not going to make it, frankly. There is a looming power and money void as the LGBT community loses their "top dog" position. The vultures are starting to circle.<br><br>At one point, civil rights for people of color was at the top, and is now fighting to be back there again. So they, not necessarily consciously mind you, are framing the conversation that way - that Black Lives Matter is *more important* than other causes and fairnesses. And events like Ferguson give credence to this view, because while some people are ambivalent about the idea of being forced to do business with people working actively against their ideals, nobody want to be oppressed and exploited by the police for fun and profit, or stripped of their right to peaceable assembly and protest, or shot in the back for no apparent reason. And as more and more of the middle class sinks to near poverty, they start to experience the police not as friendly helpers but as a bloody nuisance. The BLM leaders sense this, that their Cause-wth-a-capital-C can rise to the top, but whether they can pull it off remains to be seen. <br><br>It will depend in part on whether or not other Causes can game their way to the top, which in turn depends on a lot of things nobody has real control over, like burnings of mosques or bombings of abortion clinics, etc. It's all media driven. Right now there's a good chance voter disenfranchisement may be the next hot thing, given all the super-delegates and irregularities in the state primaries. Let the games begin. At least it's new and different. <br><br>Yes, folks, this is a horribly cynical view - sorry about that, but money and power are big motivators even if a cause is in fact good and just. And it takes, regrettably, savvy SJWs to get enough of either for their cause to make progress. <br><br>As for the ordinary person trying to navitage these waters, it seems as if political correctness has already run amok, and maybe it has. If so, it's the end of the SJW industry, so expect them to get even more shrill as the shrinking pie and resource depletion makes the pot smaller and smaller. Everybody will insist their cause is the most just and the most worthy. <br><br>Hope this helps a bit.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c7835736671234548103 title="comment permalink">4/26/16, 2:18 PM</a><br><br>

Law follows power, not the other way around. It’s not what’s written in some book, it’s what’s actually enforced. <br><br>States are not the only entities which can enforce legal systems. <br><br>Whether Muslims are low status or not depends on which system of privilege you’re standing in. <br><br>After the demographic change and mass migrations that are already baked in the cake they will not be a small minority. <br> <br>Nation states may be the incorrect scale at which to view the issue since many are already fracturing. <br><br>The majority is not opposing the process at its current relatively small scale. There are no grounds to presume that it will do so when it increases in scale and therefore becomes even more risky to oppose it. <br><br>Finally, how troubling individual incidents are right now depends on your own privilege status – they’re not minor for Ahmadis in the UK, apostates, the Hindus of Germany, outspoken liberal Muslims or the Jews of France. They’re literally lethally troubling for many of them. Those of us less personally threatened by it have a responsibility to recognize that and as a society to do something constructive about it. <br><br>German speakers have turned the term ‘Einzelfall’ (one off) into a standard sarcastic response as every incident is reported as such by their media. Black humour.

Violence. That's the mechanism. Use of it and threat of it. United, militant minority can take and has taken power from passive majority, even if they are looked down by establishment as inferiors. One could say that they can take power especially as they are seen as "low-status minority", as they are not taken seriously enough soon enough. Examples?<br><br>Roman empire after winter of 406-7 AD, when Germanic tribes poured over frozen Rhine, as story goes. Germanic people were low status, used mainly as mercenaries in auxiliary forces or slaves after "peace keeping campaigns" beyond empire's borders. Vast military machine of Rome was very slow to react to this invasion, because it was seen more as massive cattle raid than serious invasion. Top brass continued to fight among themselves for positions in court of Ravenna, as the provinces were slowly lost. Future belonged to Germanic warbands, definitely small minority, definitely low status, among heavily Romanized natives.<br><br>Spain after 709 AD, when church opposed new king Womba for throne of Visigothic Spain. Clergy backed more obedient lord Roderick. Roderick's army defeated Womba, creating king Rod in post-Roman, Catholic Andalusia. Womba's friends looked desperately for someone to help them. The Muslims were just wrapping up their conquest of (Christian) North Africa, only a few miles away from Andalusia. They were small warbands among massive majority population of Christians. Romanized Visigoths saw them as illiterate unwashed nomads. Nothing to fear there, right? A few goths slipped across the straits and invited the Arabs to Spain, even arranging the ships for them. They were viewed as small, low-status minority of mercenaries, who would help with dirty work and be paid off. In 711, an Arab and Berber force, led by Tariq Ibn Ziyad, crossed to Spain's great rock that now bears his name, Gibraltar (Jebel al Tariq, rock of Tariq). After they had destroyed king Rod's army in battle of Lagunas de Janda, they went after the friendly Goths too, those using them as "low status minority doing dirty work for them". In 756 AD, Abdar Rahman, last of Umayyads, became emir (commander) of all Spain. Low status minority had taken massive majority of Christians and subjugated them, molding form of government into theocracy ruled by tiny minority, in span of one lifetime.<br><br>History belong to those who have strength and will to use it, not to the majorities. As species we have not evolved a bit from those incidents I described. Technology is different, all the rest has remained same. There is nothing new under the sun.

A couple years ago I had my DNA tested by Ancestry.com. My sister and I both have a trace of African ancestry. But we have different tribal associations. Mine, Cameroon/Congo and my sister Mali. Last year one of our first cousin's showed up on Ancestry.com with a trace of southern Bantu lineage. These differences in locality seem to indicate that our common ancestor with African heritage was most likely a slave with "mixed" African heritage. Each of us inheriting a tiny bit of recognizable DNA.<br><br>My daughter had no African heritage on her test. So she is of the generation where the signal has been lost. Statistically it is likely an indication of the degree of separation from her ancestor. <br><br>Some of the people that have taken the tests include a photo with their test. People who are most likely related to me (it is statistically derived) are generally recognizable as European, but a number of the photos show persons that are generally recognized as having African heritage. Most of them show mixed heritage in their DNA profiles. These people are as closely related to me as any other 4th or 5th cousin. It is also likely that we do not necessarily share my African ancestor as our common ancestor/s.<br><br>So the family story about Native American heritage may have been a ruse to cover that embarrassing fact of a "bit" of Negro in our background. I am rather sure that my grandmother was completely unaware of the subterfuge and was just repeating the family tale. The question is, why even talk about heritage that is an underclass that you are distancing yourself from?

I am just offering the way I look at the question of privilege and the shortcomings of it as a rhetorical tool.<br><br>One of the difficulties in talking about privilege is it is not all or nothing. It isn't about a seat at the table of decision making. It is a question of which seat at which table. Here's an example I like to bring up: Can we talk about female privilege? After all if privilege is invisible to the privileged, can it go the other way?<br><br>Now that seems like heresy but in fact we can. Women have, as far as I can tell, always enjoyed something of a privileged role in relation to family and culture. In a pre-industrial economy, where most economic production occurred at home, that privilege was probably more developed than it is today (and usually it is hidden but see Chris Faraone's "Ancient Greek Love Magic" for a discussion of hidden aspects of gender in ancient Greece). With the rise of industrialization and the fall of the house and home as the seat of economic production, however, this has been eroded and in fact one could argue (quite successfully) that large portions of male privilege follow rather directly from female privilege. In a corporate economy, the reproductive privileges of women are liabilities for employers, for example.<br><br>I am, btw, not the only one who has noticed this. Volumes have been written by feminists who see women's privileged place in the family as a source of hindrance in the economy and this gets to one of the problems with the modern economy, namely that there are structural imbalances and a deep opportunity gap for women (something equal pay for equal work laws will never solve). But we aren't allowed to talk about female privilege because, as much as it might allow a larger, frank discussion over economic justice for women, it also comes across as denying many women what they want. After all, if we were to judge courts by whether they awarded custody to the father 50% of the time when the parents had never been married, women would be up in arms. But this has real economic implications that we can therefore never talk about. Men's Rights movements are one extremely simplistic response, but they fail to note that the implications of their agenda are not ones most men or most women should want.<br><br>This is actually one reason why I dislike the way privilege is usually talked about. The division isn't just qualitative but also quantitative and understanding how they fit together is often more important than who has more. I.e. the qualitative divisions are often more important than the quantitative ones.<br><br>A better framing is that there are social divisions and that people live in bubbles and cannot usually see over social walls. Over time, if we take on liminal experiences, we can learn to see over them incompletely. But we can never really see over them completely. For example, a transgender woman (born male) never gets rid of all aspects of "male privilege" and therefore never has to worry that an ill-timed pregnancy will destroy her career.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c8950529194310402522 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 2:40 AM</a><br><br>

This means it has more in common with medieval Icelandic law in application than it does with popular notions of it.<br><br>For this reason what Sharia law means, and the relationship between Sharia institutions and civil institutions varies greatly from one place to another. I see no reason to expect that Sharia will be adopted as a state-backed legal system in Europe (as an arbitration/contract system among Muslims, that is a very different matter however).<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c1296311489514086727 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 5:31 AM</a><br><br>

What is happening is that American foreign policy is destroying nearby countries and Americans are pushing for Europe to accept more refugees. The US, OTOH, has accepted far fewer such refugees than has anti-immigrant Denmark. This makes me think the problem originates not from the Middle East but from the West. Simply put: it sucks to be a client state of an empire, such as the US but folks don't put blame where it is due.<br><br>I see three aspects to the problem that are not well discussed generally. The first of course is the extent to which we really should blame US policies for the crisis.<br><br>The second however is that the immigrants bring with them a view of a less industrial, more family-oriented economy. Failure to appreciate this however means that this great gift is squandered and Europe doesn't break its dependency on outsourcing childbirth and childrearing (via immigration).<br><br>The third is that this area is fraught with moral hazards. Europeans don't want to hold the US responsible. But similarly there are huge structural problems being exposed in the EU, where Greece is not given a bailout but instead told they must effectively become Europe's refugee camp and self-financed border guard. This sort of arrangement could be made to sort of work while the economies were lifting everyone up, but now that is no longer the case and I think the EU is starting to tear itself apart.<br><br>I am sure we will see more of this as the long decline progresses.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c8422358474472086040 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 5:45 AM</a><br><br>

They're not imminent, they're in being. <br> <br>Look at Rome at the time when the Goths were given permission to cross the Danube and translate it into modern terms (e.g. recruits for army = cheap labour):<br> <br>“In the summer of 376, a massive number of Goths arrived on the Danube River, the border of the Roman Empire, requesting asylum from the Huns.[3] They came in two distinct groups: the Thervings led by Fritigernand Alavivus, and the Greuthungi led by Alatheus and Saphrax.[4] Eunapius states their number as 200,000 including civilians, but Peter Heather estimates that the Thervings may have had only 10,000 warriors and 50,000 people in total, with the Greuthungi about the same size.<br> <br>Ancient sources are unanimous that Valens was pleased at the appearance of the Goths, as it offered the opportunity of new soldiers at low cost…This was not the first time barbarian tribes had been settled within the Roman Empire. The usual course was that some would be recruited into the army and the rest would be broken up into small groups and resettled across the Empire at the Emperor's discretion. This would keep them from posing a unified threat and assimilate into the greater Roman population. The agreement differed with the Thervings by allowing them to choose the place of their settlement, Thrace, and allowed them to remain as one large group. During the negotiations, the Thervings also expressed a willingness to convert to Christianity. As for the Greuthungi, Roman army and naval forces blocked the river and denied them entry.[11]<br> <br>The Thervings were probably allowed to cross at or near the fortress of Durostorum.[12] They were ferried by the Romans in boats, rafts, and in hollowed tree-trunks, and "diligent care was taken that no future destroyer of the Roman state should be left behind, even if he were smitten by a fatal disease," according to Ammianus Marcellinus. Even so, the river swelled with rain and a good many drowned.[13] It is usually supposed that the Goths were to have their weapons confiscated, but the Romans in charge accepted bribes to allow the Goths to retain their weapons, or perhaps due to there being so many Goths and so few Roman soldiers, not all of them could be adequately checked.[n 1][14][15] The Romans placed the Thervings along southern bank of the Danube in Lower Moesia as they waited for the land allocations to begin.[16] In the interim, the Roman state was to provide them food.”<br><br>Mallow<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c6585642272570503992 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 12:45 PM</a><br><br>

The Goths were not ‘bad people’ or evil invaders or somehow inferior to the Romans. They simply had interests that conflicted with those of the local Roman peasants. It happens. And you don’t have to see it as a takeover – it’s a process of cultural change which you can either support or oppose. It’s not imminent in the sense of apocalyptic collapse and nor is it something that may happen in some vague future time. It’s just a trend that’s happening now and is likely to continue. Like most other processes in decline.<br> <br>Many of those opposing the current migration don’t actually simply wish harm to refugees. There are very few who are motivated by pure racism and xenophobia. You’re creating a caricature of evilly evilness for its own sake.<br> <br>It’s perfectly possible to recognize the parallels here and make some difficult decisions without wishing harm to anyone. And indeed to actively try to minimize any harm in dealing with it. But that must include recognizing that the interests of Roman peasants on the far side of the Danube conflicted with those of the Goths seeking to cross.<br> <br>You’re engaging in a kind of motivated reasoning if you don’t mind my saying so. It’s very common at the moment. It’s a kind of consequentialist ethic along the lines of ‘If this were true and said openly, it could be used by bad people to do bad things, so I’m going to find reasons for it to not be true or at least avoid expressing it openly.’ The accuracy or otherwise of a risk assessment – facts, truth – needs to come first. Then you look at the potential consequences of who might use it for what and deal with that.<br> <br>None of us can control what unsavoury characters will or won’t do. But if you’re going to control you, and thereby be able to contribute constructively, you need to establish truth for yourself first and independently of how others might react to it. What I’m saying is don’t choose your memes based on opposition to what, say, Juhana says, or what some unknown unsavoury characters might say. There are more than two narratives to choose from.<br><br>Mallow<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c3352916930338429203 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 12:45 PM</a><br><br>

The mass migrations will continue long after the US has nothing to do with it. It’s climate change and associated conflicts that’ll do most of it. The drought currently spreading across the Equator is massive. This is much bigger and longer lasting than the American empire. Europeans would very happily hold the US responsible but in practice that would amount to absolutely nothing. That’s the nature of being client states. <br><br>“The second however is that the immigrants bring with them a view of a less industrial, more family-oriented economy. Failure to appreciate this however means that this great gift is squandered and Europe doesn't break its dependency on outsourcing childbirth and childrearing (via immigration).” <br><br>Whether this is a gift, or a great one, is very much a matter of values. It’s not failure to appreciate it as an objective good that’s the problem. It’s that most Europeans don’t consider that to be an objective good. Because what you call a family-oriented economy is, in this case, inextricably linked to a position for women that most of us do not wish to adopt.<br><br>On sharia, that’s just not very accurate. There is no one central authority, yes. But there are only a few main schools of jurisprudence to which most Muslims subscribe. And polls show that most Muslims in fact believe that there is only one valid interpretation of sharia (that interpretation of course varies). <br><br>The lack of a single authority doesn’t necessarily imply anything about the relationship between sharia systems and civil law systems. Why that varies from place to place has rather more to do with the politics of each area. <br><br>At present in the UK sharia courts don’t simply deal with contract/arbitration matters among Muslims. They deal with family law and inheritance rights to a large extent. They discriminate massively against women, the ‘voluntariness’ of whose participation is doubtful. It deals with divorce, domestic violence, custody etc. In a manner that breaches human rights, as determined by the European Court of Justice which has found that sharia law (they clearly were able to define it) is incompatible with democracy and human rights.<br> <br>As for it becoming a state-backed system – we really need to get past the idea that a ‘state’ is the thing that enforces law and that societies ‘adopt’ laws as some kind of active, deliberate decision. It can work that way but it’s by no means inevitable. As Juhana pretty much said, ultimately power comes from the barrel of a gun. That’s the world we’re moving into, but it’s a world that was never far below the surface to begin with. <br><br>What no one seems to want to hear is that the process is already happening. Jews are refraining from wearing their religious symbols (the prayer cap thing) in public in certain areas for fear of attack – this reflects an interpretation of sharia under which dhimmis may not display their religious symbols. <br><br>Women in some parts are covering up more and avoiding travelling alone for fear of harassment – this reflects the sharia-related view of women being required to cover their skin to protect their ‘honour’. <br><br>That is how cultural change happens, how politics changes, and how law changes. It makes absolutely no difference to those people that the ‘state-backed law’ theoretically remains the same. When the facts on the ground change, the law has changed. <br><br>Mallow.<br><br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c6992183996154836293 title="comment permalink">4/28/16, 1:11 PM</a><br><br>

Are rights and fairness actually privileges? If so, then the masses can expect things to get much worse. If I come out of a store and pull my phone out of my pocket, is it privilege that keeps a cop from shooting me dead for reaching towards my waistband? <br><br>I don't buy into the argument made by some that I deserve not to be gunned down by police because I am white, but black males do deserved to be gunned down because they are black. To me privilege is shown by how the extremely wealthy get away with committing billions to trillions of dollars of economic damages or how the government agents and leaders get away with kidnapping, torturing and even murdering innocent civilians with no accountability. Being treated innocent before guilty is I thought supposed to a right for all, not a privilege. The privilege argument lets those most guilty of injustice off the hook by suggesting that the maltreatment of minorities is supposed to be the natural state of affairs for the majority. If fairness and justice are in fact only privileges, then inflicting greater injustice and inequality on a larger proportion of the masses is the easiest cure.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c2423863457973856655 title="comment permalink">5/2/16, 8:03 AM</a><br><br>

I am a person with some privilege (white, able-bodied, university education) and less than most of my relatives and friends (who are all of the above but have salary-class incomes/assets that I do not - I've been underemployed wage class all my life, my husband was an Ivy League educated professional who ended up without economic privilege partly by stubborn choice) who has not been able to discuss privilege with anyone - for the very reasons you mention, but now it's clear to me. It's not just my peculiar burden to live with this. Love the verb "Starhawking" - I read her Fifth Sacred Thing and while I got its point, I just couldn't agree it was the most wonderful thing I'd ever read as my eclectic Pagan friends did, but couldn't say why. as for the later column about Burkean conservatism - I'm the only ex-Leftie who agrees with many Burkean conservatives of the Front Porch Republic ilk that I know.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c887360886989926711 title="comment permalink">5/16/16, 9:59 AM</a><br><br>

Are we really fighting for a world where we're all equally oppressed? Increasingly it seems that we appeal to Central authority to control and subjugate our fellow man, but isn't the subjugation and disempowerment of the individuals the very root of this debate?<br><br>You speak of Starhawking, but let us remember privilege is also a go to ad hominem attack used today. "Of course that's what a white male would think". These personal attacks lead to many reasonable individuals avoiding debate. When the middle ground argument loses its voice; We're left with polarized extremists who care more about winning then seeing the right thing done.<br><br>I think that by and large individuals generally have the moral capacity that they can afford to have. (Even a raw vegan can't afford to be compassionate to the lettuce patch). Trying to suppress the privilege of a downwardly mobile working class may work for awhile but eventually it becomes a stranglehold and they become dis-empowered themselves. This is only going to multiply racial tensions, segregate/tribalize our communities and will likely undo years of social progress in the other direction.<br><br>In short we can't smash the faces of pretty people to ensure they don't do better in sales negotiations.<br><br><a href=starhawking-privilege-game.html#c6110838855009336456 title="comment permalink">5/20/16, 5:05 PM</a><br><br>
