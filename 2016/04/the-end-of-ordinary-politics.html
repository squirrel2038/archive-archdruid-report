Archdruids may take vacations but politics never sleeps, and during the month that’s elapsed since the last post here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, quite a number of things relevant to this blog’s project have gone spinning past the startled eyes of those who pay attention to the US political scene. I’ll get to some of the others in upcoming weeks; the one that caught my attention most forcefully, for reasons I trust my readers will find understandable, was the reaction to a post of mine from a few months back titled <a href=../../2016/01/donald-trump-and-politics-of-resentment.html>Donald Trump and the Politics of Resentment</a>. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s not uncommon for a post of mine on a controversial subject to get picked up by other blogs and attract a fair amount of discussion and commentary. On the other hand, when something I write takes not much more than a week to become the most-read post in the history of <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, goes on to attract more than half again as many page views as the nearest runner-up, and gets nearly twice as many comments as the most comment-heavy previous post, it’s fair to say that something remarkable has happened. When a follow-up post, <a href=../../2016/02/the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html>The Decline and Fall of Hillary Clinton</a>, promptly became the second most-read post in this blog’s history and attracted even more comments—well, here again, it seems tolerably clear that I managed to hit an exquisitely sensitive nerve. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It may not be an accident, either, that starting about a week after that first post went up, two things relevant to it have started to percolate through the mass media. The first, and to my mind the most promising, is that a few journalists have managed to get past the usual crass stereotypes, and talk about the actual reasons why so many voters have decided to back Donald Trump’s aspirations this year. I was startled to see <a href=http://www.peggynoonan.com/trump-and-the-rise-of-the-unprotected/ >a thoughtful article by Peggy Noonan</a> along those lines in the Wall Street Journal, and even more astonished to see pieces making similar points in other media outlets—<a href=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/07/donald-trump-why-americans-support>here’s an example,</a>, <a href=http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/16/news/economy/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-us-election/ >and here’s another</a>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, none of the articles that I saw quite managed to grapple with the raw reality of the situation that’s driving so many wage-earning Americans to place their last remaining hopes for the future on Donald Trump. Even Noonan’s piece, though it’s better than most and makes an important point we’ll examine later, falls short.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In her analysis, what’s wrong is that a privileged subset of Americans have been protected from the impacts of the last few decades of public policy, while the rest of us haven’t had that luxury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is true, of course, but it considerably understates things. The class she’s talking about—the more affluent half or so of the salary class, to use the taxonomy I suggested in my post—hasn’t simply been protected from the troubles affecting other Americans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They’ve profited, directly and indirectly, from the policies that have plunged much of the wage class into impoverishment and misery, and their reliable response to any attempt to discuss that awkward detail shows tolerably clearly that a good many of them are well aware of it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m thinking here, among many other examples along the same lines, of <a href=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/10/modern-feminism-language-policing-twitter-gender-equality>a revealing article</a> earlier this year from a reporter who attended a feminist conference on sexism in the workplace. All the talk there was about how women in the salary class could improve their own prospects for promotion and the like. It so happened that the reporter’s sister works in a wage-class job, and she quite sensibly inquired whether the conference might spare a little time to discuss ways to improve prospects for women who don’t happen to belong to the salary class. Those of my readers who have seen discussions of this kind know exactly what happened next: a bit of visible discomfort, a few vaguely approving comments, and then a resumption of the previous subjects as though no one had made so embarrassing a suggestion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s typical of the taboo that surrounds class prejudice in today’s industrial nations that not even the reporter mentioned the two most obvious points about this interchange. The first, of course, is that the line the feminists at the event drew between those women whose troubles with sexism were of interest to them, and those whose problems didn’t concern them in the least, was a class line. The second is that the women at the event had perfectly valid, if perfectly selfish, reasons for drawing that line. In order to improve the conditions of workers in those wage class industries that employ large numbers of women, after all, the women at the conference would themselves have had to pay more each month for daycare, hairstyling, fashionable clothing, and the like. Sisterhood may be powerful, as the slogans of an earlier era liked to claim, but it’s clearly not powerful enough to convince women in the salary class to inconvenience themselves for the benefit of women who don’t happen to share their privileged status. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To give the women at the conference credit, though, at least they didn’t start shouting about some other hot-button issue in the hope of distracting attention from an awkward question. That was the second thing relevant to my post that started happening the week after it went up. All at once, much of the American left responded to the rise of Donald Trump by insisting at the top of their lungs that <a href=http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_revenge_of_the_lower_classes_and_the_rise_of_american_fascism_20160302>the only reason</a>, <a href=https://medium.com/@emmalindsay/trump-supporters-aren-t-stupid-3d38f70f2a2f#.w1wo9iep9>the only possible reason</a>, that anyone at all supports the Trump campaign is that Trump is a racist and so are all his supporters. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably necessary to start by unpacking the dubious logic here, so that we can get past that and see what’s actually being said. Does Trump have racial prejudices? No doubt; most white Americans do. Do his followers share these same prejudices? Again, no doubt some of them do—not all his followers are white, after all, a point that the leftward end of the media has been desperately trying to obscure in recent weeks. Let’s assume for the sake of argument, though, that Trump and his followers do indeed share an assortment of racial bigotries. Does that fact, if it is a fact, prove that racism must by definition be the only thing that makes Trump appeal to his followers? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of course it proves nothing of the kind. You could use the same flagrant illogic to insist that since Trump enjoys steak, and many of his followers share that taste, the people who follow him must be entirely motivated by hatred for vegetarians. Something that white Americans generally don’t discuss, though I’m told that most people of color are acutely aware of it, is that racial issues simply aren’t that important to white people in this country nowadays.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The frantic and passionate defense of racial bigotry that typified the Jim Crow era is rare these days outside of the white-supremacist fringe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What has replaced it, by and large, are habits of thought and action that most white people consider to be no big deal—and you don’t get a mass movement going in the teeth of the political establishment by appealing to attitudes that the people who hold them consider to be no big deal. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Behind the shouts of “Racist!” directed at the Trump campaign by a great many affluent white liberals, rather, lies a rather different reality. Accusations of racism play a great many roles in contemporary American discourse—and of course the identification of actual racism is among these. When affluent white liberals make that accusation, on the other hand, far more often than not, it’s a dog whistle. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I should probably explain that last phrase for the benefit of those of my readers who don’t speak fluent Internet. A dog whistle, in online jargon, is a turn of phrase or a trope that expresses some form of bigotry while giving the bigot plausible deniability. During the civil rights movement, for example, the phrase “states’ rights” was a classic dog whistle; the rights actually under discussion amounted to the right of white Southerners to impose racial discrimination on their black neighbors, but the White Citizens Council spokesmen who waxed rhapsodic about states’ rights never had to say that in so many words. That there were, and are, serious issues about the balance of power between states and the federal government that have nothing do with race, and thus got roundly ignored by both sides of the struggle, is just one more irony in a situation that had no shortage of them already. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the same way, the word “racist” in the mouths of the pundits and politicians who have been applying it so liberally to the Trump campaign is a dog whistle for something they don’t want to talk about in so many words. What they mean by it, of course, is “wage class American.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s extremely common. Consider the recent standoff in Oregon between militia members and federal officials. While that was ongoing, wags in the blogosphere and the hip end of the media started referring to the militia members as “Y’all-Qaeda.” Attentive readers may have noted that none of the militia members came from the South—the only part of the United States where “y’all” is the usual second person plural pronoun. To the best of my knowledge, all of them came from the dryland West, where “y’all” is no more common than it is on the streets of Manhattan or Vancouver. Why, then, did the label catch on so quickly and get the predictable sneering laughter of the salary class? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It spread so quickly and got that laugh because most members of the salary class in the United States love to apply a specific stereotype to the entire American wage class. You know that stereotype as well as I do, dear reader. It’s a fat, pink-faced, gap-toothed Southern good ol’ boy in jeans and a greasy T-shirt, watching a NASCAR race on television from a broken-down sofa, with one hand stuffed elbow deep into a bag of Cheez Doodles, the other fondling a shotgun, a Confederate flag patch on his baseball cap and a Klan outfit in the bedroom closet. As a description of wage-earning Americans in general, that stereotype is as crass, as bigoted, and as politically motivated as any of the racial and sexual stereotypes that so many people these days are ready to denounce—but if you mention this, the kind of affluent white liberals who would sooner impale themselves on their own designer corkscrews than mention African-Americans and watermelons in the same paragraph will insist at the top of their lungs that it’s not a stereotype, it’s the way “those people” really are. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who don’t happen to know any people from the salary class, and so haven’t had the opportunity to hear the kind of hate speech they like to use for the wage class, might want to pick up the latest edition of the National Review, and read a really remarkable diatribe by Kevin Williamson—it’s behind a paywall, but <a href=http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2016/03/trump-inspired-classism>here’s a sample</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The motive force behind this tantrum was the fact that many people in the Republican party’s grassroots base are voting in their own best interests, and thus for Trump, rather than falling into line and doing what they’re told by their soi-disant betters. The very idea!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s a fine display of over-the-top classist bigotry, as well as a first-rate example of the way that so many people in the salary class like to insist that poverty is always and only the fault of the poor. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
May I please be frank? The reason that millions of Americans have had their standard of living hammered for forty years, while the most affluent twenty per cent have become even more affluent, is no mystery. What happened was that corporate interests in this country, aided and abetted by a bipartisan consensus in government and cheered on by the great majority of the salary class, stripped the US economy of living wage jobs by offshoring most of America’s industrial economy, on the one hand, and flooding the domestic job market with millions of legal and illegal immigrants on the other.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s why a family living on one average full-time wage in 1966 could afford a home, a car, three square meals a day, and the other necessities and comforts of an ordinary American lifestyle, while a family with one average full time wage in most US cities today is living on the street. None of that happened by accident; no acts of God were responsible; no inexplicable moral collapse swept over the American wage class and made them incapable of embracing all those imaginary opportunities that salary class pundits like to babble about. That change was brought about, rather, by specific, easily identifiable policies. As a result, all things considered, blaming the American poor for the poverty that has been imposed on them by policies promoted by the affluent is the precise economic equivalent of blaming rape victims for the actions of rapists. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In both cases, please note, blaming the victim makes a convenient substitute for talking about who’s actually responsible, who benefits from the current state of affairs, and what the real issues are. When that conversation is one that people who have a privileged role in shaping public discourse desperately don’t want to have, blaming the victim is an effective diversionary tactic, and accordingly it gets much use in the US media these days. There are, after all, plenty of things that the people who shape public discourse in today’s America don’t want to talk about. The fact that the policies pushed by those same shapers of opinion have driven millions of American families into poverty and misery isn’t the most unmentionable of these things, as it happens. The most unmentionable of the things that don’t get discussed is the fact that those policies have failed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It really is as simple as that. The policies we’re talking about—lavish handouts for corporations and the rich, punitive austerity schemes for the poor, endless wars in the Middle East and elsewhere, malign neglect of domestic infrastructure, and deer-in-the-headlights blank looks or vacuous sound bites in response to climate change and the other consequences of our frankly moronic maltreatment of the biosphere that keeps us all alive—were supposed to bring prosperity to the United States and its allies and stability to the world. They haven’t done that, they won’t do that, and with whatever respect is due to the supporters of Hillary Clinton, four more years of those same policies won’t change that fact. The difficulty here is simply that no one in the political establishment, and precious few in the salary class in general, are willing to recognize that failure, much less learn its obvious lessons or notice the ghastly burdens that those policies have imposed on the majorities who have been forced to carry the costs.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here, though, we’re in territory that has been well mapped out in advance by one of the historians who have helped guide the project of this blog since its inception. In his magisterial twelve-volume <i>A Study of History</i>, Arnold Toynbee explored in unforgiving detail the processes by which societies fail. Some civilizations, he notes, are overwhelmed by forces outside their control, but this isn’t the usual cause of death marked on history’s obituaries. Far more often than not, rather, societies that go skidding down the well-worn route marked “Decline and Fall” still have plenty of resources available to meet the crises that overwhelm them and plenty of options that could have saved the day—but those resources aren’t put to constructive use and those options never get considered. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This happens, in turn, because the political elites of those failed societies lose the ability to notice that the policies they want to follow don’t happen to work. The leadership of a rising civilization pays close attention to the outcomes of its policies and discards those that don’t work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The leadership of a falling civilization prefers to redefine “success” as “following the approved policies” rather than “yielding the preferred outcomes,” and concentrates on insulating itself from the consequences of its mistakes rather than recognizing the mistakes and dealing with their consequences. The lessons of failure are never learned, and so the costs of failure mount up until they can no longer be ignored. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is where Peggy Noonan’s division of the current population into “protected” and “unprotected” classes has something useful to offer. Members of the protected class—in today’s America, as already noted, this is above all the more affluent half or so of the salary class—live within a bubble that screens them from any contact with the increasingly impoverished and immiserated majority. As far as they can see, everything’s fine; all their friends are prospering, and so are they; spin-doctored news stories and carefully massaged statistics churned out by government offices insist that nothing could possibly be wrong. They go from gated residential community to office tower to exclusive restaurant to high-end resort and back again, and the thought that it might be useful once in a while to step outside the bubble and go see what conditions are like in the rest of the country would scare the bejesus out of them if it ever occurred to them at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In a rising civilization, as Toynbee points out, the political elite wins the loyalty and respect of the rest of the population by recognizing problems and then solving them. In a falling civilization, by contrast, the political elite forfeits the loyalty and respect of the rest of the population by creating problems and then ignoring them. That’s what lies behind the crisis of legitimacy that occurs so often in the twilight years of a society in decline—and that, in turn, is the deeper phenomenon that lies behind the meteoric rise of Donald Trump.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If a society’s officially sanctioned leaders can’t lead, won’t follow, and aren’t willing to get out of the way, sooner or later people are going to start looking for a way to shove them through history’s exit turnstile, by whatever means turn out to be necessary. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus if Trump loses the election in November, that doesn’t mean that the threat to the status quo is over—far from it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If Hillary Clinton becomes president, we can count on four more years of the same failed and feckless policies, which she’s backed to the hilt throughout her political career, and thus four more years in which millions of Americans outside the narrow circle of affluence will be driven deeper into poverty and misery, while being told by the grinning scarecrows of officialdom that everything is just fine. That’s not a recipe for social stability; those who make peaceful change impossible, it’s been pointed out, make violent change inevitable. What’s more, Trump has already shown every ambitious demagogue in the country exactly how to build a mass following, and he’s also shown a great many wage-earning Americans that there can be alternatives to an intolerable status quo. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No matter how loudly today’s establishment insists that the policies it favors are the only thinkable options, the spiraling failure of those policies, and the appalling costs they impose on people outside the bubble of privilege, guarantee that sooner or later the unthinkable will become the inescapable. That’s the real news of this election season:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the end of ordinary politics, and the first stirrings of an era of convulsive change that will leave little of today’s conventional wisdom intact. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
**********************</div>
On a not unrelated theme, I’m delighted to announce that my next book from New Society Publishers, <a href="http://www.newsociety.com/affil.mvc?Affil=ARCH&amp;Page=../Books/D/Dark-Age-America">Dark Age America: Climate Change, Cultural Collapse, and the Hard Future Ahead</a>, is now available for preorder. Readers who favor the sort of feel-good pablum for the overprivileged marketed by <i>Yes! Magazine</i> and its equivalents will want to give this one a pass. (It’s been suggested to me more than once that if I ran a magazine, it would have to be titled <i>Probably Not! Magazine: A Journal of Realistic Futures</i>.) On the other hand, those who are looking for a sober assessment of the mess into which we’ve collectively backed ourselves, and the likely consequences of that mess over the next five centuries or so, may find it just their cup of astringent tea.</div>

In my experience with them and, they would be utterly clueless as to how to provide for themselves as well as how to fix things, etc..<br> A book I recommend to read about working class people and how to understand them I "Deerhunting for Jesus:Dispatches from America's Class War" by Joe Bageant, who is unfortunately deceased. I think he would have been utterly fascinated by the political goings on nowadays. <br> I had a rather amusing incident where I suggested to one of my university area liberal friends that if they wanted to understand why rednecks act and vote the way they do, they should read the aforementioned book. I was told that they didn't want to read anything about Jesus because they were Buddhist, even though I described what they book was about, and Jesus was not really any particular part of it. This from otherwise intelligent people, who don't realize how much they are bigots too, just not of people of color. <br> By the way, I feel like, as Joe Bageant did, that I can understand both the "back country" people and the liberal college educated cityots,aka educated fools, having gone to college myself. As for the term cityots, country people think city people are clueless people who don't know how to do anything useful, so the city people's scorn for the country people is often reciprocated. And I have to mention that your description of the Nascar man stereotype was missing him holding a can of cheap beer ;-)<br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c3221094011454389774 title="comment permalink">4/6/16, 12:30 PM</a><br><br>

It apparently never occurred to him that those self-same trade policies have ripped up a reasonably well working village culture to provide those under-paid laborers, fueled the drug wars in Columbia, facilitated ripping up large swaths of land for mono-culture plantations and fostered a trade imbalance that's reduced a large part of our population to debt peonage.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c3205043253197473537 title="comment permalink">4/6/16, 12:53 PM</a><br><br>

Revolution is afoot globally against the postwar order. Radivcals against consensus politics in europe and usa and the sino-russian-iranian-indian axis building an alternative financial-diplomatic-military-trade and infrastructure base. So while the West collapses on its systemic corruption the East is post collapse and building up a climbing society based on fairness. <br><br>The russian revolution happened a generation before the West's last great crisis so they were able to build up a new identity before the crisis and protect their cultural independence and spread an alternate ideology. It seems the same is repeating itself now. As western social wefare state, military industrial finance complex based on consumerism and fake democracy gets shaked up internally, trump, sanders, Le Pen and co. being symptoms like mussolini and hitler were in 30s the russians provide military, diplomatic, theoretical structure of a survivable post democratic, post oligarchic consumerist slimmed down efficient state,military,etc. Chinese give financial backing and manufacturing base. More eurasian countries are becoming convinced all the time,like lots of westerners, that cia, ngos, soros,nato,etc. are not out to spread democracy. The mindset regarding treaties with indian tribes in19th century is that which the oligarchy uses against the lower classes and all foreign countries. Treaties are, like the US constiution, just pieces of paper, to the hereditary elite. Exporting factories, importing workers,ninja loans destroyed middle class. Perpetual warfare is destroying muslim world. Financial warfare by banks, IMF loans have destroyed NICs, latin American countries many times over the last decades, inaddition to coups originating in US embassies. The elite are a handful of people. CIA originators were Wall Streeters.This is all the same story.

It seems like the Republican Party has been putting together its best possible efforts at forming a unified anti-Trump movement (and most of the Republicans doing it aren’t doing much in the way of pretending their opposition is about Racism, Women, or any of those things, they don’t like his labor-centric economics and they’ll readily admit it after just a few minutes of talking). But there does seem to be a very real possibility of that coalition doing everything in their power to make sure that Trump falls just barely short of the required number of delegates to avoid a contested convention, and then force Cruz through despite him losing the primary. A Trump versus Clinton race looks like it’d be close, and if Trump came through on top, it’d be the doing of secret Trump voters who are voting in their self-interest but don’t want to admit it because of the stigma surrounding him, and who are therefore not being represented in any of the projections. Cruz on the other hand has a consistent, solid lead over Clinton and would take the presidency without much of a fight. What’s your take on Cruz? From what I’ve gathered, he seems to combine the worst of Clinton and Trump without either of their redeeming qualities. What do you think the effects, both in the populist Trump/Sanders movements, and in the policy direction of the country would likely be under a Cruz presidency? We’ve done a lot of discussion on Clinton’s business as usual versus Trump’s wild card demagoguery that could be disastrous or productive depending on how the wind blows, but until just this last week or two, I’ve largely ignored Cruz.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c3831967319713853141 title="comment permalink">4/6/16, 2:07 PM</a><br><br>

Congratulations on the attention that your excellent work and analysis is getting and I do hope that some good comes from that attention - or it at least raises some uncomfortable questions in certain quarters.<br><br>Entropy is eating our resource base, we're consuming our infrastructure and our numbers are increasing which basically means that there is less of the pie to go around with every passing day. The privileged class are attempting to hang onto what they can, but with declining resources per capita, that simply means - to my mind anyway - that they have to take from others. And they are desperately trying to avoid inflation - by any possible means. The reason for that is because inflation “disappears” their wealth (which in many cases are merely little bits and bytes in a computer memory somewhere).<br><br>Down here there have been some shocking revelations that overseas students have been exploited in many, many industries. And if the students complain then, well, they've breached their student visa's and they risk imminent deportation. I won't even mention the plight of the slaves that are down here.<br><br>My view is that the only way we can move forward is if the people holding the preponderance of power and wealth let go of some of that wealth and redistribute it more evenly across the population. Recessions and Depressions are made because no one has any money to spend on stuff - which is useful because in turn that keeps other people employed.<br><br>Anyway, whilst I'm being very controversial I'm going to say this: Growth based on debt is not growth. Economists are smoking weed if they believe their own line about growth. I've been considering the derivative and futures markets recently and the thing that I find fascinating about those is that they are so far removed from the realities that I'm not even certain that they can be traced back to their supposed reality.

Sanders, like Trump, has <a href=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/transcript-bernie-sanders-meets-news-editorial-board-article-1.2588306 rel=nofollow>few details on how what he would replace our current system with</a>. But both Trump and Bernie are inspiring simply because they offer us the possibility that what we know to be a corrupt establishment can be swept away democratically. Nothing has been better in this long election cycle than watching globalists around the world squirm at the idea of a President Trump squashing the TPP, winding down NATO, and renegotiating America's foreign entanglements. I have friends who work for the actual human establishment that maintains America's domination of global security, and I've never before seen them so worried. <br><br>I live in Japan, and it's very simple to lay out the situation here. The country is stagnant, and will undergo its own democratic revolution as soon as the American Caesar arrives (whoever it might be). The ability to dispute the central command of the party was swept away in 2006 under PM Koizumi, and his eventual replacement, PM Abe, has used that centralization of power to knock out Japan's economic backbone and replace it with undying obedience to the US and a pledge of commitment to the American security agreement. Everything that has been done in this country, even the protests <i>against</i> Abe, has operated on the incredibly naïve assumption that America is always going to have a Clinton/Obama kind of president who will say nice things while continuing to maintain the status quo. To Japan's elites Trump represents pure chaos, and they've been demanding an explanation from their American establishment counterparts for months now. I wonder what they will be saying come August.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c3121586780282724434 title="comment permalink">4/6/16, 5:08 PM</a><br><br>

I think Sanders perhaps even more than Trump is highlighting the divide between wage and salary class because some of the struggles of working class Americans have been papered over with various forms of government assistance from exploding participation in disability insurance, medicaid, and food stamps to the earned income tax credit to student loan checks, which is basically giving free money to anyone who can fog a window and sign a paper saying they are going to attend college. If not for those government programs, the wage class would be even more devastated than it already is...so it's not surprising that Sanders desire to expand programs and make them less covert also gets support....<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c6292291637485026377 title="comment permalink">4/6/16, 5:18 PM</a><br><br>

Course we don't let them sit out on the front porch and shock the neighbors. (I have impeccable Arkie ancestry on both sides including my father's family coming to California in a Model T and my grandmother winning a prize for picking the most table peas in a single day as a migrant worker in Oregon)<br><br>But seriously--I have been reading a book of essays by W. H. Auden and a passage in "The Poet and the City" struck me. "There are two kinds of political issues, Party issues and Revolutionary issues." He explains that in party issues both sides agree on the goal but differ on the means, whereas on revolutionary issues "Different groups within a society hold different views on what is just." He asserts that on party issues tempers should be kept and rhetoric controlled. "Outside the Chamber, the rival deputies should be able to dine in each other's house; fanatics have no place in party politics." But when revolutionary issues are at stake "argument and compromise are out of the question; each group is bound to regard the other as wicked or mad or both." At the time of writing this (late 40s or early 50s) Auden saw racial equality as the only world-wide revolutionary issue and berated the leaders of both capitalist and communist nations for not realizing that the disagreement on how to provide mental and physical health for all citizens was a party, not a revolutionary issue. Interesting point of view. He was apparently not politically sophisticated enough to see how blowing up the other side into the enemy of all things good and right benefited those in power in both the West and the Soviet bloc.<br><br>It seems that what passes for party politics in the U.S. is actually being presented to the voters as more closely approaching revolutionary politics. Not that anyone throws that term around lightly. But the demonization of the opposition on both sides justifies the deadlock that is really, in what I read as the view of this blog, the result of inability to address the real questions without requiring those who pay for elections to give up money, privilege and power. No Western politician feels able to say "the party is over" because real steps to stop resource depletion, etc. would threaten the dividends.

"Cruz on the other hand has a consistent, solid lead over Clinton and would take the presidency without much of a fight." What are you basing that conclusion on? It's not the polls. Looking through the <a href=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/pres_general/ rel=nofollow>Real Clear Politics General Election polls page</a>, I see both Clinton and Sanders consistently beating Trump and Cruz. Only one poll of the entire country has Cruz beating Clinton, and that was a Fox News poll from two weeks ago. Otherwise, only polls of safely Republican states show Cruz winning. This is true where I live. I reporte on a <a href=http://www.examiner.com/article/poll-shows-clinton-and-sanders-beat-trump-and-cruz-michigan rel=nofollow>poll showing Clinton and Sanders beating Trump and Cruz in Michigan</a>.<br><br>@JMG I agree that the country desperately wants change.

One thing that I think deserves mentioning is the fact that, even now, there are still many people that would like to or are planning the emigrate to the US. As my own country is currently having a political seizure that may turn very ugly indeed, a good portion of these possible immigrants are members of the upper classes - doctors, engineers, and so on. They regard the US as a sort of paradise of the rule of law, decent government and good life - they still believe in the American Dream. I'm always met with incredulity any time I talk about the real situation of the US, the imminent end of its empire, and the many possible changes that are to come to its economy and political system. The only thing they dread about Trump is his stance on HB1 visas...<br>You should keep in mind, JMG, when assessing other people's reaction to events in the US, that most foreigners still do believe that the streets of NY are paved with gold.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c2083467385332688068 title="comment permalink">4/6/16, 6:21 PM</a><br><br>

"You" is singular, "y'all" is plural, and "all y'all" is an expansive inclusive plural. It's the same as "I," "we," and "all of us." People get the idea that the term "all y'all" means that "y'all" is singular, but this does not logically follow. By the same reasoning, the existence of the usage "all of them" would mean that "they" is singular, which is nonsense. Like "we" or "they," "y'all" can refer to anywhere from two people up to everyone on Earth, hence clarification is often needed. The colloquialism of dropping the "of" in "All of y'all" is pretty much universal, but this is exactly what the construction means. "Y'all" is only used when speaking to an individual when that individual is the representative of a group or institution. "Do y'all take credit cards here?" The person would answer "Yes we do." "Y'all" functions pefectly normally and regularly as a plural pronoun.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c1903809712883060429 title="comment permalink">4/6/16, 8:26 PM</a><br><br>

Not surprised that Australia is right up there with the US in the same idiotic policies, and I suspect they'll have very similar fates. <br><br>Trog, yeah, that's not exactly a good sign. <br><br>Justin, I don't think Clinton gets it at all. Trump? I think he gets some aspects of it, but nothing like the whole picture. For example, I've never seen any evidence that he gets the limits to growth. <br><br>Gabriela, your friends have no clue what it's like over here. The US economy isn't booming, it's in the tank, and unemployment over here is sky-high -- the statistics are faked by excluding long-term unemployed from the figures. We don't have European-style health care; we've got a law that says we have to buy health insurance that only pays a fraction of our health care costs, for whatever price the insurance companies want to charge. It's true that our newcomers don't want to make us pray any particular way, but corporate interests are using them to drive down wages to starvation levels. Washington DC is protected by oceans from east and west, but not from the south...and I expect when our Odoacer shows up, he'll get the same kind of welcome. <br><br>Bill, I'll talk about Sanders if he turns out to have a shot at the nomination.

I wonder whether it's sunk in to the Democratic establishment just how poor a candidate she actually is. As for writing habits, the other important thing is to remember never to edit while you're writing -- that's where writer's block comes from. Just keep writing; you can go back and edit later. <br><br>Moshe, funny. Having lived in the Seattle area when Microsoft was doing its first big boom, I can testify to the serene detachment from reality that pervades the Gates empire. <br><br>Genevieve, you're missing the difference between the wage class and the welfare class. A lot of people in the wage class don't actually get much government aid -- that's doled out to groups that manage to market their support to politically influential power centers, and the wage class hasn't by and large been good at that for too many decades. <br><br>Rita, Auden was very naive in some ways, and he also had the attitudes appropriate to his class and background. <br><br>Bob, thanks for the link!<br><br>Pygmycory, and that's the problem, of course -- the US media is about as honest these days as Pravda was under the Soviet Union. <br><br>Unknown, with all due respect, I think you're wrong.

The existence of "all y'all" also demonstrates that "y'all" is now seen only as a pronoun, not as a contraction. People will still frequently expand contractions like "can't" into "can not" for emphasis. But no "y'all"-speaker ever expands it in to "you all." They extend it in to "all y'all." "Y'all" is a single morphometric unit. As such, there is a tiny nascient lexicographical movement to drop the apostrophe and write the pronoun as "yall," with the possessive form "yalls" (just like "it" and "its"). This would make it sooo much easier in the written form; "y'all's" is a really weird-looking construct but is an extremely common word in southern speech, and nationwide african american speech, regardless of economic status or educational background.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c7362125668585099533 title="comment permalink">4/6/16, 9:49 PM</a><br><br>

This has been accomplished by a massive, coordinated campaign by the corporate elites through the think tanks, co-opted media, and academic economists they support. (See the Powell Memo from 1971, written by Lewis Powell for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce a few months before he was appointed to the Supreme Court). Virtually all of the gains from productivity have gone to profits (and executive compensation) rather than wages. Since the mid-'70's productivity has increased, IIRC, about 97%, while the median wage has increased somewhere in the single digits. The ongoing campaign to destroy the unions, the substitution of casual employment for long-term job security (cf. Uber), and, yes, the off-shoring of manufacturing have all contributed to this. The overarching concept behind this is the idea that a corporation's single, most important goal is to increase "shareholder value", which means continually increasing profit. Contrary to what many people believe, there is no rule or law that supports this. It was promoted by neoliberal economists like Milton Friedman beginning in the late '70's. (BTW, prior to the '80's, stock buybacks by corporations were a violation of SEC rules. I think that was changed during Reagan's term in office.)<br><br>The issue of immigration is a bit more complicated. The use of H-1B visas to bring in high tech workers has certainly contributed to wage suppression in those fields. However, this is a relatively new phenomenon. The tech industry has also used the age-old method of collusion to keep wages down. Many of you may remember the exposure of several of the biggest tech companies' coordinated efforts to prevent bidding wars over programmers, etc., a couple of years ago. Intuit, Google, Adobe, Apple and others were implicated.<br><br>The problem of undocumented immigrants (I hate the term "illegal immigrants". How can a human being be illegal?) is often misunderstood. Here in Alabama a few years ago, a draconian law was passed that allowed law enforcement to demand immigration papers from anyone they stopped, as well as other provisions that basically made life miserable for anyone who appeared to be Latina/o. Even documented immigrants were afraid to leave their homes. One result was that farmers in North Alabama were unable to find workers to harvest their crops and the entire tomato crop rotted in the fields that year. The point is that undocumented immigrants do not always take jobs from Americans. In another incident, the manager of the Mercedes Benz assembly plant near Tuscaloosa was detained because he did not have his immigration papers in his car. The German press had a field day with that one.<br><br>One other fact to keep in mind about undocumented immigrants is that they are also consumers and spend most of their income in the local economy, increasing aggregate demand. They also pay taxes such as sales tax, property tax (through the rent payments to their landlords), and other taxes, including FICA, for which they never receive any benefit. If you work through the calculations, undocumented immigrants are actually a net positive for the economy, contrary to the propaganda put forth by the elites.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c4460602740805495262 title="comment permalink">4/6/16, 10:58 PM</a><br><br>

Bring up the contradiction, and yes, you're going to get doubletalk. My hope is that this and forthcoming posts will get some of them to notice the cognitive dissonance, and do something constructive about it. As for the email scandal, we'll see. Clinton has a lot of enemies, and it's quite possible that some of them are trying to make sure that her ambitions go nowhere. <br><br>David, banjo lessons are a good fallback!<br><br>Zachary, that could well be.

I'm not sure if you're aware, though, that there's competition -- in Pittsburgh and some other corners of western Pennsylvania, "yinz" (a contraction of "you 'uns") has come into general use. It's not impossible that a few centuries from now, two languages descended from modern English will be instantly distinguishable by their second person plural pronouns...<br><br>Jcummings, that's fascinating -- in other words, "y'all" is evolving to have the same functions as the second person plural in other Indo-European languages, in which it very often serves as a respectful second person singular on occasion. <br><br>Mark, this does not surprise me at all.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c2089688652352727343 title="comment permalink">4/6/16, 11:15 PM</a><br><br>

In claiming that illegal immigrants are a net gain to the economy, in turn, you're finessing the fact that the gains go to the salary class and the losses -- primarily in the form of wages being forced down by excess supply relative to the demand -- go almost entirely to the wage class. The erasure of the class issue pervades and distorts economic thinking in today's America; saying "the economy is growing," as you point out yourself, conceals the question of who gets the benefits of that growth and who bears the costs. <br><br>Charles, I'll certainly consider it. <br><br>Norton (offlist), do you know what the word "genocide" means? It means the actual or attempted extermination of an entire category of people defined by race, religion, <b>class</b>, or some other general label.

Your post explaining the Trump phenomenon was really helpful to those of us in Canada who had been perplexed. <br><br>The election in your country this season is really interesting and the establishment is loosing its grip - visibly. I thought of the electoral process as being given new life. It is now a direct forum around which people can coalesce. What I mean is that the media has done a good job isolating individuals from possible collective push back. Now, citizens are starting to see that they are not the exception (e.g., only my family, only my community, only my town, etc.) struggling in the middle of a "booming" economy with lots of available jobs - if that were the case and others were doing well, they would not be turning out and voting for the establishment outsiders. As such, the voting process is itself a forum. The last thing the elites want is engaged citizenry - they must be panicking by now. In their greed, they simply disenfranchised too many people - they probably thought they had it all stitched up after decades of gradual strip mining of the populace without much fuss - turns out that they are hitting the limits on just about every resource - funny that!<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c2477209839105763058 title="comment permalink">4/6/16, 11:36 PM</a><br><br>

The rape victim analogy is great! I'll share it around, and credit you, and eventually you'll get so many followers you won't be able to answer even half of us!<br>Japan is such an America wannabe. Essentially the same thing is happening here, with its own peculiar twists. The TV all but gloated over Trump's Wisconsin defeat and a week ago, it mentioned difficulties with Hillary's campaign, and that Biden might need to replace her. And what about Bernie? Bernie who? Meanwhile, Japan has a growing problem with child poverty which is serious enough that a "Children's Cafeteria" initiative has sprung up here in a country that has only a very recent history of charity. If I can locate one nearby I'll start donating our produce. The issue of poverty is still well hidden here, because most of the victims are the younger generations, who live at home with their elderly parents on pensions. People my age had part of their pensions stolen in a nifty bureaucratic paper-shredding incident and are now facing the prospect of trying to get by with very little.<br>I am not sure how the Japanese revolt. I think there will be a lot of suicides. Under a Confucian moral system, they prefer stability, and my impression here is that the average citizen has long given up any illusion of a political voice. In China, though, corrupt officials face execution, because under Confucian ethics, they are considered more dangerous that a murderer. Thus people who try to take advantage of their good fortune under the American system may ultimately be called to account. There is, in fact, a venerable tradition of swordsmen exacting revenge against corrupt officials (including one of the folks involved in the paper-shredding scandal), and it has always been of great interest to me how the Yakuza maintain the old, Confucian ethics in Japan.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c5561608682195576194 title="comment permalink">4/7/16, 1:26 AM</a><br><br>

You accomplished the first step in a budding political career: bringing yourself to the attention of the voters and the local political establishment.<br><br>If you have sufficient ego and I imagine you do, the result doesn't mean giving up on being a candidate ever again. It is a signal to prepare the ground more next time.<br><br>If you are working on a strategy to do that, here’s one idea. My town has a bunch of standing committees and commissions that report to the council and make recommendations in specific areas. They include economic development, capital program monitoring, financial, flood, open space, dog park, arts, bicycle/pedestrian advisory, community facilities, library, parks and recreation, historical, quality of life. These committees are composed of volunteers and I frequently see solicitations for applicants to fill vacancies. They want people who have already demonstrated an interest or have relevant expertise. <br><br>I imagine this is a typical arrangement and that some of the committees would be more permeable than others to willing newcomers (e. g., not the planning commission). If there happens to be a vacancy on a committee for which your engineering background is useful, you’ve already demonstrated your seriousness and you would have a good chance of getting on. Serving on such a committee would be worthwhile in itself, give you useful information on how things get done, and put you in the way of connections for your next run for office.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c7875161982075612236 title="comment permalink">4/7/16, 3:23 AM</a><br><br>

And BTW, there was no such thing as a respectful plural "you" or a royal "We" in that period. God, Alfred the Great, and Taran the Welsh slave pigboy would be addressed as "You," usually formally translated "thou," to the confusion of speakers of modern English. But not the local Spanish-speakers. Or any Francophones, who OTH, find addressing the ruler as "You, King....." to be highly slangy and disrespectful. <br><br>At any rate, "thou" blended into "you" in common speech for exactly the same reason that everyone of any rank (certain dishonorable regional exceptions noted)became "Mister, Miss, and Missus." From president to pig keeper. Now falling out of use as respect for the person slips out of fashion and foreign PhDs are addressed - in writing - by their first names, like children and, in some regions I lived in as a transplanted Yankee child, to my shock, the adult help.<br><br>Okay - TMI from a language geek. But postmodern English has had a few very major lacks. Y'all fills one of then, "Ms" -pronounced "Miz", another Southernism orally - is another. And for the collective 3rd person general-reference singular, we're back to the early modern "they", driving the grammar nazis into screaming fits. <br><br>Language is like water and air - rushing in to fill a vacuum.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c1375383174894949853 title="comment permalink">4/7/16, 6:02 AM</a><br><br>

My brief commute to work runs along the shoreline of Lake Michigan and for the past many months, there has been a sizable (~4x6 foot) pro-Trump sign prominently displayed on one of the roadside properties along that main drive. This morning I noticed that the pro-Trump sign had been replaced by an anti-Ryan sign ("Paul Ryan" with the universal "no" symbol). Even more noteworthy, of course, as this is Ryan's home state.<br><br>@BillPulliam regarding the grammatical discussion -- My appreciation for the concise explanation to everyone. As one who grew up (more or less) in the South, the distinctive second-person plural is one of the regionalisms that occasionally creeps into my speech. This far north of the Mason-Dixon line, it tends to get noticed.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c5140708446625266593 title="comment permalink">4/7/16, 6:07 AM</a><br><br>

As a lifetime yall-speaker and a resident of the south for most of my 54 years, I have to say I have never heard this usage. I think yall (the plural meaning everyone who makes this claim, not just you individually) are misinterpreting the plural pronoun used towards an individual as a representative of a group. When someone calls the Mayor "yall" they are addessing her as the representative of the entire city government. If I saw her on the street I would call her "you" even if we had never met before. It's not formal address, it's true grammatical plural. When I call the cashier "yall" I am speaking to him as representative of the business ("Are yall going to be open on the holiday?"). If I am addressing him as an individual I would call him "you" ("Do you have to work on the holiday?"). The classic "How are yall doing?" means you, your momma, your kids, your spouse, your dogs, cats, everyone in the family. "How are you doing?" means you specifically and individually. Since southern culture is very tribal, this form of collective "yall" gets used a lot. A Tennesee fan might say to a Bama fan, "Yall suck!" meaning you and your team and all the other Bama fans everywhere on earth: your tribe. <br><br>In languages that have an official standard second person plural (i.e. most other Indoeuropean languages) all this is understood without confusion. And the same is true for Southerners; we never get confused about "Do you have eggs?" "Do yall have eggs?" and "All yall need to go out and buy some eggs." It's not just a weird dialectical quirk, it's a very useful grammatical distinction that standard English is poorer and weaker for not having. <br><br>JMG - yes I have encountered "yinz." Back in the 70s when I first came across it, it was tabboo and those who used it were called "yinzers," the local equivalent of "hillbilly." Buy, like "hillbilly" it has been reclaimed as a badge of regional pride. As for the competition, "yall" is standard in african-american speech and is very commonly heard in Hip Hop. Because of this it is becoming more widespread and understood by younger people outside the South. And our last three US Presidents have been yall speakers in casual conversation and interviews. But it only takes one or two celebrities from northern Appalachia to put "yinz" in the national pop culture lexicon and everything might be different!<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c6983766079571883027 title="comment permalink">4/7/16, 6:08 AM</a><br><br>

At least Hedges practiced what he preached and spent time in a parish in the poor section of Boston called, I think, Roxbury. <br><br>As for the white underclass, I suspect that the elites have frankly lied to them-telling them that they were special, that they were just like them-and when the economy was doing well for these white working people it was easy to fool them with all of the goodies that go with a strong economy. Now, the elites are not even pretending to have any connection to this population anymore. Liberals like Jerry Springer and reality television poke fun at the white underclass with abandon. The Conservatives poke fun of Trump supporters as well( many of the supporters being of the white underclass), clueless to the fact that they, along with the mainstream media, created the monster that is Trump! <br><br>Whoever wins the election, the results will not be good for the people. As much as I don't like Trump, I find Clinton to be the more frightening figure of the two-I think she will do a hell of a lot more damage than Trump ever could. As for Sanders, who is simply a repeat of the 'hope and change' nonsense of Obama( you'd think people wouldn't fall for that bull again), he would be a disappointment in the same way that Obama was. <br><br>Just my little views.<br><br>Please keep up the good work! :D<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c1083696618730452042 title="comment permalink">4/7/16, 6:50 AM</a><br><br>

But before that, a few points.<br><br>Working class folks are definitely 'not stupid'. I grew up as a carpenter and bush pilot before finally breaking out and attending university to obtain a teaching degree. What, you think a faller dropping a 250' fir doesn't know 'trig'? You think a logging truck driver inching down a frozen mountainside road doesn't know physics? You think a seiner skipper doing a set on Johnstone Strait doesn't understand weather or tides as well as an oceanographer?<br><br>Anyway. I grew up making wages and working piecework, and retired on a salary with a pension. Back in 1981 I was laid off from a flying job by the owner trying to break our Union. The date was Nov. 24th, and this allowed him to forgo paying me Christmas and Boxing day stats. He turned down 2 weeks of solid flying revenue for the company to deny me 2 days of holiday pay. I knew at that moment the comapny would always be a terrible place to work, regardless of our pay and benefits, and went back to construction. That very lean Christmas, (wife at home and young children...mortgage) I discovered the following song by Merle Haggard, "If We Make It Through December". I have played it every Christmas for the past 35 years as part of our Christmas 'experience, and have never forgotten the words or what it conveyed. It would help the 'salary class' to understand what working folks endure, as they feather their nest on wage earners sweat and taxes, especially if they went through being pitched out on the street or out of their career merely to 'break their Union'. Anyway, I have loved Merle Haggard ever since and learned through life just who is and was on my side. It definitely wasn't politicans, corporations, universities, school districts; 'the system'.

We have both an "illegal guest worker" and "illegal immigrant" problem, and they are quite distinct. The former are the people who come in to work and send money home, the latter are the people who come here to stay because they want to live here. While Trump's wall is pure fantasy, he finally said how he was going to get Mexico to pay for it: stop all the money flowing back home from illegal guest workers. He missed the simple fact that, if he could actually do that (and it wouldn't be all that hard, BTW), there would be a massive exodus of illegal guest workers. They're here to earn money for their families back home.<br><br>All the kids being sent north by their parents to escape the chaos in Central America are the actual illegal immigrants. That's a humanitarian issue, not a guest worker issue.

However, living in a place where this is the predominant class, it is more complicated than that. I have had lots of very witty insightful and stimulating conversations with many people who probably do not have a single college graduate in their ancestry and may not even have many high school grads on their paternal lines. BUT, the impoverished environment does have its effects. I learned really quickly on moving here a decade and a half ago that I need to be careful about complex sentence structures. Big "five dollar" words are not such a problem, but lots of nested subordinate clauses tend to cause a slightly panicky stare in the eyes of the person I am chatting with. I have always thought (and have seen nothing to change my mind) that this is mostly due to underfunded schools. And it turns out you can express your ideas, even very complex ones, just fine without complex sentence structures and latinate jargon, without dumbing them down at all. And you can be introduced to whole new ways of understanding by listening to people whose ancestors never set foot in an institution of higher education.<br><br>There is another problem in the poorer areas though; actually a set of problems: drugs, alcohol, poor prenatal care, poor diet, untreated chronic health conditions like diabetes, etc. And of course now young vets with varying degrees of PTSD, since these are the communities that disporoportionately staff the US military with their youngsters. All these things really do damage the mind and body in ways that can't always be recovered from. And the mainstream culture's seeming willingness to let these things burn through poor and rural areas uncontrolled, so long as they don't affect the kids of the people with money, really does constitute slow-motion genocide. <br><br>Now, would President Trump actually do one single fracking thing for these communities? HAH! I would not bet a single penny on THAT! President Bernie? He might try, but Congress won't give a flip and without Congress the President is mostly impotent on domestic matters.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c3809083719396781535 title="comment permalink">4/7/16, 8:54 AM</a><br><br>

It seems like, for every promising policy, (fines on offshore accounts, trade barriers, support for manufacturing, age adjusted wages, etcetera), he’s got things tossed in that feel like a complete overhaul in the absolute opposite direction (lowering income tax all the way down to pre-depression levels, overturning business regulations, abolishing the EPA and getting rid of any environmental regulations whatsoever, support for a high surveillance military state, etc.). <br><br>But there are some things he supports that legitimately frighten me. Scapegoating and stereotyping of broad groups of people does get to me, and yes, that does include scapegoating of Trump supporters, which I have called out on every turn (and lost a few friends over it), but as a religious minority, scapegoating of other religious minorities (regardless of my feelings on their ideology) gives me a sick and familiar feeling in my stomach. I do worry about the way a lot of his rhetoric about illegal immigration has gotten the anger of his followers directed not at the employers, who are bringing in undocumented workers for pay that consists of a warehouse sleeping mats, a bucket, and the threat of deportation. It feels like the anger is getting directed at the wrong people… at people who are themselves mostly victims… and as that anger builds into a movement, the possibility that there will be people swinging from trees in the wake of this grows, and I’m afraid that it won’t be the representatives of the power establishment the mobs turn on. I hope I’m wrong, I really do, but there does seem to be a mean streak directed not at the people profiting off of the issues in our society, but instead at groups of people who are poor, marginalized people themselves…<br><br>This passage from an Archdruid Report you wrote a few years back keeps churning through my mind every day as I watch this election cycle unfold, and in a lot of ways, I think it could go down as one of your more accurate predictions:<br><br><br>“Imagine along these lines, dear reader, that sometime in the next year or so you start hearing media reports about a rising new figure in American politics [who] looks as though [he] might just be able to break the stranglehold of the established parties on the political system. Some of his ideas come straight from the fringes, and he’s been reported to have said very negative things about Arabs and Islam, but he’s nearly the only person in American public life willing to talk frankly about the difficulties Americans are facing in an era of economic collapse, and his party platform embodies many of the most innovative ideas of the left and right. Like him or not, he offers the one convincing alternative to business as usual in an increasingly troubled and corrupt system. Would you vote for him? Millions of Germans did.”<br><br>I’m thinking a lot lately about the life of Oswald Spengler himself, who voted for Hitler, seeing him as the best chance to break Germany out of the stranglehold of its decline, thinking that some of his more unsavory ideas were unlikely to influence the Germany he created… only to spend the last 5 years of his life watching in horror, and insisting at the top of his lungs that Hitler was a dangerous ideologue who would rather destroy businesses than see Jews in them and writing about his defeat, which he never lived to see. I’ve been feeling twisted up inside. I really do understand the anger, and I really do understand why some of Trump’s policies could be a break in a positive direction, though there are some things that I’m a little more doubtful on. But there are some things going on that just tug the wrong way on my conscience and I don’t really know how to feel about it. I suppose there have always been a lot of people like this at the cusp of every period of great change, stuck in the middle, tugged between their core human values and practical solutions…<br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c4346135262374419018 title="comment permalink">4/7/16, 9:27 AM</a><br><br>

Marry into a venerable old family. Buy several properties along the main drag, even if they are money pits. Find out where the power brokers go for their morning coffee. Be prepared for many sexist and racist jokes. Figure out what the "power" church is, and join it. Figure out which civic organizations or lodges are favored by the power brokers, and join them. Make sure your children go to school with, and only associate with, the children of the power brokers. Wives have an even harder time negotiating the power at the female end of the spectrum. But, since you've married into an old family, that will not be a problem. <br><br>A story I read years ago, somewhere, has stuck with me. I think it was in New England. It was an obituary for an old fellow who lived to be about 86. His family had moved to the area, when he was five or six. He was very well liked and respected, in the community. The kicker was the line "We loved him like one of our own." :-) Lew<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c4334009238073981556 title="comment permalink">4/7/16, 10:51 AM</a><br><br>

There was a time when people advocated for equality and mutual respect on the grounds of American patriotism, but it didn't work out and now the movement's ideas have become doubly politicized, first in their own right and then as flags of allegiance to the elite. Of course, there are plenty of people in the wage class fighting the good fight, but the elite left has mostly abandoned them and identified their ideas with heavy-handed paternalism at best and raw class hatred at worst.<br><br>As for the election, it looks like another Clinton presidency at the moment. If Kasich allies with Trump at the convention in exchange for the VP spot, I'd give the pair even odds against Clinton, but otherwise Trump is going to have a hard time winning the nomination (50% chance Trump, 40% Cruz, 10% other) and a harder one winning the White House (70% chance Clinton, 30% Trump).<br><br>I'm not sure that Toynbee's civilization-length waves of creative and dominant minorities (I think that in the West's case we've actually had a couple such waves already, but that's another discussion....), or even the higher-frequency "rhythm of disintegration," are on the right time-scale for talking about this election. A similar dynamic seems to happen cyclically in American politics, going once around every 50 years or so (sometimes a deal longer), going back possibly as far as the French and Indian War or farther (I don't know enough colonial history to even speculate well about anything much earlier than the Revolution). This election may be a watershed in a longer process, but it is most likely smaller than that (though still very significant compared to those immediately adjacent).<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c2623536427079162195 title="comment permalink">4/7/16, 10:53 AM</a><br><br>

Trump, racism, and the disrespect the salaried class shows for the "cracker" class:<br><br>You are correct that not all Trump supporters are racist; at least, they're no more racist than most of the rest of us. The problem I see with Trump is his rhetoric; a rhetoric that inflames sentiment against people of color, immigrants (legal as well as illegal), and religious minorities (especially Muslims). Trump's rhetoric is far from benign; already, some of my Muslim and Latino students are worried that they might be targeted by Trump supporters; it's already happened, as you probably know. His slogan, "Make America Great Again," when stripped of its facade, seems to mean, "Make America White Again," or at least "Making America Great Entails That White People Stay In Charge." Pitting American against American is an old ploy of elitists, of course. Trump hardly belongs to the wage class himself, obviously. <br><br>I must speak out against a politician who pits Americans against other Americans, who scapegoats people, and who advocates violence against protesters at his rallies.<br><br>Regarding salaried class' disrespecting wage classes, you are correct, of course. But the problem here is that wage classes and their supporters seem to be doing things to encourage that kind of disrespect. Case in point: the Tennessee state legislature passing legislation making the Barrett .50 caliber rifle the "official state fiream" (a rifle so powerful, according to the Washington Post, it can destroy commercial aircraft) and more recently passing another piece of legislation making the Christian Bible the "official state book." You can complain all you want about "elitist" attitudes toward the wage classes, but acts like these seem to invite ridicule.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c5765132232657133781 title="comment permalink">4/7/16, 5:15 PM</a><br><br>

It measures how isolated you are from the culture of the working class americans who make up the core Trump-voter demographic. Of course, it has been denounced widely by salary-class bloggers, many of whom don't really understand what they're arguing against. Here's an example from Grist:<br><br>http://grist.org/cities/if-you-live-in-a-city-this-pbs-quiz-tells-you-youre-an-elitist-dont-believe-it/<br><br>His first rebuttal completely misses the point of the question, which asks "Have you ever lived for at least a year in an American community with a population under 50,000 that is not part of a metropolitan area and is not where you went to college?” by pointing out that large cities are poorer than surrounding suburbs. It was completely lost on the writer that the "surrounding" suburbs are considered part of the metropolitan area. Towns like the one I live in in central Pennsylvania, which has 6000 people and is over 100 miles away from any large city really don't exist in the worldview of people from places like New York City, which my town, and others near it even more so, is probably poorer than. <br><br>His last paragraph is even more revealing when he says "Many city dwellers, even wealthy ones, are far less insulated than suburbanites who shuttle in oversized automobiles from their McMansions to air-conditioned indoor malls." Those are, again, not the people the quiz was asking about. Working class people in rural areas definitely don't live in McMansions or drive SUVs. This view of America is only "outdated and racist" because salary class individuals in cities have no idea that anyone lives between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, or in the central US "flyover country". <br><br>Of course, yes, cities are filled with working class people who don't fit the description of the quiz, but fact that the author ignores the existence of the working class people the quiz is asking about is frankly, disturbing and much of the reason they're voting for Trump.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c2458587325159246218 title="comment permalink">4/7/16, 5:28 PM</a><br><br>

Trump actually gets a disproportionate percentage of supporters from the upper working class to lower middle class, not the working poor or even worse off. Instead, it is Sanders who has won over the lowest income Americans, poor whites included.<br><br>https://newcoldwar.org/bernie-sanders-not-donald-trump-winning-white-working-class/<br><br>“Writing for In These Times, author Jack Metzgar notes that the basis for this assumed white working-class support for Trump is his popularity among Republican voters who lack a college degree, who have indeed preferred him to the other Republicans in the race. “Among all adult whites,” however, “nearly 70 percent do not have bachelor’s degrees,” the definition of working class used by pundits. One recent survey found that 55 percent of this group support Trump, meaning “the white working-class is under-represented among Trump supporters,” Metzgar observes, which means “his supporters are disproportionately college-educated whites.”<br><br>“This becomes clear when one takes a step back from the tiny weird world of the U.S. right and looks at the electorate as a whole. In a general election, polls Sanders would not only beat Trump but destroy him: Reuters currently has him up by nearly 10 per cent overall, and that with far less media coverage. Among white voters in particular, Sanders’ margin of victory in the most recent poll does drop to just under 5 per cent — but among white voters who make less than US$25,000 a year, his margin of victory actually grows to 15 per cent. Among unemployed white voters, that number rises to 16 per cent. Practically no one who isn’t white is voting for Donald Trump.<br><br>“Commentators are right, then, to believe the Trump phenomenon is a white people problem — it’s just the data shows it’s not working-class whites who are the heart of this problem."<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c5316511867517120991 title="comment permalink">4/7/16, 5:51 PM</a><br><br>

While it is true that there is an excess supply of labor relative to demand, this is not a problem that can be solved by making adjustments to the supply side; we need to increase aggregate demand. The existence of the excess labor supply is an intended consequence of the campaign to suppress wages, thereby suppressing demand since everyone's income is someone else's spending. By creating a large cohort of unemployed, the ownership class creates a race to the bottom as desperate people become willing to work for ever lower wages.<br><br>We need to increase aggregate demand in our economy and there are only three basic ways to do that. One is to increase the the amount of exports over imports, which is not entirely in our control and right now is seriously negative and does not appear to be improving. A second is to increase spending by the private, non-government sector, which also ain't happening as most households are still trying to pay off debt acquired during the run up to the financial crisis and as you note, their incomes are not increasing. And businesses won't increase spending unless they can clearly see more customers demanding their products and services. The third is to increase government spending, specifically the federal government. This isn't happening either right now because the morons in Congress and the Federal Reserve and the mainstream economists who support them still believe that cutting federal government spending is somehow going to cause households and businesses to increase their spending. Money is the fuel that runs the economy. If you reduce the amount spent, either through savings (or debt reduction), increased imports over exports, or reducing government spending, the economy cannot grow.<br><br>So, it seems the only solution is to increase federal government spending since it is the only entity whose spending is not constrained by the amount of income available.<br><br>Explaining that last sentence would take a separate blog altogether and there are others who have already done so far better than I can. For those interested, if you are not familiar with Modern Monetary Theory, I recommend checking out Warren Mosler's blog at Center of the Universe and his "Seven Deadly Innocent Frauds", and the economics professors from the University of Missouri-Kansas City who blog at New Economic Perspectives.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c8929768747648536727 title="comment permalink">4/7/16, 6:46 PM</a><br><br>

He told his bosses he'd not be flying anymore, for personal travel or to attend conferences, which he was doing to the tune of ~50000 miles/year. He has an online draft of a book called Becycling where he details many of the adjustments to his life he's made. Quite interesting, with two kids and wife and ancient veg-oil powered car and bees and chickens and an old house and composting and bike commuting and humanure and even civil disobedience.

They've taken a fancy for Jose Mujica, the president of Uruguay. I don't know whether he has been featured in America or not. He is a former guerrilla, incarcerated in solitary for a dozen years and tortured, but currently an endearingly grandfatherly farmer with a tractor, an old VW and an income of about $1000/month. He is in Kyoto now on live TV, fielding questions and giving advice. For example, he notes there are a lot of lonely elderly people in Japan, abandoned by their families and forced to live alone. He says Japan should build facilities so that they can live in communities. In his country, they provide free housing for the poor with the stipulation that the poor themselves build them. I dare say the Japanese are enthralled. Maybe this is the form the revolt will take here.<br>Mujica has met with Putin, but probably not with Obama, or else the TV would have shown that, I think.

Everyone uses it from the guy who lives under the bridge up to Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. "Yous" still seems to be very much taboo in the "educated classes" in most areas.

I also rarely if ever hear people defending it the way many of us southerners militantly defend "yall."<br><br>Hal -- The south is a huge place, I don't need to tell you, and regional differences are enormous. Sometimes I think there's more diversity just within the southern US than in all the rest of Anglophone North America combined. A Tennessee Henry Higgins could probably tell you which holler in which county your parents came from by listening to you talk. So not surprised if there's some variation here, especially among older folks. Southern speech has changed a lot in the last two generations. Non-rhotic speech (R-dropping) is all but extinct in people under 60 in most areas, even in places it used to be common. My mother-in-law from Savannah GA used both R-dropping and an intrusive R at the end of words ("Savanner"), as well as some amazingly drawled vowels. The vowel in the number "eight" was two full syllables -- "Ayuht." Sadly, I think that distinctive accent may have died with her last year; I have not heard it in anyone else.<br><br>And by the way since these regional speech patterns are often used as class signifiers, this is actually kinda on topic...<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c3850025256113742660 title="comment permalink">4/8/16, 5:50 AM</a><br><br>

Basically, Americans would prefer to believe that we are a classless society, but if pressed, we are willing to admit that there are economic classes (upper/middle/lower). We might even be willing to admit that some of these classes have more power and privilege afforded to them than others. However most of us just assume that you can change class by getting more or less money. The point that they drive home in their conversation is that economic class is not the same thing as social class, and that social class is a thing that exists in America. While economic class is driven by how much money a person has, social class is based more on speech, beliefs, and behavior. <br>Making this distinction has definitely helped me in clarifying me thought and conversations. It's very hard to understand our culture without admitting that social class is a thing that exists and a thing that is important to American society. It's kind of like finding a hammer in your toolbox halfway through a building project. <br>You probably understand this concept already, but you may still find it interesting to listen to a couple of guys working through the cognitive dissonance that most of our public has on the issue.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c421239449415987478 title="comment permalink">4/8/16, 7:37 AM</a><br><br>

And it mainly focuses on the rise of independent contract work, which interestingly enough in a lot of ways resembles a shift into the sort of post-decline economy you discuss in your "end of employment" essay a while back. I wonder if, once the dust clears in the wake of the 2020s crisis, where whatever comes of rising class tensions and spreading unemployment (and independent workers) opens the way towards a shift to an economy designed to aid and protect independent workers through the rise of trade guilds, etcetera. It'd be the sort of twist in conventional wisdom that seems to come out of major crises. It'd also be an economic opening for people doing the Green Wizardry work as well. <br><br>https://newrepublic.com/article/132407/voters-angry-its-1099-economy-stupid<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c493671036937353024 title="comment permalink">4/8/16, 8:04 AM</a><br><br>

My favorite poster is a guy who is definitely a leftist, but who primarily sticks up for poor rural people rather than for some race, gender, or sexuality based group. To use some Internetese, he's like a social justice warrior for rural people. <br><br>It's amazing to watch how seriously this disturbs the regular 'SJW' types. They'll start calling him things they won't even call the actual conservatives, because he dares to defend a group of people who are despised by the salary-class left and (ostensibly) supported by conservatives. Even the ones who are supposed to be Marxists and therefore see the world in class terms actually hate the poor who don't happen to fall into some other oppressed class, and nothing makes them angrier than having their own internal contradictions pointed out.<br><br>Of course then I have to clean up the flames and give people infractions and time-outs while dealing with their angry messages, which is annoying, but it's worth it just to watch hypocritical ideologues get "called out" on their own prejudices.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c102622262078881770 title="comment permalink">4/8/16, 1:26 PM</a><br><br>

Clinton gets Democratic nomination simply by superdelegate math regardless of which one has a tiny edge in pledged delegates by then.

You see, before those jobs were offshored, they first were moved South, starting in the mid-20th century. The South industrialized rapidly, and gloated over its old arch-nemesis, the industrial North--we offered "right to work (for less)", lower wages, lax regulation, tax incentives, and poached industry from the unionized, industrial North. Little did we suspect at the time that we were just a way station on the way to even lower wages, enforcement, and costs overseas.

It was made clear to us in no uncertain terms that we were the smallest generation ever, and were to take a back seat to the most important generation to ever walk the face of the Earth. So our rage was turned inward. I'm sure that there are a few Gen X parents who would take vicarious pleasure in seeing their offspring torch the system that they felt powerless to do anything about, the same way some Boomer parents took vicarious pleasure in seeing their offspring join a garage band, go to a Dead concert, etc.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c6141480555852952884 title="comment permalink">4/8/16, 4:01 PM</a><br><br>

He's speaking about lack of price transparency, monopolistic practices of insurance and pharmaceutical companies, and overcharging when people are "in extremis" such as helicopter rides and perhaps ambulance rides. I find all that interesting. Because while it is becoming more and more obvious that we are abandoning the rule of law as a nation, these nefarious practices have been getting slowly worse for quite a few years.<br><br>And I have an idea for a grassroots way to fight at least one of these prongs - the lack of price transparency - the way that you can't find out what they plan to charge you for anything, whether at a clinic or hospital. A website should be set up with a big data base so that people could post what price they were just charged for something and where. Zip codes, towns, streets and names of institutions. When possible, they should black out personal information and take a picture of the bill. Armed with this information, people can begin negotiating. At first, the information is after the fact, but soon it will be obvious what a place has recently charged someone, and the customers can begin to bargain. If they won't tell a price, walk away. If they find out that they were charged double what the place across town charged, that goes public. I think that people are starting to get some clarity about how this scam works and the ignorance of the public has allowed these institutions to get away with it. Once people help one another to price shop, the game could change.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c3956361091964099841 title="comment permalink">4/8/16, 5:57 PM</a><br><br>

In Latin America the old political system that communist rebels from the sixties and plutocrats bent on pillaging whole countries built together is cracking everywhere. Here in Brazil there are a few dead bodies on the streets: yesterday two communist militiaman were killed by cops in an ambush. Last month many VIPs that knew too much died in suspicious circunstances: planes falling, larceny and falling from balconies. And the russians are bringing lots of guns and gunships to many places in Latin America while american plutocrats finance neoliberal agitators. At the same time a philosopher with new, strange and dangerous (to the regime and the wannabe neoliberal successors) is being read and discussed by the masses, in some ways similar to the Ayatollah during the prelude of the Islamic Revolution in Iran. At least the weather improved and the dams are full of water.<br><br>In Argentina the neoliberals are ruling and the people are getting poorer and poorer but It seems that things will improve since foreign investment is back once the bolivarians were gone from the power. And Venezuela looks like Somalia just before the breakdown. All it takes is a bullet on Maduro's chest and the country will blow up and become even worse.<br><br>And in Europe the sons of the goths and franks are on the receiving end of a classical barbarian migration. The ironies of destiny. <br><br>Toynbee also said that old faiths, the "souls" of societies absorbed by another don't really die but stay dormant, underground, mutating into something else, like what became the Islam gestating in the borders of the hellenic society until it matured with the prophet. And we see dead religions walking everywhere... the Santa Muerte, followers of Odin, neoplatonists and many others.<br><br>The 2nd great crisis has alredy begun, the flame rises and is quite hot in the colonies.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c3698849069463249861 title="comment permalink">4/8/16, 7:31 PM</a><br><br>

The federal government in reality does not need to collect FICA at all since it can and does create money whenever it pays its bills. However, fully open borders, it seems to me, can create other problems. I still haven't worked that out completely in my own thinking.<br><br>@nuku - Agreed. There is much evil that is related to power relations rather than money, such as you said, although power and money are closely related. The conversation you mentioned elicited a WTF!!! I'm Jewish and have never heard that. What a f---ing idiot.<br><br>@Mark - I just looked it up and it appears that the majority of translations use "root of all kinds of evil" or "root of all sorts of evil". However, the King James Bible says "the root of all evil". From Timothy 6:10.<br><br>@Nastarana - You are correct, I did not include those, but how do we lower fixed costs in the economy such as housing and transportation. Health care costs for the people can be reduced to nothing by instituting a Medicare-for-All plan, cradle to grave, everyone in, no one out, no co-pays, no deductibles, paid for by the federal government. This would eliminate the 35-40% that insurance companies add to the cost of health care. Pure economic rent.<br><br>The only way I know of to directly reduce those other fixed costs is through price controls and that creates more problems. If, however, we were to institute a Job Guarantee that offered a living wage to anyone who was able and willing to work, the increased demand would cause developers to build more housing and competition would keep a lid on unconscionable rent increases. Perhaps a bit of temporary rent control would be necessary while new construction caught up to demand.<br><br>Please explain how "we know perfectly well that immigration pushes up the costs of necessary amenities". Utilities such as water and electricity are regulated and if the regulators are honest (I know, many are not), rate increases are capped. I agree that rent seeking needs to be stopped. As Keynes said, we need to euthanize the rentiers.<br><br>I agree that the risk of a hot war is incredibly high right now due to the aggression of the American Empire and the increase in the placing of armaments near Russia's borders through NATO. No one would win. There is already some talk in some circles about using tactical nuclear weapons.

You insist that such stories are somehow going to motivate "us" to change, and then leap to the conclusion that because I don't circulate that brand of pablum, I must be in favor of the destruction of the Earth. If I'd set out to come up with a clueless response to my comments on <i>Yes!</i> Magazine, one that embodied its most embarrassing features, I don't think I could have done a better job than you did. <br><br>Benjamin, you're ducking my point. As I said -- in so many words -- the divisions I'm discussing are between classes: the salary class, the wage class, and the welfare class. The poorest white people belong to the welfare class, while Trump's main base of support is the wage class. Please do take the time to make sure you understand what I'm saying before you misstate it and accuse me of getting it wrong!<br><br>John, what you've suggested here has been the conventional wisdom for decades, and it hasn't worked. Do you recall what "doing the same thing and expecting different results" is a definition of? Attempting to increase the demand for labor at this point can't be done without accelerating resource depletion and environmental damage, which are already costing the global economy more than it can afford and promises to get much, much worse as we proceed. We cannot grow our way out of problems that are caused by too much growth. <br><br>You've also insisted, without argument or evidence, that for some reason it's impossible to deal with the supply end of the oversupply of labor. That's a remarkable example of begging the question, because there are straightforward ways to do this: enforcing US immigration laws, and eliminating a handful of visa programs that allow big corporations to bring in workers from overseas en masse, would do the job promptly. Insisting that this is somehow unthinkable makes a great dodge for those who are happy with the consequences of the impoverishment and immiseration of the US wage class, but it's circular reasoning of the worst sort -- and makes a very good example of the kind of dubious thinking that has landed us in the present crisis. <br><br>Bryan, glad to hear about your colleague. My dislike of <i>Yes! Magazine</i> comes largely from the way that it's become the <i>Reader's Digest</i> of the green Left. Heartwarming stories about this or that individual doing something praiseworthy are all well and good, but when they're presented in a relentlessly feel-good context about how this or that person is building a shiny green future for us all, they very quickly turn into an excuse for inaction. Did that article mention the thousands of other climate scientists who heard about your colleague, scuffed their feet, and went on flying to climate conferences? (If your colleague is Dr. Peter Kalmus, I read about him some time ago when he first brought this issue up, and recall what was said then about the reaction of his colleagues.) For that matter, have you yourself decided to follow his example?<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c4518938142508543129 title="comment permalink">4/8/16, 9:58 PM</a><br><br>

Everything I've read suggests that when white politicians in the South talked about state's rights in the 1950s and 1960s, they and everyone else south of the Mason-Dixon line knew exactly what they were talking about -- that is, the continuance and enforcement of Jim Crow laws.

You might wonder why actual economists believe the BLS statistics? As it happens, there’s a second data series from a private company, using their own resources: the ADP employment report. ADP (formerly Automatic Data Processing) is a payroll processor, and it processes a huge proportion of the small business payrolls in this country. Now, the ADP report doesn’t match the BLS report exactly, but it’s close enough that real economists are pretty sure that the BLS report isn’t a pile of steaming you know what.<br><br>This is the case with a lot of government reports: there are reports from private companies and industry associations that cover much of the same territory.

People really do think that racism is central to fascism and frequently just equate both. <br><br>There's something about that equation that doesn't seem to be commonly known in Europe and even less so in the US. There is a belief on the far left that nations are 'imaginary constructs' that are inherently racist and that serve the interests of capitalism by dividing the global working class. It follows that borders are racist, all of them, and state enforcement of borders is racist and authoritarian (translates to 'fascist'). It also follows that border controls serve the interests of capitalism. This is the theory and reality is irrelevant. Internationalism you could call it.<br><br>what people other than conspiracy theorists really don't seem to know is that this pretty fringe idea has far more influence on mainstream politics than the numbers of adherents would suggest. Scratch the background of many anti-racism or migrant rights activists and you'll see it. They work within and alongside your governments too. <br><br>I can't prove this because no mainstream journalist will look into those backgrounds. I know it because i am, or was, an insider and i know some of them personally. They're an international lot, well educated, get jobs in NGO's and state bodies. They're not evil conspiracists, they mostly mean well -apart from a few inevitable agents provocateurs. They're just taking post-modern subjectivism to its logical conclusion by dissolving categories. <br><br>They support migrants of all kinds, for any reason, anywhere, any time, to breach borders, by force if necessary -because they believe they have a moral right to dismantle racist structures. And because they believe that that kind of civil disobedience is a legitimate way to achieve the goal of a borderless world.<br><br> It's a utopian goal that was once intended to happen democratically, voluntarily, as part of a global revolution which would end all glaring differences of global wealth, power, freedom etc. but they're happy to push for it in the short term, in the world as it is now - unequal, unjust, wars, terrorism and all.<br><br>The reason they have disproportionate influence is that they unwittingly serve the actual interests of capitalism (among others). They're used as the PR troops of those interests who seek cheap labour, while not being trusted by them either. They can't see that clearly because the Theory tells them the opposite. <br><br>I've had the weird experience of talking about open borders policies with Sanders-type supporters in the US. They genuinely didn't seem to know what I was talking about, or else had no idea that the concept is more than a fringe one in the US. They seemed to think that the scale of illegal immigration into the US was unintentional and that no one supported it. <br><br>It's actually easy to prove this for yourself. Learn the terminology of No Borders, then interview anti-racism activists who treat migrant rights as part of antiracism. Many of them have no coherent theory of the connection. They've just picked up the vague idea. But ask enough and you'll find the ones who really do believe that anything less than the dissolution of all borders and total freedom of movement is racist and a breach of human rights. That's the theoretical underpinning of the link between border policy and racism. The fact that opposition to immigration is sometimes motivated by racism actually has little or nothing to do with it.<br><br>Mallow.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c8889032848208332263 title="comment permalink">4/9/16, 2:01 AM</a><br><br>

It's the eschatological element to Neoliberalism - "the end of history" - that tends to insulate its advocates. There's an odd dualism to so many ideologies in that they can be simultaneously cynical and naive, selfish and utopian. If it's good for me, it must be good for everybody, right?<br><br>We're going through a similar process in the UK with the vote to leave the EU, which looks like it's going to be very close. It's clear to me that many of the advocates of remaining in the EU, as well as peddling it as "realism", do have a kind of spiritual belief in the EU, which is a classic utopian "end of history" project. Part of the magic of the EU is the assumption that it owns the future, that there was a bad past of small, confused nations endlessly fighting, but which are now in the process of permanent replacement by a benign monolith that will endure for eternity.<br><br>The salary class, or the elite, do not just draw economic sustenance from Neoliberal globalisation - they are deeply emotionally, psychologically and spiritually invested in it. The global economy, the blurring and erasure of borders, really is their pride and joy - it is what they have collectively strived for over decades. This is explains the anger of the likes of Kevin Williamson towards those who might take it away. There are elite British pundits who are similarly panicking, such as here: (It's paywalled, but the first paragraph will give you the idea.)<br><br>http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/dcpros-lb7r63rbj<br><br>I think the Neoliberals are not going to go down without a very vicious fight because ultimately, for all the "realism" that they endlessly regale us with, they are true believers, and the end of the global economy, like the end of the Soviet Union, will psychologically destroy those who were invested in it.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c7775246696097574334 title="comment permalink">4/9/16, 3:09 AM</a><br><br>

Our non-presidential primary elections, which are what establish the tone and select the general election candidates, have shockingly low voter turnout. I suppose the fact that the wage class no longer votes is a major aspect of everything you have been discussing in this thread.<br><br>By the way, all this class stuff, and the "blaming the wage class in the South" stuff in particular, is exactly why I an among the few who felt "Go Set a Watchman" corrected the sins of "To Kill a Mockingbird," and liked the new book. In "Mockingbird," the hero is a salary-class white man attempting to save a black man from the racism and oppression foisted on him by the lower class whites. But it was not the "rednecks" who created slavery and Jim Crow. Their ancestors did not practice or directly benefit from slavery, they did not write or enact the segregationist laws. This was the doing of men like Atticus and his ancestors. And this is made clear in "Watchman," which is probably why it was not acceptable for publication in the 1950s. The characteras in "Watchman" are less fleshed out, but they behave the way southerners of that era actually did. The Citizen Council is the white upper class, they are the ones fighting desegregation, promoting racist ideology, and passing the laws.

I have also lived most of my life in small towns (which makes me feel right at home in Sweden and in Jakarta). I want to share about how I suddenly became aware of the massive class divisions in society.<br><br>I had a major client in a big city, who brought me in to do some onsite work. They were willing to pay for a taxi between their site and the hotel, but I discovered I could take bus and cut the travel time in half (since it meant not waiting for a taxi). I told one of the directors of the client this and the look of horror was unforgettable. So much so that I mentioned my transportation to get a second opinion from the owner of the restaurant around the corner (a wonderful man and immigrant). His eyes lit up and he said "I love busses!" And suddenly I understood.<br><br>But that brings me to a second point, that there is another massive division in the US today and that is between rural and urban. In fact rural Americans of any social class, are effectively politically wage-earners Small towns don't afford the same luxuries regarding class divisions that large cities do and the correctional officer, the lawyer, the doctor, and the gas station attendant likely all know eachother, talk politics and economics, and the like. I the cities this never happens.<br><br>Finally, I wanted to talk briefly about the arc of history when it comes to decline and fall. I think one of the things which is typically missing when one looks at the British and American empires is the development of industrialization. While those which industrialized later often did so in a different way, in both the US and the UK, industrialization was furthered by intentionally and massively impoverishing a large class of people. In the UK this was done by seizing the monasteries and enclosing the common fields (thus forcing peasants off the land and into the cities to look for work). In the US, this was done by freeing the slaves and then insisting that the strategy out of poverty was to get a job (Andrew Johnson in fact strongly resisted any effort at land reform). The result is that you get a large, perpetual underclass (and in the US this is a racial underclass as much as an economic one).<br><br>This leads, I think to a kind of hard stratification that doesn't necessarily happen in other societies, where different groups live in different social realities which exist in competition with eachother.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c4342113236214348486 title="comment permalink">4/9/16, 7:16 AM</a><br><br>

Just to show how this is untrue, I went and did it again pretending that I was in my early twenties. I got a score of 4. And, my answers to those 4 actually did include living in some poverty and in a smaller community without a majority of college grads, as well as hitchhiking and riding greyhound. I got this incredibly low score almost entirely on the cultural class background of my family of origin, which has mostly stayed with me. On the other hand, many of the higher "points" I get now are not due to quite the reasons they think. There is such a demographic as the rural gentility! We own a pickup truck because we need to do some heavy hauling for our farm. Would not own one otherwise. We live near people without degrees because we live rural. Most of the people I know do NOT hang out with friends with widely differing opinions, which is why I try to keep most of them to myself. Most people are not as tolerant as I am, both left and right, but sadly I am coming to see that the left is the more intolerant of the two.

As well he listens to no one, defers to no one and hardly filters his words, they go straight from his mind then past his lips. Those things make him ineligible to be an organization man, a party man, a company man. Which in turn meant he could never have been a rich man unless he inherited his money which he did to start and/or become an entertainer which he did and/or enter a business that didn't require a classic hierarchical/corporate form that passes down authority to those eager to subsume their individuality to devote most all their energy to the common good of the company which he did. <br><br>In other words he could not possibly have even entered into the salary class and is not of it which in turn is why he so appalls that class which includes everyone who is anyone. One odd fact about this group is that every 'news' person and commentator most Americans have ever heard of are full blown organization people but they hardly know it. The limits of what one can say about anyone who works within a corporation or institution or those companies or institutions and the endless circles of clout and status among the elites are so ingrained into young prospective 'news' people that they do not recognize they serve a class. Those who do have an inkling rarely try to enter institutional organizations and those who do are quickly weeded out.<br><br>Trump represents a triumph of old fashioned individuality which is supposed to be an American ideal but is actually anathema to the institutional world of our elites save for their hobbies like skydiving or fetishistic sex or otherwise consuming conspicuously and being good a parties. If we can revel in the rise of a true individual with Trump we can also appreciate the downside. Cooperation and working for common goal or good is the essence of human society. A loudmouth A-hole know nothing is not going to successfully lead any nation much less the worlds most powerful one.<br><br>Americans always yearn for leaders who are not politicians but there is no such thing as a leader who isn't a politician. One who balances interests and builds relationships via favors and thus gives and garners loyalty. Americans love Trump for being the anti Party man, anti organization man which is fine. The leader of a nation is not made of such. <br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c5449392070983271280 title="comment permalink">4/9/16, 9:57 AM</a><br><br>

That is, your summary of Toynbee for this post describes what is happening in the election, but it doesn't seem to me to be quite the same thing that Toynbee talks about. Toynbee even seems to be unsure about the idea that something like a creative minority could take power after the Breakdown, or else he's just being coy about knowing whether the West has broken down.<br><br>Incidentally, have you read Carroll Quigley's <i>Evolution of Civilizations</i>? It presents the same mechanism as Toynbee (Quig doesn't think it's the same, but I think he's misreading Toynbee) in clearer and more generalizable (i.e. fractal-friendly) terminology, though he's not much good with the deaths of civilizations. His analysis of Western civilization is also interesting, though I think his comparison of it to other civilizations confuses different levels of the fractal pattern. It's a short book, so not as detailed as Toynbee (almost as digressive, though!).<br><br>What are these longer waves you mention?

It is a motley crew, formerly called Red Pill, the idea taken from The Matrix movie, where you could take a blue pill and continue accepting delusion, or take the red pill and awaken to harsh reality and start getting work done. Donald Trump is well regarded as something of a father figure among the rank and file. Very interesting that a group so dedicated to personal freedom and development so quickly form behind such an authoritarian figure. <br><br>I ask because, if I understand correctly, we have a budding contingent of mages -who don't know they are practicing magic- on our hands. The roots of the movement seem to be a reaction to the 90's Gurl Power, which was all well and good, however the added emphasis on getting women to succeed was paid for at the expense of guiding young men, including yours truly. (Elliott Rogers being a particularly horrendous example.) Basically upon graduating college, the narrative cut right out, and what garbled remains did still play clearly didn't work. Into this void stepped the pickup artists -part big brother, part seasoned slimy salesman- mostly Gen X'ers who had managed to piece together a coherent worldview of their own in the absence of doting helicopter parents, who found a very receptive audience in their foundering millennial counterparts. Central to the overall premise was Neuro-Lingustic Programming. NLP, as far as I can tell, is basically magic (changes in consciousness in accordance with will) in scientific drag. I recall the dots connecting when you first began talking of magic on this blog and TWoG, I was fairly well versed in red pill culture and the parallels were remarkable. <br><br>What rings a warning bell is that the situation could be ripe for the common hubristic thought processes that get us into so much trouble today; repeating forgotten past mistakes in the name of progress and originality. For instance in skilled and informed hands, picking out and combining certain useful behaviors from larger methodologies, such as merging magical orders to form new traditions to get new results. But the trouble comes in when there is no further context, such as mystery schools or lodges grounding the process in history and experience, and people go wielding tools and teaching others, perhaps without understanding critical limits or with missing safety components. This is further complicated in that another contingent of the Alt Right comes from the social cesspool of 4chan, a breathtakingly creative and irreverent website that also spawned the Anonymous hackers who make headlines on occasion with their cyber antics (good and ill).<br><br>For my part I have been attempting my own magic practice, unfortunately consistency is one of the key ingredients that I first have to work on, in addition to tendencies of over-emphasizing theory before practice itself. But it seems to me that part of my green wizardry calling could be mapping out some of the ancient ruins of magic and disseminating the info. Complicating this is that the movement is also comprised of hyper intellectuals, well versed and educated as anyone in the generations who write off anything not "properly scientific" with an aplomb that would do a Vulcan proud.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c709569336918071965 title="comment permalink">4/9/16, 1:39 PM</a><br><br>

The more mainstream establishment types like Jeb Bush and other neocons (and neo liberals too for that matter) however get a special and particularly nasty label of "cuckservative". A portmanteau of cuckold and conservative, even before Trump's rise those responsible for the poor state of things were recognized, and often as not it is the neocons who seem to raise the greatest ire of the AR.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c2768837510707776137 title="comment permalink">4/9/16, 2:03 PM</a><br><br>

He freely admits he's doing the things he does because they are personally appealing and gratifying, and doesn't expect his fellow scientists to follow suit. A huge reason why, I think, is that having an electric car and solar panels on your roof enhances (for now...) your status, whereas not flying to conferences, riding your old bike to work, wearing old clothes, and doing humanure definitely is a status-step downwards!<br><br> <i>For that matter, have you yourself decided to follow his example?</i><br><br>Ah, hah hah hah again! Arguably, it may be the other way around, as I was already doing various status-lowering things before Peter, and making myself a bit of a thorn in the side of our institutional Green Club.

Hmm. I'll want to look into that. <br><br>Don, you're either missing or evading my point. <i>The Tennessee legislature is not the wage class</i>. The wage class has a much lower rate of participation in elections than the salary class, and in Tennessee, as elsewhere, who gets into the legislature is mostly determined by the salary class, partly because they vote in disproportionate numbers, partly because they control political institutions. Pointing to the actions of legislatures and claiming that this justifies contempt for the wage class is like pointing to the actions of the New York City government and claiming that this justifies contempt for Nebraska -- and what lies behind that bizarre claim, of course, is the rhetorical paralogic that deliberately confuses the South (and the flyover states generally) with the wage class. <br><br>Bruno, thank you! <br><br>Allen, thank you.

We'll want to take this conversation further after next week's post, which fits very nicely with your comments about Harper Lee's two novels. <br><br>Don, good. Now ask yourself what happened to unions between the time when they were generally supported by the wage class and the time when they came to be generally rejected by the wage class. In the same way, when asking why the wage class doesn't support liberal politicians, it's helpful to ask whether the policies supported by liberal politicians over the last forty years or so have helped or harmed the wage class. Those are uncomfortable questions for today's affluent liberals, but they have to be asked and answered in order to make any kind of sense of the crisis in contemporary American politics. <br><br>Chris, thank you! All good points. You may well be right about the origins of Anglo-American class divisions, though I'd want to hear from readers in other societies to find out whether similar divisions between the wage and salary classes exist outside the Anglosphere.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c509812428856211610 title="comment permalink">4/9/16, 4:40 PM</a><br><br>

Quite a few of America's most memorable presidents have been individualists who had no time for the institutions of their age, which returned the favor. Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt are among the examples that occur to me -- and while I wouldn't compare Trump to Lincoln, he has a fair amount in common with the other two. <br><br>Jason, I gather the point of this post went right on over your head. I'm not promoting Trump, I'm talking about why he's so popular with so many people right now, and what that says about the future of American politics. You might try rereading the post with that in mind. <br><br>Aias, I read Quigley a long time ago; I should probably revisit him. The long cycles I have in mind are speculative -- since civilization on this planet is only about five thousand years old, it may be too early to get a sense of the longer cycles, but I notice the way that very old civilizations such as Egypt and China seem to have cycled through a broader arc in which several different rise-and-fall cycles had their place. Ask me again in a quarter million years and we'll have more evidence to work with... ;-)<br><br>Hubertus, good. The crucial thing to keep in mind is that what's happening now is a return to normal. Industrial society was a bizarre and temporary aberration, made possible only by all that cheap fossil fuel we burned so thoughtlessly. Now it's ending, and history is returning to the norm. <br><br>Sanguine, I've read a certain amount of Neoreaction, which I think is part of the same phenomenon you're discussing, and a very little bit of the PUA literature -- young men with limited social skills have always had trouble getting laid, but the PUAs are as far as I know the first group of them who tried to make a philosophy out of it, and I found that mildly interesting. NLP is another distinctly odd phenomenon, which combines some very useful tricks with a poorly founded conviction of its own omnipotence that has turned it into the butt of many jokes in the occult community. As I consider myself a moderate Burkean conservative, I'm pleased that the Alt-Right have noticed the difference between actual conservatism (which is about, you know, conserving things) and the bizarre Utopian fantasists of the Neocon world. As for magic, though, that's properly speaking a subject for <a href=http://galabes.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>the other blog</a>, so I'll pass here. <br><br>Jon, fascinating. <br><br>Bryan, true enough. I used to live in a very self-consciously green town in southern Oregon, and got to watch as one of the big and very pricey houses in town got PV panels ostentatiously mounted on it. They were on the side facing the street, right above the two hybrid cars in the driveway, so everyone could see just how ecologically virtuous the homeowner was. The only problem with this arrangement was that the street was north of the house, so the PV panels were on the part of the roof that got no sunlight at all. Oh, but the fashion statement!<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c574001947727482703 title="comment permalink">4/9/16, 5:14 PM</a><br><br>

Sorry to hear your break was not a fun or restful one, but alternatively, good to hear, it sounds like a very productive one.<br><br>Thanks for this thoughtful essay to you, and to all of my fellow commenters - as always, great brain-food, a lot to chew on. <br><br>As a self-described progressive/liberal and arguably "kind of" member of the salaried class now, It's been an eye opening past few weeks of self discovery, through this site as well as several articles focusing on the present and past of our, and especially the Clinton policies. I voted for Bill and at the time, really thought he was a great president. I definitely feel like hanging my head and shaking it in shame. How very very wrong we got it. I'm personally, still processing this while trying (probably ineffectively) to argue with my fellow liberal salary class peers and acquaintances where we went wrong, and while we have the chance, why Hillary and more of the same is killing us all. Thus, I don't consider voting for Bernie or rejecting the Clintonian policies, "voting against my own self-interest", I think they are just more in my own long-term interest as opposed to 'grab it all before the world ends!' short term interests. <br><br> I know in the long continuum of fractal collapse it makes little difference, but for us, now immediately, I do think choosing better leaders, a better policy path can ease the hard landing we will experience. Happy to report, my vote for Bernie helped win him the 25 Democrats Abroad delegates. He also won big in my US Home base of WY. (probably all of 20 Dem's in the entire state of WY! haha!) Yes, I doubt he will get the nomination, but I am undeterred. <br><br>I also took the bubble quiz. My score was 67. I agree, it was a weirdly narrow definition of privilege vs. lack, working class to salary class. Most of the questions just didn't fit me at all. I've lived in a number of various bubbles, high, low, rural, urban, suburban, American, Irish, British, Chinese, International…. And I thought a number of the rural exercises like owning a truck or going fishing are nowadays things only someone with a fair amount of money can do - not things that would denote 'working class' or rural underclass. I've come to expect that actually we ALL live in one bubble or the other, it's most helpful just to see that that is true, to see the film/boundary of the bubble we are in and to consider that when other bubbles think radically differently than we, they have their reasons, just as validly as we have ours.<br><br>Perhaps luckily; most of my energy and attention has been taken up with my family's impending move, packing, sorting, throwing away, refurbishing furniture worth keeping….… Another big step in living with LESS. At times, it's clear I'm living in a mixed marriage, collapse-wise, and at other times, my husband seems to be way ahead of me on the curve. An interesting journey.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c4708907186895911496 title="comment permalink">4/9/16, 8:12 PM</a><br><br>

I agree that we cannot grow our way out being at the limits of growth. That´s what I see critical with Sanders, as I understand him wanting ending the misery of the people with deteriorating livingspace, overcoming it, simply put with growth via the conventional consumating economy. That´s doomed to fail.<br><br>What is missing, is a message away from the progress myth. Instead Sanders propagates evergrowing consumption, instead of small scale progress towards sustainability. He is living another myth, that of the supressed, fighting against the opressors. Instead, what would be needed, is the propagation of a destitutional economy, like in the WWII war-time. And then binging plenty of people into small scale sustainable labour, in particular agriculture. All turning into Amish like work-force.<br><br>Yet, that is impossible to ask a politican. That would clearly state a life of manual labour and the loss of most gadetry of todays consumer desires. People would turn away from a blood, sweat and tears message to any pied piper promising a shiny future for its followers.<br><br>So, that shall not happen. Instead of a voluntary time of rationally orchestrated austerity into a sustainable smallness, we keep on emotionally denying and rejecting. So that´s why annoyance and conflicts are on the rise.

It's just another enlightenment utopian folly like "rationalism" that fails to take into consideration inherent human nature--make it taboo to define "tribe" based on "characteristics ostensibly based on biology", and "tribe" will shift to another aspect such as class, and a new out-group, in this case, the wage class, will be demonized as savagely as the previous out-group.

This is a sobering thought, for our current culture supports nothing that remotely resembles authentic human relationships. (FB "friend" counts notwithstanding.) One of the tools of empire is the isolation of its subjects from one another. We not only allow this, but actively invite it by our wholesale embrace of digital reality.

(I could tell you some colorful stories from my days working as a clerk in a photocopy shop, and in every case the customer in question was a well-to-do white person.)

Yes, I know he wrote a book titled <i>Dark Ages America</i>; it was about a completely different subject, and book titles aren't subject to copyright. <br><br>David, no, it's not too much at all. I should probably do a post down the road a bit about the replacement of institutions with personal relationships as a common feature of the transition to dark age conditions. <br><br>Dennis, funny!

Obviously, its not a great idea to be within 50 miles of Cleveland July 18-21st. But not everyone supporting Trump will be able to get to Cleveland, so what will be the focus of their anger when the convention shenanigans play out to another "electable" nominee? <br><br>I think I have the answer based on Trump's tweet the other night about Colorado. He said "How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger - totally unfair!" This is beyond dog whistle to full-blown fire house siren. Trump was referring to the awarding of all the delegates to Cruz, without even holding a primary or caucus. I can't think of a worst political tactic to pull in this election year. People are already enraged about how unfair the system is, and the Republican party did a bunch of backroom conversations to select who got delegates.<br><br>So what will be attacked after the denial of Trump's nomination at the convention? Probably all these convention delegates and nominees when they return home. I think about the threats people received who spoke out against the occupiers at the Malheur Refuge.

There are always examples cited of the tomatoes, peaches, grapes, lettuce etc. rotting in the fields after the Mexicans got rounded up and sent home in the middle of harvest. But the trope relies on some mistaken assumptions. One is that any fool can pick a peach, hoe a lettuce, etc. In other words, farm work is work only a couple of steps above that of the plough horse. This is not true. Someone not used to hoeing or picking fruit is going to be crippled by the end of the first day. Unaccustomed use of muscles, lack of learned technique, not knowing how to pace oneself, and so forth will leave the new worker exhausted, cramped up and probably incapable of working the next day. Also, the newcomers would not have a social support network. Get welfare moms to pick the tomatoes--fine--who is going to watch their kids? They wouldn't have it all worked out for the grandmothers to care for children too young to work, the pregnant women to do the cooking, and so forth as groups who have relied on the work for generations do. In England it was once a regular ritual for the London workers to head out to the hop fields of Kent for the harvest. But they knew what to expect from those who had gone before, and the transport, housing, housekeeping arrangements and so forth were all in place. A random person on the dole who decides to try country life is not going to have the same success. <br><br>Mentally the greatest obstacle is the expectation of progress. My grandparents picked crops. My dad's generation went to high school and got blue collar jobs--working in a service station, or retail or for the state. Some of my generation went to college. I didn't ever settle into a high paid career, for a variety of reasons, but my grandmother would roll in her grave if she thought her great-grandkids were going to end up picking cotton again. Dropping out and being a hippie, artist, etc. is one thing, but uncontrolled downward mobility is something white people are not prepared to accept as the norm.

It's not north facing solar panels, but it is conserving &amp; Green Wizardry, nonetheless.

It's a source of some amusement to me that the privileged classes in our very caste-bound society are so uncomfortable with acknowledging the existence of their own class-related biases!<br><br>Marin, and there's also the fact that flooding the labor market with many more workers than there are jobs, by driving down wages, decreases the income available to the entire wage class and so harms the economy that way. <br><br>Pyrrhus, thank you. By all means circulate it if you like. <br><br>Justjohn, differences in gain between south- and north-facing panels depends very much on the angle of the roof and also on how much of the solar arc is interrupted by landscape features. (I got certified to do this kind of survey back in the early 1980s, for whatever that's worth.) In this case, the south roof was readily available for use -- it just wasn't visible from the street -- so I think my interpretation is the most likely one. <br><br>Candace, except that here again, Hedges insists on seeing the whole thing in terms of racism, rather than talking about the class antagonisms that the Trump campaign is exploiting so effectively. Along the same lines, it occurs to me that there's one very obvious target for the anger and hatred that are being stirred up in the present campaign: the privileged classes themselves. Still, you won't hear Chris Hedges mentioning that possibility!<br><br>Hubertus, it's a useful thing to keep in mind. <br><br>David, exactly. How far can the privileged push everyone else into the corner, sneering at them all the while, before it's lamppost time? We're apparently going to find out. <br><br>Fred, that really is the question that matters. If a good fraction of the backlash takes the form of grassroots political organization and the creation of a movement that can seize control of the political dialogue, do an end run around our might-as-well-be-Pravda media, and change things, a lot of good could come of it. Otherwise? Well, as I've said more than once, we're probably less than two decades from a major domestic insurgency here in the US, and this might just trigger it. <br><br>Sojan, funny. It's a source of some amusement to me that the corporate types never expect that sort of thing -- I suspect it's another manifestation of <a href=../../2015/06/the-delusion-of-control.html rel=nofollow>the delusion of control</a> I analyzed in a post last year. <br><br>Rita, that very cogent comment earns you tonight's gold star for pointing out unacceptable realities.

Pacific on my sailboat, often hanging out for months with locals on small islands where tribal non-money social systems were still in operation. <br>What occurs to me is that we in the West have taken the individualistic personal freedom approach to life as far as possible. We "offshore" most of our basic support systems to various levels of government and professionals; we pay them to do the work for us. There is usually no personal relationship in the transaction. <br>Our security is how much $ we have in the bank. We are free of reciprocal responsibilities; we don't owe anyone anything other than money (except in our work environments if we work for someone else, and perhaps in our family relationships). When times get really tough and governments break down there is no safety net. When you run out of $ you sink to the bottom of the heap.<br>In the 3rd world societies I lived in, your security is the net of relationships you were born into and the relationships you make in living your life. You helped a friend build/repair his house; at some point you might call in that favor. You were born into the fisherman sub-tribe, and they by tradition give their catch to the whole village. The fisherman get their vegetables from the farmer sub-tribe. <br>So David, I've seen the personal and tribal/village nets of relationships work. Its not perfect, its not utopian, you give away some of your "freedom" because you can't afford to piss everyone off with bad behavior, and some behavior, like swimming on Sundays if the village is strongly Christian, just isn't done or you risk banishment (the ultimate sanction). <br><br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c5034829748443852520 title="comment permalink">4/11/16, 11:43 PM</a><br><br>

Now, I myself hail from a long line of the salaried class but there's some structural differences with being transplanted from a traditional asian to a western society that I've noticed.<br><br>In Australia, the structure of the salaried class has a distinct racial tone. What's most interesting is how new arrivals integrate into it. Migrants' children primarily do the technical fields - science, engineering &amp; medicine. Things that over here require demonstrable quantitiative and qualitative thinking. A huge proportion of the students in these fields are migrant kids like me who were either drilled or self-motivated to work long hours in their school years to perform well in national examinations, while piling on extra-curriculars to get admission and scholarships.<br><br>The children of the affluent white class, however, are rarely found in these fields. They prefer Law, PPE, and other humanities. And by no means do they excel at it - their main skill is 1) being well versed in the using appropriate style of writing required to get good marks (argumentation obviously not needed), and 2) the use of 'networking', ahem butchering meritocracy and ruthlessly utilising contacts. This is a generalisation, but being at a 'prestigious' Group of 8 university in Australia has shown me that the children of (what I consider to be) the entrenched aristocracy here, do not even put in a fraction of the amount of effort required to be where they are. Most of them barely scrape through the requirements, and <a href=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/school-life/concerns-raised-over-bridging-course-that-allows-students-to-bypass-hsc/news-story/95e71a9d28d9ea6ad72004e17fdbfc09 rel=nofollow> some don't at all </a>.<br><br>This reminded me of your post earlier on how the entrenched elite selectively allow members in. I have personally experienced that because of the profession I picked (engineering) and the culture it entails, I am be kept out of any offices with real power by elite-to-be. Has anyone ever noticed the absence of actual technical professionals in politics? Why isn't the infrastucture minister an engineer in any anglophone country? <br><br>Now, the most important thing. All of the most intolerant people I have ever met come from upper middle-class 'liberal' backgrounds. I have never ever faced bigotry from traditional christians, or rural folk in Australia (despite them being scapegoated as the scary racist 'bogans'). My involvement in university debating, and the contant contradictory and flawed basis by which all debates were conducted which ensured that the liberal salaried class viewpoint would always win, convinced me that the elite live in a bubble completely devoid from reality. I eventually left out of disgust.<br><br>I shudder to think what will happen when this facade breaks. It's still another 20 or so years away in Australia but it won't be pretty.<br><br>YCS<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c2817967566379742054 title="comment permalink">4/12/16, 3:38 AM</a><br><br>

Some forestry work, with culturally the rural white working class has managed to maintain a foot hold on is a similar difficulty to the work often left to immigrants. What work gets left to different subcultures has much more to do with cultural predisposition. I have talked with mexicans who were doing roofing work at a rate and skill that was athletic in nature, and the guys I was talking to seemed put of by the idea of forest work. I woundn't do roofing as a main job in all but the most dire circumstances, I think conditions would break my spirit first really, but I had a good time working forestry, even though my job was almost always swamping, carrying logs and branches very quickly all day.<br><br>Where I grew up there was one immigrant fellow, a couple years older than me, who was gifted at flood irrigation. He was always is demand for his skill, and did pretty well for himself. Much trouble was went to to get him back into town after he had visited Mexico.<br><br>I consider the observation that a lot of immigrants are sending alot of their money back to their families in their country of origin. This is a big issue in rural areas, to stay economically healthy a rural area has to recycle its current several times to stay economically viable. Rural areas are generally hard up for cash, often because contemporary culture doesn't rotate local money enough to make rural areas functional. Its not the particular jobs done by immigrants that are off putting, as the intense hours they work, largely to be able to have a surplus to send home.<br><br>I think Greer's suggested policy of using fines on employers would be fairly sensible. Though I would recommend scaling them up over a few years, slap on the wrist, smack to the face, gut punch, knock out fine, so that areas dependent on foreign born workers have time enough to adapt.<br><br>More important that any policy is a cultural factor, the idea of downward mobility has to be redeemed. Any work that a whole population can fairly say they are too good for, we might say is too wretched to do. There are a lot of jobs which should simply go away, being too vile to justify their products. <br><br>In Greeley Colorado where I went to college there is a meat plant, and a nasty one at that, many of its jobs can only be filled by dispirit people. They did a botched sudden deportation of the Mexicans, it was a terrible mess. In less than a year they had to replace those workers with Somalians. Fundimentally the factory conditions were unsound, and the going rate for meat cannot support a sane work environment. A modest raise in meat prices would justify more sensible practices, like butchers, but that would upset the consumers.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c2565553877039879362 title="comment permalink">4/12/16, 8:01 AM</a><br><br>

The fact that aside from the snow, a good deal of upstate NY could pass for much of the impoverished south (complete with confederate flags) didn't seem to register with them. <br><br>More interesting however is the salary and investment class' "cultural appropriation" of the wage class. Nothing new as far as I can tell, given the popularity of jeans. A friend showed me some youtube commercials by Hormel where they exhibited "Urban Lumberjacks" attempting to start a chainsaw, use a bucksaw and throw an axe. It was very clear that they had never handled such tools in their lives, with comments like "does it have a key?" and "I don't hold axes, this is medieval!". https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL4kSBKMbD--I4GvcSYA8C_G6HD4hG49Br&amp;v=ptvTVAE5Wx8 A good chuckle if you've got the time.<br><br>On a practical side, I have been wondering just what suite of characteristics makes a person (or home, car, etc) low, working, middle and high class. A previous comment about Sara Palin being white trash further got me wondering on the subject. How is it, for instance, that someone with much higher social status than I have, can take a shipping pallet and make a table or planter, and it is a Pinterest worthy creation regarded as "upcycling" and "shabby chic", or they can take old farm implements and decorate their house and it looks great. But when I try it, even with solid craftsmanship, it is just "shabby". Maybe I'm being too hard on myself, or I'm just on the wrong side of the "pull starter" rubicon. I've thought about the fundamentals, it seems to me that it comes down to having less clutter and more polish. Nothing I am deeply concerned with, just an interesting phenomenon.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c6802390367977708663 title="comment permalink">4/12/16, 9:07 AM</a><br><br>

My sense is that here in the UK the spread of salaries as a formal arrangement is sufficiently wide that the salary/wage distinction doesn't act in the same way as a proxy for 'real' class divisions. And we didn't see the same historic (but very rarely mentioned) increase in working hours through the 70s that US workers experienced.<br><br>I must admit to feeling a bit unsure about this as the discussion has progressed, and I don't think that's just because I draw a salary! I was excited by the approach in the first Trump post because it's so rare to see anyone speaking in class terms, and it seems that you have let a bit of a genie out of the bottle in that the trials of US workers are now at least mentionable, and mentioned. <br><br>But I have felt less comfortable as various commentators have portrayed these developments as purely or mainly the salary class's doing. In short, I don't buy that drawing a salary puts you in the frame in that way - it's much more complicated than that.<br><br>This 'paycheck' class model also seems to have something of a blindspot to the massive increase in inequality that we have seen in the last decades. This must represent something in class terms, surely, but is hard to track when so many of the super-remunerated are hired guns rather than owners (although share options complicates the picture somewhat). I don't think the idea of "the 1%" is a suitable counter, and I acknowledge that it contains plenty of its own evasions, but it does capture a flavour of the enrichment and relentless promotion of the interests of the truly wealthy that has been increasingly at the heart of politics and power since the 1980s.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Matt<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c4399111334670182552 title="comment permalink">4/12/16, 10:17 AM</a><br><br>

The paradigm of "Wall Street v. Main Street" suggests the perception of a line drawn between a dishonest investor class and people attempting to make an honest living. I think anyone with a realistic idea of the prevalence of deceitful tactics in finance would have a hard time investing unless they thought they could be quicker on the take, and those with no clue will join our wage class heroes pretty soon. But I also think JMG is right about a huge cultural gap in the general vicinity of the line between wages and salaries.<br><br>In Japan there is a major division between the salaried workers, who have job security just as long as they can tolerate truly vicious bullying, and the temporary and part-time workers, who were originally just seen as doing it for a little extra spending money and can be let go on a whim as well. As the latter is seen as "wives and children" it doesn't constitute the same sort of class division. I perceive a significant line being drawn, though, between government workers and everyone else, because the former has enough power to make moves to protect its pensions, while everyone knows the pension system for everyone else is getting ready to implode.<br><br>In response to JMG's response to my earlier comments, the Genji army, though headed by descendants of the imperial family, were barbarians who'd never participated in civilized society. They attacked from the outside, while the current barbarians (yakuza) have been deeply involved in Japan's polite society. Buddhism, not to mention Confucianism, had not spread beyond the elite. They both provide philosophical help for coping with the inequities inherent in civilized society.<br><br>I asked my husband how he thought collapse would proceed in Japan. He said, "It won't collapse." So I rephrased my question. Currently we have fringe groups of victims suffering, who can be brushed off as simply having "bad karma"--the unlucky, as in Fukushima, the morally questionable, as in single parents--but when the pension system fails, as some are saying will happen in as soon as in two years, massive misery will result. Then what? He said, "A few dishonest, hysteria-provoking individuals will arise, and lead citizens to attack a few scapegoats (which is what has happened in more recent panics). The majority of people will realize that they are attacking innocent people, but will go along with it because they are too scared of the bully. People always make the mistake of underestimating how evil humans really are." This is how Japanese society operates on a micro-scale--people are terrified of the power bullies have to inflict serious harm to their carefully balanced social world, with no possibility of recourse. This is apt to play out on the macro-scale like that too.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-ordinary-politics.html#c2963333549669647726 title="comment permalink">4/12/16, 11:42 PM</a><br><br>

I have 4, and 2 of them want the BAU Bunch to win, one pulling for Libertarians and the other for the Dems. Both of these have salary jobs and live in the city.<br><br>The other 2 are simply moving on and ignoring the entire political circus. They are building cottage businesses actually making and growing things, and believe the entire political process is a huge time waster, since those that get to participate and influence are all of the upper salaried class. Both of these have their own businesses and live far-out-suburban or rural.<br><br>There is, from what I see personally interacting with my children and their friends, one group that wants change and another that simply wants to be left alone (my younger two) and find a new way to live and do business. There are multiple online communities that support the endeavors of my younger two children, and they leverage these to earn a living.<br><br>In all 4 cases, their incomes are low compared to my own at their age, and they have 4 or 5 year degrees, whereas I had none. None of them believe they could rear 4 children, much less put them thru college without loans, as things currently stand. All of them believe the "American Dream" is a lie or a nightmare.<br><br>The environment is not the same as when I was their age - government is against small businesses, wants to control every aspect of existence and expects people to shut up and pay them simply because we always have. This is changing, the first stirrings hitting this election cycle. Regardless of who is elected, we can expect a bad outcome as there are no cards left to be played by governing bodies and banking cartels once the financial house of cards begins to slide. <br><br>It is the inevitable collapse of the financial system that will likely be the cause of the tumult slouching towards us. Too much debt has been built to finance "lifestyles of the rich and famous" and to build a class of voting wage slaves beholden to government programs. Those at the bottom know who to blame, while those at the top will be looking for tasty scapegoats for the wage class masses to roast - while they run like hell.<br><br>Hypercomplexity has reached apogee everywhere you look - it (our existing world environment) is simply not sustainable. It is built on hypercomplex financial instruments designed to do one thing - enrich the salaried class. You cannot buy a car you can repair, a dishwasher you can fix or fresh vegetables you trust - because the lies are just too many to sift through.<br><br>None of these are American problems - they are global. My friends in Colombia, Venezuela, Germany, Malaysia, China and elsewhere see the same things in different shades, aspects of the same ills.<br><br>I do not see any way forward that makes sense other than to buckle up buttercup, keep your friends close and trust nothing in media or government. There are waves coming, and you either learn to surf or you get tumbled and maybe even drown.

I have been reading this blog for many years and have noticed it attracts commenters from a wide range of perspectives. Greer himself has estimated that he probably gets as many readers from the right as the left and has pointed out that he has gained a significant following within the Neoreaction and alternative right movements. I have also noticed that Alexander Dugin, the right wing Russian philosopher that I referenced earlier, regularly reposts Greer's essays from this blog on one of his blogs, Fourth Revolutionary War.<br><br>Even though I am a conservative and pretty right wing politically, I am also the sort of intellectually curious person who regularly reads authors from the radical left, including SJW's whose views I vehemently disagree with.
