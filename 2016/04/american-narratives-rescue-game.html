<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, with its analysis of the way that affluent white liberals use accusations of racism as a dog whistle for their own bigotry toward wage-earning Americans, got a flurry of emails and attempted comments trying to push the discussion back into the officially approved narrative of race in the United States. That came as no surprise, at least to me. Every society has a set of acceptable narratives that frame public discourse on any controversial subject, and trying to get past the narrow confines of any such narrative inevitably brings some form of pushback. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Depending on the society and the era, the pushback can quite readily include such entertainments as being burnt at the stake for heresy, so I don’t feel any need to complain about the really rather mild response I got. At the same time, though, I don’t propose to back down. Every society, as just noted, has a set of narratives that confine discourse on controversial subjects to approved channels, but tolerably often those approved channels exclude crucial details and head off necessary questions. In today’s United States, in particular, the facts concerning nearly every significant crisis we face can be divided up neatly into two entirely separate categories. The facts that most Americans are willing to talk about belong to one of these categories; the facts that matter most belong to the other. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus one of the things I plan on doing over the months ahead is talking about some of the narratives that keep most people in today’s America from discussing, or for that matter noticing, the most crucial forces dragging this country down to ruin. Such an examination could as well start with any of those narratives—as Charles Fort pointed out, one traces a circle starting anywhere—but given the response to last week’s post, we might as well start with the accepted narrative about race. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably necessary to reiterate that this discussion is about narratives, not about the things that the narratives are supposed to describe. If you want to hear about the realities of racial privilege, racial prejudice, and racial injustice in the United States, you need to talk to the people of color who have to deal with those things day in and day out, not to a middle-aged white intellectual like me, who’s by and large been sheltered from that dimension of the American experience. People of color, on the other hand, have had very little influence on the officially approved narrative of race in the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like most of the narratives that shape our collective discourse, that’s been crafted primarily by middle-aged white intellectuals with college educations and salary-class backgrounds: that is, people like me. If I sing you some of the songs of my people, in other words, I hope you won’t mind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m going to approach the opening notes of this first song by what may seem like a roundabout route. There’s a school of psychology called transactional analysis, which focuses on interactions between people rather than the vagaries of the individual psyche. Transactional analysis covers a lot of ground, but I want to focus on just one of its themes here: the theory of interpersonal games. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
An interpersonal game, like most other games, has a set of rules and some kind of prizes for winners. In a healthy interpersonal game, the rules and the prizes are overt: that is, if you ask the players what they are, you can pretty much count on an honest answer. As this stops being true—as more of the rules and prizes become covert—the game becomes more and more dysfunctional. At the far end of the spectrum are those wholly dysfunctional games in which straight talk about the rules and payoffs is utterly taboo. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The accepted mainstream narrative about race in America today can best be described as one of those latter category of wholly dysfunctional games. Fortunately, it’s a game that was explored in quite a bit of detail by transactional analysts in the 1960s and 1970s, so it won’t be particularly difficult to break the taboo and speak about the unspeakable. Its name?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Rescue Game.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here’s how it works. Each group of players is assigned one of three roles: Victim, Persecutor, or Rescuer. The first two roles are allowed one move each: the Victim’s move is to suffer, and the Persecutor’s move is to make the Victim suffer. The Rescuer is allowed two moves: to sympathize with the Victim and to punish the Persecutor. No other moves are allowed, and no player is allowed to make a move that belongs to a different role. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That may seem unduly limited. It’s not, because when a group of people is assigned a role, all their actions are redefined as the move or moves allotted to that role.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the Rescue Game, in other words, whatever a Victim does must be interpreted as a cry of pain. Whatever a Persecutor does is treated as something that’s intended to cause pain to a Victim, and whatever a Rescuer does, by definition, either expresses sympathy for a Victim or inflicts well-deserved punishment on a Persecutor. This is true even when the actions performed by the three people in question happen to be identical. In a well-played Rescue Game, quite a bit of ingenuity can go into assigning every action its proper meaning as a move. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s more, the roles are collective, not individual. Each Victim is equal to every other Victim, and is expected to feel and resent all the suffering ever inflicted on every other Victim in the same game. Each Persecutor is equal to every other Persecutor, and so is personally to blame for every suffering inflicted by every other Persecutor in the same game. Each Rescuer, in turn, is equal to every other Rescuer, and so may take personal credit for the actions of every other Rescuer in the same game. This allows the range of potential moves to expand to infinity without ever leaving the narrow confines of the game. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s one other rule: the game must go on forever. The Victim must continue to suffer, the Persecutor must continue to persecute, and the Rescuer must continue to sympathize and punish. Anything that might end the game—for example, any actual change in the condition of the Victim, or any actual change in the behavior of the Persecutor—is therefore out of bounds. The Rescuer also functions as a referee, and so it’s primarily his or her job to see that nothing gets in the way of the continuation of the game, but all players are expected to help out if that should be necessary. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Got it? Now we’ll go to an example—and no, it’s not the one you’re thinking of. The example I have in mind is the standard narrative of race in the deep South for the century or so after the Civil War. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The players were rich white people, poor white people, and black people—this latter category, in the jargon of the time, included anyone with any publicly admitted trace of African ancestry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The roles were assigned as follows: poor white people were Victims, black people were Persecutors, and rich white people were Rescuers. The rest of the game followed from there. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Anything that poor white people did to black people was thus justified, under the rules of the game, as a cry of pain elicited by their suffering at the hands of Yankees, carpetbaggers, former slaves, etc., etc. etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Anything rich white people did to black people was justified by their assigned role as Rescuers. Meanwhile, anything and everything that was done, or not done, by black people was defined as a persecution—if black people pursued an education, for example, they were trying to steal jobs from white folk, while if they didn’t, that just proved that they were an inferior element corrupting the South by their very presence, and so on through all the classic doublebinds of bigotry. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A variant of that game still goes on in the pseudoconservative end of American politics. When Hillary Clinton went out of her way to characterize African-American youth as “superpredators” not that many years ago, she was playing a version of that same game, in which law-abiding white citizens were the Victims, black youth were the Persecutors, and white politicians were the Rescuers. On the other end of the political spectrum, of course, the roles are reversed; in games played on that field, people of color are the Victims, working class white people are the Persecutors, and affluent white liberals are the Rescuers. The players have changed places but the game’s otherwise identical. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yes, I’m aware that people of color on the one hand, and working class white people on the other, occupy radically different places in the hierarchy of privilege in today’s America. More precisely, members of each of these heterogeneous groups occupy a range of sharply differing positions in that hierarchy, and these two ranges have very little overlap. What’s come to be called intersectionality—the way that social divisions according to gender, race, class, ethnicity, physical disability, and a bubbling cauldron of other factors, intersect with one another to produce the convoluted landscape of American inequality—is a massive factor all through contemporary life in the United States. So is the wretchedly common human habit of “paying it downwards,” in which an abused and exploited group responds by seeking some other group to abuse and exploit in turn. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All these considerations, though, belong to the real world. They are excluded from the artificial world of the Rescue Game, and from the officially approved narrative about race that derives from that game. In the Rescue Game, all members of the group assigned the role of Victim are always, only, and equally Victims, all members of the group assigned the role of Persecutor are always, only, and equally Persecutors, and the maltreatment of the Victims by the Persecutors is the only thing that matters. If anyone tries to bring anyone else’s treatment of anyone else into the game, it’s either dismissed as an irrelevance or denounced as a deliberate, malicious attempt to distract attention from the maltreatment of the Victims by the Persecutors. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The assignment of roles to different categories of people takes place in the opening phase of the Rescue Game. Like most games, this one has an opening phase, a middle period of play, and an endgame, and the opening phase is called “Pin the Tail on the Persecutor.” In this initial phase, teams of Victims bid for the attention of Rescuers by displaying their suffering and denouncing their Persecutors, and the winners are those who attract enough Rescuers to make up a full team. In today’s America, this phase of the game is ongoing, and a great deal of rivalry tends to spring up between teams of Victims who compete for the attention of the same Rescuers. When that rivalry breaks out into open hostilities, as it often does, the result has been called the Oppression Olympics—the bare-knuckle, no-holds-barred struggle over which group of people gets to have its sufferings privileged over everyone else’s. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Once the roles have been assigned and an adequate team of Rescuers attracted, the game moves into its central phase, which is called “Show Trial.” This has two requirements, which are not always met. The first is an audience willing to applaud the Victims, shout catcalls at the Persecutors, and cheer for the Rescuers on cue. The second is a supply of Persecutors who can be convinced or coerced into showing up to play the game. A Rescue Game in which the Persecutors don’t show quickly enters the endgame, with disadvantages that will be described shortly, and so getting the Persecutors to appear is crucial. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This can be done in several ways. If the game is being played with live ammunition—for example, Stalin’s Russia or the deep South after the Civil War—people who have been assigned the role of Persecutors can simply be rounded up at gunpoint and forced to participate. If the people playing the game have some less drastic form of institutional power—for example, in American universities today—participation in the game can be enforced by incentives such as curriculum requirements. Lacking these options, the usual strategies these days are to invite the Persecutors to a supposedly honest dialogue, on the one hand, and to taunt them until they show up to defend themselves, on the other. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
However their presence is arranged, once the Persecutors arrive, the action of the game is stereotyped. The Victims accuse the Persecutors of maltreating them, the Persecutors try to defend themselves, and then the Victims and the Rescuers get to bully the Persecutors into silence, using whatever means are allowed by local law and custom. If the game is being played with live ammunition, each round ends with the messy death of one or more Persecutors; the surviving players take a break of varying length, and then the next Persecutor or group of Persecutors is brought in. In less gory forms of the game, the Persecutors are shouted down rather than shot down, but the emotional tone is much the same. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This phase of the game continues until there are no more Persecutors willing or able to act out their assigned role, or until the audience gets bored and wanders away. At this point the action shifts to the endgame, which is called “Circular Firing Squad.” In this final phase of the game, the need for a steady supply of Persecutors is met by identifying individual Victims or Rescuers as covert Persecutors. Since players thus accused typically try to defend themselves against the accusation, the game can go on as before—the Victims bring their accusations, the newly identified Persecutors defend themselves, and then the Victims and Rescuers get to bully them into silence. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The one difficulty with this phase is that each round of the game diminishes the supply of players and makes continuing the game harder and harder. Toward the end, in order to keep the game going, the players commonly make heroic attempts to convince or coerce more people into joining the game, so that they can be “outed” as Persecutors, and the range of things used to identify covert Persecutors can become impressively baroque.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The difficulty, of course, is that very few people are interested in playing a game in which the only role open to them is being accused of violating a code of rules that becomes steadily more subtle, elaborate, and covert with each round of the game, and getting bullied into silence thereafter. Once word gets out, as a result, the game usually grinds to a halt in short order due to a shortage of players. At that point, it’s back to “Pin the Tail on the Persecutor,” and on we go.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s plenty more that could be said here about the details of the Rescue Game and the narrative of race derived from it, but at this point I’d like to consider three broader issues. The first is the relation between the game and the narrative, on the one hand, and the realities of racism in today’s America. I don’t doubt that some readers of this essay will insist that by questioning the narrative, I’m trying to erase the reality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Not so. Racial privilege, racial prejudice, and racial injustice are pervasive factors in American life today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The fact that the approved narrative of race in today’s America is deceptive and dysfunctional doesn’t make racism any less real; on the other hand, the fact that American racism is a stark reality doesn’t make the narrative any less deceptive and dysfunctional. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second issue I’d like to consider is whether the same game is played on other playing fields, and the answer is yes. I first encountered the concept of the Rescue Game, in fact, by way of a pamphlet lent to my wife by her therapist sister-in-law, which used it as the basis for an edgy analysis of class conflicts within the lesbian community. From there to the literature on transactional analysis was a short step, and of course it didn’t hurt that I lived in Seattle in those years, where every conceivable form of the Rescue Game could be found in full swing. (The most lively games of “Circular Firing Squad” in town were in the Marxist splinter parties, which I followed via their monthly newspapers; the sheer wallowing in ideological minutiae that went into identifying this or that party member as a deviationist would have impressed the stuffing out of medieval scholastic theologians.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With impressive inevitability, in fact, every question concerning privilege in today’s America gets turned into a game of “Pin the Tail on the Persecutor,” in which one underprivileged group is blamed for the problems affecting another underprivileged group, and some group of affluent white people show up to claim the Rescuer’s role.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That, in turn, leads to the third issue I want to consider here, which is the question of who benefits most from the habit of forcing all discussion of privilege in today’s America into the straitjacket of the Rescue Game. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s only fair to note that each of the three roles gets certain benefits, though these are distributed in a very unequal fashion. The only thing the people who are assigned the role of Persecutor get out of it is plenty of negative attention. Sometimes that’s enough—it’s a curious fact that hating and being hated can function as an intoxicant for some people—but this is rarely enough of an incentive to keep those assigned the Persecutor’s role willing to play the game for long. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The benefits that go to people who are assigned the role of Victim are somewhat more substantial. Victims get to air their grievances in public, which is a rare event for the underprivileged, and they also get to engage in socially sanctioned bullying of people they don’t like, which is an equally rare treat. That’s all they get, though. In particular, despite reams of the usual rhetoric about redressing injustices and the like, the Victims are not supposed to do anything, or to expect the Rescuers to do anything, to change the conditions under which they live. The opportunities to air grievances and bully others are substitutes for substantive change, not—as they’re usually billed—steps toward substantive change.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The vast majority of the benefits of the game, rather, go to the Rescuers. They’re the ones who decide which team of Victims will get enough attention from Rescuers to be able to start a game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They’re the ones who enforce the rules, and thus see to it that Victims keep on being victimized and Persecutors keep on persecuting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nor is it accidental that in every Rescue Game, the people who get the role of Rescuers are considerably higher on the ladder of social privilege than the people who get given the roles of Victims and Persecutors. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Step back and look at the whole picture, and it’s not hard to see why this should be so. At any given time, after all, there are many different Rescue Games in play, with affluent white people always in the role of Rescuers and an assortment of less privileged groups alternating in the roles of Victims and Persecutors. Perhaps, dear reader, you find it hard to imagine why affluent white people would want to keep everyone else so busy fighting one another that they never notice who benefits most from that state of affairs. Perhaps it hasn’t occurred to you that giving the underprivileged the chance to air their grievances and engage in a little socially sanctioned bullying is a great deal less inconvenient for the affluent than actually taking action to improve the lives of the underprivileged would be. Such thoughts seemingly never enter the minds of most Americans; I’ll leave it to you to figure out why. </div>

And yet even more uncomfortable is the realization that none of his/her opponents are actually willing to address his take on the economy, or the issues that the US economy is facing.<br><br> Of course the rest of the world already knows that all of the USA's policy is just protectionism at the expense of everybody else, under the convenient disguise of "free market".<br><br> But the deindustrialization of the USA is a problem we can easily sympathize with, us denizens of the formerly great wealthy industrial nations of Western Europe. We have put ourselves in the same predicament, and his stance on economy truly makes sense in this context.<br><br> And then his persona is attackable from a racial minority's standpoint, though it only feeds his divisive tactics.<br><br> There is also the constant jokes about how he would legalize incest, or about his wolverine of a hairdo. Those are jokes made by, for example, the humourists at Comedy Central. They are usually able to tackle, within a comic perspective, very serious issues, so they ought to know better and deal with Trump's actual program instead of dealing with fantasies that only exist in Trump's opponents' imagination.<br><br> To his credit though, John Oliver did just that in a video where he detailled the actual cost of building a big wall upon the Mexican border. But again, I got the feeling that it was being discussed only because it dealt with the racist side of the character, and not because it was an important cornerstone of the political program.<br><br> In general, I am frightened to notice that either Trump or his detractors somehow lack global systemic vision, even though he has my sympathies when it comes to an economic vision.<br><br> It is interesting that he should funnel so many accusations of incest, it seems like your nation is summoning the demons it created in the first place, as a society that is increasingly older, tries to predate on the young to avoid facing the self-awareness of ageing, and, in order to do that, is ready to deprive its children from the economic liberty and basic level of control over their lives that your Constitution says they should expect.<br><br><a href=#c9086650620924693831 title="comment permalink">4/13/16, 3:50 PM</a><br><br>

After a grandiloquent and juridically useless proposal for reforming the constitution regarding binationals convicted of terrorism, they have come up with an ambitious (and overcomplicated) of the already complex French Labour Code.<br><br>Of course most of the points within the reform are already applicable under current laws, just less directly so than they would be with the reform... but its symbolic values was hard to miss, and didn't fail to strongly mobilize a youth already faced with the prospect of mass unemployment.<br><br>The month of April has, until a few days ago, turned out to be rather cold even for a Parisian spring, but watch as nights get warmer here and tempers get hotter.<br><br>Interestingly, and this had been annonced about a month ago, in order to compensate for the unpopularity of its reform, the governement wants to enforce an extra tax on fixed-duration contracts (to favour the use of fixed-position contracts instead). So they managed to get unpopular with pretty much every side of the debate, but it is true that their project is favouring big firms against both the working-class population and small companies. While everyone now is aware that big companies are increasingly laying off their staff or outsourcing their positions to India, in order to please their shareholders, and small companies are the strongest drivers of employment here.<br><br>The contestation has organized around a movement called "Nuit Debout", which would remind a lot a French observer of the Mai 68 mass movements. Some of their ideas are interesting, and had been circulating among the population already, for rxample electing the President by randomly drawing some sort of lottery, to avoid the formation of an oligarchic political class, a minimum salary for every working-age denizen, which would be a good thing in my view since the corporate world nowadays is running short of jobs to keep everyone occupied and at the same time the need for humanitarian work has never been so strong...<br><br>But some other ideas left me dumbfounded : the future of democracy would be a decentralized, more participative process - fair enough - so it would most certainly be digital - err... ?<br><br>In the end, it fails to deal with the core theme of this blog : we have to face our responsabilities and stop externalizing our costs on poorer countries, since it bears too much burden on the environment and only creates aggravating inequalities. That is one of the core reasons why the labour market has faced a rarefying demand.<br><br>Eventually, both the French government, its contestators, and the US anti-establishment candidates all commit the same fallacy of thinking.<br><br>I suspect the real ideological debate will not structure along the current divides (French right wing or supposedly left-wing politicians vs the population, Bernie versus Donald...) but along a divide that is unthinkable now : limits-accepting versus limits-denying. Equalitarianism will be a key aspect of that, for sure, but to me, the essential question has not yet been articulated, even amongst the population here.<br><br> <br><br>The Panama thing is a pretty funny coincidence, it shows the predation of the financial sector on the rest of society, with help from the wealth pump that international fiances have become. It is fuelling even more of the contestation originated by Nuit Debout.<br><br><a href=#c1457268748284531849 title="comment permalink">4/13/16, 3:51 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks for another excellence and, for me, timely post. Being a Unitarian Universalist and interacting with a number of activist groups, I’ve seen the Rescue Game often in action in an up close and personal fashion. Your post has helped me crystallize some existing thoughts in a more systemic fashion.<br>I’ve a thought about the Black Live Matter movement for a while which I was thinking of putting in as an off-topic comment last time before realizing it would be a very on topic comment for this post. To wit:<br><br>There has been a debate between the use of the terms “All Lives Matter” and “Black Lives Matter” for the movement spark by the police killings of the last few years . I’ve always thought that if properly used, the term “All Lives Matter” could be a very effective verbal weapon to address the ugly underlying issues that the Black Lives Matter movement is seeking to address. One way the “All...” phase could have been used effectively is some form of the following incantation: “You (paleface) consider your life to matter. But for that, all lives should matter. Therefore, black lives must matter.” Stories about more or less innocent white people being kill by the police, while less common than those about blacks, definitely do exist.<br><br>In terms of the Rescue Game, I suspect that this use of “All Lives Matter” was avoided since it could have broken the game and created the possibility of a backing for the movement that have could been more than the usual suspects. In particular, it could have possibly drawn in the white population that is the most at risk of police violence – the poor and working class whites. We can’t have that happen, of course. Some useful to the victim group might come of it.<br><br><br><a href=#c8355137895483941017 title="comment permalink">4/13/16, 7:05 PM</a><br><br>

In this version, the roles are self-chosen and the participants are engaging in these behaviors not to fill some greater social need, but to manage their own psychological needs, especially their anxieties, in a way that allows the participants to ignore the dysfunction and harm done to others. The Persecutors get to be "one up" and say to the Victims "It's all your fault." Unlike the version you describe, there are actual benefits to being in this role other than negative attention. In both versions, the Victims get to say "poor me" to themselves and seek sympathy from the Rescuers, who says "poor you" to the Victims. However, the Drama Triangle acknowledges that the Victims can be engaging in self-destructive behaviors and the Rescuers end up enabling the Victims and keeping them dependent. The result is very unhealthy for all involved, as it just keeps the conflict going without achieving solutions. On a personal level, we should all try to break out of these roles for more constructive ways of dealing with each other and our environments. A healthy society should strive to get out of the game, too. However, as you've been pointing out for ten years (next month will be the tenth anniversary of your first post on this blog), we do not live in a healthy society.<br><br>I can see the Dreaded Drama Triangle playing out here in Michigan.

The sense of an era in twilight that you mention is pretty general these days, and quite common in times such as these -- I remember similar comments by perceptive writers in the years leading up to the First World War. <br><br>Marcu, may a good time be had by all!<br><br>Jean-Vivien, I'd gotten the impression that the Rescue Game was specifically an American bad habit -- notice how often our foreign policy follows the same narrative, unlike those of other countries. Thank you for confirming this. <br><br>Curtis, that's a very large and complex question. Obviously the first step is to recognize that what's going on is a Rescue Game rather than a meaningful response to the facts on the ground, and the second is to change the rules -- but how to do that, and what new rules to use...that's an intricate issue. I may do another post on that as we proceed. <br><br>Leif, yes, that's another fine example. Notice that for both sides of the issue, whatever violence the Victims do to the Persecutors is justified and whatever violence the Persecutors do to the Victims is motivated by sheer malevolence -- that sort of rhetoric is a dead giveaway that a Rescue Game is in process. <br><br>Marian, I write about what I want to write about. If you don't want to read it, hey, there are thousands of other blogs out there. <br><br>Pygmycory, the thing that makes the Rescue Game vulnerable is that its rules and payoffs are covert. If you break the taboo and talk openly about the rules and payoffs, it becomes much harder to keep the Game going. <br><br>234567, as long as you're still caught up in "this version of privilege is more important/widespread/damaging/etc. than that version," you're missing the point. Look at the forest, not the trees! <br><br>Michelle, exactly. What's happening is that racial privilege, racial prejudice, and acts of racial injustice are all being conflated into a single reified thing called "racism," and so any person who benefits from racial privilege (as white people in the US do) is then accused of, by definition having racial prejudices and engaging in acts of racial injustice. That's one of the many gambits by which the Rescue Game recruits Persecutors.<br><br>Wendy, I'll take "eloquent" -- I've spent half a century working full time on English prose -- but "smarter"? Don't sell yourself short.

Is it just me wondering why this is even in the newspaper - some things should not be aired in a public forum. And no disrespect to the guys on the deck of that ship as it would have been an unexpected event, but they're standing there calmly taking video footage of a Russian aircraft doing a mock bombing run on what looks like a destroyer. It was surreal, but the best was yet to come as the White House flunky dude - who clearly looks and sounds stressed and is not the guy to front the media about such matters (you can see that one eye is clearly open wider than the other and he stumbles over a few words and concepts) - tries to explain the situation. I don't know whether it is just me, but the situation requires very little explanation and calls of: "it's just not fair" fall on deaf ears when push comes to shove. Was this an April fool’s day joke that has somehow been incorrectly taken seriously by our media down here?

I think, in general, the rescuers are everyone saying, "x group is harming y group," for example, when oil companies destroy the planet with greenhouse gases, liberal rescuers defend the whole world (a lot of victims, lol) from the evil corporate persecutors. This narrative fights with its opposing narrative, that conservative rescuers defend the global economy (and jobs and workers) from persecuting government forces. There must be a grain of truth for the game to work or it's obvious nonsense. I think the key to identifying this game is each player is elevating their own self worth by judging someone else. The underlying fuel of the game is guilt and judgement. I'm not Christian, but there is a Christian phrase that transcends this exact game: "Hate the sin, but love the sinner." I will never love Exxon-Mobil, but chasing down the CEO to tell him what he's doing wrong is never going to change a thing. We've had four decades to point fingers at each other and co2 keeps rising. We all need to own our own guilt here and embrace real changes instead of arguing. Instead of yelling at Exxon, or the EPA, if that's your persuasion, we need to create our own sustainable, self sufficient lives with our own local economies. We all need to learn how to extract ourselves from the blame game and build the world we want out of whatever resources we have. If your solution starts with the dictum "You need to do this (or stop doing that)," It's never going to work.

Example; you are a genuine campaigner for social justice, actually doing the right thing and seeking change for the better (I assume they exist as I have not yet become a complete cynic, as that is surely just another game), yet your detractors can label you merely a player and could be said to be playing another game called "the discrediting SJWs game" in which they denigrate any real attempt to seek social justice in front of an appreciative audience. They may catch the rescue players as well, but they cast the net too wide and don't really care who gets caught up in it because they are playing a dishonest game too. Every backlash has its backlash and so on and so forth, until we get to the point where one is afraid to even leave a dissenting comment in case one gets doxxed.<br><br>That's not to say we shouldn't talk about it, you are right when you say that bringing it out in the open and discussing the unwritten rules is the only way out of the briar.

That said, yes, the people in TA described it to a T. <br><br>Post-Millennial, I'm not familiar with the specific example -- the US media these days are so relentlessly vacuous and propagandistic that I get my news entirely from foreign media -- so I'm not sure I can diagram it out for you. (Thanks for the reminder, btw -- just finished another big project, and am still digging myself out from under the backup of email.) <br><br>Patricia, ah, but if the Persecutors refuse to show up and play their assigned role, the game moves into Circular Firing Squad anyway. You have to have somebody to bully into silence, remember, and if people just turn their backs and walk away, the fun goes out of it very quickly. <br><br>Eric, please do use it! As for the anthologies -- heh heh heh. Why, yes, as Oswald Spengler points out, once a culture reaches the end of its creative years, its production of original literature worth reading declines rapidly; after that, it's all a matter of curating the legacy of the past, repetition of old forms, and derivative works of various kinds, some more interesting than others. <br><br>Tom, exactly. At least you got it eventually!<br><br>Howard, neatly summarized. Exactly. <br><br>Max, thank you! If I ever get the chance to visit New Zealand, I'll certainly be in touch. <br><br>Doctor W., you're certainly right that it could have been used in that way. Unfortunately -- at least as far as I saw -- it was used to minimize the extent to which African-Americans, specifically, are targeted for extrajudicial police killings at a rate that vastly surpasses any other group nationwide. (And of course that played into the hands of those who were using that disparity as more fodder for the Rescue Game. It really is complex.)<br><br>Pinku-Sensei, thanks for this! It's been a long time since I read TA literature, and Claude Steiner was the TA writer who influenced me most; iirc, "the Rescue Game" was his term for Karpman's Triangle -- though I may have gotten the moniker from one of the other books and pamphlets I read on the subject back in the 1980s. The first time I watched <i>The Life of Brian</i>, by the way, I laughed so hard my sides hurt for days, and the parody of radical politics was among the reasons why. "Splitter!" <br><br>Siliconguy, the Rescue Game isn't the only game in town, but I'm sure you can think of examples not that far away from your neck of the woods. Where are you relative to Spokane, btw? My wife grew up in Spokane, and I spent a good many summers in my childhood in Cheney and Ellensburg, while one or another parent was doing summer school. <br><br>Tokyo, thank you. The word "privilege" is a two-edged sword; I should probably talk oneof these days about how it can be used constructively, as a convenient way to talk about all the different built-in biases in society.<br><br><a href=#c8314316985660926425 title="comment permalink">4/13/16, 11:14 PM</a><br><br>

It's easy for the privileged to whip up those rivalries into full-blown hatred, and then play the Rescue Game with each of the groups, convincing it that the others are its real enemies. <br><br>Nathan, that's only in those aspects of popular culture that are dominated by the mainstream center-left. Go over to center-right culture and it's white working class Americans who are assigned the role of Victims, while people of color are assigned the role of Persecutors -- think of Hillary Clinton's description of African-American kids as "superpredators" threatening law-abiding white folk, blah blah blah, or the vilification of "welfare queens" et al. It really does work both ways. <br><br>Alex, sure -- if privileged people start intervening in situations like that, the police will tend to back down. Now watch what happens when you suggest that to your privileged friends, if you have any. <br><br>Don, yes, but it's something more specific than Hegel was talking about. (Well, to be fair, it's hard to be vaguer than Hegel...) <br><br>Bryan, sure, in some situations you also get handouts of various kinds -- which are always tightly controlled by the Rescuer, of course. I didn't include that because it's not a universal feature, and I wanted to focus on the basics. <br><br>Genevieve, er, how you would have assigned the roles isn't the point. I'd encourage you to read a good book or two on the Jim Crow era and see how those roles were in fact assigned in the mainstream rhetoric of that time. <br><br>Misty, good. The thing is, once the narrative is identified and discussed <i>as a narrative</i> -- once the game is recognized as a game -- it isn't hard to change the rules. That's why there's always so much pushback against discussing the narrative as such. <br><br>Cherokee, excellent! Yes, the McCarthy hearings are another great example. There the Victim role was assigned to ordinary Americans, the Persecutor role to evil Communist infiltrators in our midst, and the Rescuer role to McCarthy and his goon squads. I saw the same news story about the Russian planes -- I assumed that they were trying to get the ship to use as many of its radar signals as possible, so a spyplane or boat in the vicinity could record the data for use in future electronic warfare. <br><br>Ray, to hack a game, you have to be fluid. It can be as funny to treat would-be Rescuers as Victims, choosing some utterly unacceptable high-status group as their Persecutors, and watch them freak out. <br><br>Donkey, too true! It's worth remembering that any American with a family income above $40,000 a year is in the global 1%; I suspect an uncomfortable if unspoken awareness of that fact is behind the unwillingness to get up off the sofa. <br><br>John, TA got applied to the social level in the 70s -- there was, for a while, a quarterly called, iirc, the Journal of Radical Therapy, which came out of TA and applied its insights to politics and economics. It laster for a while, and then had the plug pulled along with so many other promising options in the early 1980s. <br><br>Samurai, "this white liberal class that doesn't exist"?????

You're right, of course, that "look what you did" never gets anywhere, and that may be part of its attraction to people who benefit from the system but are uncomfortable about its ethics. "Look what we did" is so much more threatening...<br><br>Mark, if the only two choices are to be victim or oppressor, you need to redefine the game. <br><br>John, exactly. There's a lot of emotional force behind the taboo. <br><br>Mark, I also grew up as an affluent white kid in the suburbs. I then proceeded to spend the first decade or so of my adult life being downwardly mobile, working in low-status wage jobs such as nursing home aide where I was often the only white guy in my job category, and because I paid attention I got to explore my own prejudices and see how the privileged status I got assigned because of my race, gender, etc. worked out in practice. That's a lot of what's behind this discussion. <br><br>Allexis, that's exactly what makes narratives like the Rescue Game so dangerous. People who are genuinely trying to do the right thing and make a difference -- and of course they exist, in fairly large numbers -- can get sucked into a routine that doesn't actually accomplish the good they want to accomplish. That's why it's crucial to bring the narrative to light and talk about it, so we can figure out whether what we're doing will actually have the results we want. <br><br>Roberta, my advice remains the same: lace up your walking shoes. As an experienced Granger, you know how to run a Grange-style organization; you might, if you haven't done this already, pick up a copy of my book <i>Inside a Magical Lodge</i>, which explains in detail how to run the very modestly different version of the same thing that's standard in the occult community, and file off serial numbers as needed! A lot of the old fraternal orders are either willing hostages to the power structure, on the one hand, or obsessed with death-wish behavior of various kinds on the other -- one order in which I'm involved now has an influential group of members that insists the menbership fees and dues have to be raised to astronomical heights, for example -- and so it really is time to start some new projects of the same kind. <br><br>Allexis, exactly. It's by recognizing the various kinds of games, some healthy, some dysfunctional, that we can start playing constructive games such as "Let's build a better future."<br><br><a href=#c8621833368049968310 title="comment permalink">4/13/16, 11:57 PM</a><br><br>

That is admirable and something worth emulating!<br><br>@Michelle, good for you! I always just figured there was some particular blind spot I had for whatever clumsiness on my part was harming my victims. Oh, and I had victims all over the place! At the age of seven, I was required to assimilate among a racially different group of girls. I said, "Oh, wow! Look at all the -----ese!" This childish statement, the result of having seen too many cartoons, was scolded as a sign of my inherent racism, because they were a different "-ese." If my scolders had explained it in terms of "How would you feel if someone called you 'Canadian,' Miss Privileged?" I might have seen the absurdity, but then again, I might have scratched my head and wondered for years what there was to be ashamed about for being Canadian. The girls naturally rejected me. I was an awkward, messy little brat. So I was told that I must try harder. So I did, and once again became aware of what an undesirable little pest I was. I'd go sit down by the girls, and they would all get up laughing and walk away. Finally, I was sent off to a psychiatrist to find out why I was being such a racist little jerk.<br><br>He, fortunately, came to the conclusion that I was not racist at all. After subjecting me to a bunch of mysterious rorschach sorts of run-arounds, he finally came out and asked me directly about my feelings towards the girls, and I said I dreamt of being their friend, but couldn't because I was too messy and ugly. <br><br>This was in the sixties, so the current game was already up and running. Now I live in Japan, where nerdiness is the norm and my slight differences from everyone else have a visible skin-color explanation.<br><br>@JMG, the victim game is not uniquely American. It sounds a lot like the terror inflicted by communism in China. But I haven't seen the same dynamic at work here in Japan. Here, the mythology seems to be "Everyone is equal and we should be happy, and those who aren't, don't exist. Oh, and everyone knows you cannot trust women!" The underlying basis is the three monkeys. Anyone who "sees evil" is blameworthy.

Most importantly, how politicians can do mutually contradictory actions and not get caught out, while some other group is easily scapegoated for votes.<br><br>In Australia both major political parties have mastered the art of being rescuer, to the effect that they are able to play victim-persecutor on two groups simultaneously. For the white lower class, immigrants are the persecutors stealing jobs - all while businesses and government outsource employment to Asia in droves. For immigrants, lower-class white racist 'bogans' (the ultimate snarl word here) are the problem - while it is mainly the affluent upper class people (of all races) who benefit from treating immigrants as dispensable. Rural folk are being bullied by the urban majority, while at the same time being narrow minded and bigoted, keeping the economy from being more 'efficient'. Refugees are case in point on how a real victim can be cast as persecutor - somehow they've managed to rationalize putting them in (what can only be described as) concentration caps.<br><br>This is brilliantly orchestrated through effectively segmenting the party line and discourse in the media - people live in their bubble and only read and watch the channels and papers that pander to (what is defined as) their interests. The same political part members can espouse two different views and carry out actions that hurt both victim/persecuter parties while benefiting their class interests.<br><br>If I went into detail I could easily fill a whole article (which I'm thinking of doing). However, the most important thing to realise is who benefits - and if all the discourse is silently benefiting one group over all others, it's an indication that something is very wrong.<br><br>YCS<br><br><a href=#c4687763142650729750 title="comment permalink">4/14/16, 2:19 AM</a><br><br>

Could it be that the Rescuers get most of the benefits because they are the only ones in a position to apply rational approach to the game?<br><br>Persecutors cannot act rationally within the confines of the game. Whatever they gain by actual persecuting, they stand to lose anyway - by whatever means the Rescuers arrange. If they do not persecute, the same arrangements ensure that the blame is not removed from them - so they get no benefits while still keeping the losses. They can of course withdraw from the game, and this indeed is their best long-term option, but it may be impossible to achieve in the many short terms from which the long term is composed - or, more cruelly, it can be made impossible through the aforementioned Rescuers' arrangements.<br><br>Victims cannot act rationally within the confines of the game either. If they are actually victimised, then this makes them worse off. If they do not demonstrate being victimised, they lose their victim claim and with it the protection of the Rescuers, whatever it may be. They can of course work to improve their lot - and the constraints placed by the game on the Persecutors do make it somewhat easier - and this indeed is their best long-term option, but it comes with a short-term cost of losing ties to the Victim group. This group would contain much of their social and familial circle, so it is no small sacrifice and may be (or, again, be made) prohibitive.<br><br>Rescuers on the other hand can act rationally. They get to choose which of the bidding Victim groups receive their (and the corresponding Persecutors') resources, and can choose and discard those groups which best further their own goals. They also set in place the arrangements by which the perceived wrongs of the Persecutors are supposed to be undone - and this creates two conditions which bind Rescuers to the game just as strongly as the other groups. Firstly, they can profit from their own arrangements, which creates a powerful incentive to keep the game going; secondly, it awards them a degree of freedom of action not available to other players. They can of course steer the game towards some sort of compromise, knowing that in the long term it is doomed to end regardless of their efforts to perpetuate it - but again, it creates an uncertain benefit far off into the future at the expense of immediate loss, especially of freedom of action.<br><br>So yes, Rescuers are the only potentially rational actors of the game. Egoistical to be sure, but the two terms so often go hand in hand...<br><br>MigrantWorker<br><br><a href=#c649252734158197384 title="comment permalink">4/14/16, 2:29 AM</a><br><br>

Unlike the other continental violent epochs of race and class warfare, Hawaii was first and foremost a Kingdom that was illegally overthrown and annexed into the United States (using dubious legal means and gunboat diplomacy) and has been experiencing a prolonged occupation and succession of hostile corporate takeovers ever since. Unfortunately for the Rescuers, this means that pointing fingers at anyone besides long-dead Snidely Whiplash characters will inevitably lead to biting the hands that feed them (with pillaged loot). <br><br>The normal ways around this, such as creating an Office of Hawaiian Affairs to try and turn the Victims into “Indians” and undermine their legal clams of independence have failed over the years because of lack of participation in what is seen as a disingenuous official narrative. Dead people make poor Persecutors. This had led to a political stalemate for a few decades due to the imperial wealth pump supplying an insatiable appetite for development and greed overriding due process, but meanwhile Hawaiian culture has been busy re-inventing itself and picking up the dangling threads of the past in order to weave a new national identity. <br><br>The recent protests over a telescope that was illegally rubber-stamped by an increasingly uncaring, unresponsive, and ethically tainted State government was the spark for a counter-movement against the tide of slow-death colonialism. The powers-that-be couldn't have chosen a worse battle ground. Mauna Kea is the spiritual center of Native Hawaiian belief systems, and after years of desecration and empty promises the people finally had enough. Enter the ʻAha Aloha ʻĀina movement. There's a lot more to the story and I'd encourage people to follow it especially if they are interested in creating their own grass roots organizations with the underlying ideals of inclusiveness and research as opposed to pointless shouting. Time will tell if this new model is viable, but I'm inclined to believe that coalition building is the answer to dīvide et īmpera schemes. It worked for our imported Japanese and Filipino communities when they united at the turn of the 20th century to combat worker exploitation under the sugarcane barons, and as a result flipped the script on local power dynamics for a few decades. <br><br>Hawaiian Sovereignty may seem like a distant colonial struggle that has nothing to do with your personal situation, but keep in mind if you live in a Westernized nation (US, Europe, Australia, NZ, etc.) and aren't a member of the shrinking investment class then by definition you belong to one of the Empire's internal colonies.

For the average Joe in the trenches, it may appear as if there is a single conflict and they are expected to 'choose sides', whereas I believe the reality is that they are expected to choose between narratives intsead. However, what's needed is a meta-narrative which reveals the games to the victim/persecuter pool so they can see the option to form a 'won't play' constituency. The Rescuers seem to be the only self-selecting group in the game, and get to choose the rules of the game.<br><br>Computers and politicians seem to have this in common: the better I understand them, the less I like them...<br><br><a href=#c3364823312170402735 title="comment permalink">4/14/16, 5:18 AM</a><br><br>

The integrationists were supposed to be able to rescue the entire population from persecutions of any non-progressive isolationists/nationalists ad infinitum. As the politicians and bureaucrats in Paris and Brussels continue to play by those rules, they look more and more like perpetrators while the nationalists look more and more like rescuers. Since the migrant crisis began last year, power and influence have consistently been transferring from the integrationists to the nationalists. As John Michael pointed out, the rescuers don't often jump ship when the game gets stale, they just jockey for position in their failing hierarchy. So, while the old order plays circular firing squad, the population is playing another round of pin the tail on the persecutor. Merkel anyone? Schengen suspensions, Scandinavia rejecting migrant quotas, and Holland rejecting Ukrainian inclusion all point to the collapse of integrationist hegemony in Europe.<br><br>The rescue game is clearer in the United States because our integrationist hegemony has just begun to be questioned. The Euro Zone is much further along in its dissolution than the "United" States is, though we could still beat you to the cemetery if our political class plays its hand badly enough. As a New Yorker spending March and April in the Haut Var doing repairs on the house I inherited, I will soon have to choose from which side of the Atlantic to watch the spectacles unfold. Can I choose neither of the above?<br><br><br>A Post-Millenial said, "JMG, can you help me map the Rescue Game onto the disputes between certain liberal students and their professors which made the news not too long ago?"<br><br>As with the Euro Zone, political correctness is a failing round of the rescue game. It was created by marginalized university intellectuals who saw the power vacuum created when the "dead white male" stranglehold on higher education began to dissipate. Marginalized became minority became preferred minority in the game of identity politics. Once a professor identifies with his preferred minority he can join the circular firing squad and blast all competing minorities with abandon. As in Europe, this pin-the-tail-on-the-persecutor, cry-of-pain competition is mashed up with the circular firing squad of the dying order in a free for all. <br><br>The students are very much the victims in this scenario, though pawns might be a better term. Rather than jumping ship when the professors' preferred tool of being more-politically-correct-than-thou has lost its magical ability to redirect scarce resources towards them, said professors are jockeying for position in their failing hierarchy by brainwashing students into acting as their zombie hoards. Of course, what they are brainwashing the students with is the failed discourse of political correctness. This political gambit, collapsing under its own inconsistencies, no longer works at the individual level so can only be successfully wielded by controlled hoards. Will the entrenched professors realize that they squander more resources managing their armies than their gambit will ever give them back, before their students wake up, turn on their masters, and eat their brains? Or will the circular firing squad render the question moot?<br><br><a href=#c3711478823222900494 title="comment permalink">4/14/16, 5:53 AM</a><br><br>

Do they simply refuse to be bound by the working assumptions of the game by perhaps owning the Racist moniker as Blacks in the sixties began to own their African heritage or should they try to "out victim" the officially sanctioned victim groups.

I missed your insights, but I hope you enjoyed your well-earned vacation. This post put into words a lot of my feelings I hadn't been able to describe, and nicely explains who so many of my liberal friends keep accusing me of being a covert Trump support because I refuse to vote for Clinton in the fall. <br><br>I've got three more data points for you, all related to the fact that we are temporarily living in the most endangered area of the country, south Florida, while my wife works on the doomed Everglades restoration project and we decide where to relocate to permanently.<br><br>1.) Local sea level rise is now <b>measured</b> at 1 inch per year, and climbing by my wife's coworkers on the saltwater side of things. <br><br>2.) Housing prices around here are insane, and the people who can't afford to pay $1800+ a month for a tiny apartment are blamed for not going to college and getting a good job (never mind that many of them did). We're living in a working class neighborhood on the edge of the actual ghetto and our rent is "only" $1400 a month for a 2 bedroom 3/4 bath in semidecent shape. The only reason we got it is that our landlord doesn't care about your income being at least 3 times your rent like the complexes do. Our rent is nearly half of our income. How do our neighbors afford? Many don't. Evictions are commonplace in our neighborhood. Most houses are multigenerational or multifamily, even the one bedrooms.<br>Those complexes that want so much money? None of them are full, yet by my rough count, about 5,000 more such apartments are being built within 10 miles of my house. One of them is advertising 3 bedrooms starting at only $2400 a month! Where do they think that many families making $75000+ a year are going to come from? Roommates aren't allowed unless they each qualify on their own.<br><br>3.) I haven't been able to find a permanent job since we got here, so I've joined a growing class of people I wasn't aware existed: the professional temp. These are highly educated people with solid "in demand" degrees like accounting, finance, etc, who also can't find permanent jobs, most under 35 like me. We do salary class work for below salary class wages (but more than minimum wage -$14-$15 an hour is common, but are always temporary and usually part-time. We get no benefits, no perks, and are disposable at the drop of a hat. I've lost two such jobs already because my daughter got sick, and may lose a third today for the same reason. Jobs might last a day, a week, a month, and then we might be unemployed for several weeks until another company needs us. We're not officially counted as unemployed because we work for agencies, and there are thousands and thousands of us in the Miami area. I'm dusting off my business degree and working on a business plan, because this is nuts.<br><br><a href=#c5590397168557277558 title="comment permalink">4/14/16, 7:17 AM</a><br><br>

So in this case one has persecutors and victims being ultimately interchangeable with two different groups of rescuers treating the two groups differently.<br><br>So those with money and power get to be rescuers and get everyone else to fight against eachother.

When I first saw it applied as part of training for community and volunteer work, the concept was presented to make sure that the people who actually belonged to disadvantaged communities and were affected by the things that happened in them took the lead, and that the work didn’t get hijacked by affluent white volunteers who thought they knew better. In other words, Peggy McIntosh was, in a lot of ways, initially trying to call out the game, and give well-meaning affluent white people advice on how to avoid becoming would-be “rescuers.” Now, the entire useful discussion has turned into affluent college students screaming “check your privilege” at people they don’t like.<br>That seems to be one of the real catch-22s of the game. I can imagine a scenario in which, on unmoderated discussions on this very essay, people begin to use the language of the game itself to keep the wheel turning by turning “rescuer” into just another dog whistle for “persecutor.” In fact, that’s very similar to what’s happened in certain segments of the internet, where a certain brand of affluent white male tech geek has begun using the phrase “social justice warrior,” on its own, the phrase could be carried toward a useful analysis of the rescuer phenomenon, but instead, in actual usage “SJW” is the new form of persecutor; young, socially awkward, economically disenfranchised white millennials are the victims; and suave, tech savvy paternal Gen-Xers are the rescuers. Is there any way to stop it other than triggering an endgame so catastrophic that once the dust settles everyone throws up their hands and says “never again” until a few generations take the last round out of living memory?<br>-------------------<br><br>All that aside, I did want to share one fairly hopeful thing that was drawn to my attention this week, that shows one of your more optimistic chickens coming home to roost and getting ready to lay some eggs that might hatch once the dust of everything going on right now settles. This article popped up on the American Conservative about Distributism, which shows that big mainstream publications are beginning to think outside the Smith/Marx box we collectively shoehorned ourselves into in the last century. I wonder (considering the fact that they’ve quoted the Archdruid Report before), if someone on the American Conservative ran across your “Advice for Distributists” essay and started looking into some of those third options you discussed there. Either way, new paths in the wake of the next crisis are beginning to be disseminated and discussed more broadly.<br><br>http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/distributism-is-the-future/<br><br><br><a href=#c4940663669741773942 title="comment permalink">4/14/16, 8:16 AM</a><br><br>

(One of the nasty little factors at play now is Affirmative Action caused racism/sexism: that is, if you appear to be of a group that benefits from Affirmative Action, then you are assumed to not be capable of succeeding without Affirmative Action.) Our refusal to play along with the game has caused reactions that I can only identify as being cognitive dissonance, including raised voices and insistence that while the form in question says identifying your race is optional, it's in fact mandatory.

I think this explains some of the generational bias we have seen in the last couple of months in ADR. The victims are the poor Millenials. The persecutors are the Boomers, which is sometimes stretched to include Gen X. Perhaps the rescuers are the financiers who make unpayable student loans, and the colleges that ramp up the costs into the stratosphere to cover the new football stadium and the countless layers of administration. There must be more, however. There are MILLIONS of people playing this game. <br><br>What alerted me to this was the invariably-repeated claim that ALL the Boomers were equally guilty. This covers those who lived on a small farm, those who spent their lives helping people, those who were the long-term unemployed, the wage class of any race or culture as well as the salary class. You name it, every Boomer was personally responsible for Reagan, the dissing of the Limits to Growth, the loss of "appropriate technology", and the general state of the economy and the world.

Your ability to connect dots I note and to open up entire new realms of thought never fails to impress!

Humbly ceding my own privileges without reservation, so that I could get past that to explore their viewpoint, or to cause intellectual mischief by taking advantage of the circular firing squad, what I saw as ultimately self defeating Sith behavior (yes from Star Wars lol). It seemed apparent to me that even well intentioned as they are, the ends don't justify the means because their policies simply aren't working and are even counterproductive to the stated goals, in the case of women's and blacks equality anyway, and they are adopting worse and worse means to get there. We now have college students fighting against free speech and space as "racist". <br><br>Another blogger I follow who has a much more audacious approach to the world than mine put forth an experiment on twitter about projecting the shadow. He posted a professional, positive picture of Marissa Johnson with the caption "This is the leader of Black Lives Matter", no further commentary or anything. People were incensed!

I did get the impression a while back that you were gearing up for a new long-running theme, and I was hoping it would be something like this.<br><br>Sit-rep from Yawron, this narrative as a structure for framing public discourse is even more heavily applied here, and it is hard to find a subject, controversial or not, that doesn't get that particular treatment. Of course, for a country that has modelled its collective sense of self on its role as Rescuer among nations, this is par for the course.<br><br>A little less than a decade ago, the Big Rescue Game featured affluent, white, middle aged, upper middle class women as the Victim, our ignorant culture with all its baggage of conditioned stupidity (which pretty much works out to "the habits of thought of white, working class men") as the Persecutor, and officialdom, the chattering classes and the media as the Rescuer. Around the time when climate change activism decided to destroy itself the cast was changed to nature (or at least the the "Silent Running Fallacy" variety of it) as the Victim, people who work in the productive economy and who in turn spend the money they earn on actual goods and services (again, working people) as the Persecutor, and officialdom, the chattering classes and the media as the Rescuer.<br><br>It's been losing wind since, and the only people who haven't gotten the memo are by and large millenials with standing prescriptions of anti-depressants and not much to do apart from consuming social media, who put a lot of ingenuity into creating victim groups they can champion (sexual minorities seems to be the buzz right now). <br><br>That is to say, we're back to pinning the tail. Right now it seems we're being geared for two separate Big Rescue Games: The first features Syrian refugees as the Victim, people with the audacity to point out such inconveniences as limited resources, demographic pressure and, oh, those terrorist incidents that just happened to occur (and yes, this group more or less works out in practice to "white working class people"...) as the Persecutor, and the chattering classes and the media as the Rescuer. The media has been even sneakier than usual in this regard, by first working up fear and suspicion in the general populace and then serving itself up as a channel through which the chattering classes can condemn said general poulace for being fearful and suspicions (which of course is chattering class code for "stupid"). The second features the gentle and honorable peoples of Western Europe as the Victim, the Evul Russians as the Persecutor, and officialdom and the media as the Rescuer (the approved plan for doing said rescue consists of whining on television and buying F-35s, btw). Note that the only instance where white working class people didn't get dealt the role of Persecutor was the instance where the chattering classes weren't claiming the role of Rescuer.<br><br>And now I sayeth popcorn, and lots of it...<br><br><a href=#c6346887881349082882 title="comment permalink">4/14/16, 11:51 AM</a><br><br>

Consequently, the left paints the right-wing media as loony and goes about the business acting like everything is normal.<br><br>Fast forward to 2016. Sanders supporters (who are more people who sympathize with victims than victims themselves) see through the game partly and hope to get genuine rescuers to genuinely rescue everyone.

Trump is far more dangerous to the establishment because Sanders supporters are still mostly playing by the rules. They're still globalists and they're still victims.

As others have pointed out the dynamic is evident in both politics and religion. It certainly describes what goes on in the religio-political scene in mormon Utah: it is not easy to discern whether the religious leaders (past or present) act out of genuine belief or intent to profitably defraud. Both likely have been the case, but their use of the rescuer-victim-persecutor dynamic (prophet of God-believer-gentile) to perpetuate what is a profitable enterprise with its fair share of sacrificial lambs exposes the nature of what is certainly a dysfunctional dynamic. It also does a good job of explaining how a person's altruism or anxiety both can get hijacked and how otherwise well intentioned people are played against each other. This is definitely juice for the culture-jam cocktail!<br><br>I appreciate the notion of bringing the discernment and differentiation of racial privilege, racial prejudice, and acts of racial injustice to what we lump together as racism; so tracing the circle through generationism, classism, sexism, and anthropocentrism ought to be fruitful.

(What year is it now? Is it Deutschland 1920, or is it Deutschland 1932? We'll find out in due course.) <br><br>(3) Having pondered and pondered a separate blog for discussing, in a rather Catholic setting, some of the topics raised by JMG (frequent, occasionally prolix, Catholic postings here, in JMG's ADR blog, might become tedious to many readers), I have at last acted. <br><br>In those protracted ponderings, I have felt myself in the position of the dinner-party host wondering what kind of party to give. <br><br>(i) For three months or so, I kept thinking that I should in imitation of JMG's ADR make my blog a careful, formal, affair, producing the cyber equivalent of white linen and bone china. <br><br>(ii) Then I thought that I should largely give up, producing something like pizza on paper plates (in cyber terms, a mere e-mail discussion list, for the seven blog-interested people now in e-mail contact with me). <br><br>(iii) What I have finally settled for is a kind of compromise - a cyber parallel to the cold serve-yourself buffet of reasonable sandwiches and reasonable finger foods, with hospital-grade (as distinct from hotel-grade) crockery and cutlery. I have just created a blog <a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com/ rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com/</a>. This blog is not meant to attain the polished literary quality of JMG's ADR. It is, rather, a place for posting a hasty weekly essay, sometimes JMG/ADR-relevant and sometimes not JMG/ADR-relevant, sometimes of reasonable length and sometimes comprising just a swift paragraph or two. When the weekly posting is not JMG/ADR-relevant, it is liable to address one or another of my various JMG/ADR-irrelevant concerns, generally from a rather explicitly Catholic-environmentalist standpoint: the current green-hermit movement (including its roots in the 2015 encyclical <i>Laudato Si'</i>), or the David Dunlap Observatory and Park heritage-conservation problem here in Richmond Hill (in which I oppose two publicly Catholic families of real-estate developers), or my efforts in physics-of-radio (a topic with its own faint Catholic echoes, as when one considers the conceptual depth of the created cosmos). <br><br>Guest comments and guest essay postings, including comments and essays courteously critical of Catholicism, or even critical of environmentalism, are welcome. Admittedly, such materials are liable to elicit courteous rebuttals from me, in my own online comments. <br><br>The emerging Catholic-environmentalist <a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com/ rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com/</a> blog has just one entry so far, explaining areas of writer interest and rules of conduct. <br><br>The first substantive posting, as opposed to the current posting on upcoming topics-of-interest and rules of conduct, should be uploaded in the (Tuesday morning) interval UTC=20160419T0001Z/20160419T0401Z. That posting will perhaps be on green Catholic hermits. But so informal is everything that I reserve the right to change my mind: if - as I do not now envisage - I get obsessed next week with Dorothy Day's social teaching, or with liturgy, or whatever, then let it be Dorothy Day, or liturgy. <br><br><br>Sincerely, <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br>Toomas(dot)Karmo(at)gmail(dot)com <br><br>in Richmond Hill, near Toronto in Canada <br><br>(member of Estonian diaspora, <br>pursuing perceived informal vocation as green Catholic hermit,<br>outside the more formal framework of Canon 603, <br>without vows, <br>within the ordinary disciplines of the Catholic laity)<br><br><a href=#c7300395413545029763 title="comment permalink">4/14/16, 2:12 PM</a><br><br>

The model you describe fits nicely to the narrative being used to sell the ongoing coup here in Brazil. The persecutors in this case would be the president, her "utterly corrupt" party and their supporters among the population, responsible for plunging the country into the worst recession in its history. The Rescuers are played by the media, most oligarchs, oposition politicians and all "concerned" citizens supporting the coup. Coincidentally, most of these could also be labeled "affluent white people". Finally, the Victims are, of course, the people who have been suffering under the economic downturn. Unfortunately, such simplistic narratives tend to have the most appeal, and it seems a lot of people are buying it.<br><br><a href=#c5936388717054356675 title="comment permalink">4/14/16, 2:36 PM</a><br><br>

To my mind, that's the first non-negotiable step toward the honesty that allows a functional game to develop. <br><br>YCS, please do fill up a whole article with it! That's exactly the same game the two major parties in the US play, of course. <br><br>MigrantWorker, I'm not at all sure what you mean by the word "rational" here. Each player makes a rational response to the situation he or she is in; it's simply that the rules are defined by the Rescuer to ensure that no permissible action on the part of any other player threatens the continuation of the game. <br><br>.Mallow, I don't know that there's an easy answer, but I can think of two important places to start. The first is to accept your own privileged position -- by which I don't mean wallowing in guilt or any such thing, of course; I'm talking about acknowledging the power differential that exists, so that you can correct for that in interpersonal interactions. The second and more important is this: if you're going to try to cause change for the better, find out from the people who are going to be helped by that action what changes they actually want, and then help them achieve those. Don't decide that you already know what they want, or (worse) that you know better than they do; use your privilege to boost their signal, rather than drowning it out beneath a signal of your own. Does that make sense? <br><br>Beetleswamp, thanks for the update from Hawai'i! It's precisely from local actions that the rest of us can get some sense of the tactics that work. <br><br>Tony, good. That's what I'm trying to do here, by introducing a narrative that says "the map is not the territory, the game is not what it claims to describe," and then laying out the rules in cold print. Do you recall those evil spirits of legend who could only be defeated by speaking their name aloud? It's pretty much the same strategy here. <br><br>Bruce, good. The fact that you've noticed that, and not simply fallen into it, shows that you're way ahead of most Americans!<br><br>Christophe, nah, the Rescue Game is clearer in the United States because we're deep in the Circular Firing Squad phase; having lost our external Persecutor with the fall of the Soviet Union, we've been playing Pin the Tail on the Persecutor with increasing vim domestically, to the point that every group you care to name is a Victim, a Persecutor, and a Rescuer to somebody! <br><br>Mikep, the only way to win is not to play. <br><br>Dragonfly, the Oppression Olympics can be a very lucrative game these days.<br><br>Yossi, no kidding. Nearly every former British colony I can think of is still riven with ethnic rivalries the British government deliberately stirred up -- think Israelis and Palestinian Arabs, Indians and Pakistanis, Anglo-Canadians and Quebecois, Irish and northern Irish, etc., etc., etc. It was a very profitable gimmick in its day. <br><br>Nati, that's why finding ways to trick or force the Persecutor into playing is an essential part of the game. How you get out of it depends on how much force can be applied to keep you in it. A lot of young white Americans, for example, are refusing to go to college these days, and although there are plenty of other reasons for that, part of it is the fact that if they go to a university they'll be assigned the role of Persecutor in the currently popular forms of the game.<br><br><a href=#c973980505111494726 title="comment permalink">4/14/16, 2:46 PM</a><br><br>

Otherwise, if you don't spend enough time making sense of what doesn't work, you're likely to reproduce its dysfunctional features in other contexts without realizing it. <br><br>Rebecca, many thanks for the updates! I hope you and your wife can get out of there before things get really ghastly. <br><br>Chris, that's certainly one of the ways the game can be played. Again, finding an adequate supply of Persecutors is essential if you want to avoid the circular firing squad phase...<br><br>Matt, I may have to do a post about the differences among privilege, prejudice, and acts of injustice. It really does clarify things to sort those out -- which is probably why this is so rarely done. <br><br>Johndevelopment, you're confusing the game with the real world. These people you're labeling Predators -- unless that's just your way of saying Persecutors -- don't have an assigned role in the game; that would defeat the purpose of the game, which is to direct responsibility away from those who benefit most from the system. <br><br>Don, I'm probably going to talk about that next week. One of the core features of the American caste system is the loud insistence, from those who benefit most from it, that it doesn't exist at all.<br><br>Frank, don't confuse the game with the real world! In the real world, nearly everyone -- other than a tiny minority at the top, and a larger but still small minority at the bottom -- is both exploiter and exploited, benefiting from privilege in regard to some people and suffering from it in regard to others. Of course the proportions vary drastically from, say, me (white, male, straight, salary-class upbringing, etc.) to, say, a wage-class Latina lesbian, but you have to look long and hard to find someone who is either always on top of privilege relations or always on the bottom. In the game, on the other hand, everyone has only one role -- the Victim always suffers, the Persecutor always gains from the Victim's suffering, and the Rescuer is motivated by pure altruism. <br><br>Eric, I'm going to try to avoid the hamster wheel of endless Rescue Games by a couple of moves. Defining the game as a game is one of them; stating the rules and payoffs outright is one of them; there are several other moves, which will be made as we proceed. Thanks for the heads up about Distributism -- that's really good news! <br><br>Ekkar, exactly. Once you learn your way around the game, it's fascinating to see how many bogus conflicts follow the same script. <br><br>Whomever, we'll be talking about that as the discussion proceeds. <br><br>J Gav, glad you liked it. Again, though, it's important to keep clear on the difference between the game and the real world. In the fictive reality of the Rescue Game, everything the Persecutors do is bullying by definition, and the Victims and the Rescuers never bully anyone -- no, no, the Victims simply express their pain, and the Rescuers inflict justly deserved punishment on the Persecutors. Outside that fictive reality, the people who have been assigned the roles of Victim and Rescuer get to bully the bejesus out of the people who have been assigned the role of Persecutor, and feel a warm glow of self-righteousness while doing so.<br><br><a href=#c2891314871221049950 title="comment permalink">4/14/16, 3:32 PM</a><br><br>

Probably also useful to understand that by the time we reach adulthood we are all well versed in each of these roles having cycled through them in many different contexts. e.g. the white liberal female academic playing the role of rescuer at work is coming home and easily slipping into the role of victim to her husband, while the Latino activist victim comes home and steps into the role of persecutor to his family and so on through all of the many contexts in which we have to play this particular game. <br><br>Berne said that the only place game playing ends is where a person is able to express consciously what his/her needs and wants are with the reasonable expectation that they will be honored and fulfilled. That is an increasing rare and privileged occasion. I think that one of the fatal flaws in TA is/was how easy it is to see the games other people are playing and fail to see how caught up we are in it ourselves. All of this stuff takes work to understand and the willingness for self exploration. In the meantime, most people (the 80%) need to figure out how they are going to keep a roof over their head and some food in their belly, making this sort of investigation more or more only accessible to those parties who are most invested in keeping the game going so they don't end up playing the game, "oops, I'm hanging from a lamppost."

It just seems as though it's especially popular in the US right now. <br><br>Adrian, I can't speak to the social justice scene generally, but I've watched a couple of classic circular firing squads in action in the science fiction community, so it's quite possible that there, at least, the game is running out of Persecutors to bully. <br><br>Tokyo, the first step is to acknowledge our own self-interest and condition of privilege. The second is to stop "speaking for the oppressed" by drowning out what they themselves are trying to say, and if we want to do something good in the world, find out what the people who would be benefited by it actually want, and further that instead of imposing our own agenda. That ought to be a good start. <br><br>BoysMom, exactly. Of course the two parties can be lumped together; they stand for exactly the same things in practice, and simply take different sides of the ongoing Good Cop-Bad Cop routine of American politics. As for refusing to be good little Victims, that's precisely the issue -- if you and your family don't do as your told, how can the other side get poor white folks enraged at you? <br><br>Poet, that'd take at least one post -- the UN is one extremely complex flustered cluck. <br><br>Greg, I tend to think that baboon analysis -- how would this work out in a troop of baboons? -- is a very useful tool in most human situations, this one among them. <br><br>Pygmycory, precisely -- you're afraid, and reasonably so, of being suddenly transferred from the category of Victim to that of Persecutor. That's one of the whips the Rescuers hold over the heads of the other participants. <br><br>Unknown, that's a good example of the Oppression Olympics I discussed in the post: "We've been oppressed worse than anybody else, and so we deserve all the attention from Rescuers." <br><br>Pygmycory, good. Yes, that's another good example. <br><br>Christopher, bingo. The Rescue Game pervades American thinking these days, at least at the levels of higher privilege. <br><br>Pygmycory, yes, handouts often play a role, but that's not universal by any means. Good for you, for catching the way that so much of the handouts end up in the hands of Rescuers...<br><br>Lucretia, nah, I'll be coming at things from an unexpected angle as usual.

I can't imagine how awful it must be to be a native person on a well-run, but poor and remote reserve (most of them) watching people who could fairly be called race traitors exploit the generations of suffering white Canadians have imposed on the natives.<br><br>JMG's explanation of the game dynamics at play here dovetail perfectly with the government and media playing rescuer, while of course demonizing just about everyone who disagrees with the notion that reserves should get even *more* money to spend without oversight(this year's federal budget allots something like $10,000 a year per status Indian, and last year's wasn't much less) - this is roughly 50% of what a Canadian making $32000 a year gets per year, after taxes.<br><br>And accurately enough, the voices of people who've 'left the reserve' and dare to speak out, as a few did last time Theresa Spence was in the news, are shamed and ostracized for breaking the rules.<br><br>Regarding the black lives matter types and Kunstler, well, I went to high school with a lot of white people who grew up in environments filled with the sort of social problems Kunstler likes to pretend are black cultural problems - there are plenty of lily-white examples of the same dysfunction, even if they are rarely on the scale and pervasiveness of places like Baltimore or Camden. Nearly everything that racists like to call Typical ... Behavior was on display and even valorized to a degree as a mark of perverse pride.

As I noted, though, a lot depends on how much force the Rescuers are willing to use to make the Persecutors play, and how effectively the Persecutors use what power they have to refuse to play.

I ponder what hidden lesson and virtue is in this game. It is easy to "hate the game, love the player", but I think that might be missing some lesson... there is something important in this... something yet unstated... a gut feeling.<br><br>So, I've got a question. Can you think of a formally different game which fills a similar functional niche? I have been trying to imagine such a beast for about ten minutes, but I haven't caught any fish yet. Might be the bait, might be the waters. But if any one else can think of such a thing, I think it would be useful to contemplate the dynamics under the process. Put another way, if this is a cultural phenomenon, and it addresses a human need. Then there might be things with other forms to address the need in a different form. <br><br>So the question becomes, what is the need addressed by the Rescue game? Socrates always wanted one answer, that sneaky sneak, but we might have a hive of answers. Though the clearest answer to me at this time is to address cognitive dissidence. The game cause a social condition to stabilize while making a show of opposing the same condition it stabilizes. So the game only is 'called for' by circumstances where there is some kind of disharmony, a mismatch between ideology and the rest of our motives.<br><br>I assume that what I just called 'the rest of our motives' is relatively similar between cultures for the context of this line of thinking. Vices differ greatly from individual to individual, but whole cultures have similar collections of motives which would grok the roles made available by the rescue game. This makes me suspect that ideology is important, I suspect that if the rescue game is not universal (which I indeed would guess) this could be explained by it requiring certain ethical frames to be in place to support it.<br><br>Though there are many risky jumps along this line of thinking, I jump forward again. The ethical character of a people should resemble the formal pattern of the Game it plays. Or to be more specific... the Rescue game can only flourish in a contest that is primed with stories where rescuing victims is what heroes do. Ohhh... I like that!<br><br>If heroes primarily go questing, for example of something else that lots of heroes do, the rescue game sorta misses the point. I hypothesis, and don't dare push me to figure out how we would test this, that people and cultures that especially cherish stories where rescuing isn't the defining activity of a hero won't take to the rescue game as much as people or cultures where rescuing the innocent from villains is the bread and butter of a hero's role in their preferred stories. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c779239663468836733 title="comment permalink">4/14/16, 7:26 PM</a><br><br>

But, if I trust those suppositions I imagine thus. The Rescuers game serves to let a person play out a heroic role, didn't you say the game requires an audience? while having enough 'give' not to over-encumber their more sorted motives. Also, it gives a persecutor the chance to be a thorn for a frustrating dippy goody goody. The victim gets 'rescued' from conditions that are a set for their suffering- a most convincing set features true suffering, and such a set is eagerly looked for by the rescuer, true suffering also gets the best performance out of the victim- and in nastier versions of the game the victim can earn the 'right to justice', or revenge. Lynchings after the civil war; less lethal revenge depending on the tastes of the rescuer.<br><br>Concerning tastes. Games generally have stakes, and the violence in such a game I believe reflect the level of stakes the players are accustomed to risking in life. Some people play for bragging rights and indignation. If one is accustomed to 'playing' for keeps then the participants livelihood could be at stake. If players risk life and death in their own lives, their own or others, then escalating to that point becomes likely.<br><br>So I have reached the following clue, for those interested in my question, which remains a question as much as my clue remains speculative. There may be corresponding games for various heroic ideals.<br><br><br>Also, I just remembered that only a few months ago I hadn't heard the term SJW. Then in the same week I had a friend try to ring me into a firing squad and the term started to saturate TADR. I suspect this sudden change reflects a phase change in that subculture, likely the beginning of the circular firing squad. Largely death from success, the stated values were so vague that it over recruited rescuers. Circle up.<br><br><a href=#c8607042873046455783 title="comment permalink">4/14/16, 7:26 PM</a><br><br>

The very title of his latest book, "Too Much Magic," betrays your difference in perspective -- what we have is not too much magic, but the wrong kind of magic, the techno-kind instead of the human kind. I have a friend who reads his blog religiously, and I've realized it's because it fits into his narrative where all Americans are totally impotent in the face of massive immanent collapse. But in fact it is the same American minorities who white liberals try to rope into the "victim game" who are genuinely getting more equitable treatment and feeling far more hopeful than rural whites. Hope is the human magic that can rescue us from ourselves. If we can get beyond these games, and beyond the ephemeral knee-jerking of partisan politics, we might see the transformative role that present-day minorities will probably play in the future. That's something genuinely worth thinking and talking about.<br><br>Especially in the increasing sense of crisis this year, we need to be able to step back from our dreams of catastrophe and see the mixture of human emotions that exist today as much as any day in human history. You've <a href=../../2013/05/the-pleasures-of-extinction.html rel=nofollow>already discussed that on this blog</a>, but in light of the American election, as well as the natural fears that arise from the growing disruptions of internal and international migrants, war refugees, and climate refugees around the world, I hope you will return to the subject sometime during this cycle.<br><br><a href=#c6826674525802207216 title="comment permalink">4/14/16, 8:01 PM</a><br><br>

I've been through Moses Lake more times than I can count, though of course it's been a while. <br><br>Ray, another game that fills the same role is the one played in medieval Europe, which we can call "the Rightful Place Game." The overt goal of the game is to get everyone lined up in their rightful place in a single straight line which extends from the king, who's standing next to God, all the way down to the lowliest serf's baby daughter. The covert goal is to take advantage of any confusion or disruption to try to move a notch or two up the line. If anyone gets caught making such a move, everyone else gets to bully him back into his "rightful place," which is usually a notch or two lower than he started out -- and of course the disruption this causes will inevitably give someone else a shot at jumping up the line. It's quite a lively game, with the fiction of a nice neat hierarchy constantly having to be pasted over the surface of something that looks a lot more like Donnybrook Fair.<br><br>Avery, yes, we'll be getting to that.

Specifically my hypothesis fits my own experiences. I have often been an audience for various versions of the game in my youth. I remember vaguely being an anarchist with a 15 inch mohawk about 8 or 9 years ago. Anarchy, mutualism, some related thought I explored well. I felt the prescribed emotions about the people that 'good sources' told me were victims or persecutors. Though I recall being very jaded about the prospects for rescue... but let's see, I do recall, at the time believe in world improving. I think I didn't view injustice as originating in human sin, but as coming from systematic malfunctions which humans were trapped with in.<br><br>The heroic ideal wasn't the rescuer, it was the Quest goer. Grew up watching Star Trek TNG, it had a big effect on me. Say what you will about the cheese and the issue of the progress narrative, TNG had a few episodes which were jems on moral philosophy. Rescuing 'less developed' (translate that code word) 'lower status' peoples was against the prime directive. Some episodes focused on the moral challenges any law drawing such a simple line paints, but often it was played straight. I grew to like the episodes where they had to figure stuff out, discover things, find solutions. Star Trek is not a lone influence, but it is sufficent for the point. To me heroism was about balancing the moral callings of maintaining what is most beautiful about our humanity with accepting transformation and lessons from a Universe that is stuffed with the unforeseeable, and seasoned with the inconceivable. <br><br>Fast Forward. Out of college, lost the mohawk, traveling. A friend and mentor says "The World does not need Saving." as an off hand remark. Stuck with me. It was good to heard a belief I didn't know I had stated so clearly. Freeing isn't it? It deserves care, respect, honor, and so on from our human virtues, but it does not need for me to be being a Savior. <br><br>Same era, I start to become aware of what I have just now learned to name 'the Rescue Game'. But I don't understand it, tend to bristle around it. The Scapegoating isn't the frustrating bit, it's not like that nasty habit is beneath me, I get pulled into the blame game all too easily. Its the way victims get talked about, makes them seem so pathetic. Even the least of the people I know from groups which are cast as victims are so much greater than any such victim could be; the dumbest persecutors are not the dog pack described in such game, even those that play at being dogs are hammy actors; the least capable rescuers are more capable that their forged achievements show, one would think that if playing heroes they would at least play heroes who did something! The bickering, the grand standing, the tirades, the constant use and abuse of categories. I love categories, and hate to see them abused, the real victims!<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I feel danger in my heroic ideal, the game that fills the same need for me. There is danger in growing cold, distant, aloof, arrogant, or abstract from the world; always a foreigner. I have seen games many of it that are fearful and sad to see, I have even dabbled in playing those games.<br><br><a href=#c3527139894069899532 title="comment permalink">4/14/16, 10:08 PM</a><br><br>

Returning to the function of social motives. Yes, the example of arranging the links in the great chain of being makes perfect sense! The Rescue game functions in that light as a way to step up and down the rungs in a culture that is required to deny the rungs; similarly the Rightful Place Game has to accomidate for the fact that social status ain't set in stone in a culture obliged to insist that it's just got to be! From these two examples I can generalize to a group of games that are based in accommodating rough facts on the ground with the narrative of the top of the hierarchy, and infer that for the function you are bringing to focus one might expect these games to correspond to the stories justifying a leaders status.<br><br>Which makes me realize that there are TONS of radically different stories for 'why so and so is the leader'. The social hierarchy needs stories for stability. To the extent that those stories have bits of reality they don't fit well there is a fissure. Here a savvy player can redefine the split that is relevant to their interests. If things go well for the player they have 'shown' that the story increases their position, if not consequences can be heavy. But everybody who plays has to still believe or at least play at believing the absolute truth of the story they are tweaking. Since the Story in a key mechanism for how power actually is distributed, being able to control ones role in the story is truthfully very powerful. It is a high stakes game, and it is therefore played with appropriate seriousness.<br><br>I still stand by the relevance of the heroic ideal on my digression, in terms of how the person who is playing the game takes their cues for how to do it from the narrative structure of their culture. Emboldened by the fact that it seems, on the face at first glance, consistent with the Rightful Place Game.

Take the GFC of 2008 as an example, whilst I agree with the notion that the banking industry, and the related players in the sub-prime mortgage crash, should've faced stiff consequences for their actions - I also recognise that there is a huge amount of projection going on. The sub-prime mortgage industry had to have willing customers and salespeople after all - for which they found by the tens of millions. Likewise, I hear of people who castigate the food system, and the plight of farmers being paid less for their product than it takes them to produce it, only surviving by way of subsidy ensuring that unsustainable farming practices remain in practice, but then will gladly make 90% of their food purchases at the supermarket. But on social media they'll purport to support farmers and hate the supermarkets and the inequality that they cause. But then none of this should be surprising as the shadow is particularly powerful in a culture that wants to have it all, when they want, how they want, no matter the consequences - and of course don't want to deal with the grim realities of producing everything they want. I want to be able to eat an exotic diet and travel the world, but want clean air and to stop global warming, I want a shiny smart phone but don't want child slavery and I want cheap clothes made by fairly paid workers. Well unfortunately you can't have one of those things without the other. And I know this mentality well because I am talking to myself of just a couple of years ago. No it's far easier to blame climate change on the oil companies, bad working conditions on corrupt sweatshop owners and slave-labour minerals on greedy multi-nationals. After all how else can I possibly afford my habits and buy all my cheap consumer tat? And hey, a few lines of coke on the weekend never harmed anyone did it? viva la revolución!<br><br>I suppose to sum up my meanderings, is that it's always someone else's fault and never our own. I, as a privileged middle class liberal can never be at fault, because why those things are foul and uncivilised, no it's the bad guys who at fault. And why do something about those injustices when you can click like on facebook? Meanwhile I can keep my hands clean.<br><br>And that to assume by taking simple decisions in your life can actually have an effect e.g. stop supporting Walmart/Tesco's, stop buying yet more clothes, stop flying around Europe on lovely weeks away, stop being so reliant on the global market-based systems etc. etc. is to of course fall foul of individualism because my lonely self can't possibly make a global impact by doing that. No only governments and corporations can change things. But of course if they are the cause of all things evil then of course they are the only ones that can solve all our problems. But if we were to admit that we could play a role in changing things, then we'd have to admit that we are culpable, complicit and ultimately as much at fault as the 'evil elites' who do our bargaining for us (so we don't have to). The idea that just because I believe individual action is important, doesn't mean I don't think collective action is also important gets lost. 0 or 1. no 0.5 or 0.33 or whatever....<br><br><a href=#c3066541034791260742 title="comment permalink">4/15/16, 5:08 AM</a><br><br>

(and this is me saying it, who long ago angrily pushed away from the Christian faith of my childhood). Only love drives out fear, and guilt, and judgment.

I think forbidding people to express their own needs and limitations may be a completely different way of establishing power relationships, with results that are just as dysfunctional as those of the rescuer game. Victims inevitably arise in any society, but when they are persecuted for saying so, it doubles down on the victimization. The privileged classes take pride in not having to elucidate their needs, and others aspire to that as an ideal. Because pride is involved, encouraging people here to see the irrational nature of the game being played would not bear much fruit. This is why poverty is so invisible in Japan, though it is quickly rising to levels comparable to those in America. I think collapse in Japan will be marked by lots of suicides. But I also think that when stress overtakes them, people will act out in irrational ways that will be hard to predict. I don't know what resentments may be simmering beneath the calm surface. I hear it is like this in Thailand as well, only more so.<br><br><a href=#c3563217972849464589 title="comment permalink">4/15/16, 6:10 AM</a><br><br>

I've been noting that in Japan, I don't see the rescuer game as such, but another sort of power game that seems to be at play. Interestingly, as per your speculation, Japanese culture/literature does not have much in the way of rescue stories. Bad luck is considered to be the result of bad karma, and the individual must pay and then can hope to take part in privileged society in the future. Misfortune is stoically accepted to a large degree, but people here nonetheless have their limits, and when those are exceeded, the outcome can be very hard to predict except that it will be violent.<br><br>For the same reason, self-sacrifice is admired, and a source of pride, and one of the heroes of Edo Era Japan was a religious leader who starved himself to death atop Mt. Fuji, hoping to help bring on an age when people would be kind to each other. The authorities were desperate to stamp out the Fuji-ko movement he headed, fearing it would empower the people to break down the order, but they failed to make a dent in it. The movement was never really about challenging authority anyway, and probably for that reason, the authorities quit worrying about it after a while and it flourished until recent times.<br><br><a href=#c4778622279521128947 title="comment permalink">4/15/16, 7:39 AM</a><br><br>

His tendencies, for example, to refer to rural working class whites as "NASCAR morons" and to focus his scorn on the dysfunctional aspects of African-American society as somehow uniquely divorced from the larger issue of class in the U.S. is not particularly helpful. <br><br>Your introduction of the Persecutor-Victim-Rescuer game, on the other hand, gives us an actual tool we can use to begin to slog through the 300 year old swamp of class and race that the United States is built on.

No, it's all the usual stuff, race, culture, sexual preference, gender issues in all their profusion. Nothing much about religion either. Seems that the issue is side-stepped, at least in the confines of the corporate world. <br><br>Maybe I'm overgeneralizing but it seems to me that the type of person that sees themselves as a "rescuer" see themselves as a cut above, intellectually superior, much more enlightened and, as such, they see themselves as post-religious (I couldn't think of a better term).<br><br>Do they look down on religious people? In their private lives, yes, of course, as grads of the University of Toronto and Queen's University, this social class is acculturated and indoctrinated in atheism. They look down on this superstitious stuff from a great height. <br><br>But they don't utter a peep if the religion in question is Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism. No, these varieties of faith are allowed space under the protective umbrella of "multiculturalism". But if the religions in question are Christianity or Judaism, well now, that's a different story. Especially evangelical Christianity. Extra special scorn there. <br><br>See, to the "rescuer", at least the ones I've seen, if you're a Christian you're a hypocrite, and if you're an evangelical, you're an idiot besides. <br><br>Maybe I'm applying some of my own extra special scorn here and maybe I'm seeing something that isn't there. But what I'm sensing in the "rescuers" is a racism of low expectations. That is, as a Caucasian born and raised in North America, you're fully expected to have left behind religion. To the "rescuer" there's no possible excuse for a highly educated white man who's been afforded all the resources and privileges of my race to cling to such patently obvious nonsense. NO excuse.<br><br>But, for the non-white from a distant land, it's different, there's only so much you can expect from those people. And don't tell the "rescuer", as I've tried, that people with a different skin-tone and cultural background are adults just like us and they have a full set of moral and intellectual faculties. You may as well be speaking in an obscure Martian dialect. No, the "rescuer" isn't having it particularly when their self-image and social position and career are dependent on it not being so.<br><br><a href=#c5586635250862436974 title="comment permalink">4/15/16, 8:50 AM</a><br><br>

U.S Secretaries of State go there with high-powered delegations to move the - ahem - "peace process", all sides profess to want "peace" but "peace" never comes.<br><br>All the parties to the conflict say that American leadership is essential to its resolution. They all say that without American engagement nothing will get done. They sit down with the Americans, pretend to listen to the high-flown rhetoric, pretend to consider the most diligent proposals for compromise, all the while planning the next rub-out. The question is cui bono from this non-resolution?<br><br>Maybe I'm cynical but it looks like this is a made-to-order distraction for various regimes, mainly in that locale. The way I see it, these regimes should fervently wish for Israel's continued existence. They should ask themselves every morning as they sit down to tea, what they can do to help Israel. In their innermost councils they should conspire to lend Israel aid. Israel is perpetrating outrages? They should thank Allah. It makes the lives of regime leaders immeasurably easier. <br><br>While Palestinians more than adequately fulfilled their role as Victims, Israel is that indispensable country, the perfect Persecutor, that wonderful excuse, the alibi that flies its blue and white flag on hill-tops in infuriating mockery. <br><br>Official corruption? Bureaucratic incompetence? Water supply? Sewage disposal? Sorry, but it's the legacy of Western colonialism and imperialist American meddling and especially dastardly Israeli subterfuge. <br><br>And, to make it clear, the aforesaid issues are important but attention has to be first on the plight of Palestinian brothers and sisters. If you want to make substantive change, if you want to defend the pious Muslim against the perfidious Jew, do what the Koran says, go wage jihad (but do it over there).<br><br>A hazardous game to be sure because "blow-back" isn't something that just blows back on the United States. In the meantime, kleptocratic oligarchs, running their various rackets, stay fat and happy. <br><br>Lately though, with ISIS so prominent nowadays, we're hearing less and less about Palestine.

Couple of ideas from NW Europe, back to you. Globalist consumerism was imposed on Europe after WWII. It was only possible because that great de-fanging of European nations after the war. Roots of tribalism and that bastard offspring of media-inflated tribalism, nationalism, have so much deeper roots here. They go deeper than any particular constitution or form of governance. As EU has drifted from crisis to crisis, grass roots support for globalist thinking, sharing and caring has started to worn at fast pace. <br><br>Couple of years ago I introduced to this blog the idea that tentative stirrings in subcultures of European working classes had experienced dramatic shift. Leftism was cast out then. Social democracy has had huge impact on Western Europe and Scandinavia especially. It was force majeur for many decades in our politics. Society shaped by that ideology is probably utterly alien from your North American point of view. Coming of globalism changed vows of fealty that were foundation of this system completely. Class-based voting, totally normative in my own childhood, did not anymore produce loyalty from those elected into power for their support base, as had been case before. As gaze of political class was averted into Brave New World without boundaries or old morality, their base of support started to erode.<br><br>In recent decades, various identity groups based on ferociously local feelings of sameness and belonging have slowly replaced older, already brittle Leftist loyalties felt towards trade unions, party and the class that shaped so much of my own working class childhood. From new loyalties, one felt towards local football outfits has been probably most ferocious, most manly, among native Europeans. It has defined borders between Us and Them, shattered working class hoods into mosaic of feudal local loyalties. Amongst Muslim newcomers same role has been assigned to massive religious revival movement, both Sunni and Shiite, which is actually much deeper and stronger than it's most violent manifestations.<br><br>Long before Paris attacks claiming rebirth of religious war in Europe, I had wrote to comment section of your blog that then current football riots in France showed us that France is heading into the deep end of troubles. Nationalist and religious undercurrents visible in those riots were so blatant. Of course mainstream media, made by and for upper classes, missed that moment's crucial meaning. Because they have hermetically sealed themselves off from working class cultures of all ethnicities, they just did not see the writing in the wall. Now this grass roots forging of new identities has abandoned all pretensions that they share any mutual understanding with bureaucratic nomenklatura or political correctness of "salary class". Abandonment is total, amongst native and immigrant working classes both. Lets look at Belgium, which has been in news lately. In Molenbeek, nobody recognizes authority of police forces. Niqba is new national costume there. Nobody living in heartlands of FC Brugge football firm supporters anymore trusts official truths, or recognizes apparatus of governance as their own. Their abandonment of official apparatus is not as total as in other side, but resentment runs pretty deep. <br><br>Whole globalist dream of non-nationalist Europe has withered among it's economically lower classes. It lives only, and I really mean only, in affluent "salary class" neighborhoods. I have never witnessed before such a contradiction within people nominally belonging to same nation. At the level of narratives, stories about the world, nothing is shared anymore. This is new situation here in Europe, even if has been business as usual in your side of the Atlantic. Rise of political parties based on identity politics in inevitable, in all sides involved. Old political system will wither and dissapear in one generation.<br><br><a href=#c4673751335907590784 title="comment permalink">4/15/16, 12:44 PM</a><br><br>

Happy end...<br><br>The same case was the rest of "Liberation/Humanitarian" campaigns as those of Kosovo in 1999 (the butchers was the serbians), the two Irak campaigns, the Vietnam campaign, The Great Afghan War Of Liberation Against The Evil Empire Waged By The Freedom Fighters (1979 - 1988), the syrian campaign (2011 - ?), the Yemen campaign (2015-?), the nicaraguan (Contra) campaign, the Drone campaign, etc...<br><br>Because this is the big battle between the Good and the Evil to make the world a better place for our children<br><br><br><a href=#c788447222175249055 title="comment permalink">4/15/16, 1:32 PM</a><br><br>

Such thoughts seemingly never enter the minds of most Americans; I’ll leave it to you to figure out why.</i><br><br>Thus the game is (or perpetually threatens to become) not only fractal but also reflexive. Assuming you're not planning to Rescue these underclass Victims from the Persecution of the habitual Rescuers, the question of how to evade or escape the Game, especially while addressing actual lower-case persecution, becomes paramount.<br><br>This week's post speaks to me a great deal, and relates to some of the hardest-won lessons of my own life, which are about that exact question. I'll sum it up in way too few words:<br><br>Upon finding yourself in the role of Persecutor, the escape is to repent. Stop doing the persecuting thing. Do so quietly, or else you'll be recruited or caricatured, with or without your actual participation, as a Rescuer convert.<br><br>Upon finding yourself in the role of Victim, there are many dangerous options to choose from (having limited options being part of the definition of victim-hood), of which the best is usually, subvert subvert subvert. That's the path least likely to be exploited by would-be Rescuers or thrown back in your face later as a Persecutor badge. I think a good case could be made that black Americans were making strides in subverting the systems of oppression in the U.S. before the Rescuer narrative took over.<br><br>Upon finding yourself in the role of Rescuer, the escape is to forgive. This is a challenge, when outrage seems more justified in the face of genuine wrongs. It's easy to mistake forgiving for condoning or tolerating. But it breaks the game like nothing else. (Accordingly, a common aspect of the standard Game is that avid self-interested Rescuers will disregard or condemn any forgiveness offered by the Victims, protecting the Game.)<br><br>Hmm, what kind of narrative might be built around the game-breaking ideas of repentance, forgiveness, and subversion? Especially if it disguised subversion as submission…?<br><br>Of course, any such narrative would struggle for traction in an era when the Game has become all-consuming.<br><br><a href=#c9056938328053075992 title="comment permalink">4/15/16, 2:46 PM</a><br><br>

After all, the end of white privilege does not mean that peace suddenly breaks out and we all join hands and sing Kumbaya, nor does it mean the end of privilege and hegemony as a socio-political phenomenon. <br><br>It simply means that privilege and hegemony transfer to other groups. We can see this in the Pacific Rim, with the decline of the American empire and the resurgence of China, allied with Russia and Iran. The balance of power is already shifting, and will no doubt shift again as China falls prey to the cycle of imperial overstretch decades or centuries from now.<br><br>Likewise, we can see the early stages of an Islamic Volkerwanderung in Europe, while people in Mexico and the Southwestern US are already openly talking about the "Reconquista" of Aztlan.<br><br>As someone pointed out, it is true that the history books are written by the victors. But sooner or later, those victors are displaced by another group of victors who take their place and the cycle begins again, as ibn Khaldun, Spengler and Toynbee have all noted.<br><br>I know this is an unpleasant truth for a lot of people, especially those who fancy themselves as progressives, but its how the real world works. Humans are tribal animals by nature and always have been.<br><br>In a multi-ethnic society, some groups will tend to do better than others for any number of reasons, which are not necessarily related to race or skin color, and this often becomes a source of resentment and conflict. Equality has never existed in the real world and I doubt that it ever will. Even supposedly egalitarian hunter-gatherer bands tend to be dominated by a small group of tribal elders and we know from history that in the absence of some outside power imposing peace, tribal cultures often fight one another for territory and resources, frequently in ways that are quite brutal.<br><br>I for one have absolutely no interest in joining the "check your privilege and then give yourself forty lashes with the cat o'nine tails for the crime of having been born white" brigade. <br><br>I never have been able to comprehend the self-loathing mindset and the propensity for self-induced guilt-tripping that so many middle class white liberals seem to have. Every group of people, whites included, has done some pretty awful things. But why should I beat myself up because of the bad things that some people who happen to have a similar skin tone to mine have done in the past?<br><br><a href=#c28124018274168744 title="comment permalink">4/15/16, 3:44 PM</a><br><br>

I find it oddly gratifying that it was actually lain out in one of these 1960's cold war psych studies. I find those fascinating; hilarious and diabolical at the same time. <br><br>I haven't had time to read all of the comments yet, so apologies if I'm reiterating what someone else has already pointed out.<br><br>I've come to think it is an iteration of something inherent in our human psyche in interpersonal interactions. Certainly not exclusively American, or even exclusive to macro national group dynamics. I've noticed this &amp; very similar dynamics in all levels and facets of human interaction. In families, in school cliques, church and social groups etc. It was blatantly on display in the latest Dem debates (I saw last night) - in exactly the iteration you describe. It seems we NEED an "other" a 'bad' person or group, a perpetrator. Yes the Rescuers, those at the top, in authority benefit vastly from continuing the game, but for some reason we all WANT to buy into it. It's an easy narrative to get behind, however false.<br><br>The first time I saw this with clarity was when I was about 11. My sister and I were raised by my Grandparents. There was always 1 good kid and one bad kid. We could never both be good at the same time, one was always 'in trouble', had done something unforgivably wrong. It was usually me, but at the infrequent times I had done something noticeably 'good' and was the good kid, my sister had to step into the role of 'bad kid'. My Grandma simply couldn't be happy or proud of both of us at the same time. It was a hellish dynamic to live in. At one point in some family fight, my uncle complained of the same treatment of himself and my father when they were growing up. That's when it clicked and became clear to me.<br><br> I see this in my school in the teacher/student dynamics - It doesn't seem enough to praise a kid without comparing them to some other 'bad' kid. I've even felt it myself. Yesterday, I gave 2 gold coins, (tokens of good behavior), to the afternoon class. I know my congratulations speech to them was very odd and stilted as I was battling in my mind as I gave it. I kept thinking of comparing them to the awful morning class we's just had, but I didn't want to as that's just not fair on the morning class and only serves to divide the kids from their friends in that other class; mostly it doesn't allow the morning class room to improve into the good behavior. It just labels them as 'bad' which is a terrible teaching tool!! It's a cheap, lazy trick to boost one side up by tearing the other side down. Yet it was definitely in my mind. I've seen a fellow teacher harangue a small group of silly noisy boys for misbehaving, not because it disrupts her, or cuts their own learning time, but because "You're ruining it for everyone else". In fact, they're not, everyone else is doing fine - WHY did that teacher have to plead the case for some fictional other 'victim'?<br><br>I know this is not specifically the Rescue Game, but I do suspect the Rescue Game stems from this cheap lazy thinking. I've thought since I was a young adult, that the nations of the world will never come together until we are invaded by hostile aliens - we need someone to fight and hate. <br><br>I guess the best we can do is to recognize that when we are feeling it and fight against it, as I tried to do in my stilted, congratulatory speech to my afternoon class. "Y'all are great!" is enough. "Y'all are great because 'they' are terrible" is destructive to both groups in the long run. And sooner or later those kids too will see through the cheap lazy thinking that we teachers are manipulating them, not helping them, so ultimately it undermines us too.<br><br>Thanks again. :)<br><br><a href=#c4474065598372127011 title="comment permalink">4/15/16, 5:45 PM</a><br><br>

I'd encourage you to pursue that line of reasoning, and work up the result into an essay. <br><br>MigrantWorker, fair enough. Of course that's the whole point of a dysfunctional game -- it exists to shut off constructive options that, for one reason or another, aren't acceptable to those who make the rules. <br><br>Rebecca, that's the story of our time in a nutshell -- the process by which the privileged convinced themselves that they owe nothing to anyone else, and set themselves up for the inevitable (and inevitably violent) reaction. Oswald Spengler would have laughed, and reached for the popcorn. As for relocation, presumably you have to go where your wife can find work; I'd simply encourage you not to wait too long. <br><br>Phil, I did indeed. I wonder what all those climate activists who drive SUVs and live high-carbon lifestyles are going to say when their favorite vacation hotels in Puerto Vallarta et al. are flooded by rising seas! As for the Rescue Game, well, I don't know the British scene well enough to be able to say whether that's in common use there or not. There are many potential games; the Rescue Game is simply the one that's most commonly used to stop social change in its tracks here in the US. <br><br>Shane, I know. Yesterday I was hanging out at the laundromat -- our sewer pipes are too creaky to handle a washer here at home, so that's a weekly chore for me -- and the usual multiracial crowd was shooting the breeze as the dryers turned. A minor local crime wave was the topic du jour. Care to guess who was using the sort of lock-'em-up rhetoric that is supposedly the province of wage class white folk? An African-American guy. Kunstler needs to get out more; I'm sure he could find a local laundromat if he tried. <br><br>Alex, excellent! You've earned tonight's gold star by pointing out the thing that next to nobody wants to talk about -- social change begins by <i>changing your own actions</i>, not by waiting for a superhero or by shouting denunciations at someone else. Thank you; it's a point that deserves repeated underlining. <br><br>Scotlyn, certainly love is one of the ways out of the trap. I think, though, that wisdom is another. It's also possible to look at the game, see it as a waste of time for all concerned, and walk away. That was certainly my motive.<br><br>Donalfagan, of course, but it would have taken a lot more than one post to cover the whole range of TA insights relevant to this subject!<br><br>Patricia, I may well have misunderstood your comment! Never having lived in Japan, of course, I have no sense of how things might play out there; one way or another, though, that many people on an island chain that can only support a small fraction of them without petrochemicals and global trade, heavily committed to the survival of a dying hegemonic power and caught in a rising spiral of suspicion and hostility with the rising power nearby...this is not going to end well. <br><br>David, thanks for that. Fascinating to see Trump coming right out and talking about the class issue. I suppose it's just possible that someone in his staff read a copy of <a href=../../2016/01/donald-trump-and-politics-of-resentment.html rel=nofollow>Donald Trump and the Politics of Resentment</a>...<br><br>Friction Shift, I won't argue at all. <i>The Long Emergency</i> was a hugely important book -- one of the two books (the other was Richard Heinberg's <i>The Party's Over</i>) that convinced me that the long winter of the Reagan era was finally over and it was once again possible to discuss resource depletion and the end of the industrial age in public. That's why I've stopped reading his blog; it's too depressing to see someone who made such an impressive and iconoclastic impact sinking into a swamp of class-and-ethnicity stereotypes. <br><br>Roger, okay, that's about what I expected.

Now watch the privileged players demand two extra queens, in the interest of "fairness"!<br><br>Roger, true enough. One of the things that makes current discourse about Israel so toxic is that everyone, on all sides, seems fanatically committed to seeing every issue connected to that discourse in the most extreme Rescue Game terms. It's typical that the one death threat I've ever fielded in connection with this blog came when I published a post <a href=../../2012/11/in-twilight-of-empires.html rel=nofollow>discussing the future of Israel</a> that sidestepped the whole "who did what to whom" rhetoric. <br><br>Perl Hacker, just don't let that kind of thinking become an excuse to keep stomping on the fingers of those below you on the ladder who are trying to follow your advice and rescue themselves. <br><br>Shane, yep.

Kick a dog often enough and it'll learn to bite. <br><br>Juhana, thanks for this. Your comments helped me see something that I hadn't quite grasped before, about what it means that the process of warband formation is so far advanced in Europe, compared to the situation here. I'll be doing a post on that down the road a bit, because it casts a great deal of light on the future of Europe. The very short form? Warband formation normally takes place in border zones, not in the core areas of an imperial state -- and what that stresses is that Europe these days is peripheral, not central: it's one of the borderlands on the fringes of the American empire, and can expect a borderland's experiences as we go forward. More on this in due time! <br><br>111DFC, exactly. The US in particular is utterly addicted to the Rescue Game in its foreign policy, which is why US foreign policy always perpetuates the crises it's supposed to solve. After all, one of the rules of the Rescue Game is that the game must go on forever. <br><br>Myriad, brilliant. That is to say, in Spengler's language, one of the benefits of the Second Religiosity is that it provides a way out of the Rescue Game.<br><br><a href=#c7303404245386424806 title="comment permalink">4/15/16, 7:24 PM</a><br><br>

They couldn't care less about white privilege, because they've got class privilege; they're perfectly willing to admit a small number of people of color into the ranks of the affluent salary class (cough, cough, Barack Obama, cough, cough) so long as the newcomers share their values and support their approved policies. Thus they're perfectly willing to bemoan their whiteness at the top of their lungs, or buy one of Rachel Dolezal's used wigs, or what have you -- but if you even breathe a hint that their class privilege might be an issue, you can expect instant and furious pushback. <br><br>I really do need to do a post on that, don't I? Among other things, in the circles where Druids abound, there's a useful term for the habit of distracting attention from one's own privilege by demanding that everyone pay attention to some other issue: it's called "Starhawking." I'll explain why in next week's post. <br><br>Caryn, if you have the chance, you might want to read Eric Berne's <i>Games People Play</i>. The game you've described your grandparents engaging in is called, if I remember correctly, "Bad Child," and it's a very common and very destructive one.

I'd like to see a solid page of your book recommendations.<br><br>I am very pleased to see someone else describe the conflation of injustice, privilege, and prejudice in the word "racism." It's something of a personal bugbear. I am more supportive of the current SJ left than many of the commenters here (e.g. I think trigger warnings are a pretty good idea, though not very high-priority), but I cannot stand how some of them will switch meanings in the middle of a train of thought without even noticing. The same is true of "sexism" and the rest. I would add that "racism" is also used to mean the belief that there are real biologically distinct races, which does not necessarily imply prejudice or support for unjust policies. This is more of a problem with the word "sexism," since there are actual differences between the sexes, whereas the evidence for racial differences is overall not that convincing, but in either case the bad logic is frightening. Often people use the term "privilege" in a similar way, jumping between meanings without being careful not to carry over the implications of the one meaning to the other.<br><br>It's good to see that the new anthology is out!

A specific example I'm thinking of is that white supremacicist ideologies came to the forefront during the era of western global dominance that is currently in its last phase. Ethnic conflicts are part of human nature and will undoubtedly continue, but I think the days are numbered for the modern western concept of race that white supremecy is based on. The question is whether it will fizzle or go out with a bang. White supremacist ideologies won't lead to many allies among nonwhite people/nations, and in fact will tend to unite their enemies against them. Once the global balance of power shifts, a race war of whites vs everyone else on any significant scale would likely lead to loss for the whites.<br><br>Most white Americans who claim to be fighting racism won't listen to that argument at all because it doesn't fit into their rescue game, they are as attached to their own power and privilege as the overt racists are.<br><br><a href=#c6220451622252826093 title="comment permalink">4/15/16, 9:01 PM</a><br><br>

Many thanks. <br><br>Aias, exactly. The current use of terms like "racism," especially when combined with the "is of identity," are great examples of the kind of sloppy thinking against which Korzybski contended in vain. Privilege is not the same thing as prejudice, and prejudice is not the same thing as acts of injustice; all three are problematic, but they're problematic in different ways, and responsibility for them lies in drastically different quarters. More on this next week. <br><br>Ozark, bingo. We'll get into that in detail shortly. <br><br>Glenn, well, yes. Quite some time ago -- in the early 1990s, when I was dipping a first tentative toe into the Neopagan scene, after well over a decade of solitary practice in the Golden Dawn tradition -- I penned a little satirical essay titled <a href=http://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/humor/moondrip.html rel=nofollow>Lady Pixie Moondrip's Guide to Craft Names</a>, which got uploaded without my name on it to the newborn Web (and which three or four people, last I heard, have claimed as their own work).

The same is true of elites. The Rescue Game isn't new, not by a long shot -- and in fact, it's because the elites have gotten senile that it's being played so clumsily and reflexively now, and it's thus become so easy to point out what's going on. <br><br>Patricia, why, yes -- due to an incident at a Pantheacon a little while back, though it wasn't the first example of the kind. <br><br>Prizm, the advantage the Russians and their allies have is that they know how to play more than one game, and we don't. Beltway pundits here are still babbling incoherently because the Russians didn't play the Rescue Game (aka "Quagmire") in Syria -- they went in, decisively changed the balance of power, and then sent most of their people home. It wasn't even a matter of hacking the game; we were playing checkers, and they brought in chess pieces, made chess moves, and brushed our checkers right off the board. <br><br>Bootstrapper, that's always an option, especially when exposing the game as a game isn't likely to work. <br><br>Hubertus, there I disagree.

It was a kind of metaphor of the sinking spanish empire fo that time<br><br>The russian novel, the italian or spanish films, or even the ancient Greek Attic Tragedy always revolve around the "losers", is a very different way to build the ethics of the Hero, which has a human nature, with ligths and shadows<br><br>Evidently I am talking about the american mass culture, not of the large amount of very good american writters with a totally different approach to this narrative, but anyway the mass culture in the countries show a lot of interesting things about the culture of the societies<br><br>So I think some cultures are more prone to play the Rescue Game than others, because to play the game to the end you must believe in the inherent Absolute Depravity of the Men, and the existence of The Justs (Saints) and The Doomed decided by God from the beginning of the Time (as Luther and Calvin teach)<br><br>Anyway this all is falling apart now, and even Trump cannot stop it (his "Makes American Great Again" is a continuous calling to be again "winners" as he say in every speech)<br><br><br><br><a href=#c6765114015563156458 title="comment permalink">4/16/16, 3:04 AM</a><br><br>

The funny thing is that it is my understanding that at the time of the McCarthy hearings few if anyone down here actually cared about such labels. It just wasn't that big a deal with the general populace. Even today, I can walk around in Melbourne and spot lampposts with "Marxism today" and/or "Marxism 2016 conference" posters (the last conference clearly worked out so well!). They always make me laugh because I seem to recall that that system has been tried in the flesh and it didn't work out so well. It is interesting that they use the label "Marxism" to somewhat differentiate themselves... ;-)!<br><br>No doubt that you are correct in that assessment. Matters both small and large tend to usually escalate slowly, but surely. Edges and mettle are tested and weak points are exploited mercilessly.<br><br>They keep telling me that inflation is dead - or that we are in a "sustained" period of deflation. Yet, today I noticed that the dog food biscuits which used to be $5.30 for 1kg (that is AU$0.53 per 100g or 3.5oz) and today, the box size has reduced to 800g and now costs $5.00 (that is AU$0.625 per 100g or 3.5oz). I smell a rat. Give a person a KPI (key performance indicator) and sooner or later they will game it. Incidentally, that is an impressive increase to their sales revenue if units sold remain at the same volumes. Dogs care not a whit and are very unlikely to be fooled on such important matters as their dinner!<br><br>Fortunately for me, I make my own dog biscuits nowadays. Along with the decline in quality of goods this is our future, I reckon anyway. I'll write about this - and strategies to adapt to it - on the next blog Monday night. The whole thing just annoys me as I rather suspect that the powers that be have a rather low opinion of our collective intelligence. As an interesting side note, I've read that sociopaths often believe that they are smarter than everyone else, even when such beliefs are counter to their interests.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c3714027835562535399 title="comment permalink">4/16/16, 3:48 AM</a><br><br>

Because Japan defeated Russia early in the 20th century, a military clique gained power over the idealistic, modernizing nation, and took steps to consolidate its dominance. Their rhetoric about a "co-prosperity sphere" meant "rescuing" China and other Asian countries from western colonizers. They considered Japan specially gifted and uniquely able to help their neighbors, regardless of whether or not they wanted it. Dissidents, of course, arose, and to maintain power, the ruling clique established a secret police and began persecuting anyone who disagreed about going to war. One of the generals involved had visited America and knew that going up against this major industrial powerhouse would be suicide, but he had no way of convincing the clique of this. Their dispirited soldiers fighting under unrealistic demands all the while being told that they must maintain a "winning attitude" committed a lot of atrocities.<br><br>Japan didn't have drones, though they tried one or two tricks with balloons. Instead, they traumatized an entire generation in a last ditch attempt to stave off an invasion by what they all had been told were barbarians.<br><br>Having said that though, the path to ponerization of a self-sacrificing, peace-loving people like the Japanese is simple. Victims do not stick up for themselves, and that empowers abusers. Other people become afraid that they too will be abused and have no recourse, so they fall in line and join the abuser. Ostracism is one major tool resorted to in trying to avoid this. Confucianism also provides social stability, which discourages people from trying to accrue unearned power. But you can see how in the end, it all worked out just about the same in these vastly different cultures.<br><br><a href=#c4922704068098109079 title="comment permalink">4/16/16, 8:31 AM</a><br><br>

IMO it's just another diversionary tactic to obscure advantages they've been able to extract for themselves. <br><br>In any case, in their own opinions, this "self-loathing" puts liberals on a higher moral plane and moral superiority is a big part of what middle-class white liberals are all about. It's taken decades of refinement in institutions of higher learning and elsewhere but they've made talking down to people a high art. And this very public self-flogging gives liberals licence to flog you. <br><br>And nobody does the sneer better than them. Just watch Ruth Marcus and Eleanor Clift. If there was ever an Olympic sneering event, these two would get gold and silver. <br><br>It's a sneaky game liberals play with a lot of careful word-smithing. "Globalization" they call it, as if off-shoring tens of thousands of factories and millions of good paying jobs was the result of an implacable force of nature, like plate tectonics, instead of the result of deliberate trade policy.<br><br>As JMG has pointed out, those guilt-seeking white liberals benefit handsomely from lower product prices as goods flood in from China. And, as beneficiaries of central bank monetary debasement - living in coastal cities with mind-blowing real estate prices - these members of the managerial and administrative and self-declared "creative class" fully earned all they've got, at least in their own minds. <br><br>As for the now destitute inhabitants of blighted, former industrial cities, well, what can you say. Not much you CAN say, can you? Those tattooed morons had it coming, didn't they? They failed to keep up with the times, chose deliberate ignorance, opted for drugs and sloth and bad living habits. Their condition is all their own fault, every bit of it, at least in the most astute and enlightened opinion, that opinion being liberal, of course. <br><br>There's another aspect to "self-loathing", at least of the public sort. This comes from people that are utterly confident of their position on the societal pyramid. They think that maybe they can be scratched and dented but never brought down low. Maybe they should reconsider. Nobody is invulnerable.<br><br><a href=#c5101120563490751638 title="comment permalink">4/16/16, 8:35 AM</a><br><br>

A disproportionate share of the very expensive therapy and psychiatric medication seems to be consumed by upper middle class professionals, and not by those on the street with PTSD, the ones more likely to experience violence, or the ones talking to themselves without a cell phone. It is much easier for those who have really good benefits or other resources to indulge in endless therapy that never seems to lead to a practical result for "issues" most people in the world would be glad to have, than the less compensated. It is curious to me that so many people I have met who are further up the food chain can claim a kind of victimhood while perhaps being the rescuer in another part of their lives.

Maybe a greater variety of perspectives will be more useful than pathological.<br><br><a href=#c5559225182983478213 title="comment permalink">4/16/16, 10:17 AM</a><br><br>

HydroQuebec/Eversource is coming to the ‘rescue’ with ‘sustainable’ power generation. ‘Persecutors’ can take the form of its opponents who don’t like the idea of ten story power lines marching across the landscape and are trying to get either get Eversource to bury the lines or just not build it. So the ‘victims’ accuse the ‘persecutors’ of trying to leave New Hampshire in the dark or with sky high electrical rates. Or, on the other hand, ‘victims’ can be the locals who don’t want to see huge power lines defacing the landscape and the ‘persecutors’ are the ones trying to ram an unwanted project down their throats. <br><br>We got a brief but revealing glimpse behind the scenes over these past few weeks when a developer received a $2 million ‘loan’ from our ‘rescuers’ Eversource, and immediately began twisting arms at the North Country Chamber of Commerce and got them to change their stance from opposed to neutral. Opponents on the board were naturally portrayed as troublemakers by the developer and the board members (two of whom resigned in protest) fingered the developer as a persecutor. Who’s the victim?

One point not covered is when a person cast in the role of the Persecutor actually isn't. One example: if your skin is white, you MUST BE a racist according to a certain class of Rescuer. You can't repent of being the race that you are. But if you stay white, regardless of your personal activities, you stay stuck firmly in the Persecutor class in one form of this game. <br><br>Just to turn about: another class of Rescuer believes that if your skin is black, you MUST BE a thug; there is no other possibility. Therefore this Rescuer needs to keep rescuing white Victims (ie Law and Order), and absolutely no facts on the ground will prove to him/her that a black person is not a Persecutor. <br><br>Truly in many forms of this game, it is the Rescuers who are actually committing the evils against both Victim and Persecutor. Look for the real power: it is the Rescuers.<br><br><a href=#c4040738268248112793 title="comment permalink">4/16/16, 1:45 PM</a><br><br>

Back in the '90s, I worked for a large company that tried to take diversity seriously. I was part of a group that was about 75% white males over 45. The remainder were almost entirely young white women, but there were a few men and women who identified as African-American in the mix. The diversity trainers were always African-American women, so at least they got a job out of the deal. <br><br>I always kept quiet during training, although an occasional curmudgeon would ask "why don't we want to hire the best people for the job?" and no one ever challenged him about why he felt that white men were always going to be the best candidates.<br><br>As far as games go, I would like to propose the following game:<br><br>How close is your job to the "primary economy"? (as defined by JMG, which is the actual natural processes which create something useful to humans)<br><br>I'm going to suggest (please come up with something better, readers) that the closest possible human job is breast-feeding an infant.

In 1974 while in High School, I managed to break the rules of this game without understanding what I was doing; My High School had a student group that called itself the "Society Of Soul (SOS)." They met after school just like the other student groups, and periodically would issue public statements complaining about being ignored or oppressed because of racial bias. I had read the book, "Black Like Me," and wanting to learn more first hand, I joined the group by just showing up to their after-school meeting one week. To their credit, the SOS let me join, but the third time I showed up for the meeting I was the only one there. I was told by the faculty sponsor that they decided to meet at homes, not in the high school. After that, some of the SOS members would dodge me in the halls, and some continued to say "hello." A few of the members and I got to know each other a bit. For we few, there seemed to be fear of friendship on both sides, but willingness to try. It was interesting. Some of my other friends explained to each other that I had joined SOS 'to show their hypocrisy,' ie., that they complained about being excluded but ended up excluding me. When I tried to tell them that wasn't why I joined, they did not believe me.<br>At the end of the school year, I posed with the other SOS members for the club picture. I actually think we SOS members did pretty well overall, and I can see now how difficult it is to break out of the 'Rescue Game.' The players keep trying to press you back into a role.<br><br><a href=#c6697136899284130125 title="comment permalink">4/17/16, 1:21 AM</a><br><br>

You had to cope with being rejected completely by the only social group available to you, hearing them express contempt for personal characteristics you could do nothing about, while the adults in authority told you it was your own fault and there was something entirely different wrong with you.

No physical harassment, and the adults did not attack me; they just ignored what was going on. I suppose an eleven year old girl can get more mental distance from her situation than a seven year old.

The problem with words like "racism" in contemporary discourse is that they presuppose that privilege, prejudice, and acts of injustice are all a package deal, and anyone who benefits from privilege must by definition be prejudiced and engage in acts of injustice, which simply isn't true -- and equally, it allows those who aren't engaged in acts of injustice to claim that they don't benefit from privilege, which again simply isn't true. <br><br>111DFC, that's fascinating -- many thanks! You're right, of course, that the good vs. evil dynamic is hardwired into American culture by way of its religious roots, partly in Predestinationism but also more generally in the whole range of Protestant theology. <br><br>Cherokee, ah, yes -- stealth inflation. That's a major issue here also, where product debasement and decreasing package size combine with gimmicked statistics to try to hide the fact that it's getting harder and harder for most Americans to make ends meet.<br><br>Tidlösa, well, I wrote it after my first sustained contact with the Neopagan scene, so it does have a certain verisimilitude...<br><br>Patricia, as you may have noticed, neither "Grey" nor "Badger" appear in Lady Pixie's list -- nor, for that matter, in the expanded list for evil types provided by <a href=http://www.deepgenre.com/wordpress/craft/lord-ooky-hellwrought%E2%80%99s-sixteen-unspeakable-utterances/%22 rel=nofollow>Lord Ooky Hellwrought</a>.

It's usually when something like that gets taken over by the already privileged, and used as another tool to wedge themselves into positions of influence, that any remaining positive potential is lost. As for your proposed hierarchy, nice -- might you consider writing an SF story for the current Space Bats contest, with a society along those lines as the setting? <br><br>Dennis, all of us are involuntary participants in any number of Rescue Games. You've certainly named a couple. I hope, though, that when coyotes try to raid the chicken coop, you actually do something to protect them, rather than just giving them an opportunity to express their pain and grief! <br><br>Doctor W., that seems like a reasonable supposition. If Clinton wins, we may still get four more years on the tail end of the Reagan era -- her policies don't deviate an iota from the elite consensus of that era, after all. <br><br>Rita, I still hear the term from time to time. I first noticed her use of that tactic in an essay in a collection I reviewed some years ago, and have heard plenty of stories since that time. <br><br>Emmanuel, yeah, that's got to have been a harrowing experience. Unintentionally breaking the rules of a major social game will do that! <br><br>Pseudorandom, now's the time to start selling shares in a company to locate and sell previously undiscovered lithium mines! Give yourself a million dollar a year salary out of the inflow of venture capital, and ride that baby until the bottom drops out; if you've got enough of your take stashed offshore, you'll be fine. Ah, the wonders of modern capitalism!<br><br>Martin, I don't know -- Acirfahtuos makes me think of <i>acier fatueux</i>, "fatuous steel," which is at least a colorful image. <br><br>Batalos, in my experience, at least, affluent people of color in the US haven't really gotten deeply into the Rescue Game yet. We'll see what happens in the longer run. <br><br>Gottfried, the key is to remember the difference between the game and the real world. If you get assigned the role of Persecutor, walk away -- don't engage the Victims and Rescuers if you can possibly avoid it, no matter how desperately they try to get you to play your assigned role. If you get assigned any other role, do the same thing: don't play. Meanwhile, any time you catch yourself thinking of yourself or anyone else as "a victim deserving a rescuer," or falling into the mindspace of the game in some other way, stop and reframe the issue in some way that violates the rules of the game. Nietzsche is a good name to invoke here; his relentless questioning of the motivations behind moral beliefs is a useful tool for getting out from under dysfunctional games like the Rescue Game.<br><br><a href=#c4662301629886512865 title="comment permalink">4/17/16, 10:23 PM</a><br><br>

Macron is claiming the abandoned center of the political spectrum; my guess is that he won't amalgamate the parties, he'll simply strip them of large portions of their current support in the process of building a mass movement, which may well put him into power -- constitutionally or otherwise. <br><br>Breanna, that's good. Now reimagine the same joke with an affluent white liberal, a poor person of color, and a white working class guy; the liberal scoops the cookies and then says to the person of color, "that racist cracker is trying to steal your cookie." It works just as well that way!<br><br>Sojan, well, Ladty Pixie's guide was based on direct personal experience. I knew a lot of people in the Pagan scene with really silly names. As for your second comment, er, I've basically stopped interacting with the Neopagan mainstream precisely because I got tired of being treated as a second-class citizen, since I'm a Druid rather than a practitioner of eclectic Wicca. It's rather as though a bunch of Christians insisted that Jews didn't really need their own congregations -- after all, they can just come on down to church and praise Jesus...<br><br>Derv, one of the big frustrations of these contests is that there are way too many good stories, and I can only take a certain number of them! <br><br>Marin, that's a great example of the way the Rescue Game narrative is used to distort experience. Of course that happened -- but it's inadmissible, because Victims are always and only Victims, and only Persecutors are supposed to Persecute. <br><br>Onething, the British used just about every trick you can think of to stir up those rivalries. Why was it advantageous to them? Well, if you want to keep an empire, isn't it helpful if the local people are so busy hating each other they never get around to uniting to rebel against your imperial rule? <br><br>Nancy, excellent.

In other words, it disproportionately benefits the more privileged globally, rather than those it was intended to help back in 1950’s Europe. <br><br>I’m trying to put forward a compromise position that could be politically acceptable. It starts from the premise that the needs of current residents of a country should form the basis for setting and implementing limits on migration. If taken seriously, that ‘should’ create political space for an open discussion of who benefits and who loses, and in what way, from various forms of migration. <br><br>It would include, for example, people’s need for decent pay and safety from terrorist attacks to be taken into account in migration policy. That would of course breach EU laws but the EU’s existence and membership are moving targets and such international law is far more a matter of politics than law. I’d expect those trends to continue.<br> <br>Then, subject to those limits, I’m saying that refuge should be offered directly first to those most in need of it around the world, not those most able to physically reach a European border – which is the current limit in practice. <br><br>That would cut out the people smugglers, drownings etc. In theory it should also hugely reduce the security risks – because it would focus on people whose real identities and ages can be established (most now destroy their documentation because the system incentivises that) and because, contrary to the Rescue narrative, terrorists are far less likely to be found among that group. I think that flows from the nature of oppression and persecution.<br> <br>This element does involve playing the Oppression Olympics. But it seems to me that there are contexts where it’s appropriate to do that. Providing refuge is more a form of charity for those who can’t really help themselves than it is (or should be) a form of solidarity with people who are better able to take care of themselves. <br><br>Engaging in it is also almost politically necessary because a majority of people from all classes do want to help those fleeing war and persecution so the retention of the spirit of the asylum system is necessary. <br><br>I’m trying to redress the balance for wage class people in a way that can be accepted by enough of the political class to be implemented. From what I hear from wage class people, most want to help genuine refugees but, rightly, don’t trust the current system to do that, and they don’t want to be disproportionately burdened with the costs as they presently are. Some seek a shutdown of the whole rotten system, some a total ban on Muslim immigration etc. <br><br>Whatever about the ethics of those positions, I just don’t think they’re remotely achievable in the present political climate here. I’m uncomfortable about putting forward a position which won’t simply amplify those kinds of demands but which I think has far more chance of succeeding in achieving the outcome they’re looking for, because I know how the political classes work. What do you think? Anyone have thoughts on it? <br><br><br><a href=#c8080330279629827266 title="comment permalink">4/18/16, 3:19 AM</a><br><br>

Yes, I'm white, college educated, and spent about 20 years of my working life in what's generally called a "profession," (though also an equal amount driving nails, turning wrenches, and lifting things) and none of that can be changed.

I'd say it is actually a form of scorched earth tactics that the British reliably applied as a final act of imperial malevolence upon being forced to abandon a former colony. It works by ensuring that the former colony remains permanently crippled by setting up an artificially created political entity within the confines of the former colony and then ignite a conflict that is practically unsolvable, precisely due to said artificial nature. Then the empire withdraws and lets the resulting circus play itself out (though it can perhaps be approved by the persuaded to return in the form of "rescuer" at a later date). Note that Northern Ireland, Pakistan, Israel etc. all came about upon the withdrawal of British influence in those respective regions, and the result has been the same every time. I can readily image that De Valera, as one of the keenest political thinkers in the Sinn Fein suspected what was going on, and opposed Collins so fiercely on the terms of secession because of it.<br><br>Now the U.S. of course shamelessly nicked this strategy for their own imperial toolbox and has been employing it with equally good results, Syria and the Ukraine being the current poster children (JMG, you posted a question a while back if perhaps Obama had some unstated reason to actually not want to defeat Daesh. I'd say this has more than a little to do with it). As such I suggest, when you see this strategy being played out, see it as an admittance of defeat.<br><br><a href=#c4790920611439924833 title="comment permalink">4/19/16, 7:09 AM</a><br><br>

There's an article on the HuffPost that discusses the democrats' trend towards right-wing economic policy over the last 20 years and a commenter (Josh Silverman) stated, "By rallying against the dog-whistle racism, sexism, and homophobia of Republican platforms, they unwittingly divided their own base along those very lines. Instead of a message of solidarity in the face of economic domination, they ran hard on social issues and co-opted or conceeded on economics.

Not for Democracy Spring, although that was interesting to see.<br><br>The way I heard the Rescue Game explained was in terms of interpersonal relationships, so this take moving it up to the 10,000 ft. level was really great. People pick a role: victim, persecutor, rescuer, and then move around in the different roles in their life. For instance, one can feel like the victim at work, then interact with people outside of work as a persecuting people (angry and rude to everyone), and then come home and rescue the family doing everyone's laundry or cleaning. Once a person plays one role in one group, then the other two roles come into play automatically elsewhere in one's life with other groups of people. As it was said to me - "Once you buy the ticket, you take the ride."<br><br>So going back up to the 10,000 ft. view, the groups you named as victims in the media, let's go with African Americans because of the media coverage is so much, can also be seen as persecutors, i.e. Black gangs in neighborhoods, and rescuers, i.e. Black activists, civil rights leaders, the President. African Americans as a group bought the ticket in the Rescue Game so they ride the whole ride around doing all the roles.<br><br>The middle class white people I know also play all the roles. Listening to their whining about life you would think they are the victims. Just not enough time to go to the gym, get kids to all their activities, and go out to dinner on a Saturday night. boo-hoo<br><br><a href=#c2074900301761390214 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 1:25 PM</a><br><br>

Evangelical Christians are tasked with going out and preaching the gospel and encouraging people to be saved by Christ, i.e. rescuers. Evangelicals are one of the markets of Fox news programming. Its interesting to me for years that Fox News targets their message to evangelicals so that they feel like the victims in our country - the war on Christmas, gay wedding cakes, Chick-fil-a under attack, trans people in bathrooms (to name a few). That leaves evangelicals to do the last role on the rescue game, persecutor, because they already bought the ticket to victim and rescuer, and once they bought at least one ticket, they go do the other role(s) too. <br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c2867149385082687951 title="comment permalink">4/20/16, 1:59 PM</a><br><br>
