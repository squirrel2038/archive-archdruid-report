<div class=MsoNormal>
The last couple of weeks in American politics have offered an interesting confirmation of some of the main themes I’ve discussed on this blog. For that matter, those weeks would have come as no surprise to one of the thinkers whose work has guided these essays since this blog started a decade ago, the philosopher of history Oswald Spengler. I can all too readily imagine the hard lines of Spengler’s face creasing in momentary amusement as he contemplates the temporarily divergent fates of those two candidates for the US presidency that, less than a year ago, nearly everyone insisted would be facing one another in the general election:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Bush is in some ways the perfect poster child for the theme I have in mind just now. When he launched his campaign last year, it was a letter-perfect copy of the successful presidential campaigns of the last three decades. He lined up plenty of big-money sponsors; he assembled a team of ghostwriters, spin doctors, and door-to-door salesmen to run his campaign; he had a PR firm design a catchy logo; he practiced spouting the kind of empty rhetoric that sounds meaningful so long as you don’t think about it for two minutes; he took carefully calculated stands on a handful of hot-button topics, mouthed the conventional wisdom on every other issue, and set out to convince the voters that their interests would be harmed just a little bit less by putting him in the White House than by any of the alternatives. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That sort of content-free campaign is what got George Bush I, Bill Clinton, George Bush II, and Barack Obama onto the list of US presidents. What it got Jeb Bush, though, was a string of humiliating defeats. Some have suggested that his tearful exit from the race in the wake of the South Carolina primary was the act of a child who had been promised a nice shiny presidency by his daddy, and then found out that the mean voters wouldn’t give it to him. I think, though, that there was considerably more to it than that. I think that Bush had just realized, to his shock and horror, that the rules of the game had been changed on him without notice, and all those well-informed, well-connected people who had advised him on the route that would take him to the presidency had basically been smoking their shorts. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If anything, though, Hillary Clinton’s campaign offers an even clearer glimpse into the festering heart of the American political process. She did exactly the same things that Jeb did—it’s indicative that the two of them both splashed their first names across their equally banal campaign logos—and she also managed, as he never did, to get the apparatchiks of her party lined up solidly on her side before the campaigning season got under way. By the ordinary rules of US politics, she should have enjoyed a leisurely stroll through the primaries to the Democratic convention while Jeb Bush wrestled with his opponents, and then gone into the general election with plenty of money to spare, saturating the air waves with a deluge of advertisements designed to convince the American people that four years under her leadership would be ever so slightly less disastrous for them than four years under Bush. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This time, though, the rules have changed. Clinton is facing a spirited challenge from party outsider Bernie Sanders, and though she’ll still probably get the nomination—it’s a source of wry amusement that just now, the Democratic Party’s nominating procedure is significantly less democratic than that of the GOP—it’s pretty clear at this point that she’s not going to get it without a fight. Once she does, in turn, instead of facing another bland insider in a tepid race to the center that can easily be clinched by an ad blitz or two, she’ll be up against Donald Trump, whose popularity soars with every petulant denunciation the pundits of the privileged classes fling at him, whose take-no-prisoners style of bare-knuckle campaigning is exactly the sort of challenge that neither Clinton nor her lumbering campaign staff have shown the least ability to handle, and who is prepared to offer the voters something other than the very slightly lesser of two evils. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course Clinton has made things considerably worse for herself by the way she’s approached the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>campaign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She’s got a whopping case of that weird mental blind spot I labeled, in a post <a href=../../2015/06/the-delusion-of-control.html>that appeared here last year</a>, “the delusion of control”—the notion, as pervasive as it is preposterous, that when a member of America’s privileged classes does something, the rest of the cosmos is obliged to respond to that action in a wholly passive, wholly mechanical manner. For a world-class example, watch the way Clinton’s handlers simply look blank each time they find out that most of the American people loathe and distrust their candidate, and try repeatedly to “reintroduce” her, as though they think they can just hit a reset button on the campaign machinery and start all over again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, Clinton’s own attitude during the campaign so far reminds me of nothing so much as<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>what happens when someone puts money into a defective vending machine. She’s fed the thing her quarters and pushed the right button, but the desired product hasn’t dropped to the bottom where she can get it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now she’s jabbing the button over and over again, and in due time she’ll be pounding her fists on the thing and screaming at it because it won’t give her what she’s paid for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I honestly don’t think she’s ever, even for a moment, considered the possibility that the voting public isn’t simply a passive, mechanical mass that will spit up a presidency for her if she just manipulates in in the right way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I doubt it has entered her darkest dream that the American people might just up and decide to cast their votes to further their own interests rather than hers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That analysis seems plausible to me for a variety of reasons, but high among them is the way that Clinton’s supporters among her own class-and-gender subcategory have demanded that all American women back the Clinton campaign. I’m thinking here particularly of Madeleine Albright, who made the news a little while back with a irate public statement insisting that “there’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help other women.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s a common trope among a certain well-paid class of Second Wave feminists. It’s become controversial, and for good reason, among a great many other feminists, particularly in the partly overlapping sets of women of color and women in the wage class. Listen to them, and you’ll hear at some length how they feel about being expected to help rich and influential women like Madeleine Albright pursue their goals, when they know perfectly well the favor won’t be returned in any way that matters. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What, after all, does a Clinton presidency offer the majority of American women, other than whatever vicarious thrill they might get from having a president with a vagina? The economic policies Clinton espouses—the current bipartisan consensus, from which she shows no signs of veering in the slightest—have already brought poverty and misery to millions of American women who don’t happen to share her privileged background and more than ample income.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Her tenure as Secretary of State was marked by exactly the sort of hamfisted interventions in other people’s countries to which Democrats, once upon a time, used to object:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>interventions, please note, that have already been responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths in Syria, Libya, and elsewhere, and may yet—especially if Clinton takes the same attitudes with her into the White House—treat a good many American women to the experience of watching their kids come home in body bags from yet another brutal and pointless Mideast war.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The reaction to Albright’s public tantrum is in many ways as instructive as the tantrum itself. A great many American women simply aren’t buying it. More generally, no matter how furiously Clinton and her flacks hammer on the buttons of the vending machine, trying to elicit the mechanical response they think they ought to be able to expect, the voters aren’t falling into line. Trump and Sanders, each in his own way, have shown too many people that it’s possible to hope for something other than an intolerable state of business as usual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the wake of their candidacies, a great many voters have decided that they’re no longer willing to vote for the lesser of two evils. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/cthulhu-2016-3009f5-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=200 src=../../img/cthulhu-2016-9cf187-g95.jpg width=200></a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s a point of some importance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To my mind, it’s far from accidental that for the last few decades, every presidential election here in the US has been enlivened by bumper stickers calling on voters to support the presidential ambitions of Cthulhu, the tentacled primeval horror out of H.P. Lovecraft’s tales of cosmic dread. I’m sorry to say that the Elder God’s campaign faces a serious constitutional challenge, as he was spawned on the world of Vhoorl in the twenty-third nebula and currently resides in the drowned corpse-city of R’lyeh, and as far as I know neither of these are US territory. Still, his bid for the White House has gotten further than most other imaginary candidacies, and I’ve long thought that the secret behind that success is Cthulhu’s campaign slogan: “Why settle for the lesser evil?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The reason that this slogan reliably elicits laughter, in turn, is that the entire rhetoric of presidential politics in the United States for decades now has fixated on the claim that one party’s pet stooge won’t do anything quite as appalling as the other side’s will, even though they all support the same policies and are bought and sold by the same corrupt interests. Over and over again, we’ve been told that we have to vote for whatever candidate this or that party has retched up, because otherwise the other side will get to nominate a Supreme Court justice or two, or get us into another war, or do something else bad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Any suggestion that a candidate might be expected to do something positive—that he or she might, for example, reject the bipartisan policies that have crashed the standard of living for most Americans, consigned the nation’s infrastructure to malign neglect, and pursued gargantuan corporate welfare programs, such as the worthless F-35 fighter, at the expense of anything more useful or necessary—is dismissed out of hand as “unrealistic.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What the insurgent candidacies of Trump and Sanders show conclusively, in turn, is that the lesser-evil rhetoric and its fixation on “realistic” politics have just passed their pull date. There are very good reasons for this. The pursuit of the lesser evil means that the best the American people are supposed to hope for is the continuation of the current state of things—that’s what you get, after all, if your only talking points fixate on stopping things from getting worse—and for most Americans today, the current state of things is unbearable. Cratering wages and soaring rents, a legal environment that increasingly denies even basic rights to everybody but corporations and the rich, an economy rigged to load ever-increasing costs on working people while funneling all the benefits to those who already have too much—well, you can fill in the list as well as I can. If you don’t happen to belong to the privileged classes, life in today’s America is rapidly becoming intolerable, and the “realistic” politics that both parties have pursued with equal enthusiasm for decades are directly responsible for making it intolerable. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus the reason that a large and growing number of ordinary working Americans are refusing to accept another rehash of the status quo this time around is that their backs are to the wall. That’s a situation that comes up reliably at a certain point in the history of every society, and it’s a source of wry amusement to me that Oswald Spengler predicted the situation currently facing the United States—and, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, the rest of the industrialized world as well. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Spengler’s historical analysis covers a vast amount of territory, but the point at issue here appears late in the second volume of <i>The Decline of the West</i>, where he sketches out the immediate future of what we call Western industrial civilization and he named the Faustian Culture. His theme was the way that democracies die.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>He argued that democracy suffers from a lethal vulnerability, which is that it has no meaningful defenses against the influence of money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since most citizens are more interested in their own personal, short-term advantage than they are in the long-term destiny of their nation, democracy turns into a polite fiction for plutocracy just as soon as the rich figure out how to buy votes, a lesson that rarely takes them long to learn. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The problem with plutocracy, in turn, is that it embodies the same fixation on short-term personal advantage that gives it its entry to power, since the only goals that guide the rich in their increasingly kleptocratic rule are immediate personal wealth and gratification. Despite the ravings of economists, furthermore, it simply isn’t true that what benefits the very rich automatically benefits the rest of society as well; quite the contrary, in the blind obsession with personal gain that drives the plutocratic system, the plutocrats generally lose track of the hard fact that too much profiteering can run the entire system into the ground<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A democracy in its terminal years thus devolves into a broken society from which only the narrowing circle of the privileged rich derive any tangible benefit. In due time, those excluded from that circle look elsewhere for leadership. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The result is what Spengler calls Caesarism: the rise of charismatic leaders who discover that they can seize power by challenging the plutocrats, addressing the excluded majority, and offering the latter some hope that their lot will be improved. Now and then, the leaders who figure this out come from within the plutocracy itself; Julius Caesar, who contributed his family name to Spengler’s term, was a very rich man from an old-money Senatorial family, and he’s far from the only example. In 1918, Spengler predicted that the first wave of Caesarism in the Western world was about to hit, that it would be defeated by the plutocrats, and that other waves would follow. He was dead right on the first two counts, and the current election suggests that the third prediction will turn out just as accurate. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To a very real extent, Hillary Clinton’s faltering presidential campaign is a perfect microcosm of what Spengler was talking about in his cold analysis of democracy<i> in extremis</i>. Her entire platform presupposes that the only policies the United States can follow are those that have been welded in place since the turn of the millennium: more government largesse for corporations and the rich, more austerity for everyone else, more malign neglect for the national infrastructure and the environment, more wars in the Middle East, and more of the fantastically stupid policy of confrontation—<a href=../../2015/06/an-affirming-flame.html>there really is no gentler way to describe it</a>—that has succeeded, against all odds, in uniting Russia, China, Iran, and an assortment of smaller nations against the United States, by convincing their leaders that they have nothing to gain from a US-centric world order and nothing to lose by challenging it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those policies have not brought any of the good things their promoters insisted that they were going to bring. Another four years of the same policies aren’t going to change that fact. Every American voter knows these things, and so does Hillary Clinton, which is why her campaign focuses so precisely on everything but the issues that actually concern the majority of American voters today. That’s what lends a savage irony to Madeleine Albright’s brittle demand that American women support Clinton even though, for all practical purposes, she’s offering them very little more than they got from George W. Bush.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Albright’s is the classic voice of a senile plutocracy on its way down, demanding a loyalty from others that it has done precisely nothing to earn. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I suspect we’ll see plenty of the same sort of irony as the current election season lurches toward its end. No doubt Clinton and her flacks will keep on trying to reintroduce her to voters who already know her quite well enough, thank you; no doubt we’ll hear all sorts of encomiums about what a nice person she is—as though that matters one jot to people who know that four more years of the policies she supports may well land them out of a job and out on the street. For that matter, facile claims that everything is fine, the economy is booming, and the American people are happier than they’ve been in decades are already appearing in the mass media. No doubt things look that way if you live in a bubble of privilege, and take good care never to step outside it and see how the other 80% live; for that matter, it’s true that if you take the obscene gains raked in by the privileged few and average them out across the entire population, that looks like economic betterment—but those gains are not being shared by the entire population, and the entire population knows this. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For the connoisseurs of historical irony, there will doubtless be plenty of entertainment to be had in watching the Clinton campaign as it tries one tactic after another to get that vending machine to cough up the prize Clinton so obviously and desperately craves. None of those veerings matter in any broader sense, because Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have already demonstrated that rejecting the consensus of America’s dominant minority is a ticket to electoral success. It’s possible—indeed, I think it’s likely—that Clinton will manage to squeeze past Sanders and get the Democratic nomination by fair means or foul; it’s considerably less likely that she’ll be able to overcome Trump in the general election; but even if she does, others will follow where Trump and Sanders lead, and sooner or later one of them will triumph. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The more likely option just now, I think, is that the Clinton campaign will meet a crushing defeat at Trump’s hands, and the decline and fall of Hillary Clinton will also mark the end of the failed consensus that has dominated American politics for decades. That fact alone doesn’t guarantee improvement; no law requires that whatever policies replace the conventional wisdom must be better. Nonetheless, things will change, and it’s at least possible that some of the changes might remove at least a few of the worst features of the bleak era now stumbling to its end around us. </div>

It's that the Democratic party counts a large contingent of minorities who have regarded the government as something of a protector. That is, however badly the US government has treated African Americans, in much of the country they rightly suspect that they'd have been treated even worse under unrestrained white oppression. Same for gays, Hispanics, non-Christians, women, etc. Much as people would like to see the government burn to the ground, the spectacle of it being built from scratch as a Trump rally is going to give a lot of people pause. That's why I think she'll prevail - and why I suspect the big money and big influence will eventually rally to her as well. I won't be shocked to be wrong about that. Interesting times, no doubt.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c1993002579576829743 title="comment permalink">2/24/16, 6:38 PM</a><br><br>

The DNC wants Hilly as the nominee and will do whatever it takes to give it to her (At-Large Delgates indeed!).

Her parading around with DLC centrist ideals that are essentially Republican lite. But I must demur on what is the best option but least likely to happen. What I call, the "Less" candidate. This Candidate from the Lesser Party will advocate for transition to bikes and mass transportation by regional or local means. Closing of trade deals to those countries who under price us and subsidize the manufacture and R&amp;D of products we buy. Restricting energy production to what we actually mine, extract or can build on our own. These policies would be shot down in second. In fact, we never hear about the Green Party candidates or lesser known parties who petition a candidate for POTUS. What I'm trying to say is, yes, neither Republican moderates or Democratic candidates have a chance, but neither does the best answer to power down and transition.

I vaguely remember Dole vs. Clinton. A kid on the school bus told me that Clinton wouldn't let us run cattle on the BLM lands anymore, I remember feeling skeptical about that claim, and during Clinton's second term I remember being very conscious of the fact that each spring we would get together to heard cattle to the high country, as that community had done since my Grandmother was a little girl.<br><br>Bush vs. Gore, and most clearly the issue concerning Florida seemed like a farce, what little I knew of politics at the time gave me a sense that that election was a terrible mess. Even before the hanging chads, none of the candidates seemed to be the slightest bit impressive.<br><br>Bush vs. Kerry, at this point I was old enough to be some what active, though I could not vote I did work as an election judge. Let me say, a lot of votes get miss handled. Around this time I was very supportive of the Democrats as an alternative to the obvious catastrophe of the Neo-Cons, but also profoundly sad that a very narrow range of options was on the table at all. The fact the Democrats managed to nominate a candidate that could lose to Bush seemed pathetic. How many Democratic candidates flailed to go against Bush? I think there was a game show about it.<br><br>Obama vs. McCain. This is the only time I voted, and I voted for Obama, and was glad that he had defeated Hilary, who by that time I was beginning to see as a person with serious character deficiencies. Even with W out for good this election was still more a farce, and the fact that Sarah Palin was involved is proof enough.<br><br>Obama vs. Romney. Seriously, where did the GOP go to find Romney? Obama was despised by a wide swath of Americans who had come to understand that his 'hope' message was just a ploy to manipulate the early more optimistic resentment of the establishment.<br><br>This year's mess. This is the steepest decline I can remember.<br><br>Trump I would give 75% odds to, and most of the remainder (15%) goes to Sanders, who I think would have a very solid shot against Trump in the general election, but I think it is unlikely his populist movement can overcome the extreme conservatism of the Democratic party. That leads 10% chance to spread between any other outcome where a more establishment figure manages to brute or cheat their way into power. These are just my guesses.<br><br>Certainly Trump's aggressive tactics turned against Clinton would be viscerally effective. If it comes down to those two options, the entertainment value of watching that would be small comfort to the dread of uncertainty.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c5631140021378546646 title="comment permalink">2/24/16, 7:02 PM</a><br><br>

For several years, I had been doubting that the US is truly democratic, and that most European countries aren't either. Significant change by popular demand didn't seem possible; cosmetic changes (e.g. Obama replacing Bush) seemed to be the limit of what could be achieved. The only real changes that seemed to occur were ones that were in the elites' best interests.<br><br>Then Trump and Sanders came along, and now we're seeing how fragile the system of political control really is. Even if Trump is somehow cheated out of the Republican nomination (to say nothing of the general election), he's shown that a populist alternative to the status quo is possible. Sanders demonstrated this too, although I doubt that he'll get past Clinton given the massive institutional support for her. <br><br>It's fascinating to me that after such a long time hearing that Republican voters demand rigid orthodoxy, and that socialism is a toxic label, the probable nominee for the GOP is a former Democrat who has taken all sorts of populist positions over the years, and one of the two top Democrats proudly calls himself a socialist. It turns out that the American people weren't demanding neoliberal orthodoxy after all! This was pretty obvious for a long time, but it's definitely coming as a big shock to the elite class as they are finally getting hit with the cluebat. Finally, the neoliberal era is showing unmistakable signs of ending, and I'm excited about that even though what comes after it could easily be worse.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c4676448831479872927 title="comment permalink">2/24/16, 7:09 PM</a><br><br>

My father's youngest brother was admitted to the hospital Monday night, and died tonight.

I was literally just about to start writing a blog post entitled “Make R’lyeh Great Again,” and now you’ve written almost exactly what I wanted to say. Some of the ideas, almost word for word. How did you do that?<br><br>Just a few things I want to drive home. The first is that we Americans often don’t understand what trade-offs are involved in “democracy”. We think, “voting on stuff, boo-yah!” But as you say, the GOP primary this year was more democratic than the Democrats, and Trump is the result. Responding to Ron Paul’s clever moves in 2008 and 2012, they removed the superdelegates and the other checks by elites on popular opinion, apparently betting that the well-oiled money-politics system would continue to work as it’s worked since 1976. This is what Spengler called true “democracy”, for precisely the reasons you explained about Hillary.<br><br>Also, living in the heart of Trump country, I think you might have missed out on the need to explain exactly why Lovecraft is relevant. There’s much more that can be said about Cthulhu 2016.<br><br>We’ve been hearing for many decades now that the country is “more divided than ever before”. This has become a cliché, and the response has been to “come together and unite” around a specific culture and specific register of speech, which was never going to happen due to the specificity involved. Our initial unity was around a single language, attitude, and ethnicity, but more important than that, a single vision.<br><br>But what is that vision? How did that essential American vision maintain continuity from the 1600s through the upheavals of the 1960s all the way to today, and why is it under threat now? The answer is that an American politician in the broadest sense, by which I mean anyone but Trump, is essentially a Lovecraft protagonist. When Bernie Sanders is talking to the audience at a debate, he is imagining that the audience shares an American Dream with him. He imagines a moral, rational individual trying to shape his mind to a moral framework, which Bernie and his supporters just need to explain correctly so it makes sense to the common man. The other candidates have different moral frameworks, but they share that metaphysical vision of the Pilgrim’s Progress, of an individual man or woman journeying through life, gaining various experiences, becoming more perfect, and, through the communal education of their children, bringing into being a more perfect and more American world. <br><br>(Continued)<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c2923234210302060686 title="comment permalink">2/24/16, 8:52 PM</a><br><br>

These dreams are not entirely comprehensible to the mind of an American politician, in the way that opposing views are. They come from totally outside their vision of a single ideal individual working for an ideal society. Perhaps they are dreams of a Napoleon making a weak government invest all power in himself, or of a Russian politician snatching his pen back from the hand of an oligarch. All that can be said for sure is that there is no city on a hill in these dreams, no Pilgrim’s Progress. And this is the essential Lovecraftian moment. A Trump candidacy appears to an American establishment politician <i>precisely</i> the way it would have appeared in the dreams of Cotton Mather: as an illogical nightmare, from an unimaginable chaos realm. <br><br>“Chaos candidate” is the perfect appellation for this. Didn’t Nietzsche say, “one must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star”? Why do we respect that in philosophers but are terrified of it in political candidates? We admit of philosophers a certain predictable, comforting human nature, and expect their inner chaos to take new and interesting forms. This is the reality, and I support Trump for this reason. But up until now we have not been able to admit an inner chaos for present-day politicians. We can read history books, and learn from diaries and inside sources of the torments of JFK and FDR, of the mixtures of good and evil they encountered. But in the present day, we are still the horrified moral public. When we learned of Nixon’s tapes, we were in shock; when we learn of a celebrity saying something “racist” or “sexist”, we still react with shock, or at least pretend to; Trump openly admits to his whirling chaos, and that is a violation of very ancient ideas that the American establishment has grown up around. The center cannot hold.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c8041287477710149027 title="comment permalink">2/24/16, 8:52 PM</a><br><br>

I expect her to get the nomination, but that's not yet a done deal by any means -- especially if more of Clinton's rich friends open their clueless mouths. <br><br>Unknown, or the crabby and sardonic one!<br><br>Jeffrey, ahem. The Elder God/Great Old One distinction was coined by August Derleth, who is widely considered a heretic by all wrong-thinking cultists, you know. <br><br>Andy, given that Clinton started the campaign with literally every imaginable advantage, I don't know that it requires any special explanation to understand why she's been able to stay ahead of Sanders so far. We'll see what happens as the campaign proceeds. <br><br>Pygmycory, the popcorn should be enough. I figured out many years ago that I'd probably witness the end of the last scraps of constitutional government in this country, and dealt with it then. <br><br>Robo, or it may be hopelessly confused by them!<br><br>Max, the latest polls show that 75% of Americans "could see themselves voting for Trump." That's not just his existing demographic -- though I'm not at all surprised to see the voices of the salary class falling all over themselves to reassure themselves otherwise. <br><br>Zachary, yes, that's a fine example of highbrow stupidity, isn't it? <br><br>Steve, I still think Sanders has a chance to take the nomination right out from under Clinton's grasp. Her campaign is so badly managed and so inept at dealing with challenges that if Sanders just keeps hammering away, and begins to amass a decent delegate count, he might just wear her down and win it in the later primaries. Still, we'll see. As for Elder God/Great Old One, see my comment to Jeffrey Williams above. <br><br>OilisFinite, I don't really see a point about imagining fantasy candidates who don't and can't exist. <br><br>Ray, I won't argue at all. It's a sign of the decay of our republic that so few people with the least scrap of talent or integrity will run for office these days. <br><br>Sojan, I did indeed, which was part of what was behind my description of his concession speech. <br><br>Graeme, I'll certainly consider it -- thank you.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c2582953147997209221 title="comment permalink">2/24/16, 9:33 PM</a><br><br>

Trump? He might do that; my guess, though, is that he's more likely to do an Augustus Caesar routine, and leave the forms of democratic government in place while finishing the process by which the presidency becomes an elective autocracy. Still, we'll see.<br><br>Peakfuture, that's a good point. I don't have any specific names in mind just now, but that's because my perennial I-wish candidate, William Catton Jr., died a few years back. <br><br>Globus, my guess is that Hillary's more likely to end up facing charges than Trump is; she's made a lot of enemies, and has apparently done some very stupidly blatant things in the way of influence peddling and the like. Still, we'll see. <br><br>Grebulocities, bingo. The neoliberal consensus was never more than an agreement among the political class; the rest of the population just put up with it, until things reached a point at which doing so was intolerable -- and here we are. <br><br>Rüdiger, I'll give it a look as time permits. <br><br>Jim, fair enough. I think you're quite wrong, but we'll see, won't we? <br><br>Dennis, if you can't be bothered to read my post, why should I be bothered to respond to your comment? <br><br>James, I'm very sorry to hear about your uncle. That sort of story is much, much too common these days. <br><br>Ventriloquist, funny. <br><br>Jonathan, that's certainly my suggestion! <br><br>Unknown Eagle, thank you. Your politics won't change until they reach the point that the desperation is no longer quiet. That's where we are now. <br><br>Tokyo Damage, I got it from the "Bloom County" comic strip a long time ago. The rather unsanitary implication is that the people in question have rolled up their nether undergarments and are smoking them as a recreational high. <br><br>Mary, we can certainly hope that Clinton -- for some reason, whenever I try to type her name, it comes out "Clingon" on the first try -- will crash and burn in some colorfully legal manner. <br><br>Escape, the Onion as usual has it nailed.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c8578710276821131215 title="comment permalink">2/24/16, 9:49 PM</a><br><br>

(The Native American material in it was there with the blessings of Native American elders -- Seton was one of the first White defenders of Native American rights, and was encouraged by his many Native American friends to teach non-Native kids Native ways, in the hope that this would make the Wasi'chu a little less crazy.) <br><br>Betsy, thank you for the data point! What I'm hearing from everywhere, basically, is that the wheels seem to be coming off the economy, in the US and more generally. We may all be in for a very, very rough time of it. <br><br>Sojan, got it in one. The "cessation of hostilities" was also nicely timed to keep the Turks and Saudis from sending in ground troops to try to overthrow Assad; if they do that now, the Russians have all the plausibility they need to see how well their cruise missiles and ground-attack aircraft work against a conventional ground invasion -- a detail I think they'd be quite eager to determine. All in all, Putin and his government have managed this whole business very well indeed. <br><br>Jessi, <a href=https://cthulhuforamerica.com/ rel=nofollow>he is indeed</a> -- and that link has bumper stickers, not to mention red coffee cups to wage war on Christmas with. ;-)<br><br>M, oh, sure, that'll change everything. How many times has that same sort of story appeared in the media? If you always do what you've always done, you'll always get what you've always gotten...<br><br>Cathy, got it and thank you! <br><br>Inohuri, to me the various allegations are less important than the mere fact that four years of Hillary Clinton might as well be four more years of Dubyobama. <br><br>Avery, I'd take that perspective and put more history in it. It simply isn't true that the US today is more divided than ever before; we were just as divided in 1776, 1861, and 1932; in all three of those years, the common dream shattered into fragments, and a strong and massively controversial figure took power and reconfigured those fragments into a new dream. It bears remembering that all three of those earlier figures got the same kind of hostile press Trump gets now, and none of them were anything like as genial as they've been made to look in hindsight. Will Trump repeat the pattern, or did we finally draw the short straw? Good question -- but not all of us are a horrified moral public, not by a long shot. <br><br>The fact that the media gasps when someone says something that's been defined by the bicoastal chattering classes as racist or sexist does not mean that most Americans share that reaction. That's one of the reasons why Trump's ratings go up every time he says something that's supposed to be outrageous: the rest of the country, the 80% who don't belong to the chattering classes, talk exactly the way he does. (Trust me on this -- I live in a small Middle American town, and if Trump sat down in a bar here and started chatting with the locals, unless somebody recognized him, he and his utterances would fit right in.)<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c2241794231848199467 title="comment permalink">2/24/16, 10:51 PM</a><br><br>

I find Spengler delightful to read, precisely because his prose has such a degree of Wagnerian bombast to it -- but then I'm a Wagner fan, too. The interesting thing about Spengler's binaries is that he uses polarity the way a Taoist does: history and nature, physiognomy and systematics, becoming and the has-become, in each case both sides of the binary are equally necessary, nor can one function in the absence of a tincture of the other.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c1098047685990360734></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/16674758871210428697 rel=nofollow>Chloe</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I was going to say that from this side of the pond, the women-for-Hillary attitude seems baffling - cultural memories of Maggie Thatcher will do that - until I remembered that Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall tried to do exactly that back in the Labour leadership election last summer. I've never heard the same applied to Merkel, Le Pen or Sturgeon, though, perhaps because they can all attract voters on the merit of stances and policies that actually mean something to their respective electorates. (Not that it's a non-issue that all of the US's presidents up to now have been distinctly Y-chromosome-enabled, but trying to change it by simply voting for the only woman in the race on the basis that she's a woman is going about the whole thing distinctly a**-backwards.)<br><br>I'm going to hope you're wrong about the first prediction (Clinton beats Sanders), because I suspect you're right about the second: there's a good chance Trump will thrash Clinton in the presidential race if that's how it plays out. As several of your commenters have already shown, a good chunk of the old Democratic base is now more anti-establishment than anything and could well be swung to Trump. I suspect Sanders' fortunes in the primaries may in part depend upon whether enough of Clinton's current support base realise in time that the rules of the game have changed; it will seem counter-intuitive to many (particularly older) Democrats to think that Sanders would have a better chance in the presidential election than Clinton, but if they do figure it out then a lot of them (being of the anyone-but-Trump crowd) will happily jump ship.<br><br>The main difference between the two outsiders, as far as I can tell, is that Sanders is standing on a platform of "the system is broken", where Trump is standing on a platform of, "the system AND the society are broken". There are a fairly small number of hot-button issues - abortion, same-sex marriage and LGBT rights, the creationism debate, gun control - where it's at least perceived that victory has gone to the left. That's not to say the project of social improvement in the form of equality and stamping-out of prejudice - which is a long-winded way of not using its own name for itself, social "progress" - has actually been successful; in material terms the lives of many minorities have not improved or are slipping again - but perception is everything. That large swathes of the right still view these changes not as "progress" of any kind but as slips down the long slide to damnation is, of course, the issue; and that's without even getting started on the question of immigration. What this means is that Trump has a much deeper well of anger to draw on, and across a wider spread of demographics - as he said himself in Nevada, he's been winning across every group, whereas a lot of Sanders' support base is young: his main draw is disenfranchisement with the current plutocracy, but Trump additionally has the advantage of the usual swing towards the Republicans after eight years of Democratic presidency. Even if the parties are all but identical in every way that actually matters, they do still differ at several of the points people put great stock in. What that means for the presidential election, I can't say. I doubt there are few generalities to be drawn about the values and views of the American population at this point and a victory for either Trump or Sanders could well deepen the wedges and accelerate the course towards break-up of the union. Clinton, of course, would simply mean drifting on until the next round.<br><br>Which reminds me: it's a popular pastime over here to laugh at everything Trump says, but if he's been running his mouth about energy, climate or the environment, then it hasn't made its way into the airwaves. In fact, everybody seems to be curiously quiet on the topic.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c1098047685990360734 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 2:21 AM</a><br><br>

He is the first democratic presidential candidate I have been excited about and I find myself gravitating to the phrase, help us Bernie Sanders you're our only hope.

I really thought by now we would have a real third party option.<br><br>You and the other readers here might enjoy this. It is a conversation between Chris Hedges and Ralph Nader about this election. In it they give a good critique of Sanders (starting around the 15 min mark). Nader analyzes some of Sanders' campaign strategy and criticizes him for not going after Clinton, or Obama for that matter, as much as he could. As much as he is trying to take over the democratic party, he still does not want to criticize the establishment in a way that might hurt Clinton if she gets the nomination. Which might ensure that she does, especially since she seems to be co-opting his message. At this point I really hope Clinton gets indicted soon, because that would probably tip the scales in Sanders' favor.<br><br>http://www.truthdig.com/avbooth/item/video_chris_hedges_and_ralph_nader_on_the_bernie_sanders_set-up_20151110<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c7463321370376073626 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 4:50 AM</a><br><br>

I was in primary school around that time, and I am from New Zealand (although the moral panic came to our shores, as well as I believe to most of the western world), so I only have dim memory of the events as they happened, but that would seem to have been an instance when political correctness in the media prevented the obvious from being accepted, caused lots pain and suffering for individuals, and allowed a unhealthy paranoia to be inserted into our culture where children are concerned.<br><br>I bring this up because it seems like the crazy wing of modern day feminism seems to have started a whole new moral panic surrounding "campus rape culture", stating that roughly 20% of women will be sexually assaulted at college, for a discussion of where that stat came from http://time.com/3633903/campus-rape-1-in-5-sexual-assault-setting-record-straight/. The "National Crime Victimization Survey" says that on average 6.1 per 1000 female college students will be victims of some form of sexual assault in a year, this is compared to 7.2 per 1000 for non students. Quite a discrepancy. Based upon this college campuses have been setting up tribunals in which the accused is assumed guilty until they can be proven innocent, and instituting affirmative consent policies http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/us/california-high-schools-sexual-consent-classes.html, from the article, a student asks “What does that mean — you have to say ‘yes’ every 10 minutes?”, the teacher replies “Pretty much. It’s not a timing thing, but whoever initiates things to another level has to ask.” Every time, including kissing, or you're a rapist.<br><br>I bring this up because I've noticed that many people are looking at what is going on in the college campuses, with this and things such as no platforming, getting people fired for ideological reasons, and so on. They're noticing that the current establishment left appears to be fully willing to indulge this behavior, and or is actively encouraging it, and they/I, are worried. I have to ask whether this is part of what is fueling support for trump is the fact that minority ideologies such as feminism (23% of women in the US identify as feminist, 82% of Americans agreed that men and women should be equal, draw your own conclusions), are being treated as sacrosanct in the mainstream, even though most people don't agree with them.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c4462650610574995544 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 6:09 AM</a><br><br>

I think most people either don't recognize the extent of the corruption/uselessness of the status quo politicians or they think it's impossible to change something so pervasive, and so they focus their energy on things they think can change in their favor--equality for the gay community, immigration policy for the Hispanic community etc. If wil be interesting to see how that changes as we bounce down the craggy slope of decline.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c8398291624498796497 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 6:32 AM</a><br><br>

He also got cheers (!) at a rally for suggesting the US should have a more friendly relationship with Russia. Not to make a mountain out of a molehill, but I find these remarks far more interesting than rhetoric about building a wall. He's also gone after waste in the defence and healthcare industry instead of just promising to throw more tax money at them as well...<br><br>Here's some food for thought: Trump, who is a reasonable analogue to Putin, is likely to oversee a country where the material standards of living are dropping for everyone, which is exactly what Putin has been doing for the past few years. I believe Russians still generally like Putin, especially young, male Russians. If Trump manages to revitalize American nationalism and turn it away from materialism to some degree (which would be an ironic twist to be sure) he might just accomplish something incredible.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c8554896196284628960 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 7:12 AM</a><br><br>

It was an interesting and amusing perspective, and one that really puts into perspective the sort of thing we may well be enjoying a year from now in a realistic way that avoids the usual distracting Godwin appeals that tend to pop up in conversations about Trump and autocracy. It’s striking just how much Trump resembles not the strictly disciplined, staunch melodramas that the populist autocracies of 20th century Europe produced, but rather the sort of colorful flamboyance that tends to show up in the leaders who rise up in the aftermath of today’s Western Industrial nations’ attempts at regime change. If I had a taste for conspiracies, I might suggest the resemblance is a little more than coincidence, as it is, it’s a particularly amusing bit of historical irony.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FPrJxTvgdQ<br><br>*sigh* I suppose that when all’s said and done you can say what you want about Trump, but you’ve got to admit, he’ll make the trains run on time…<br><br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c4628661982867547430 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 7:22 AM</a><br><br>

One only has to look at their hold on state level government across the nation and the inordinate influence that the small Tea Party contingent has in congress to see how false that hope is. Reading your blog this morning, I find myself wondering how the Democrats are going to fair if Sanders wins the popular vote by a significant margin and the party leadership uses their Super Delegates to push Clinton into the nomination anyway. Even worse, if she then turns around and loses to Trump. Worse still, if Trump actually turned out to be a passably competent president, which is not too difficult. Bush set a pretty low bar. It seems almost certain that super delegates are on their way out now that they've become national news. I guess time will tell how much credibility the party itself will have left by the next election cycle.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c7896987362094621168 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 7:46 AM</a><br><br>

It’s a bit different here because we have a parliamentary system, vote for more than one person to represent our district, and have first and second choices that factor in when votes are tallied, a system that allows for multiple parties that must work together in coalition. I prefer it to the USA’s system, in which only two similar groups run, and one takes total power by some slim margin. <br><br>Still, the mood among the populace is similar – the two biggest parties have each had a turn in recent years, and are seen as having mismanaged the prosperity, helped cause the crash, and are claiming a recovery that most people don’t feel. <br>The result is that both major parties, who have merely taken turns governing, are doing poorly in the polls, with third parties like Sinn Fein doing about as well as either, and independent and minor-party candidates polling better than anyone.<br> <br>I don’t know what the result will be tomorrow, but there are three major possibilities: 1.) the two big business parties, rivals as long as the nation has existed, will be forced to go into coalition with each other; 2.) Sinn Fein and all the minor parties will be forced to form a sweeping left-wing coalition; or 3.) there will be a hung parliament, and we’ll have another election soon. It will be an interesting night. <br><br>One other point you might find interesting: The American Conservative, which I write for occasionally, has graded the remaining candidates on their foreign policy ambitions. Keep in mind that AmCon writers tend to be conservative, but in a more traditional sense -- they remain sceptical of America’s imperial wars, and sharply criticised the war in Iraq. <br><br>For what it’s worth, they considered Sanders to have the most realistic and healthy foreign policy, followed by Trump and Kaisch. Clinton and Cruz did badly in their estimation, with Rubio and Carson getting straight Fs. Make of that what you will. <br>http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/a-2016-foreign-policy-report-card/<br><br>Finally, enjoy your holiday, and we look forward to your return.<br><br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c1463127496709653548 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 8:12 AM</a><br><br>

Would it be enough for it to flee the US &amp; the US$ for something more stable? How much would a collapse in the hallucinatory economy actually affect the real goods &amp; services economy, and how willing would a Sanders or Trump be to apply the shock paddles a la FDR to keep the real economy going?<br>As a gay man, Trump's Muslim comments don't move my support or lack of support one iota. I know the Middle East along w/sub Saharan Africa remains one of the most homophobic places on earth, where gay people are put to death &amp; tortured. I've met gay refugees from Islamic nations, and know what they faced.

Hillary jamming her fat finger onto a button that doesn't do anything anymore, over and over again and expecting a different result - stamping her foot and getting red in the face - it's a great mental image.<br><br>It's breathtaking how corrupt the DNC political process is. I mean, Bernie and Hillary are almost neck and neck on the popular vote, yet she's utterly trouncing him in delegates thanks to DNC proceduralism. I expected something like this to take down Bernie but I never guessed they'd be so thoroughly shameless about it. Those 6 coin tosses in a row... does anybody really buy this story?<br><br>Of the liberals I know, half of them are going to hold their noses and vote for Hillary, but the other half are completely disgusted by the political process at this point. They're either going to vote for Jill Stein or another 3rd party outlier, or they're just going to stay home. That just doesn't add up to presidential numbers by my calculation. It looks like Trump is going to coast into office without any meaningful resistance at this point. Since underneath the bluster and bombast he seems like a fairly middle of the road Democrat, maybe we can hope for some getting our house in order under his reign; of course, Obama also seemed like an outsider at first, and then turned out to be the consummate Beltway Consensus politician.

If it comes down to Hilary vs. Trump I'd be pretty unhappy. How do you make a choice between the evil you know and the one you don't? Maybe there will be some independent candidate to vote for. Or Bernie could get in. I like him, though I'm not sure his ideas are workable given the economic situation in the US. <br><br>I figure that the next few years are likely to be a mess no matter who gets in. If Bernie gets in, I'd feel sorry for him. Trump, I figure he'd deserve whatever he gets, and Clinton... she helped design and make that bed so it is only just that she gets stuck with lying in it. It won't be a comfortable bed. Maybe events will so thoroughly discredit the people in power that the US will pick something better next time.<br><br>As it is I get to watch without whoever ends up in power in the USA being my responsibility.<br><br>Of course, I still have to deal with Canada's system, and we have plenty of problems of our own. We're still very much the status quo, and they don't know how to deal with the world's concatenating problems. I wonder how hated Trudeau will be by the time he leaves power.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c8198007422700540575 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 11:06 AM</a><br><br>

What you'd expect, a reference or two to angry, scared low-info voters too thick to know what's good for them, plus a condemnation of the "ugly underbelly" of the American soul as exposed by Trump &amp; Co. <br><br>As for Bernie - is he a socialist-lite in the Euro-style? I might add that the prez of Denmark, responding to Bernie's claims that he'd like to install a socialism similar to Denmark's, denied that Denmark is a socialist nation. Sure, we have a wide social safety net, said the president, but we have a thriving free market economy, and we intend to keep it that way.<br><br>The two drawbacks I see in the Sanders campaign are his proposing an expansion of government in a time when the majority of Americans have basically lost faith in government and other established institutions. The other is Sanders' acquiescence, to a degree, to the realm of modern Democrat political correctness. I think an understated albeit major reason for Trump's popularity is his refusal to kowtow to PC. He shakes it off like he was flicking dandruff off his lapel, and with a laugh. <br><br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c7404624588743702468 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 1:30 PM</a><br><br>

Clinton looses. Or, that they might vote for whomever the Republican party bosses manage to install at the convention, Kasich would be my guess.<br><br>I am going to venture on a modest prediction, which is that Clinton, if elected, will be the first American president impeached AND removed from office. She seems to be wholly unable to curb her warmongering lustfulness--observe her voice and demeanor when discussing the possibility of invading some helpless country--and I doubt that the American public will tolerate any more overseas military adventures. I have no doubt that the Republicans in the House, who hate her even more than they do Obama, are even now assembling a case against her, not that would be very difficult. I think Mrs. Clinton is an indictment waiting to happen, and I can only wonder what the DLC thinks it is about. Have we ever before had a major presidential candidate under investigation by the FBI?<br><br>A personal note; my twenty-something daughter has announced on FB that she will donate another ten bucks to "Bernie" every time she hears another aging feminist telling her she has to support Clinton. BTW, Steinem is a known CIA asset; she went from directing a foundation funded by the CIA, (and being the subject of adoring Glamour Mag profiles) to being inserted into second wave feminism for the purpose of diverting that movement which was beginning to cost important interests too much money. On account of feminists not being very interested in living room sets, weekly hair appointments, new wardrobes every six months and so on. <br><br>This election puts me in mind of events during the last centuries of the Roman Empire, when various numerically small groups decided they got to select the next emperor. Instead of a Pretorian Guard, we have Angry White Men, Black Lives Matter, Aging Second Wave Feminists, Evangelical Christians Who Have Never Read the New Testament, and so on.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c8363648129167270750 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 2:04 PM</a><br><br>

He seems to be the last humane alternative to Trump-style populism. She can't beat Trump, he will be much less delicate than Sanders in the debates, making her look like a puppet (which she is), arguments that he can't use against Sanders. It's really astonishing the cluelessness of the establishment. It appears that they really believe that Clinton is more 'electable' (a word that has been thoroughly used in the last few months) than Sanders, as if they were the ones electing the rulers. Yesterday, Tony Blair said he was "baffled" by the rise of Corbyn and Sanders due to the question if 'electability). There was an article recently in the New York Times (http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/17/hillary-clinton-donors-hear-concerns-about-nevada-outcome/?_r=1) telling how Clinton's donors didn't understand how she was losing so much ground. These are the signs of a terminally senile elite.<br><br>Sanders doesn't look like another Obama. He has maintained the same position on these issues for decades and criticized Obama regularly in the past few years, except on the overall situation of the economy. He has now largely refrained from doing so as too many Democrats still think he brought change and he fears he may alienate the black electorate. His criticism of the US foreign policy has been consistent and accurate (most notably about the Iraq War and recently about Kissinger). Though he has some things that do trouble me, it's either him or someone much worse. It's hard to believe how many Democrats still vote for Clinton. They are commiting political suicide and they don't realize it, it's incredible.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c95504727375512962 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 2:06 PM</a><br><br>

The former governor, having pushed a biotech friendly bill through the legislature is only the first casualty of their ire. Clinton gave a major policy speech to a biotech convention two weeks before announcing her presidential candidacy and an infamous Monsanto lobbyist is bundling contributions for her.

He argued that democracy suffers from a lethal vulnerability, which is that it has no meaningful defenses against the influence of money. Since most citizens are more interested in their own personal, short-term advantage than they are in the long-term destiny of their nation, democracy turns into a polite fiction for plutocracy just as soon as the rich figure out how to buy votes, a lesson that rarely takes them long to learn."<br><br>The problem with this analysis is most citizens think of "the nation" in terms of its global standing and all the things that denote its power. What is good for "the nation" in the minds of the populist right is perfectly aligned with the political and national security elites. That is in a nutshell the eagerness to bomb anyone anywhere anytime, to show our strength. The thing is the results are at odds with not only the neoliberal ideas of the corporate and financial world but also the yahoo populists. Still the economic elites stand aside as we bring chaos to more and more places and the yahoos cheer and want more. <br><br>So it isn't just about money and self interest. I suppose Spengler covered the fact that Caesar was all in on empire too and it was the draining of empire more than the loss of democracy which sealed Romes fate. At any rate as toxic as money is to democracy so too is empire. In our case money and empire are now working at cross purposes and one can suppose a loose cannon like Trump may very well throw a monkey wrench into the financial economic status quo but embrace war and empire because he is part yahoo and in part because it is popular.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c3102869612380290997 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 3:03 PM</a><br><br>

Excellent post for us to think about as we go into Super Tuesday. Have a great time off!<br><br>By the way, I did not know that August Derleth was the original publisher of the H.P. Lovecraft books or that he wrote this type of fiction himself. I grew up in Sauk City WI and went to high school with his daughter, April. Locally, we all knew him as an anthologist and writer about our local folks and goings on. And he was seen as a kind of a Bohemian, the only one in town in the 1960's to wear sandals (shocking stuff). People didn't talk about what he was doing, except to say it was not something we kids need to know about. :) It's nice that you could use his term and mention it came from him. He passed away before I graduated from high school. <br><br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c4237449463482780202 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 4:53 PM</a><br><br>

They are in danger of losing both parties as it is, but a strategy of unifying the establishment Republicans and Democrats around a single candidate/party could buy them more time if the populist left and right are still largely separate. Hillary is unpopular enough among establishment Republican voters that few will cross over to vote for her in order to oppose Trump. Bloomberg may be the test run of that idea, if Sanders pulls ahead of Clinton. I don't think Bloomberg could actually pull off a win from coming in this late in the game, but the same strategy in the future after the establishment has more time to cope with their new predicament could buy some time for them.<br><br>If the establishment forces crumble in both parties without uniting, populist forces could overtake both, populist left on the Democratic side and populist right on the Republican side. If however, the establishment is able to maintain its grip for a while longer, it becomes more and more likely that the populist left and right will unite in its opposition to it. Not that they won't still have plenty to disagree about, rather that uniting against the common enemy of the establishment will become more important than their own differences. It's already starting to happen, a decent number of people would vote for Trump or Sanders against an establishment candidate, but there are still plenty of Trump or Sanders supporters that wouldn't ever vote for the other candidate. As of now, neither one is the uniter that I'm talking about, its possible that may change if one takes office and does enough things that both left and right approve of, but I'm still skeptical of that. Trump's personality and comments have upset enough on the left to the point that they'd always hate him even if he changed his tune after being elected. Sanders's socialist leanings won't get him far with most of the populist right. I do think it's more and more possible every year that someone (or maybe not one specific person, but a political movement) could come around who knows their way around the hot button issues in a way that speaks to both the populist left and right enough to get plenty of enthusiastic supporters from both sides. That is when things will really get interesting, with the possibility for positive change or something nasty like fascism.<br><br>continued on next post<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c1540453418089074240 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 7:06 PM</a><br><br>

The actions of politicians and voters will still make a big difference in just how bad it gets, but I can't help but think that people will be mad enough when America faces a time such as in "Twilight's Last Gleaming" that whoever is in power will be a scapegoat however much they deserve it or not. If the establishment is still in power when the U.S. loses its status as an imperial power, that will just accelerate its demise, but if some other political movement has taken over by then, it may fall apart as well. Neither Trump nor Sanders will be able to avert collapse of our empire and a fall to third-world status, although they could possibly do some things to soften or forestall it, and it's possible that a four-year term could see improvement within the general context of decline. <br><br>However, the majority of Trump and Sanders enthusiasts (and the supporters of the establishment candidates as well) won't be satisfied with a softer decline, they want things that are only possible in a rich and powerful nation. The right uses more obvious language of American exceptionalism, but the left is just as attached to America's imperial wealth. Bernie Sanders' massive spending proposals might be feasible in a first-world economy, assuming his tax increases were also implemented, but won't be possible at all in a third-world America. I have a lot of doubts that any political movement will last long until America reaches the bottom of its current stairstep decline phase. If something extreme like fascism pops up, however, it won't need to last long in order to do a lot of damage.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c8283369688403715093 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 7:07 PM</a><br><br>

I'll go with "Caesarism" as a good explanation of populist candidates like Trump and Sanders. Sanders is more of an insider, but calls himself a Democratic Socialist, daring to be a party of one since he was elected.<br><br>I'll be attending my March 1 caucus for the Minnesota DFL next Tuesday to support Sanders, just in case it matters, not that I believe for a second his biggest talking points will happen - free college paid for by Wallstreet gambling, and universal health care, but at least it'll be a test to see if the word socialism itself can be recovered.<br><br>But if this is true Caesarism, then only entertainer Trump fits, while Sanders "free stuff" is a poor fit, more of a Gorbachevism reformer perhaps. <br><br>I'm perhaps with President Carter, and see Trump as malleable, not an ideologue like Cruz but rather someone who really wants to "make a deal" and who knows if wall-building isn't going to be the big industry of the next 20 years seeing all the refugees flowing around. And Trump can make walls "Classy", which is important, even if Mexico won't pay for them.<br><br>A bigger question for me is whether Trump's success inspires some new political power, we'll call it "Wallism" that breaks from the Republicans and Sanders might inspire a new generation of Socialists to split from the Democrats.<br><br>I saw today that Nader's VP, Minnesota's Winona LaDuke endorsed Sanders, and stated her reasons for resisting oil pipelines through tribal lands, and you almost imagine a president Sanders might surprise and advocate for states (and reservation) rights that decentralize power like the Libertarians always claim they want. So that's the Gorbachevism at work - seeing the limits of central power, he might call for States to reclaim necessary sovereign powers that will be needed as things start to fall apart, and the federal government finds itself divided and disabled from acting.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEbCNEAa-70<br><br>So we might expect the federal debt will sky rocket under "Liberal capitalist" trump, and shrink under "Conservative socialist" Sanders. <br><br>Anyway, I'll take my bet on Sanders and hope for the matchup, whatever it means.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c4888420806753172464 title="comment permalink">2/25/16, 9:54 PM</a><br><br>

My best guess at this stage is that Trump will reduce the size of the salaried class and lift the burden a little bit off the wages class. My intuition tells me that he is motivated to protect his own wealth from the senile elite and he also has firsthand experience with the salaried class so he knows all too well their weak points and vulnerabilities - and that the large majority of those that remain in that class from that reduction process will provide passive support as long as they're continually drip fed.<br><br>I'm sorry to say that Sanders has not shown up on my radar. At all. Just sayin. There is no easy path away from the current policies.<br><br>Oh! Before you go, I noticed some interesting articles: <a href=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-25/russia-gives-a-gift-of-10000-automatic-rifles-to-afghanistan/7198000 rel=nofollow>Russia sends 10,000 automatic rifles to Afghanistan as a gift to fight insurgency</a>. What a gift! My those Russians have a sense of history, humour and pragmatism.<br><br>And you'll laugh at the sheer cheek of these two lads - who have taken a short position on the Australian property market. In this instance the word "short" refers to a gamble that the Australian property market will fall at some stage in the future. All I'm saying - and at the risk of annoying my fellow citizens - is that if it looks like a bubble, it smells like a bubble, and roars like an annoyed Cthulhu on a bad day, then it probably is a bubble. I mean what sort of story do you have to tell yourself that it is reasonable on an average income to spend over $1m on a small house? It just makes no sense whatsoever and the young and my generation are really doing it tough.<br><br>And why would anyone want to take out an interest only loan, just because a financial planner reckons it's a good idea as you're apparently making an active investment decision. It's a house people! It's meant to keep the rain of your head, not provide a path to wealth...<br><br>Oh, I feel much better now! Hehe! I thought, I'd say “see ya later until after March” with a fine rant on some serious silliness going on down here. Unfortunately, when the property bubble pops it is going to be a world class mess... I think that pop may be a better outcome than a much later violent reaction from the adults who are excluded and have nothing to lose.

Did you consider addressing the points I made, challenging your beliefs, or did you simply think that chanting the same litany over again would somehow convince anyone? <br><br>Greg, the two mainstream parties have been doing everything in their power to keep the existing third parties out of the media and the election debates, and to prevent any new third party from getting going at all. It'll be interesting to see how long that holds up -- in particular, if the revolt against the mainstream politicians keeps going and control over one or both main parties begins to slip out of the hands of the apparatchiks, some mainstream figures may found a third business-as-usual party in an attempt to stay on the ballot. Interesting times!<br><br>Raven, nah, those are details, and subject to the usual quirks of historical contingency. <br><br>Dagnarus, I don't recall whether Steinem was involved in the "Satanic ritual abuse" witch hunt. I'll want to look into the statistics on campus rape before making any kind of call on the current situation. <br><br>Mister R., as you noted further down, Trump hasn't gone for a single payer scheme, but he does want to get rid of Obamacare, which would certainly be a step in the right direction. Obamacare is to medicine what the F-35 is to military aviation, a grossly overpriced corporate welfare scheme incapable of doing the thing that it's officially supposed to do, and the sooner both of them go into the scrapheap, the better. <br><br>David, exactly. Nobody wants to talk about the working class -- the people I've called the wage class. That's because the middle class, meaning here people who earn salaries, have profited mightily by slamming the wage class face first into the gravel for forty years now. <br><br>Ekkar, Orwell's <i>1984</i> is indeed something everyone ought to read. I'd also put Sinclair Lewis' <i>It Can't Happen Here</i> on the same list. <br><br>Nick, I won't argue. As I noted in my post on Trump, the man is very, very clever, and he may have realized that there are things he could do quite easily that would win him the overwhelming loyalty of a lot of Americans. <br><br>Sweaterman, oh, I think Sanders would be a refreshing change -- certainly that's the way I'm minded to vote, as Cthulhu doesn't seem to have gotten onto the Maryland ballot this year. <br><br>Johnny, thank you!<br><br>Eric, one of the consequences of Hitler's overwhelming presence in the collective imagination is that very few people remember just how campy and undisciplined other fascist states of the 1930s, such as Mussolini's Italy, actually were.

Solidly funny stuff. <br><br>Brian, I did happen to know that, but thanks for reminding my American readers, most of whom won't. Yes, I saw that in AmCon; if that magazine wasn't engaged in an ongoing effort to ram one particular subset of Christian social policy down the throats of everyone else, I'd probably be a subscriber. <br><br>Shane, those are indeed questions. Does anyone know the answers to them here and now? Nope. <br><br>Zaphod42, thank you!<br><br>Dammerung, I wish I knew. I think, for what it's worth, that Trump genuinely has his finger on the pulse of the public, and recognizes that some things have to change to prevent a massive social explosion of the financiers-dangling-from-lampposts variety -- a recognition that his clueless rivals lack -- but that's a guess, not any kind of certainty. <br><br>Shane, that's another form of the lesser-evil argument. Notice that nobody in the Dems is seriously talking about doing something to improve the situation -- no, it's all just "we have to keep those bad people from doing that bad thing, so you have to vote for us!" <br><br>John, thank you. <br><br>Wayne, you're far from the only one. In the last month or so I've heard from scores of people, many of them way over to the leftward end of things, who are going to vote for Trump if Clinton gets the Democratic nomination. I wonder if anybody inside the Beltway bubble has any idea just how deeply she and everything she stands for are loathed. <br><br>Steve, the Taibbi piece is pretty good. The more the media are willing to talk about the real reasons people are rejecting a status quo that has brought them nothing but misery, the more likely this whole business is to resolve without civil war -- and I'd greatly prefer that. <br><br>Peacegarden, thank you!

Keep an eye open for Trump dangling carrots in front of various sectors of the 1%, in an effort to convince them that he really won't be that bad. <br><br>MickGspot, thank you! <br><br>Hapibeli, good. The five stages do get tiring after a while...<br><br>Patricia, thank you. <br><br>Will, of course! King is a New England liberal, so shares in the inherited loathing New England liberals have for those uppity rustics in the flyover states -- and the sneering mockery I mentioned in my post on Trump is, of course, very much on display. As for Sanders, nah, he simply stands for what the Democratic Party used to stand for before it sold out. <br><br>Hugo, to be frank, I'd prefer a Sanders presidency to any of the other options; though I have serious doubts about some of Sanders' positions, he's a good deal less clueless and corrupt than the others. (The lesser evil, I suppose!) A Trump win will unquestionably strengthen the hand of nationalists across Europe -- though I really don't think that tide can be turned back at this point, not after the ghastly mishandling of the refugee situation. <br><br>Sojan, thanks for the heads up! <br><br>Kevin, US election fraud is a long and well-established tradition, but most of it is managed at the local level, where local politicians sell votes to the highest bidder or extract specific favors in exchange for handing over an electoral district to one or the other party. The outcry about those black boxes was mostly a reaction to the fact that state officials were taking away the opportunities for corruption from local officials so they could exercise it themselves. Every US politician plays that game, Trump and Sanders just as much as Clinton and Bush -- and Trump, at least, has the money and the realism to play it well. <br><br>Rapier, that analysis seems highly simplistic to me. Trump is soaring in the polls in part because he criticizes the bellicose foreign policy of the US and talks about a rapprochement with Russia. Sanders is even more opposed to the mainstream's war mania, and that's helping to drive his campaign, too. The interests of the masses have diverged sharply from those of the plutocrats, and Trump and Sanders are both cashing in on that by proposing policies that make sense to the common people and challenge the consensus politics of the last few decades. <br><br>Bruce, oh, it'll be spring in name only until I get back to writing posts. As for my newest book, well, which one? I've got a book forthcoming from <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/ rel=nofollow>New Society Publishers</a> titled <i>Dark Age America</i>, the fourth After Oil anthology coming out from <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/ rel=nofollow>Founders House</a>, and <i>The Weird of Hali: Innsmouth</i>, the first book in a Lovecraftian epic fantasy series from <a href=http://www.miskatonicbooks.com/Arcane-Wisdom/ rel=nofollow>Miskatonic Books</a>.

I didn't read Spengler until 2005 -- not at all sure why it took me that long to get to him -- but he wielded a mean clue-by-four. I spent weeks after that first reading, brooding over his ideas and fitting them into everything I already knew about history. <br><br>Kate, thank you for sharing the story! August Derleth was most of the reason why anybody's heard of H.P. Lovecraft today; he was a friend and correspondent of Lovecraft's, and after HPL died, he took a massive gamble and started a publishing house just to keep HPL's work in print. I know very little about his non-Lovecraftian work -- will have to look into that. <br><br>Donald, I've had the same experience with people I encounter here in the north central Appalachians. <br><br>Onething, true, but a lot of privileged people never quite realize that they aren't the only people who matter. <br><br>Luke, I'll consider that for a future post. I ain't no Kwisatz Haderach -- if anything, I resemble the parodic version from National Lampoon's <i>Doon</i>, the Kunquatz Haagendazs, "He Whose Fruitlike Essence Has Mellowed To A Smooth, Creamy Consistency" -- but I'll give it a try. <br><br>Ozark, no argument there at all. To some extent, what we're seeing is the inevitable result of the abject failure of the neoconservative agenda to do what its proponents said it would do; this sort of thing happens regularly in American political life, when a failed political-economic consensus has to be junked in order to deal with a rising spiral of national problems, and it's very common when that happens for one set of power centers to be replaced by an emerging set at the ragged pinnacle of the pyramid of power. That said, there's always the chance that things could go haywire in a big way, and an age of decline makes that rather more likely than it would otherwise be. <br><br>Ares, that all seems plausible to me. <br><br>Cherokee, yes, I heard about the rifles! It'll be interesting to see if Russia can duplicate its Syrian feat in Afghanistan. As for the property bubble where you are, yeah, it's going to get ugly -- ditto Canada, which is facing a similar bust.

Maybe they learned something from their previous activities in that country - they would be hard pressed to say that it ended well for their empire?

I avoid debt like the plague. My gut feeling is that it will impact those that are the most heavily in debt and they may quickly find themselves unable to service that debt and try and sell into a falling market which is an experience many here would not know. Certainly it will bring about an abrupt halt to expenditure in this country and of that I'm fairly certain. It may actually bring about a benefit to the young as property prices fall, so it is not all doom and gloom. Most of the trinkets and toys people consider as necessities aren't actually that necessary to a persons existence so a lot of easy savings can be made without too much personal hardship.<br><br>As an interesting side note, I went to the films yesterday and watched a beautiful film with the title: "Brooklyn". The film followed the story of a young lady who emigrated from Ireland to New York in the early 1950's. It really was a great film. Anyway, at one point in the story the young lady quipped that although the winters in New York were colder and the summers hotter than Ireland, it wasn't such a bad experience, because everyone heated their houses in New York during the winter and it was funny to hear that line spoken because it provided such a strong contrast.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c7709148246097746082 title="comment permalink">2/26/16, 2:05 AM</a><br><br>

An entire generation (including myself) is locked out of affordable shelter. <br><br>Belatedly sensing this anger, the opposition party revealed earlier this week that if it wins the next election, it will remove special tax concessions on property that many believe have helped contribute to our property bubble. Some say our bubble is so fragile that this will be enough to prick and burst it. The government has declared this is an attack on mum and dad investors and vows to keep the tax concession in place. The latest polling gives the opposition a 50-50 chance of winning the next election, an amazing result when they were generally considered un-electable just a few weeks ago.

Women do not automatically share interests simply because they are women. On the other hand, setting women against each other is an old, old tactic.

The left's disturbing notion that They Are Right and that the arrival of whatever wave of feminism and racial equality we've gotten to must now be protected by the rule of law is mildly disturbing.<br><br>I followed the occupy movement fairly closely and even went to some protests - where I was it fizzled organically due to a harsh winter, but my understanding is that the larger and more durable occupy groups were torn apart from the inside by feminist and racial politics - a lot of the leaders were silenced for not being black or female enough, and once the discussion turned to gender inequality and racism - which could only be discussed in terms that would be permitted in the most liberal 'safe space' imaginable - the movement fizzled. Considering that the authorities in the US (and elsewhere) have a long track record of turning populist movements against themselves by fracturing them on racial and more recently gender lines, it would not surprise me in the least if an alphabet-soup agency or two was behind that. (Isn't it ironic that Google rebranded itself as Alphabet...?)<br><br>However, something interesting happened recently: When a conservative personality (Milo Yiannopoulos) was speaking at an American university, the usual leftist suspects showed up to shut down his talk with air horns, etc. They were shouted out of the auditorium by people chanting... ("TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP"). Trump might make a good Mussolini after all.

There is also a seeming sobriety that what is likely to replace the status quo is tyranny. These are conversations I'm having with my parents, friends, which is a small sample size for sure, but these are conversations that I can't imagine having a year ago.<br><br>Also, from my perspective within what many would describe as a SJW scene, I've observed a considerable softening - it seems that awareness of the logical inconsistencies is growing more pronounced and different conversations that would have been unthinkable a year ago. People seem more willing to stray from "the party line" and engage more logically and openheartedly in discourse. This is a major shift, and one I'm delighted to see.<br><br>Of course my rather eccentric identity as a trans herbalist and bookworm (not to mention reader of this blog!) perhaps lets me say things in leftist circles that others would be shot down with, but that being said, I've still noticed a marked increase in receptivity to ideas in general that until recently were taboo. <br><br>I'm not sure what this all means, it's certainly refreshing now. I imagine that a good deal of this openness is from the sobering influence of the actual political situation. This video by VICE does a good and entertaining job of investigating the phenomenon of the patriot movement https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOBJsZOgN14 I am, of course reminded of TADR essay "The Suicide of the American Left" and shiver http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2015/08/the-suicide-of-american-left.html<br><br>Thank you JMG for your essays as always! Your recent class analysis of Trump has helped me enormously in talking with people about politics. The magic that you work with your blogs is beautiful, and has certainly changed my consciousness and helped me clarify my will.

Mondale &amp; Dukakis, I don't believe, was part of the neoliberal consensus. I don't really think that many on the leftward end fully sold out until the Clintons made it acceptable for people on the left to adopt neoliberalism, too. That, I think, marked the collapse of any significant resistance on the left to the neoliberal consensus.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c2892143581349978867></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/14535034825090836447 rel=nofollow>onething</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Shane,<br><br>AS you may have noted, I agreed with Sgage. I'd like to know just how you think I sold out and committed unspeakable evil. I've been barely middle class, although I identify as a member of the salary class by family culture, I've never had a salary. I was offered one once though, at 19, by General Telephone even though I had not been to college. I turned it down because I was about to get married and have children. My husband was one of those who had an engineering job without an engineering degree (he now has one). We struggled because we had one salary. I chose to stay home with my kids. After I got divorced I struggled as a single mother with a secretary job and got little child support because he had issues with cocaine. My uncle helped me go to school and I got a two year degree because I really didn't have more time than that. But none of that has to do with selling out or not. It was just the vicissitudes of my life. <br><br>You say that those who save for retirement or expect social security and medicare are evil. I don't believe for one minute that another generation would turn those down, it's just that our system is going down and those might not be there. I may not get social security, or I might collect briefly. I haven't had much chance to save for retirement, partly because even when my wages got better I was helping my children go to college. So did their dad. They got grants and one got scholarships, but they still graduated in debt. Is that my fault? Is that the fault of other baby boomers? Most of the financial problems have been brought about by the machinations of the oligarchs and their lobbyists. Most baby boomers' children are struggling. You think they are not aware of that? Other than helping their kids or having their kids living with them, what were they supposed to do to head this off? <br><br>I got my first job at 15. Social security is not a choice. You are about 40. Haven't you paid into social security? Do you think you deserve a return on that? I've been scolded for not having savings, and my answer is that I have paid off my house and will be able to make it on social security. Medicare is govt health care and we should all have it. But when boomers were coming up, medical insurance or seeing a doctor without it for that matter, were reasonably affordable. So things made sense. The whole medical industry is in a bubble and has been corrupted like everything else, but I don't think the average middle class boomer saw it coming or devised it. No one is happy about it except those who are getting rich from it. Me and kids were without medical insurance for lots of years, but I can't say I worried about it much. <br><br>to be continued...<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c2892143581349978867 title="comment permalink">2/26/16, 5:23 PM</a><br><br>

I'm afraid it might not be ethical. I might be wrong, but although I did not understand the wealth pump I've been aware that corporations are oppressing the 3rd world and making a lot of money for nothing seems impossible to me without that someone somewhere is getting the short end of the stick. So, I have little savings. But is saving for retirement evil? Isn't it a sensible thing to do? Some employers match savings. Why turn that down? Lots of young people are on medicaid, by the way. <br><br>You think when the economy is decent and you need to make a living and take a job that somehow you are a bad person because over the decades the democracy becomes corrupted and life gets worse? <br><br>One unfortunate tendency in this country is people being divided from each other who ought not to be divided. It serves the oligarchs well. <br><br>I can agree we have used too much energy, but until I came to this blog I hadn't really considered peak oil. I don't know that most people did. I was just about old enough to vote when Reagan came in, but I did not see any of these things clearly. I did see that the dems and repubs were a lost cause since about the age of 30 and have not voted for one since then, with just one exception. But really, McCain scared the bejeezus out of me.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c3332446272584277312 title="comment permalink">2/26/16, 5:24 PM</a><br><br>

Wishing you a joyous Vernal Equinox and a happy, restorative break. <br><br>By April, I expect, (and kind of hope) to be Stateside again. My husband, the main bread-winner, is jobless again and our funds and time are running out; so I will no doubt be flooding these threads and Green Wizards with practical and social questions on re-integrating. A heavy dose of reverse-culture-shock awaits my family and I. I am reading these comments about suiciders with a massive lump of paralyzing fear in my throat and heart.<br><br>On a happier note: I watched the circus of the Republican debate last night - holy Idiocracy! Reality TV has some way to go to catch up with the craziness and manufactured drama of this! I think due to the clarity your essays have brought me, In a few segments, I could spot with crystal clarity the secret: wherein The Donald was winning votes from viewers at home, even as according to standard debate pundits he was 'losing' or misstepping on practical debate grounds. On healthcare reform, he offered no solutions or plan but kept repeating "No one is going to die on the streets under my reign", as the approved establishment candidates blindly pushed forward with their 1/2-measure complicated plans to appear reasonable, anti-Obamacare and still 'free-market'. They had solid plans. He didn't. Yet, I could imagine an overwhelming number of voters out there for whom dying on the streets is a real threat - that's all they want to hear. No other Republican candidate had a plan that could claim that. He 'gets' it, they don't.<br><br>In regard to this week's post, I've puttered around some internet blogs/sites/discussions that have also left me a bit bewildered until this weeks post re: Madame Clinton and why I as a woman should feel compelled to vote for her. This finger-waving has indeed come exclusively from women all of a higher end salary-classed, comfortable background. Usually executive women. Shocking to me, but no: They really don't see that there are a multitude of other people, (including other women), who are in far more dire straits than they are, for whom 'breaking that last glass-ceiling' is very low on their list of concerns. They don't seem to see that they although not on the very highest branch in the tree, are really quite high up there and that without the support of those multitudes below - they will fall. *to my fellow commenters:I realize this is a judgy, possibly snarky generalization. I still think it stands - not for EVERYONE, but for many. Certainly for those Hillary supporters I'm talking about on Salon, True Activist, my HK Moms FB group, etc.<br><br>I am also voting for Bernie in the Primary, not sure what I'll do if/when the super delegates stuff Madame Clinton into the slot for the General. I too have more immediate concerns.<br><br>Again, Happy Vay-Cay. Will pick up again in April.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c9118937215151928895 title="comment permalink">2/26/16, 6:10 PM</a><br><br>

(right?) I was 18 in 1980, my first election. I won't pretend to have been prescient enough to have voted for Carter because I saw through the BS of 'greed is good, or could extrapolate enough to predict what would come. In my family we swore like sailors, but were not allowed to say the "R" word. I also had some hazy idea about anti-nukes, solar=good, oil=bad, So I voted for Carter; but as a young artsy fashion-y type coming from a poor family and middling public school education, I really had no clue. On the one hand: My own ignorance is my fault, the information was surely out there if I was motivated to look. OTOH, understanding civic responsibility was not only not promoted, 'not a thing', it was discouraged as anti-progress, anti-capitalist, retro-hippy-dippy…. This is why I so love 'The Century Of The Self', in the last 2 segments, it describes EXACTLY what I lived through. <br><br>So I read these discussions and these indictments by millennials and try to think back on how I and we Oldsters collectively dropped the ball. Maybe we should have seen and felt that if such heady prosperity flaunted everywhere were too good, they were most likely too good to be true. It was a time of unfettered optimism for most people. In retrospect, I was one of the kind of 'left-out' that Bruce Springsteen songs were about. I embraced that Springsteenish working class cool as well as punk music and culture, but even for me and those like me - it seemed like we had some duty to better ourselves as we could and climb up the ladder to at least self-sufficiency within the existing establishment. That rejection of society, counter-culture happy hippy stuff had clearly failed, mired in a haze of dope. <br><br>I'm happy to own my part in the failure, but if I could go back in time, I'm not sure even knowing what I know now, how I could have effected much societal change. To go back and do it again - with what I knew then - I cannot imagine making much better decisions at all. So I don't know what the answer is. Get angry at us all you want - I do believe if you collectively were plopped down in that time and place with the knowledge we had, (and hadn't) you wouldn't have done any better - neither would any collective generation. Sad and infuriating as it may be, it just kind of IS. Like every civilizational collapse. Maybe young collapsing Romans, Mesopotamians and Mayans also hated their elders for eating up all of their potential. I'm sorry we failed. I guarantee you, to ruin the world was not a deliberate choice.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c8097315719882203323 title="comment permalink">2/26/16, 6:53 PM</a><br><br>

It seemed to be a popular opinion among a bunch of Canadians who are paid a lot of money to touch computers in a nice way that Trump's election would cause a second American revolution... which is kind of darkly amusing, seeing as how the Trump side of the whole exchange is far more likely to own guns and have used them for real in the Middle East.<br><br>Regarding Trudeau, it is not going to be pretty.

In fact it appears to me as if the bubble booms and busts are a necessary component of the whole process (a relief valve of sorts) and if they weren't there then you would well be witnessing an inflationary surge. A truly cynical person would suggest that perhaps the reason no bankers have been charged for any incident recently and the bail-out was actually provided willy-nilly when it shouldn't have been was because the whole destruction of paper money during the bust is now part of your economic cycle and there is little easy way to step out of that cycle.<br><br>The implications - if this is the case - are profound.<br><br>Anyway, enjoy your holiday and I shall not hassle you again (unless of course you wish to discuss this fascinating insight).<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c1404104440355316481 title="comment permalink">2/27/16, 12:46 AM</a><br><br>

My husband's cash flow turned negative about 16 years ago, and rather than trying to hang on in vain, as he saw others doing, he "retired." I've kept the ship going. Cashed out my retirement account a while back (I don't really trust the company to be solvent for that long). Japan at least has decent health insurance. Around this time each year I go into a funk, as all the tax forms I have to file with US agencies force me to delve into the sordid details of my savings accounts. The one bright spot today was that my husband's eenie-weenie farming income came close to matching the expenses, and that doesn't even take into account the value of all that organic food it puts on our table every day of the year.<br>Nonetheless, the anxiety I feel this year has been much more severe than usual. So last night I tapped (practiced EFT--an energy healing technique), calling anxiety "my friend" for alerting me to the need to change, and so on. But I still couldn't quite figure out where all that anxiety was coming from, so I decided to let my dreams tell me. I must have been asleep for three minutes, when sure enough, the answer came. It's all the suffering from all around this planet, and we are really at a tipping point, and there's no telling where this is going to lead for any of us. But I can tell you this much: going out and farming is probably the best thing you can do in quite a number of ways, and so I wish you all the best from the bottom of my heart.<br><br>@JMG, I have no idea how you manage to keep up with this blog all alone, and you do so much else as well! I'll scour your archives in March, and I've gotten most of the second draft of my work for the Meriga Project typed out, so will keep on working.

One of the features of American life that Alexis de Tocqueville (mid-19th century) commented on was the way we form private associations, independent of either government or business. In my case, I participate in my Lutheran church, amateur radio club, and neighborhood swim club; in each of these, I'd had the chance to have serious conversations with people of both older and younger generations, and vastly different life experiences. Look for local associations to suit yourself. Regarding religion, I anticipate objections like "but I don't <i>believe</i>".

They got college level compensation with high school education and minimal effort and this couldn't go on.<br><br>Never mind the craven behaviour of the managerial-salaried class (that would be people like me) that caved in to unreasonable demands (from both our capitalist masters and wage earning employees) when we ought to have stood firm. Never mind our own arseholish treatment of workers. We knew, but chose to ignore, one iron law in employee relations: a company got the union it bloody deserved. We, the salaried class, insufferably smug, are utterly impervious to understanding who we are and what we've done. <br><br>If we had gripes we should have stood up and said so. But we didn't. We should have said look, more and more pay for ever decreasing effort and productivity cannot go on. We should have had an adult discussion about the fact that Canada was losing more time due to labour stoppages than any other country except Italy. And we should have acknowledged our part in it. But we didn't.<br><br>We sidestepped problems. Our central bank helped us kick the can and printed money like there was no tomorrow and inflicted the inflation of the 60's-70's-80's. <br><br>But dammit, if we couldn't get a decent day's work out of people that lived here, with China and other places opening up to foreign investment (meaning off-shoring) we'd locate our factories and facilities where dirt-poor people worked like beasts without complaint. And not only that but where unsqueamish governments with no notion of human rights would mercilessly crush unrest.<br><br>Not only did we install a world economic and financial system that has no chance in hell of working (as we can daily see by ZIRP and NIRP) we let others do the dirty work. Contemptible in full measure. There's a special place in hell or there ought to be.<br><br>That's the kind of people we are in the salaried class. Cowards to the core, caught between our capitalist masters and the workers we managed, slaves to the bottom line, instead of looking for long term, workable solutions, we took the easy way out.<br><br>We know, or we ought to know, that one way out of this global mess is to do two things 1) pay people in the third world to buy the stuff they make, 2) pay people in the west to make the stuff they buy. Will we do it? Not on your life.<br><br>Will we even breathe a word of it? Never, suggesting it would be seen as a despicable act of disloyalty, a career stopper. And this blacklisting, to the teeth-grinding careerist, is capital punishment, no less. If you want to know what it's like in a totalitarian regime that controls speech and thought and action, just go to work for a large corporation and you'll know. <br><br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c733798836421605461 title="comment permalink">2/27/16, 10:32 AM</a><br><br>

She spent the night with her 20-something Turkish German boyfriend and his friend. That's still statutory rape in Germany and grooming of a very young girl by older men but it wasn't quite as she reported. <br><br>It is true though that there are enormous problems in Germany and Austria as a result of the recent migration and it's headed for civil war. Almost daily there are reports of refugee centre arson and attacks on migrants. On the other side are constant reports of sexual harassment and assaults - often by groups- muggings, burglaries, gangs of pickpockets, often with a side order of sexual harassment, from north Africa, in most main train stations etc. <br><br>There are also widespread and proven reports of persecution of apostates, Christian converts, LGBT people, Muslim women without headscarves, Muslims drinking or selling alcohol as well as fights between Shia, Sunni and Kurds. All happening both within and outside the refugee centres. The authorities are slowly being forced to allow segregated refugee accommodation for LGBT people but are resisting doing the same for Christian converts or anyone else - frankly because it wouldn't look good for the 'integration' story. <br><br>IS leaders have been found registered as refugees in the refugee centres. At least two of the Paris attackers used the refugee route through Greece with false Syrian passports to travel from IS territory in Syria under the radar of French security services. Austria recently arrested a few more who travelled with them but didn't make it to Paris in time to participate and got stuck in Austria instead.<br><br>It's difficult to separate rumour from reality at this stage but it's ugly out there. Neo-Nazis spread wild rumours, the mainstream and the left deny reality as much as possible. The wealthier classes who don't hang out at places like bus stops and train stations too much just don't see a problem. The political class will only discuss crime statistics as if the map were the territory. Anyone who points out that there's a gap between reality and statistics is denounced. Even though ironically the same people have no difficulty being aware, for example, that sexual offences are underreported and underconvicted. <br><br>Refugees are being given classes to educate them about freedom of religion, equality for women, freedom of speech etc. That's as close as the political mainstream gets to admitting the problem and it's about the only idea they have for solving it. That some of their students might just disagree that what they're being taught is 'A Good Thing' doesn't seem to occur to officialdom. Apparently such values are so clearly rational and correct that all anyone could need is to have them explained to them. Whereupon they will see the light and recant their previous heretical beliefs. Naturally...<br><br>They also pretend to expect the police and courts to somehow be able to stop it when they blatantly can't. Mostly though they spend their time calling the average person on the street racist whenever they disagree with the official story. <br><br>I hope the US doesn't end up like that. <br><br>Hope you have a restful break JMG!<br><br>Mallow <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c4240882052582134490 title="comment permalink">2/27/16, 11:06 AM</a><br><br>

I was born in ’61 also. It’s easy to look back with 20/20 hindsight, and be upset and say that people should have done better. It is hard for me to understand the things our society does. As a water quality regulator, I deal with stuff everyday that boggles the mind - landfills, leaking underground tanks, sewage treatment plants, severely polluted and contaminated storm water, aquifers and other waterbodies, ecological destruction, and let's not get started on the stupidity and delusions of the ivory tower bureaucrats and politicians. This stuff started before any of us were born. As JMG wrote recently in the comments here and at his other blog, <br><br>“Human beings don't like to think; we're not actually very good at it; and trying to make people think when they don't want to do so is not going to do any good. That's simply the way our species is.”<br><br>“[H]uman beings are not rational creatures -- nor will they ever be, nor can they be made rational without mental and spiritual mutilation.”<br><br>“The rational mind is a very recent evolutionary construct perched on top of a superbly adapted primate nervous system and brain. Like most new releases, the rational mind is riddled with bugs, and though it can do some very impressive things, it also tends to run off the rails catastrophically on a routine basis…”<br><br>Also, consider that back in the 70’s and 80’s, we didn’t have computers everywhere or cell phones or the internet or a brilliant historian/philosopher/Archdruid pointing things out so clearly. In my gut, I knew things did not make sense, but I did not have what was needed to come to any kind of clear understanding of what it was about. Few did. We are irrational, limited primates making a mess of things.<br><br>I’m trying to do things today, but it is huge uphill battle. Over the last couple of years, I’ve tried talking with people about the issues discussed here at the ADR and usually get nothing but blank stares, brush offs, sputtering denial, or pure silent incomprehension. What are ya gonna do? If you think it is really that helpful, go ahead, climb up on your high horse. Cast judgment.<br><br>The currents and momentum affecting us and our society back then and affecting us today originated tens, hundreds, and thousands of years ago.

There was a brief postwar recession followed by a long period of economic expansion during which men of all races got jobs that paid enough to enable them to set up a household and support a family. Perhaps the reason you don't know you are a Boomer is that your were born late in the period and are too young to remember the assassination of President Kennedy. That was a defining end-of-an-era event for older Boomers. <br><br>Here's a link to a chart of the generational periods commonly applied to US history from the beginning of the Twentieth Century. You will note that the length of generations is between 15-25 years. The variance is because they are characterized by historical events that supposedly affected the outlook of most people born during that period. The idea of giving generations names like this seems to have started after The War (WWII). The names used to be applied in retrospect as it can take awhile to figure out what the important shifts are.<br><br>http://www.careerplanner.com/Career-Articles/Generations.cfm<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c6331679106146883240 title="comment permalink">2/27/16, 8:21 PM</a><br><br>

In this essay he described how a new military technology, the war chariot, was what made some groups of people, like the Indo-Europeans (Aryans) conquer the Iran (The Aryian land), the Indian subcontinent (the Indra comrades) and the great plains of Europe around 1500 –1100 b.c. against some bigger and more populated civilizations and kingdoms (Spengler was not a racist, he talked about cultures not races). <br>IMHO It seems possible that his speech, in Germany in 1934, about that machine made by the “militarized ethos” of this peoples the Nazis thought were their ancient ancestors, and the way they made war with “schwerpunkt” (spearhead) attacks and quick deep penetration in the enemy’s rear by the extremely mobile ancient war chariots, could help to change the concept of the german modern armored warfare in the 30’s <br><br>Talking about US, there are 30.000 dead by firearms per year, one complete Vietnam each two years, this means that people are waging a silent big war without front lines.

I highly recommend (Boomer) <a href=http://davidstockmanscontracorner.com/hillary-clinton-class-president-of-a-failed-generation/ rel=nofollow>David Stockman's classic article</a> "Hillary Clinton, Class President of a Failed Generation." You'll capture a large sense of the sellout in it, and how the promise of the Boomers was diverted: they stopped Vietnam, cold, but then, like the little special snowflakes they were, got diverted by that essential solipsism that probably drives you to distraction.<br><br>I'm barely over 50, and I am constantly amazed and encouraged by your generation. The Boomers are right about you guys: you're whiny, lazy, sheltered, and don't wanna do what you don't wanna do. But as I have told my own students: in the most important city (NYC) in the most important country in the world, YOU are the most important generation in human history. So much crap has gone un-dealt-with, and so many scams have compounded for so long. Not really by the Boomers, per se, but by the Salary Class, of whom the largest plurality are Boomers, desperately clinging to myth and continuing the scams to stave off the horror of personal poverty.<br><br>I'm sure you've read <i>The Fourth Turning</i>, but if not, pick it up TODAY and go through it. The crisis upon our society is a recapitulation of previous crises, but compounded by the civilization-ending fact of peak oil. We climbed to the state of knowledge we have now by burning through, as JMG writes, 500MM years of stored sunlight. No future civilization will be able to do that, and so if that knowledge is lost, it will never b recovered. NEVER. <br><br>As an Xer (1961-1981) who never got the benefits that the Boom did of caring for children by society, I don't mind seeing it collapse and having something new built. That task, which is the task of building a new social order for the whole world, falls on the Millennials' shoulders. You guys have tremendous assets, social conscience, and empathy... And a lot of Xers and Boomers in your corner. Learn to recognize the allies you will need, and let's build Retrotopia together.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c5090479025501602437 title="comment permalink">2/28/16, 9:25 AM</a><br><br>

I'm always open to hearing about how people avoided the American Dream and the normal middle class lifestyle in the teeth of all sorts of pressure to conform.<br>It always amazes me how much collective action &amp; responsibility is in the blind spot of the Me Generation. Inevitably, they revert to talking about their own personal experiences and that of their immediate family. It's not really about individual, but collective responsibility.<br>Regarding Social Security &amp; Medicare, there's really no possible way to get it through older heads that Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system and not a "savings account" system. It's impossible. Regardless, I know that Social Security and Medicare taken out of my pay goes directly into some old persons social security check. Being as Social Security is not means-tested, it's just as likely to go to some well-off older person who doesn't need it and could make do without it. So, Social Security is just another way that our society takes from the poor (workers making poverty line wages) and gives to the rich (wealthy SS recipients who don't need Social Security)<br>Thanks, Caryn, for your well thought out and careful response to what you experienced.<br>I'm not sure how much I believe the "we didn't know" line, it's just so reminiscent of Germans &amp; the Holocaust. I tend to believe JMG when he says when he says that ecology, systems theory, &amp; limits to growth were ideas in popular circulation during the 70s. I've read the books listed--Limits to Growth, Overshoot, Muddling Toward Frugality, etc. My reaction is "how could they say they didn't know, when the books clearly laid out our predicament?" I'm taking JMG's word that these books were popular enough to be common topics, especially with the oil embargo &amp; President Carter's initiatives. I realize that not EVERYONE was reading these books, but I do believe that the topics that these books discussed were circulated enough in the mainstream consciousness at the time.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c991165983429757117 title="comment permalink">2/28/16, 11:26 AM</a><br><br>

The first election I remember was Mondale/Reagan in '84. I was in the third grade. Growing up in the 80's, I knew plenty of people who lived outside the mainstream, that actively avoided the consumer economy, had no TV, lived very sparse lives by choice. There seemed to be plenty of hippies/ex hippies who maintained their ideals in the face of the Reagan (counter)revolution, perhaps because Reagan was such an unpopular figure among them. I first remember thinking about energy issues in mid-grade school, maybe 10 or 11 or so. I pretty much accepted the conventional wisdom that the problems of the 70s were caused by regulation, and that deregulation had "solved" the oil/gas shortage. I was in high school from '90-'94. If anything I can contribute to the understanding of people coming of age today is just how overwhelming the neoliberal consensus was in the 90s. It's hard for people today, in the age of Trump &amp; Sanders, to understand just how powerful the neoliberal consensus was in the 90s. The 90s was the time when the election of Bill Clinton made it okay for people on the left to sell out, as well, and that is when I remember the "holdout hippies" disappearing, and being reduced to an invisible remnant. I remember Bill &amp; Hillary &amp; Al &amp; Tipper taking the stage @ the Democratic convention in '92 to "the Age of Aquarius". The Boomers were president now, and that was going to transform everything, in true "Making of a Counterculture" fashion. Francis Fukuyama's The End of History was popular, and even Russia, under the hapless Yeltsin, was on the business end of the American/Western wealth pump, for God's sake. Greenspan was chairman of the Fed, unemployment was way down, gas went below $1/gal., and nobody except for those on the far, loony fringes challenged the conventional wisdom of neoconservative defense, globalization &amp; free markets and neoliberal economics. Politics in the 90s was STRICTLY about the hot button social issues. I remember reading editorials about the widening wealth gap, and exported jobs, but it seemed abstract and not pressing at the time. Gen X grew up knowing it was a very small generation, with very little political clout (birthrates hit an all-time low the year after I was born), and the only real options for "opting out" was the whole Kurt Cobain/grunge/slacker rage thing. If I'm not mistaken, Gen X was actually smaller than the Silent Generation, which was born during the Depression &amp; WW II. There was (prescient) discussion about Gen X'ers doing worse than the generations before them and having fewer opportunities. So, I came of age in a trend that started in the 80s and achieved critical mass in the 90s--to say I was unaware of limits to growth &amp; peak oil is an understatement. All I had was a hazy recollection of the national mood being pretty good in the late 70s and turning sour in the 80s &amp; 90s, and not really knowing why (unlike Caryn, I don't remember the 80s as being optimistic--I remember the whole Reagan thing as having a veneer of optimism with a very nasty heart) Needless to say, the topics on this blog were not a part of popular conversation.<br><br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c6780344888812263607 title="comment permalink">2/28/16, 11:31 AM</a><br><br>

A state supreme court case threw out state minimum pricing/price controls on liquor and opened up the liquor market to market pricing. My dad was not able to compete with the drug stores and big box stores that swept in to the market in the wake of that decision. He never was a very good businessman. If I had a nickel for every time he damned Taylor Drugs &amp; Shoppers Village, I'd be wealthy. He basically ran the liquor store into the ground, and the building sat vacant for quite a while. He was always coming up with some big idea that would make us rich. A convenience store, a bowling alley, finally, he settled on a tire &amp; automotive place, which he also ran into the ground, and finally took a factory job &amp; rented the property. I do recall my Depression/WW II era grandfather looking around with a wary &amp; suspicious eye at all the extravagant, wealthy things that were going up in our community in the wake of the 80s. I lived in a mid-sized "New South" city that was poaching jobs and people fleeing the Rust Belt. Now that it is "our turn" to collapse, I have a newfound appreciation for what they went through.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c2123400439394504227 title="comment permalink">2/28/16, 11:32 AM</a><br><br>

That's an interesting analysis. <br><br>Cherokee, that might work -- insofar as anything can be said to "work" in a situation such as Afghanistan's, where you've got people (most of them not Afghani) trying to pretend that a tribal society in which internecine warfare is normal can somehow act like a modern industrial state. As for <i>Doon</i> -- yes, that was a riot, almost up to the very high (or low!) standards of <i>Bored of the Rings</i>. <br><br>Rebecca, thanks for the data point! <br><br>Damo, it'll be very interesting indeed to see how that plays out. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, doubtless there's some of that. Still, I think it's not out of place to point out the way that a subset of Second Wave feminists -- a white, wealthy, and privileged subset -- has spent the last forty years demanding that all women support them in their quest for more wealth and more privilege, while doing precisely nothing for those women outside their own class. That was the point of my comment on Madeleine Albright, you know. <br><br>Ben, it's interesting to watch what's left of the Democratic consensus break up over the fault lines that Sanders' run has opened up. <br><br>Nick, I don't think anybody from the alphabet soup brigade had to bother themselves about taking down Occupy. The soi-disant radical Left in the US these days is fixated on certain habits -- in particular, a distorted form of consensus leadership -- that guarantees that any active movement will promptly bog down, stop threatening the status quo, and chase its tail in ever-decreasing circles until everyone else leaves and the professional activists are left sitting by themselves in an empty room. Until somebody on the Left breaks with those habits and takes up the tactics and strategies that actually work, the government and the rich need do nothing to defend their leftward flank but watch and snicker. <br><br>Patricia, that's an excellent example of the same logic at work. <br><br>Tidlösa, I don't think those are politically possible. At this point the only likely course of events that can derail a Trump/Clinton race is if Sanders claws his way to a victory in the primaries -- which is still possible, though the odds don't favor it. <br><br>Zachariah, okay, that one just about made me snort tea out my nose. An article in the WSJ admitting that only the rich minority have benefited from the last forty years of "reforms"? I'll have to check to see if the moon is blue. <br><br>Nick, that's a good point, and it's worth finding ways to change that. I get my multigenerational experience via my Masonic lodge, which has members across an age range from the 20s through the 90s, and the Druid scene, ditto. Others might want to explore their own options. <br><br>Kyoto, I'd prefer a Sanders presidency to any of the other available options just now, though I don't expect to get it. The main point of this week's essay, though, was to challenge the lesser-evil logic that the Democrats use so consistently to get people to vote for them even though they're basically the GOP Lite at this point.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c7822644734476579889 title="comment permalink">2/28/16, 3:33 PM</a><br><br>

The culture of bullying that took over so large a part of the social-justice scene for a while handed the bigots a huge win, as I'm sure you're well aware -- and the fact that people are beginning to question the dubious logic and far more dubious behavior of that end of things is a hopeful sign. <br><br>Pygmycory, I suspect that what Canada is doing is desperately trying to find some way to fulfill its responsibilities as one of the lapdogs of the United States without causing too much irritation to its future masters in Beijing. Sorry, but that's how I see it. <br><br>Jeanne, that must have been fun! As for the weather, it hit 70 degrees F. today and will be back down to hard freeze by the end of the week. The people who insist that climate change can be stopped if we just all sing "Kum Ba Ya" one more time are closing the barn door when the horse is three states away. <br><br>David, neither am I. Unfortunately history isn't in the habit of asking our permission for things. <br><br>Ekkar, I see the F-35 as perhaps the classic example of a senile plutocracy at work -- it honestly never occurred to any of the corporate flacks or military bureaucrats who profited personally from the process of building the worst plane in the history of military aviation that their actions might have an impact on something other than their careers. That's the stupidity in action that gives Caesars their opening. <br><br>Sojan, delighted to hear it! I have both Toynbee and Spengler right next to my writing desk, and for good reason. <br><br>Phil, my guess is that conditions in Britain are going to be very peculiar indeed. I wonder what Britain will do when the US really slams facefirst into the wall...<br><br>Sojan, the Hawkwind tunes are classic! It's worth doublechecking claims from the sort of sites you've linked to, though, just as you would doublecheck any claim from the New York Times or some other US propaganda outlet -- there's a lot of very well-aimed agitprop out there from all sides just now. <br><br>Onething, it's not just Trump and Sanders. Clinton and all those forgettable GOP clones are all pretending that it's 1986, after all. <br><br>Nicholas, I dare you to say that to his tentacled face... ;-)<br><br>Varun, typical. If you disagree with the shibboleths of the salary class, they'll treat you the way they treat anyone else they think ranks beneath them -- and that's not a pretty sight. (And they can't let themselves think about the anger that's directed at them, because if they did, they might have to notice that quite a bit of it is justified...)<br><br>Totara, of course she's clueless. I probably need to do a post about the way that abstractions come to substitute for realities in the minds of a senile elite. <br><br>Stu, you're welcome and thank you. It hasn't escaped my notice that most other countries with more-or-less democratic systems of government have learned from the many mistakes of the US -- we're the only ones who seem incapable of doing so.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c1889934297392865128 title="comment permalink">2/28/16, 3:59 PM</a><br><br>

You'll be returning to a nation in crisis, and I'm sorry to say you may have as much trouble finding work here as in Hong Kong. <br><br>Sojan, yep -- I have several albums from the HP Lovecraft Historical Society, and can do passable a capella renditions of such Cthulhoid holiday classics as "Do You Fear What I Fear?" and "I'm Dreaming of a Dead City." <br><br>Caryn, I was born in 1962 and had a somewhat similar experience, though I had a very clear idea of peak oil, the limits to growth, etc. -- those were all over the place when I was in my teens. I'm also aware that I could have done more than I did, and recognize my own role, limited as it was, in the moral collapse of my generation (I've always more or less identified as a trailing-edge Boomer). This is one of the reasons that I keep on bringing up what happened in the 1980s, and why it mattered and still matters, even though so many Boomer readers of this blog bristle like irate porcupines whenever I mention it. <br><br>Beneath, Edgar Pangborn's <i>Davy</i> is one of the great deindustrial SF novels, and I hope you'll consider it. <br><br>Justin, talk about how Trump's election will end in revolution, or civil war, or impeachment, or assassination strikes me as one more way in which the salary class tries to convince itself that it really won't have to put up with a president that appeals to the wage class.

Yes, and that's actually going to merit a post down the road a bit -- it's really quite ingenious that they've worked out a way to inflate the financial economy while preventing that from leaking through into the real economy, and it also says something very telling about the shape of the economic future.

As commercial and personal debts go un-repaid, that virtual money is simply disappearing, which would otherwise be recognized as deflation. Apparently (so the theory goes) new government debt is balancing the expiration of old non-government debt, and so we proceed smoothly balanced like a snail on the edge of a razor blade. (Ref.

You didn't really answer any of my questions. <br><br>No, I never heard of or read any of those books about peak stuff, and the oil embargo was, well, an embargo. I heard of Reagan's trickle down economics and knew it wasn't widely well thought of, but that it was the start of the rise of the oligarchs? Not in my purview. I even read the LA Times in those days, but no, the big picture never made any sense to me. I've never taken presidents all that seriously, either. I looked at Bill Clinton's face, saw he was a con man and started voting 3rd party, and have done so ever since. <br><br>I'm really not getting, nor from JMG either, what all this sell-out stuff is about. Did some people stop being young and passionate about life and the world, and get caught up in their jobs and families? Sure. <br><br>Now you fudge and say it is not individual but collective responsibility. Okay, but the collective is made up of individuals. When I get really upset with Americans, it is mostly that we have sat by and let our govt and military go around the world and bomb people. That our soldiers are mercenaries. That we have books like Confessions of an Economic Hit Man about just exactly how we go about overthrowing decent governments in other countries, and destroying their economies. About this sort of thing I have been at least vaguely aware when I was younger. And dismayed. Other than total revolution, which doesn't come easily, I don't know what to do about it. <br><br>There was a group in my prior town that met and demonstrated every single Friday for years about the sanctions in Iraq, and that was between the two Bush wars - and during the Clinton years - it was ongoing. Without them I would not even have known that we were killing them directly and indirectly for over 20 years without letup.

The various individuals and citizens do not bring these things about. Because your ire is mostly a matter of personal jealousy, perhaps you would be content if only you could have been richer?

In fact, I feel that way too. But I really wasn't aware that they blamed this on old people! In fact, I don't really believe that. Perhaps in certain circles...<br><br>Several hopeful comments have been made about young people getting very savvy about things, but you and your friends are contributing only dangerous and inflammatory rhetoric, nothing constructive.

To me, unspeakable evil is throwing future generations under the bus to maintain your current lifestyle and way of life in the face of the evidence. The reason why all those wars were fought was to keep the oil flowing, to maintain the empire and wealth pump that makes our extravagant lifestyle possible.<br>As to twenty-something's paying in to 401Ks, JMG has already discussed the con of investment &amp; the stock market. Basically, they might as well burn the cash than to put it in a 401K.<br>Basically, I've been wandering around lost until I found this blog. I lost eight years of my life to a popular pseudo cult that seeks to take dysfunctional people and turn out shiny, productive citizens. I'm still recovering from that, and it explains a lot of my wariness with people. I don't do the System well, I'm not competitive, and I don't play "the game" well. I'm not successful at faking passion and ambition, and being the overall fake person it takes to succeed (or even maintain a job) in the corporate world. I got a degree in Psychology, but saw the damage the public mental health system did to me and others. I see most people who still have jobs hate their jobs and are under no illusion that they're able to make a positive difference (see last week's post for that). I agree with JMG when he says "knowing one story is death", and my experience ever since I was conscious enough to understand the world is that it's been a continual foreclosing and narrowing of options until the only option left is opting in to a dying System with no future. Everyone I've ever looked to for advice, left, right and center, has counseled opting in to the System in one form or another. I came of age when the neoliberal consensus was at its most powerful, "opting in" was really the only option. Appropriate tech, limits to growth, conservation, and other things that were in popular circulation when JMG was a teen were not options when I was a teen. I recall a display of peak oil books @ the library around '06 or so, glanced at them, and thought, "how depressing", and went on. So, here I am at forty, and I finally found something I'm passionate about, and believe in wholeheartedly, after wandering around lost all those years. I just want to live in the margins, however modestly, but have no idea how to do that. I'm a gay man who was once labeled "gifted"--I pretty much accepted the conventional wisdom that I wasn't supposed to do manual labor, even though I was pretty mechanical growing up. I did manual labor all last summer &amp; loved it, and it sure beats customer service &amp; working with conventional people all day long. So here you are, asking why I didn't opt in to the System--I tried, I failed, I couldn't fake passion and all the other things you have to fake to succeed or even just stay employed, tread water. I've never met anyone in person who showed me there was any other way.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c5039030882777546608 title="comment permalink">2/29/16, 5:50 AM</a><br><br>

It's hard not to be enraged when you're trying to do physically painful housekeeping work for someone who is far more physically capable than you because they happen to have money and you don't, especially when they top it off by asking if you're planning to go to university and not seeming to understand when you tell them you've already been. <br><br>My situation has improved since, but it isn't the sort of thing you forget.<br><br>Basically, I feel like we've been handed an impossible job, while the people with the resources to act are refusing to lift a finger to help.<br><br>I'm NOT including very poor people in this, no matter what their age.

Not to suggest that the Democrats haven't been fully steeped Neocon thinking - clearly the "Dubyobama" consensus is seamlessly Neocon. But to have an allegiance swing to HRC public contemplated - that perhaps is new.<br><br>https://theintercept.com/2016/02/29/neoconservatives-declare-war-on-donald-trump/<br><br>A couple more quotes from that article:<br><br>"Even when Trump echoes certain elements of neoconservative orthodoxy — he repeatedly and emphatically calls for strengthening the military — he does so in a unique way. He talks not about spending more money but defying the “special interests” who make the Pentagon order “missiles they don’t want because of politics … because the company that makes the missiles is a contributor.”" (F-35, anyone?)<br><br>"...neoconservatives might be preparing to ally with Hillary Clinton...With Trump’s ascendancy, it’s possible that the parties will reorient their views on war and peace, with Trump moving the GOP to a more dovish direction and Clinton moving the Democrats towards greater support for war."<br><br>Your analysis makes more sense than anything else I have read. Thanks a lot for your writing. I am away from the US on fieldwork in SE Asia for 6 months. Much of the time I don't have internet access. I've had to deactivate my Facebook account, and take other measures to screen out the deluge of B-S that is happening now around the election campaigns. It makes me so frustrated to feel like so many people are missing the point, and misunderstanding what is going on. A lot of people on my FB feed have taken to snobbish petulance and hate directed at Trump supporters. I don't support Trump, but because I come from a Wage Class, Appalachian background, and because your writings have clarified things for me considerably, I get so mad when these folks (mostly highly educated liberal/progressive types) dis "my people." <br><br>I feel like a man without a country. <br><br>Because of the cost in money and CO2, when I take these trips to Asia for fieldwork I usually stay for about 6 months at a time. Being away so long, the reverse culture shock can be tough. I expect it will be particularly tough this year when I get back in June. More so, because I'll be landing in Boulder, Colorado for a bit. I am not looking forward to overhearing a lot of misinformed derogatory slights against rural people, "hicks," "hillbillies," "backwards racists," and "stupid Christians," and the conspiratorial way that people try to get you to side with them in conversation about such shameful "other people."

I had heard as a young person, for instance, the statistic on how much of the energy used in the world was used by Americans. But I had no idea of the reasons for it, the way the wealth pump worked. I guess I thought that the west got on track with industrialism, and was just ahead, timewise. Now I see that this sort of thing has been true on and off throughout much of history, and that the classes who enjoy great privilege probably don't like to look at it too honestly. And definitely from this blog it has all become so much clearer. I wonder if I should even have been voting. I had no idea what really goes on. So far as what I heard in the media, it was all BS all the time. But what makes you crazy is everyone pretends that things are normal. This whole world is kind of a fog, where one's inner reality doesn't match the outer one, and that for me was true in every sphere - in school mostly. But here again, I note that I am talking about the world, and not the different generations of Americans. I really don't agree that the boomers threw the next generation under the bus. <br><br>"As to twenty-something's paying in to 401Ks, JMG has already discussed the con of investment &amp; the stock market.

My dream would be as an independent teacher in a one-room schoolhouse. The home schooled kids up the street that I mentioned, we had them over to show them how to make maple syrup. After we were done, my husband showed the 12-year-old, who is very bright and thinks he doesn't like math, some interesting tricks with algebra and geometry and they went to town.

I see most people who still have jobs hate their jobs and are under no illusion that they're able to make a positive difference (see last week's post for that). I agree with JMG when he says "knowing one story is death", and my experience ever since I was conscious enough to understand the world is that it's been a continual foreclosing and narrowing of options until the only option left is opting in to a dying System with no future. Everyone I've ever looked to for advice, left, right and center, has counseled opting in to the System in one form or another. I came of age when the neoliberal consensus was at its most powerful, "opting in" was really the only option."<br><br>+Gee, I think you just explained to me why I feel the way I do, why I am living the way I am living now, and why I have pretty much always gravitated toward this, (but not for reasons of the understanding that you think I ought to have had but didn't).

I think most people have not articulated it to themselves, but surely this whole System ("The Man" "Babylon") is not very fulfilling. But everyone has to make a living...we all get roped in...are your friends on the same page as you? <br><br>“So here you are, asking why I didn't opt in to the System--I tried, I failed, I couldn't fake passion and all the other things you have to fake to succeed or even just stay employed, tread water. I've never met anyone in person who showed me there was any other way.”<br><br>+I still think your blame is misplaced, is partially fueled by envy, and doesn't completely make sense if the world that the boomers made a success of is not what you want. A lot of people are stuck in a similar way to you. They want out, but how?

One example I can think of - the EA Spouse debacle that had EA telling their game developers to spend up to 80 hours a week for months and months and months on end (and thus mightily ticking off one said EA employee's spouse so she made a very public blog about the abuse). The devs (iirc) were even being told by their managers to 'bring your sleeping bag to work' (if you want to keep your job) - kind of thing.<br><br>Here's a fun extra to really see the wealth pump web visually<br><br>For a nice visual of major transnational corporations check out www.theyrule.net .

Then from the alphabetical list click on "War and Oil Media Machine'. Then sit back and wait as the map draws the crony web of CEO's of transnational companies who sit on each other's boards. For more fun try the one near it called 'JP Morgan rules the world'. You can even make your own custom '6 degrees' maps too. I did one on a whim to find out the connection between Halliburton and the Walt Disney company (if any). Turns out both company's CEO's sit on the board of directors for Citigroup(!).

What makes it ironic for me is that as a long time radical who campaigned for Nader in 96 and 2000, and who had been known in the past to vote for Dick Gregory and once wrote in Wavy Gravy out of disgust with the options that year, I am probably going to walk into a booth twice this year and cast a vote for Hillary Fracking Clinton. It's a decision I've arrived at through long thought on the matter, and not a little bit influenced by you. <br><br>I am persuaded in my old age that revolutions are almost never a good thing. That is, that they always cause a lot of collateral damage and more often than not produce a worse situation than they overthrew. I think Burke would agree.<br><br>I don't want to minimize the fear and pain that a lot of people are going through these days, but I am especially flummoxed by the people commenting here that equate Sanders and Trump as more or less interchangeable agents of bringing down the status quo, as if they are suffering intolerable hardship and are willing to do anything to just mess things up. I suspect a lot of these people are actually pretty comfortable in their own lives, at least on the scale of worldwide comfort or how bad things can be in this country, also. It comes off sounding pretty childish, to tell the truth, and I also suspect a lot of them will live to regret their sentiments in the course of time. I suspect they have no clue of just how bad things can get in a nation that is falling apart and has lost the ability to provide basic order.<br><br>For my money, I have decided that Hillary, with all of her many faults, is most likely to keep the ship afloat just a little bit longer.

Mate, people lived in those houses and they dreamed and hoped and so were conned. I ask you - and you failed to adequately answer my previous question, so you are down to one final chance of a reply: If there are homeless people living in your county, then how can you claim in all honesty that there is an over-supply of houses? Have you ever questioned who put those ideas into your thoughts? And what do you believe makes a house a valuable asset?<br><br>You write: "Student loans may not be forgiven, either, but if the students aren't paying them back, the money-ness of the loan has vanished. It's just a line in a ledger somewhere, and can't be spent again." I've had a student loan debt and it is a noose around your neck. My understanding is that if the students aren't paying the loans back - in this country at least - it is because they're not earning much income. Do you not think that that is a sad indictment on the system, that young people are being stitched up? Over here the student loans are finalised even from a person’s estate and the government now pursues students living overseas to repay the debt.<br><br>You write: "When private lenders have to collect on the government guarantee behind a housing or student loan, isn't that exactly like the government printing money to make up for private liquidation?" No. It is a completely different situation. How can you not understand the process? Private lenders purchase debts off companies and individuals and they use the legal process to liquidate that persons assets. In that process they usually rack up huge legal fees which coincidentally are about the same size as the assets. Please do not come back and tell me that this is the same thing, as it is an outrageous claim. You need to ask yourself the question: Who put those ideas into your head?<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c5516793871226340359 title="comment permalink">3/1/16, 1:48 AM</a><br><br>

The powerful example of a failure to build resolve to never repeat the mistakes is massive--look @ how 1929 loomed so large in the minds of the Depression generation. Speaking of which, all I can think about was my grandfather's alarm and disapproval at all the extravagance going around in the 80s &amp; 90s.<br>Honestly, I'm still skeptical about the "we didn't know" meme. Okay, so you weren't a limits/ecology geek like JMG, and you didn't read all the ecology/peak oil books on the list. I know about President Carter's initiatives on conservation and appropriate tech, how could you miss that? The sweater, thermostat, and fireplace talk broadcast to the nation? And all those PSA's by the energy department, ignored as well? And oil embargoes that painfully exposed America's achilles heel for all to see? Drive 55? (alright, that was as big a mistake as Prohibition, but still hard to miss)<br>@Onething,<br>thanks for your thoughtful response. We may be more on the same page. Whenever I contemplate these things (the System, etc), I get depressed and despondent, but it comes out as anger. I'm just now starting the magical practice necessary to change consciousness so as not to be so profoundly affected by the dysfunction in the world. I'm not really sure you understand, though, how much the System is dying, though. A lot of people are pretty much shut out at this point--JMG's statistics about the permanently unemployed. For the first time, I saw someone in my small town holding a handmade cardboard sign, begging, @ a stop sign in front of the supermarket--that used to only be common in the largest of cities. Even if someone has a job, such as yourself, how stable is it? Your industry (healthcare) is in a bubble right now. Will your job be there tomorrow? How about five years from now? "Opting in" is not an option for a lot of people now, and even if they're "opted in" today, odds are they'll be forcibly "opted out" in the near future. We're entering another recession that looks to be worse than the last. How many jobs will go away for good this time? I'm always amazed how many people in farming expect you to want to have your own farm. I'd settle for being a tenant farmer/helper. A place to take shelter from the storm, proverbially speaking, and work the ground and watch the seasons turn is all I need. I'd like to apprentice in a trade so I can have a useful skill. All this is very awkward @ forty, and would be much easier in my 20s, but, better late than never? It's kind of awkward for me b/c I live in an area that everyone tells me is a "black hole" of sorts, community wise.<br>As for the pseudo cult--AA. I'm still recovering from that, and it explains a lot of my wariness with people. I saw the dark side of humanity there. I was a part of a notorious group in Southern California when I made my escape. It really made me doubt myself that I fell for it.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c3023496305135377074 title="comment permalink">3/1/16, 6:04 AM</a><br><br>

Being President is not a job for septuagenarians. Reagan was too old. Somebody has to state the obvious.<br>2) Because of the working class revolt in both parties, this election could have been a real opportunity if there was a capable, ethical candidate with the skill to channel this energy into something constructive. No such candidate exists, so the majority of Americans will be more politically detached than ever. <br>3) I consider myself a New Deal Democrat, so I am like a man without a party. I want a basic floor under everybody and enough regulation and enforcement so that people in Flint are not getting lead poisoning. The Democrats abandoned this notion decades ago.<br>4) Although Sanders comes far closer to my beliefs than anyone else there is plenty I disagree with in him, and he is not the right person for the job. I was hoping he would play a Eugene McCarthy role in clearing a path for a more viable candidate. I will vote for him as a "statement."<br>5) I disagree with Sander's free college for everyone idea. It would be dumping vast money into a black hole so that millions of people with college degrees could be working at UPS or Starbucks. I would like to see that money, and a lot more, spent on infrastructure. If we had a real conversation on infrastructure, without falling into an Obamacare hysteria, maybe we could think about the hard choices based on reality about a sustainable water, energy, and transportation system, something that won't be obsolete in 20 years. It could be like the CCC, Phase 2, to train and employ people for real jobs like carpenters, electricians, masons, etc., building what we really need. If the American empire collapses and the bonds are never paid off at least we leave behind some useful infrastructure, like the Romans did. Of course, this won't happen. <br>6) What I read about college campus politics is often so absurd it is astonishing. These are the people who end up running the world, from a non reality based view. The term "microagression" is an example. I mean, get over it, the world is nothing but microagression. If we have free college for everyone it becomes a really expensive daycare for young adults. <br>Nobody is going to care about the people working three crappy part time jobs so they can still be poor, but then they hear about the more privileged ones who are so sensitive about their self esteem.<br><br>After all the Bush/Cheney crap, and then seven years of Obama/Congress gridlock, could it get any worse? The answer, apparently, is yes.<br>I just don't see any good outcome to this election, or any sign of necessary change on the horizon. I hope I am wrong.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c6055936556795276644 title="comment permalink">3/1/16, 11:37 AM</a><br><br>

Nothing against them.).<br><br>I think Sen. Sanders already occupies the job he is qualified for, and would be in over his head if elected President. I don't see him as any kind of revolutionary. He calls himself a Democratic Socialist. By Western European standards, he's a centrist. There's no mass movement behind him, only a bunch of youthful idealists and disgruntled progressives. <br><br>Sanders has given no hint that he won't campaign for Clinton if she becomes the nominee. Early on, one analyst pegged Bernie as being another in a long line of "sheepdogs" who mobilize left-leaning voters to support their primary run and then herd those voters toward voting for whatever machine candidate the Democrats pick. I'm not implying that Sanders should contemplate a third party run without a real third party behind him. However, the honorable thing for a candidate who means what he says about a "political revolution" would be to sit out the general election and let the Democratic Party, of which he is not a member, take its medicine. I will be surprised if Sanders does this.<br><br>I agree with some of what HalFiore wrote, particularly "I am persuaded in my old age that revolutions are almost never a good thing. That is, that they always cause a lot of collateral damage and more often than not produce a worse situation than they overthrew." I don't think I'll vote for Clinton, even though it might be in my short term interest. A vote for her is a vote to continue the appalling slaughter of Arab civilians and I have enough of their blood on my head already. I probably won't vote for anyone in the general election, and that's a first for me.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c2244763804177254065 title="comment permalink">3/1/16, 5:01 PM</a><br><br>

As to whether she can keep the status quo going, I'm not so sure because she might make decisions that are disastrous and will come home to roost.

The baby boom only began when WW2 ended and most of the young men came home and got busy making babies. That started to happen in 1945. When 1942 turned into 1943, most of the young men were still on various fronts or in training camps.<br><br>It took about twenty two years for the earliest baby-boom babies to finish college, marry and start their own families. That brings us down to 1967, which just about when the counter-culture began to spread from a few untypical parts of the country like the San Francisco Bay area) to the rest of the nation. I started working at my university (Brown, in Providence, RI) in the Fall of 1967, and the counter-culture began to show up at Brown around 1969, about four years after it had hit the Berkeley campus of the University of California (during the academic year 1964/5).<br><br>Fast-forward another twenty-five years -- the first children of the oldest Boomers (the first Gen-Xers) began to start their families when they were a few years older than in the previous generation -- and you come to 1992. The early 1990s when I began to notice a major shift in attitude among the undergraduates in my classrooms. Before then, most undergraduates were not at all scared about their own personal futures. From the early 1990s onward, however, a noticeable and large fraction of the undergraduates were clearly "running scared" and noticeable more anxious during their college years. By and large, they were far more cautious than undergraduates had been even five years earlier. They still did lots of college-age "dumb things," but they were, by and large, more calculating about the risks of these things. This was, from where I sat, not quite as sharp a generational divide as the divide beween Silents and Boomers had been, but it was still noticeable, and it startled me when I noticed it. -- I've used the term "Gen X" here because everyone else does, but I also think of them as the "Frightened Generation," desparate to game the system so they can somehow survive.<br><br>I retired in 2005, so I never really saw much of "Gen Y" in my college classrooms. The first members of this new generation would have been born about <br><br>So those are the years of the generational divides as I observed them at my own college, for whatever they may be worth. I don't want to claim any broader validity for this scheme, and I am sure there are regional differences as well as differences depending on economic class. <br><br>This scheme doesn't line up all that well with the more common schemes, as discussed above by John Roth and others.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c314102106736491385 title="comment permalink">3/2/16, 2:26 AM</a><br><br>

As best I can tell, the Church of Religious Science is a New Age thing into "creating your own reality". It is different from Christian Science. Google it. Yes, I do realize how thoroughly AA is influenced by evangelical, fundamentalist Christianity, and that its founders were heavily involved in the fundamentalist Oxford group. I was involved in a very famous/infamous group led by an ex-con near Long Beach, that was closely connected to the largest AA meeting @ a Jewish temple in Westwood. I know more than enough about the history of AA &amp; its founders.<br>As for "sobriety", I "went out" over two years ago, oddly enough @ a company Christmas party. Having been stuffed full of AA, I kinda freaked out, and waited for my life to fall apart (again, I'd already waited for my life to fall apart when I fled). Then a strange thing happened. Nothing. No "phenomenon of craving". No "obsession of the mind". Of course, by now, I'd already read information about what a pseudocult AA is, and how dubious the claims are. I realized there is no evidence for "once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic." I realized that the US is the only nation in the world that uses 12-step as its primary form of recovery. I remembered all the disturbing people I'd met in AA, and thought the cure was worse than the disease. (I think that substance abuse is a more healthy response to our society than pretending that our very sick society is a-okay) So, now here it is, two years later, and still no phenomenon of craving, no obsession of the mind, no excessive drinking, no even regular drinking. If I had to put it in AA terms, I must have been what is termed a "heavy drinker" who can moderate or quit, though I'm sure that many in AA would doubt my experience because it doesn't conform to their belief system.<br>@Hal,<br>if I'm not mistaken, you are retired or nearing retirement? If so, that puts you in the investment class, with a steady income that needs protecting. Perhaps the reason that things don't seem that bad to you is because you are a part of the investment class w/a guaranteed income. Things are different for those of us under 60 something who don't have a guaranteed income, no matter how small. Much more precarious.<br>I'm very conflicted about this election. I'm starting to have a sense of hope and excitement about Trump that belies all logic, yet I speak Spanish and am very fond of the undocumented. I'm very wary of the salary class &amp; empathetic to the wage class. I think they can show us the way forward by demonstrating tight knit, functional, healthy communities on much fewer resources than the average American lifestyle. I think that Mexico is up and coming, and relations w/them will be vitally important in the future.

I don't mean to be self-righteous, as I implicate everyone, myself included. I'd like to just think about &amp; focus on overall mood, the "bad faith" as Sartre calls it. If you worked at the credit union I worked at, your money was made by giving car loans to people who can't afford them. Now, that affects different people in different ways, from the loaning officers/CSR's giving the loans to the people who can't afford them, to the collections agents trying to get money from people who can't pay, to tellers taking payments from unhappy, down and out people (some of whom are still paying on broken-down vehicles). Everyone deals with it in different ways, from blaming the victim, to screen addition, to weed, to alcohol or other drugs. But on some basic level, everyone is dimly aware of the misery. Of course, credit unions are way better than, say, Chase, when it comes to exploiting people. Now, let's go to another industry, healthcare. If you work in healthcare, your money is made by bankrupting people. I'm sure everyone is dimly aware of the misery this causes, and deals with it the same way as people in the credit union. Also, a large part of your business is killing people through malpractice, as JMG has noted. If you work in mental health, a large part of your job is prescribing or referring to someone to prescribe, psych meds w/dubious side effects, and telling people that there are solutions to problems for which there are no solutions. And so on through the lists of professions. We all make the "Dell's bargain", as Trey would say, and see how the "bad faith" is expressed in our day to day lives.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c4621487710464750432 title="comment permalink">3/2/16, 9:15 AM</a><br><br>

Just got through the first section and you really opened my eyes. Appropriate Tech is definitely inefficient/resilient. That fact is tough to swallow at first. I immediately thought about that cliche example of a grandmother that does things the "old fashioned way" instead of efficiently without the aide of modern tools or processes. I'm experiencing a mix of emotions about this. I know in practice a lot of this might be a giant pain in the you-know-what at first. I can't possibly comprehend anyone trying to maintain their same lifestyle and adopting any meaningful amount of appropriate tech into their lives. But I'm also intrigued by the sense of freedom that I imagine coming with it, especially in the financial sense. In comparison to peers, I don't live with an immense amount of excess, but compared to those who've adopted the appropriate tech way of life I most certainly do. Giving up my current lifestyle will be tricky but I can only imagine how much less money I would need to survive on per month.

They may not be right, but that’s where I get them. In any case, the edges are really fuzzy: using the standard demographic cutoffs, I’m a Silent, using Strauss and Howe’s numbers I’m in the first wave of Boomers (born in 43). Frankly, I’ve always wondered what the Boomers were smoking, all the way back to the early 60s. However, a lot of the people my age and even a year or two older were definitely Boomers. As far as JMG is concerned, it’s hard to tell. More Boomer than Gen X, but the whole “generations” thing is a lot more complicated than it looks. One tidbit: “generations” are set up on the Astral plane as agreements among Essences who are planning to incarnate to make certain kinds of social change and have certain kinds of collective experience. There may be several “generations” of this kind all in the same territory at the same time.<br><br>@Nestorian and Shane<br><br>I may have missed the post where AA was described as a “new age cult” or whatever.

The illegal immigrant rhetoric bothers me most, but I understand it, from what it does to the wage class. I've yet to hear Trump say much of anything homophobic or anti-black, and I give him a pass on his remarks on Supreme Court nominations. I don't find homophobia or anti-gay pandering a credible label for Trump. I fully expect him to court black voters on jobs and immigration, and he's already said he expects to do better than any GOP nominee w/the black community. All he has to do is apply his elite sellout rhetoric and tell the truth of how the black &amp; liberal elite have sold out wage class black people and shipped their jobs overseas, and he'll get a lot of their votes. Yes, he has made questionable comments in the past (he is Donald Trump, after all), but no worse than Hillary's super predator remarks back in the 90s.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c4849829199795817735 title="comment permalink">3/2/16, 1:13 PM</a><br><br>

I think your first statement, "we all make (the bargain) nowadays to get by" is an overstatement. Most people's livelihoods do depend on bad faith. I believe the system is not so utterly corrupt and dysfunctional that there are no ways to make an adequate living without making the bargain. Whereas in the past one might inherit an honest living or fall into it by accident, today it requires thinking ahead, determination, and luck. There is not enough paying work of that kind for everyone who wants it, but there never was. <br><br>How to Make An Honest Living<br><br>1. Lawyer. Don't laugh. What used to separate the learned professions from other lines of work was that they each had a code of ethics, and practitioners had enough leeway in the way they worked to stick to it. This is no longer true for public school teachers or most medical professionals, but it is still possible for lawyers to choose their clients and make a living while serving the public good as well as the interests of those clients.<br><br>2. Some skilled trades. If you own a small business as a tradesman/tradeswoman, or you have some choice over the jobs you are hired for, you can do useful work without wrecking the environment.<br><br>3. Some small businesses, if you have some control over both your suppliers and the kinds of customers you serve. For example, running or working in a neighborhood cafe.<br>Second hand store. Repair person. Barber. Baker.<br><br>4. Being a business agent or chief steward in a union local that is democratically run by its rank and file.<br><br>5. A career in local politics, depending on what politics are like where you live and how firmly you stick to your convictions. Staffer for such a politician.<br><br>6. Private school teacher, depending on the school. Childcare, if you can manage to get paid a living wage.<br><br>7. Home assistant to elderly and disabled people, if you can get a living wage.<br><br>8. Small scale organic farmer or herb grower.<br><br>9. Bookkeeper. Again, you can choose your clients.<br><br>10. Artist, musician, theater tech worker (lights, sound, sets, costumes).<br><br>11. Minister, rabbi. Another learned profession whose practitioners have codes of ethics and enough freedom of action to follow them. Some rabbis get salaries from large institutions, but most are hired and fired on contract by independent congregations, so a full time job as a rabbi depends on a negotiation between what the congregation wants and what the rabbi thinks they ought to have. In that way it resembles teaching in a private school.<br><br>12. Translator. Court reporter.<br><br>None of these lines of work exempt a person from being presented with a Faustian bargain; they provide more leeway than others to reject it. Perhaps readers of this blog have additional ideas for right livelihood.<br><br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c7264254611874364098 title="comment permalink">3/2/16, 1:16 PM</a><br><br>

I thought that was obvious to everyone except the Federal Reserve."<br><br>If you lend me a minute or two of your time, I shall share an insight about you that may be to your profit?<br><br>Your reply to me suggests that you are displaying what is known as a reductionist mindset. Basically what this means is that you have taken my comment and reduced it to its component parts and then responded to the information that you are comfortable with. I don't intend that to be a criticism either, as it is a very common and useful way of looking at the world. And thus you have fixated on the part of the quantitative easing story that you are comfortable with. That story conforms with your world view.<br><br>However, that mental tool for thinking through problems is useful in some regards and with some problems, but not with all problems. In this case you need to employ holistic thinking - or look at the problem with the whole system in mind! That is a very different mental tool - and we are actively discouraged in our society from using that mental tool - because it will have outcomes that are counter to the desired goals of our society. No doubts about it, it is a real problem.<br><br>Please don't feel like this is a personal criticism, because it is anything but. I recently listened to a podcast with Chris Martenson and Charles Eisenstein and they got right to the same point in the story that you did and then I could see they hit a mental barrier - as you did, and they retreated back into the land of the comfortable discussion, as you did. As I previously wrote, it is unthinkable. I've been turning this problem over and over in my head for many years now and I could not see the facts on the ground even though they were right in front of me.<br><br>I refuse to spoil JMG's future essay and I'm very excited about this particular insight and therefore: I WILL SAY NO MORE ON THE MATTER!<br><br>In fact this is my last comment here until April.

But I should also say that I think many or most people in CEO or leadership roles currently are at least in the sociopathic event zone. How could it be otherwise with the amount of killing they sanction, and the underhanded way they are strangling the country and populace while presenting a completely false front?<br><br>From a spiritual standpoint, I ponder whether there is a cutoff or just a continuum from the most extreme lack of conscience to what is called normal. To be sure, I know that there are significant differences even in brain function between true psychopaths and normal people, who for the most part feel bad when they do something wrong and examine themselves internally against some kind of standard. The biggest difference is being capable of compassion. <br><br>As to Trump, above someone said this:<br><br>Trump says whatever will benefit Trump. He’s reputed to be very charming in person, and makes whoever he’s talking to feel like the most important person in the world. <br><br>These are two traits (if true) that are sociopathic or narcissistic. I don't follow very closely these political debates nor watch TV, but I have heard that Trump has said some things I find pretty disturbing. Demonizing the Other (Mexicans, Muslims) is pretty worrisome and it could turn out badly. <br><br>On the other hand, the other candidates have already been turning out very, very badly for the world and the worst of it is coming closer and closer to home. <br>Perhaps a gamble?<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c8843136879160366343 title="comment permalink">3/3/16, 3:28 PM</a><br><br>

For example, in Northern California there is an organization called Fibershed that is trying to get a facility to process local fleece into wool up and running. <br><br>The more opportunities farmers, herders and foresters have to produce value-added products which can be sold to local markets, rather than wholesaling their entire crops to giant cooperatives and multinational conglomerates, the better their chances of making a living, the less will be wasted and thrown away as uneconomic byproducts, and the more resilience the entire region develops via local employment and short supply lines. A lot of potential economic activity lies (for example) between giant meatpacking plants and tanneries thousands of miles away and butchering and tanning leather at home in the backyard.<br><br>I think most efforts in the direction of re-localizing the processing of agricultural production are pretty small and are aiming at niche markets of wealthy people for whom being a locavore at triple the supermarket price is a form of conspicuous consumption. Localized ag-processing projects tend to be capital intensive and speculative as an investment in the absence of some social welfare subsidy or tax write off. It's the same dilemma as household production writ larger.

However, that is different in important ways from sociopathy. A sociopath has no conscience whatsoever, and is ultimately indifferent to what others think of him. He may want others to capitulate to him and be totally submissive to him, but he is indifferent to whether he is loved or feared. <br><br>By contrast, classical narcissism is rooted in extreme feelings of inadequacy and shame. One feels like nothing, and overcompensates by presenting a false image to oneself and others as being everything. This is bound up with a desperate need for the affection and positive regard of others. <br><br>Beneath the bombast, Trump has always struck me as pathetically needy; consequently, I lean toward the pathological narcissism interpretation of his public persona. <br><br>And if this is true, then he may also possess a rudimentary conscience and sense of principle, which would make him considerably less dangerous than if he is an out-and-out sociopath.<br><br>The central theoretical question is this: Can a true sociopath be emotionally needy in a way that desperately craves the adulation, affection, and positive emotional regard of others?

He does have some pride, I imagine, and a job which I think he loves in the Senate. I think that Clinton at this point has little choice but to pick a non-white VP. Cory Booker would be my best guess. He is Senator from NJ and also a creature of WS and High Finance, and I believe he could actually survive having been Mme. Hill's running mate. I rather think a lot of Democratic senators and governors are asking themselves, do I really want to do this to my career? Rising star Merkley, OR, has already made it known that he will not accept a VP nomination, should one be offered, which means Clinton can forget about carrying OR, and probably WA as well. Not to mention HA, where citizens are having a battle royal with the biotech companies. <br><br>I regard it as by no means certain that Trump will be nominated or that, if elected, he will serve four years. Republican leaders are even now having panicked conferences, trying to find a way, not to get rid of him, but to get away with getting rid of him. If they can force on him a VP whom they like--Sasse, for example, there can then be one of those unfortunate accidents. If elected, he will have to govern through a Republican Party and entrenched nomenklatura who despise him. He has not spent a decade building up his own para-military National Socialist party who can be sent out to cow the populace.

As people have been shoved out of the economy by the oligarchs, it looks like their way of dealing with it was to take on more and more debt to make it still look like they were living a middle class lifestyle. I'm wondering now why there wasn't more of a counter movement or an intentional dropping out from the economy. Has the media had that much of an effect on our thinking that people were convinced that the next year, next president, next congress would be different and change things for the better? Maybe the shame of not succeeding at the level expected for I'm guessing mostly Gen Xer's and younger Boomer's, kept people quiet and to themselves, speaking the truth only under anonymous message boards online. <br><br>So if people have gone through shock and denial about the economy, it looks like now they are on to anger with all the support Trump is getting. The comments on what Trump posts on Facebook are really interesting. People are saying they know both parties have sold them out and the media is lying to them. They ask Trump to keep attacking the other candidates and pray for him to stay strong. <br><br>If Trump gets into office and can change the conversation so people move from anger to acceptance of the way the economy is, he just might keep us from getting into a total civil collapse. The acceptance would only come though after he actually takes down the structures that have hurt people - the illegal immigration, the trade deals, the over investment in the military, prisons and police. <br><br>I keep running out of popcorn and there is so much more to go!<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c3214928944482486112 title="comment permalink">3/5/16, 12:35 PM</a><br><br>

I have been noticing this ever since my return to America after living in Asia for a year and half. I started a small box truck delivery job in Upstate New York right after I came back to this country, and I have had a hard time driving on the roads here. Where the tolls of the New York State Thruway go are a subject of speculation among my coworkers, and when driving on local city streets coffee cannot even stay in my cup when in the truck's cup holder. Our product frequently gets knocked out of place no matter how well I strap it in, and when I repack the boxes I often find the merchandise to be too dirty for our retail customers to sell. While I acknowledge that our product is junk that keeps the status quo going, it is the source of a paycheck. A paycheck that only exists because a business can deliver it, and the state of the roads are making it harder and harder for my employer to deliver.<br>. <br>Yesterday I subbed a route to Rochester, delivering to grocery and drug stores in neighborhoods that have fallen upon hard times. The roads in these neighborhoods are awful, and some intersections are paved in only the bricks that have always been under the asphalt. In the middle of this area, I noticed ironically, are the waterfalls of the Genesee River, a natural feature that made the first large enterprises and creators of jobs and prosperity in Rochester possible. I realized, driving for my company through this infrastructure neglect among a natural source of wealth, that the American elite now only focus in terms of money and have therefore forgotten where they came up from. <br><br><br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c5381601437371406584 title="comment permalink">3/5/16, 3:07 PM</a><br><br>

I'm surprise your post went through. I reviewed JMG's guidelines above this little box here, and I'm sure that if he thought my comments didn't meet those guidelines he wouldn't let them through.<br>@Deborah,<br>thanks for the info on farm processing. It's a tough nut to crack--having worked on organic, small farms, I know what they're up against. The average person expects to pay so little for food, that what they're willing to pay can't possibly support a form of agriculture that is remotely sustainable. I kinda see today's sustainable ag farmers as placeholders, keeping alive a tradition for the day when agribiz/high energy farming is no longer sustainable, and sustainable ag will be the only game in town. I've been told that food prices have been basically flat for a long time, that people are paying the same prices for food today that they were years ago, and that big grocers like Kroger &amp; Walmart are the main reason prices are driven so low. My guess is as the global, just in time economy winds down, people will have to pay a lot more for food, and a much larger percentage of their check will have to go towards food, then they do today--I'm sure this will prompt a lot more people to grow their own in response.<br>re: Trump &amp; black nativism:<br>this is definitely something Trump can go after. I saw in my local paper where there were some black Winkfields at the local high school. I went to high school w/black Winkfields, as did my mom, and there were probably black Winkfields @ the "colored" school when my grandmother was in high school. Most of the black surnames in my community have very deep roots here, far deeper than the Irish &amp; Italian of my grandmother on my dad's side. Point is, the black community is the most native with some of the deepest roots in America, going back four hundred years. Most of them trace their roots well before the Civil War--most white people are darn near recent in comparison, not to mention Latinos &amp; Asians. And they're tired of being leapfrogged by more recent arrivals for jobs &amp; opportunities. Alex Haley even mentions leapfrogging in Roots. It's an age old problem. So, black nativism is definitely something somebody could tap into, especially considering how poorly the black community is doing economically<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c912714289328792522 title="comment permalink">3/5/16, 5:19 PM</a><br><br>

They are great options and I would go further and suggest that ALMOST any job, any 'Dell's Bargain' one finds oneself in having to perform to get by can be one of more honor or less honor. I've personally had the misfortune, (and bad finances) of getting to know phone-debt collectors very well at various times in my life. There are definitely distinctions between good ones and bad ones. Perhaps ironically, the ones who show compassion, work with the debtor on a feasible plan of repayment, are respectful but persistent get the debt repaid. The shrill unbending demanders just get avoided. I've known landlords who were scammers and landlords who were responsive and fair. In my life, I've worked in two big garment factories, (a notoriously abusive fly-by-night industry), both were family run and not only fair but helpful and caring to us workers. It may not be possible to be perfect, as Shane said, we may all have to take that 'Dell's Bargain" in some way to some degree, but It's possible to be a good person or the best person you can be, in a not so great job.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c2099248448242344694 title="comment permalink">3/5/16, 5:26 PM</a><br><br>

Unfortunately, I think you've lost the moral high ground in your rail against all things-Boomer. It does, however, clarify for me, what we were discussing upthread about that generational divide. You see, the detested 'Social Justice Warrior' movement is what we late Boomers were working and focusing on, the goal of institutional equality and equality of opportunity for all races, religions, sexual preferences, genders. You can thank us for that. <br><br>As a tail-end Boomer, I did not grow up with more than a hazy awareness of resource depletion, peak oil, global warming; had never heard of Oswald Spengler, Toynbee or 'those books' you seem sure were in mass circulation at the time, (do you remember how limited information was disseminated before the internet - almost impossible to imagine these days!) etc… as you insist I &amp; we all must have known intimately. If you say so, I'm sure it was all out there somewhere, competing with concerns of a Nuclear Winter, but less immediate or clear for me or anyone I knew in So. Cal.<br> I DID grow up with an acute awareness of the Civil Rights struggle, school bussing, Affirmative Action, and racism, (I grew up in Vista CA, next to the Southwest KKK hub in Fallbrook, CA. Racism and racial strife, was a big issue for us in the 70's. LGBT rights and the AIDS epidemic in the 80's.) So, still the picture of a black girl being manhandled by white supremacists sets off alarm bells to me. Reading of an unarmed black man or boy being shot by police every, what? every other week? for no reason at all, and with no consequences, in the US is very alarming to me. In the 80's we were protesting the arms race, nuclear proliferation and Reagan's refusal to address the AIDS crisis in the face of a plague decimating the Gay community - many of whom were still stuck living 'In the Closet' at their deaths. <br><br>These were the issues we fought for and the success of that fight is, I suppose, apparent in both the current overshoot into absurdity of some of today's SJW causes, (body-shaming, micro-agressions…); but also the current backlash against social justice, both the absurdities on the fringe and the vital basic rights at the core. <br><br>So, here, you and I fundamentally disagree and will unfortunately probably always be on opposite sides of 'the fence'. <br><br>I'm perfectly willing to examine and accept MY guilt or responsibility for my failures: ignorance and laxity on fighting the the long-range problems: Reaganomics, over-consumption and ecological mess. I realize that doesn't put ME on the high road either, but it may be the best any of us can do. <br><br>With that, I'll stop beating the dead horse of this topic.<br><br>Now: Cheers All, I'm off to vote.

The question you are asking about whether it has diminished is a good one.<br><br>Have the targeted beneficiaries of philanthropy changed over time? Certainly the answer is yes. Has the amount of money given as a percentage of an individual's fortune changed from decade to decade? Probably yes as well, and it would be interesting to see what the changes correlate with (obvious correlations would be tax policy and how economically secure the giver feels, but there must be social influences too). Are there differences in giving between "old money" and "new money"? Yes, and that's a question that has been studied by sociologists.<br><br>Over the past ten years or so, there has been public criticism that the people who have made fortunes in Silicon Valley startups have not been socialized to noblesse oblige and are stingy. Organizations have been created to mobilize peer pressure among these multimillionaires and billionaires to get them to give more, and other organizations to teach them how to give effectively to causes that interest them, which aren't the same causes the old money families support.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c3328993667598906075 title="comment permalink">3/6/16, 2:47 PM</a><br><br>

I mean, it is the least my generation can do for yours, having screwn you over so liberally. Okay, I was screaming my head off to stop screwing over the generations to come since I was in my 20s and the hip crowd around me decided that caring was so passe (well, actually it appears to have been a clever PR ploy in the 80s to make everyone think it was hip not to care and go back to money grubbing), and it was just as effective as screaming at a movie. In fact, I endured once such movie a while back when renewing my drivers license. They put me in a simulator with brakes and steering wheel and so on, but the brakes didn't work. Previous folks had pounced on them too hard, I reckon. So I went along applying full pressure on the brakes while slamming into pedestrian after pedestrian (they had really good actors for those parts). And the folks at the licensing bureau? They didn't care, it was all supposed to be merely for my edification. I suppose it was. This is the sort of reality we live in.<br><br>Here in Japan we are being entertained by ever more frantic newscasts from America, going, "Can anything be done to stop Trump?" We have a sort of Hillary over here named Shinzo Abe, who somehow got elected though nobody I know knows anybody who voted for him. Someone must have. And the Japanese are very patient, but the time will come when they too will explode, and I think they are beginning to wonder why the TV thinks it's so important to stop certain people from having a choice. Maybe they are poor people, maybe they are badly educated. If so, educate them! I am beginning to detect supportive undertones here. Japan has its own newly impoverished, they are just to ashamed to admit it.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c6258833354431687467 title="comment permalink">3/9/16, 7:51 PM</a><br><br>

Out of 3.5 million voters, 250,000 LEGCO -(representative or 'delegate') voters - he only got 689 votes and yet he is now our Chief Executive - our top representative to Beijing. During the Pro-democracy 'Umbrella Revolution' two summers ago, 689 showed his true mettle and did…nothing. So the issue was resolved after about 5 months, and yet unresolved. The protestors were largely students who just eventually lost steam and went home, but the issue WILL come up again. There seems to be a theme here.<br><br>@N Montesano:<br>I am with you on this. I can understand why some people like Trump - when he rails openly on destructive trade policies, out of control pharmaceuticals and health insurance monopolies, and most of all the corruption in politics - I remember in one debate he was being accused of giving money to Hillary's 2008 campaign he retorted "I've also given money to everyone on this stage. I give you money and you do what I want". Even I find that kind of blunt honesty very welcome. His capitalist solution, (open nationwide competition for the insurance companies) may even be a more effective solution than Bernie's top-down socialist solution; <br><br>but as I said on a previous thread, the racial and religious division and scapegoating are a deal-breaker for me. I can't accept that he means what he says on the things I like but doesn't mean the tolerance of the KKK or racial animosity, which I can't abide. I think that's magical thinking. <br><br>The discussion here as far as I can see, can get pretty divided, but overall respectful - or maybe I'm just used to much more virulent mud-slinging arguments elsewhere, even in my HK Mommies' group!! As a late-Boomer/cross-over/early Gen-X, I can take responsibility for what I didn't do but should have. I also look around to my peers and see I ,(I really think everyone on this thread) is way out of step with the mainstream.

But if the rally is just for the supporters... is it to reinforce their support?

But then there are the charges that "reasonable words" are just code for unreasonable positions.

Excepting immigrants, I just don't see anything in Donald Trump's background as a native of Brooklyn, NYC that's not standard mainstream white, cosmopolitan, Northerner. No more red flags than, say, Hillary Clinton (superpredator, etc.) As someone who has witnessed the GOP for 30 years push divisiveness and intolerance based on social issues, I find it refreshing that the front-runner is not dog whistling to religious conservatism. I think there's a major gap between the black wage class and the professionally aggrieved, microagression, trigger warning, safe space salary class SJW protesters that claim to represent all of black America. I'm not so sure that the average, wage class black person concerns him or herself much with issues such as reparations. Indeed, the salary class may even denigrate the wage class as "Uncle Tom" or oppressed &amp; unenlightened. There is clearly a need for the issues of the black wage class to be represented, and I'm not sure that the salary class black elite is representing them well. To me, the greatest outcome of this election would be a realignment of the political parties based strictly on class, not those "categories with some basis in biology". If Trump could somehow start to unify the black &amp; white wage class under one party (a tall order, I admit, but let's not forget "turn Lincoln's picture to the wall" in response to FDR in '32), it would be a major coup--most of Southern &amp; American racism was designed by the elite to keep the black &amp; white wage class divided since colonial times, so if Trump can begin to unite black &amp; white wage class under common cause, it would be historic. Trump has already said that he's going to go for the black (wage class) vote based on economic issues. Of course, by default, then the Democrats become the party of the salary class and the establishment, which is kind of fitting, if they successfully shut out Sanders and get a lot of neo-cons "anyone but Trump" votes. This really could prove to be a realigning election if the parties realign based on class rather than "characteristics based on biology" Personally, I'm thrilled that the front runner in the GOP race is not pandering to homophobia and political fundamentalism. I'm thrilled that the GOP front runner is anti-neoliberalism (anti-free trade, selectively pro-enforcement/regulation), Trump's commentary regarding the Iraq War and other disastrous neo-cons warmongering adventures are music to my ears.<br>I'm thinking of going to the rally in Cincinnati and bringing back a full report to the ADR...<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c6883496147851997023 title="comment permalink">3/11/16, 6:33 AM</a><br><br>

What role is Ben Carson angling for? Does Christie want to be Trump's Dick Cheney? Given Christie's bold personality and his experience in government which Trump lacks, he seems ideally situated to be a powerful Vice President. <br>Although most candidates for political office are good at avoiding specifics and seeming to say what we want to hear, if they have held other political positions we can guess from their track record what their proclivities are. In Trump there is nothing to go on. He seems to blur the distinction between outright racism and a resentment of political correctness that so many people feel, so that they are willing to overlook a dangerous coarsening of ideas because they are fed up with being invisible to the the government/corporate/intelligentsia power structure. <br>In a Clinton vs. Trump general election Trump could hold an advantage because people could hope for what they want in him, when so many already have an impression of what they don't want in Clinton. Especially the Independents, the ones without party loyalty, could go for Trump.<br>I am feeling a sense of gloom about this whole election. I think of it as a lost opportunity to constructively channel all the legitimate anger into a more viable future. <br><br>Regarding the generational debate, it doesn't elucidate the overall process by blaming one generation over another. More than one generation is always alive at one time, and they all vote and buy things and most of them drive cars. In the 70s I remember those who blamed the WW 2 generation for creating a crass consumer culture and a suicidal world with nuclear weapons. We grew up doing duck and cover drills in school, which were supposed to protect us from nuclear attack. To those who blamed the "greatest generation," the reasoning was that they built the superficial suburban nation of conformity, so they were responsible. I never bought into this because of individuals I knew, who were trying to find their way through terrible circumstances, like my father and uncle who were homeless during the Depression and then were in a lot of combat in WW 2. Any generation is made up of individuals who all have drastically different circumstances. I have heard this generation identity thing before and it doesn't hold any water. As a boomer, I think it was mighty pretentious for those of my contemporaries who thought we were so enlightened. There have always been some who are more enlightened or courageous than others.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c18152807647058249 title="comment permalink">3/11/16, 8:54 AM</a><br><br>

To the victor go the spoils, and our political process is no different that any other, in the process of horse trading, there are winners and there are losers. Alliances form based on interests, and can just as easily be broken when interests change. From my perspective, the SJW equality thing currently serves to keep the salaried class unified and the wage class divided based on race and religion. It serves the salary class's interests. Now, whether that is intentional or not, the fact remains that that has been its overall effect. It's widely known and reported that there is a black/brown division, and tensions between black &amp; brown--the LA County Sheriff has been unable to desegregate the jails despite repeated court orders to do so because of racial violence. The marriage of black &amp; brown politically is one of political expedience based on a fear &amp; suspicion by black &amp; brown of the white wage class. Someone could certainly come in and rearrange that by making the division "native/nonnative" or "English speaking/non-English speaking" or a non-racial class unity "wage class/salary class". Captive constituencies of either party who are tired of being taken for granted would probably LOVE to have their votes courted by the "other side" and not be quite so captive anymore. One sign that the US is really post-racial is if we finally get political parties cohesively based on class, like they have in Europe. One of the reasons we've never had strictly class based parties like they do in Europe is because of our history of racial divisions.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c9131438512172199758 title="comment permalink">3/11/16, 9:18 AM</a><br><br>

It doesn't fit the narrative the media like to push, the story they like to shape, so these cases are rarely if ever given much attention. For it to be a norm, is unacceptable to be happening to anyone. Further, or perhaps as important - what is his take on for-profit prisons and the 'school-to-prison-pipeline'. From some of the 'in-depth' news stories I've seen, this is also a result of the privatization of local judicial and penal systems. Small infractions or traffic missteps that drag one down into a never ending labyrinth of fines and penalties to outsourced collectors, often resulting in actual jail time. Yes, disproportionately affecting the black community, but by no means exclusive to it. It's targeting the poor and vulnerable and it's very scary.

(?) the response of "it doesn't bother me so much" which looks clearly to be Trump's attitude too, I can only GUESS may be another generational/experiential divide? When one has grown up with certain conditions, even privileges, 'You', (figurative you, not literal) tend to take them for granted even having been told of the hard struggle to achieve them before you were born. It's hard to imagine what it must have been like or that the continuation of these privileges or conditions is not inevitable. I know, I am certainly not immune, so I can't imagine anyone else being so either;( but I don't get it. I'm just guessing.)<br><br>e.g.: who doesn't take the concept of weekends for granted? Even if you work retail, definitely working weekends because most other people are off and so out to shop, even if you have to work weekends, you know you're working 'extra'. You have to dig a bit even now, to get a true picture of the early union struggles of the Wobblies, Matewan, Ludlow, Haymarket, the massacres, the murders - just how violent and hard, "to-the-death" that struggle to achieve livable working conditions was, including 2 days off at the end of the week. <br><br>So while I personally have memories of the civil rights struggles, Definitely of LGBT struggles, I can see that younger people might take them for granted or think the measure of social or racial equality achieved is a given and will always be there. I think this IS one place I disagree with our venerable host in his Retrotopia. While he states that there is no reason the social injustices of the past MUST come with reduced living conditions or technology of the past; I personally think - we baser humans will still probably 'eff' that up and return to the easy clannish divisions, (kind of like Dr. Seuss's 'Star-Bellied Sneetches') We really are suckers for those divisions. They seem to be a tendency of human nature. The social circles I find myself in now are of extremely multi-cultural global expats - they, (well, WE) all have some racial peccadilloes. Bar None. No question this expat circle is all of the higher end salaried class, (genteel-ly scratching their heads over the Trump phenomenon), but they all still have biological divisions of some sort or another as well.<br><br>re: your reply on "tolerance and equality", I couldn't presume to speak for the black wage class - it will indeed be very interesting to see how the votes turn out, what they and different groups or demographic constituencies think of this. I do agree that the divisions on biological lines have been pushed and exploited, by both parties, just using different rhetoric, for political and economic expedience. Of course the goals of social justice and civil rights did not start out as cynical ploys, but like kudzu, corruption grows on everything, right? <br><br>Off to reread 'The Brothers Karamazov' to glean tips on writing shorter, more concise answers.

With no differences, the parties are merely rival organizations for distributing graft and spoils, which makes them totally parasitic. <br><br>Sometimes class struggle comes into the differences. From the 1930s to the early 1970s, the Democratic Party was a friend of organized labor and vice versa; before and after, not so much. You express the hope that "Trump could somehow start to unify the black &amp; white wage class under one party." That might happen, but if so it will be accidental.<br><br>I've been watching Trump's speeches (not entire speeches, but long excerpts from them) since he got into the race. At first I was totally baffled by his appeal, because everything he said repulsed me or seemed illogical or both. However, I believe in democracy, so if someone appeals to voters and I don't understand why, I don't assume the voters are stupid or bigoted; I look for what I'm missing. <br><br>I've worked out that there are two things going on almost one hundred percent of the time in a Donald Trump speech. <br><br>The first was pointed out by others; I didn't catch it at first. Nearly everything Trump says and some of his body language is an assertion of dominance. Often he invites the audience to share the dominance by associating themselves with him. Sometimes his statements also convey some information which may or may not be true and sometimes they are nearly content-free. They always convey that Trump is the most dominant person in any category under consideration. Trump sometimes acknowledges challengers, but never rivals. Consequently, Trump appeals to people who understand life as a struggle to be on top.<br><br>The second is something I caught onto early on and it surprises me that no one else has mentioned it. Knowing Trump's background as an entertainer, it seems obvious. People hear the statements and themes in Trump's speeches and wonder whether he believes what he is saying. When one theme becomes more prominent in speeches or his expressed views change, they wonder what Trump's strategy is and whether he is making adjustments in response to the reactions he got from previous speeches. He is, but not in the way they think.<br><br>The contents of Trump's speeches made complete sense to me as soon as I figured out that his method is that of a stand-up comedian trying out new material with the goal of getting to Las Vegas. He does his act in small clubs and pays attention to what gets laughs. The comedian expands on those bits, makes them longer and more elaborate, and adds more material of that kind to his act. Any material that doesn't get laughs gets dropped. He keeps working on his material in front of live audiences and by the time he gets the Vegas gig his act is a smash. It might not resemble the material he used in the small clubs very much.<br><br>Trump is a pathological attention seeker. He wants adulation; if he can't get that, he'll settle on getting a rise. Trump's audiences are telling him what his views are, not the other way round. <br><br> <br><br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c1988975026143150666 title="comment permalink">3/11/16, 9:39 PM</a><br><br>

I was on a farm in Ontario over the summer, and the farmer had married an American from Ill. The Canadians just couldn't understand how much anxiety an interaction with the police would provoke in us Americans. How much anxiety we would have just over a routine traffic stop. Of course, we were both white, but, as you noted, police brutality is not limited to minorities, though they are the disproportionate recipients of it. The Canadian tradition of police as public servant, and my interactions with police there (OPP, Toronto) have been very refreshing compared with stateside.<br>The Trump rally in Cincy was cancelled, and I don't think I would feel safe going if there is another one close by soon. I don't know what to think of it all. How come the protestors aren't screened from the events? Why don't they have barricades and other safety features like when the pro- and anti-choice protestors get together for shouting matches? Trump is certainly feeding into the rage, yet I think he's just the vehicle and not the cause--he's just the messenger. I don't think either side means well. I certainly hope Bernie doesn't get shut out of the nomination, and that maybe Hillary gets indicted, b/c I will be very conflicted come November. After seeing all this, I'm now more certain than ever that JMG's prediction that Trump is the wage class's last stand for the political process, and that if Trump doesn't work out, then it's roadside bomb &amp; insurgency time. Honestly, hard as it may sound, Trump may actually be the LESS violent alternative...<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c6445974885618247978 title="comment permalink">3/12/16, 7:25 AM</a><br><br>

His definition is a bit circular though, since he came up with the idea by studying a lot of wars and their place in the 80-year cycle that JMG has mentioned a time or two. That's not quite the same thing as studying the 80-year cycle in a lot of different countries across history and seeing that they always have a Crisis War every 80 years or so. <br><br>Crisis Wars occur across a fault line, when the situation has gotten so intolerable that picking up a gun and starting shooting at the scapegoat du-jour seems to be the best way forward. There are possible futures where we come out the other end without a whole lot of bloodshed and with something positive, but it's not guaranteed.<br><br>As far as politics are concerned, I agree with Deborah Bender about what Trump is doing, and I also agree with Ted Cruz when he said that Trump is responsible for the climate he's creating, something that Trump seems to be in deep denial about.

West Chester is suburban Cincinnati and the rally was held in a suburban strip mall area. We've been having torrential rains lately, and I had to tromp through a sopping wet, muddy field to get to the line waiting. The crowd did not necessarily match the "other" that it has been caricatured as. Yes, it was mostly blue collar, white, wage class, but the people were generally neat, clean, and although casually dressed, not slovenly. Many of the women were wearing make up. There were few Kunstler "Honey Boo Boo" caricatures. The crowd seemed like a good representation of what you'd find where white wage class people gather, if not somewhat more put together. What surprised me was the age makeup of the crowd, there were quite a few younger people there, teenagers and young adults--I had expected the crowd to skew much older. I got in line behind a white guy talking with a Japanese couple who moved from Southern California--the white guy was praising how dependable Toyotas are, kinda surprising, considering Trump and his supporters stance on trade. An interesting thing was that the vendors selling Trump merchandise were of color, mostly black, but the were a few vendors who appeared to be Latino. I did not interact with the protestors, as I wanted to try to get in to the rally, and was not there to protest. What little I saw of them, they seemed conventional urban, pachouli &amp; weed, left leaning. There were fewer protestors than I expected.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c2909780373454039006 title="comment permalink">3/14/16, 9:10 AM</a><br><br>

Their signs were mostly too cluttered to be read @ a distance (basic graphic design--few words in bold, contrasting colors). I couldn't really make out what they were chanting. They seemed to be contained to an oval shaped area in front of the building. I was expecting violence, and was prepared to flee at any moment if something broke out, and had I made it inside, I would've grabbed a spot in the back by an exit to be safe. Only one protestor was taken out of this rally. I'd come this far, so I decided to wait it out--we thought they were letting more people in as other people left, and, if a protest broke out, there might've have been a chance they'd let others in. I was kinda just taking it all in, being the eyes and ears to all of it. I was in line w/a Kasich supporter who lived nearby. I was surprised to find there was common ground to discuss: Hillary's corruption and sense of entitlement, bad trade deals, Wall Street. In addition to the number of teenagers &amp; young adults there, I was also surprised at how many families were there--I don't consider Trump suitable for children, and considering the likelihood of violence, I wouldn't feel safe bringing children to a Trump rally. I was next to one young girl, probably 10 or so, who asked her dad, "why do they COME here, Daddy, why don't they go to their OWN rally, instead of coming to ours?" (regarding the protestors) There was some yelling across lines between protestors &amp; supporters, but, overall, not much violence. One black woman who I thought was there for the rally was later about 500 ft back from the building, facing the line &amp; the building, yelling and giving the finger (some other person, who I think was black, seemed to be holding her back)<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c7388538238749755741 title="comment permalink">3/14/16, 9:33 AM</a><br><br>

People who release a banner from a balcony can expect security to confiscate the banner and escort them out.<br>6. To sum up, people who attend a political meeting of their opponents are permitted to interrupt the meeting briefly without suffering any consequences other than being told to shut up or being escorted out. People who cause major disruptions or attempt to shut the meeting down can definitely expect to be escorted out, and if they don't cooperate, be arrested for disturbing the peace.<br><br>These are the customary boundaries, and like other customs, some people never learn the customs and some deliberately violate them. In the current Trump campaign, there have been violations by some (not all) of the protestors, some (not all) of the hired security, some (not all) of the police. <br><br>Trump has been giving mixed messages to the audiences attending his rallies. On the one hand, he has been instructing them to surround protestors and chant "Trump, Trump," or "USA, USA". That is a nonviolent way of dealing with organized protestors whose intent is to shut down the meeting. I don't see anything much wrong with it.<br><br>OTOH, Trump has also been inciting his followers to violence against protestors, which is not only a violation of American custom, it's illegal. The other night, a sheriff actually considered bringing charges against Trump for violence at his rally, although in the end he didn't charge him.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c1469233373796696784 title="comment permalink">3/15/16, 3:51 PM</a><br><br>

Ohio Highway Patrol had the entrances to the venue blocked by their cop cars and were monitoring the intersection as I left. West Chester police and Butler Co. sheriffs were monitoring the crowds, protestors, and guarding the door to the venue. I was concerned about how law enforcement would respond, and how forceful they would be, but they seemed in a good mood, respectful, cordial, talking and cutting up w/those waiting. I was not as close to the protestors, but did not see any altercations between law enforcement and protestors. There were the normal number of conspiracy nuts passing out various tracts, one was some anti-Papist, anti-Catholic paranoia, the other seemed to be a more mainstream "get saved" tract. As I said before, the protestors did not seem organized, but I did notice one guy flying an American &amp; Mexican flag bound together, and another guy in a Mexico olympic style jacket. There was some sneering about Sanders among those waiting in line in response to the protestors, and people derisively saying "feel the Bern" in a sarcastic way.<br>Commentary:<br>Observing the protestors, all I could think about was JMG's post "The Suicide of the American Left", and just how tired, bankrupt, and disconnected from reality what passes for "left" is today. I assume that most of the protestors come from salary or investment class backgrounds--trustafarians. Also, I was reminded of JMG's posts of how meaningless the labels of "left" and "right" are politically, that they only function for one group of people to line up on one side of a line and yell "fascist", "racist", &amp; "bigot" (snarl words meaning "I hate you") at the other side, while the other side yells "commie" (another snarl word meaning "I hate you") This is exactly what happened in West Chester. To me, the meaninglessness of the labels "left" and "right" have reached an apex this year as you have two insurgent candidates with similar views and positions on Wall Street corruption, trade, tariffs, jobs/outsourcing, and the establishment, who, nevertheless, line up on opposite "sides" of the faux "right/left" divide and yell and sometimes even punch each other. The fact that this divide cannot be bridged in spite of similar attitudes on important issues shows how far things have come since both white Southerners, Jews, and black people were part of the New Deal Coalition of the Democratic party.<br>I don't think that West Chester was representative of a normal Trump rally as far as how peaceful it was. Only one protestor was taken out of the rally. There seemed to be fewer protestors. I'm thinking this is related to the nature of where the rally was held. Cincinnati has a reputation of being one of the most conservative, most staunchly Republican, cities in the nation. While most of Kentucky was a part of the "Solid South" and overwhelmingly Democratic, Northern KY stood out as Kentucky's version of Orange Co. (Calif.)--rock, ribbed, solidly Republican, and very wealthy. The Cincinnati suburbs on the Ohio side are the same, if not more so. John Boehner is from suburban Clermont Co. "Mr. Republican", Sen. Robert Taft, of Taft-Hartley Act fame, was from Cincinnati, and his home is a museum there. This is the city that shut down the Maplethorpe exhibit and arrested the museum's curator. So while there are eclectic neighborhoods like Clifton near UC, I'm not sure if Cincy has as much of a "progressive" base to draw from for protestors as other, more liberal cities.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c4809962299869452479 title="comment permalink">3/16/16, 9:07 AM</a><br><br>

I don't think Trump is playing to the "Southern strategy"--I don't see any Willie Hortons or gay baiting/bashing. Trump is playing with fire, feeding his supporters rage and anger, but he is trying to thread the needle--he is trying to keep his supporters anger focused on the elite and the establishment, and away from other scapegoats. His rhetoric is narrowly focused on the protestors disrupting his rallies, not the groups that they belong to. His rhetoric is that of a mobster, thug or tough man, which is disturbing in and of its own right, but not necessarily bigoted. For years, intellectuals have lamented that the white working class have abandoned their economic interests in favor of politicians who pander to their social anxieties, i.e. the "Southern strategy"--now, you finally have a candidate that is focusing with laser precision on their economic interests and carefully NOT pandering to their social anxieties, and, yet, pundits are still using "Southern strategy" narrative to describe Trump, if not more so. I know the optics of ethnic protestors fighting w/white supporters looks bad, but I'm not willing to judge on that alone. We do know that progressive organizations sympathetic to Bernie Sanders are behind a lot of the protests, and a lot of them seem to be of color. What we also know is that black and Latino people have overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton over Sanders in the primaries, so I'm not sure how representative progressive Sanders supporters of color are of the ethnic groups they come from. If anything, they're not very politically representative at all, black &amp; Latino voters so far seem way more conservative than Sanders supporters, based on voting patterns so far.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c1120261617278250806 title="comment permalink">3/16/16, 9:31 AM</a><br><br>

The media continues attacking him for racism, promoting violence, telling lies, and it just strengthens his supporters. Reading through comments people post on his Facebook page, they truly believe Trump is the only one who will save this country. I would encourage everyone to go and read them. Every post by Trump has hundreds to thousands of replies and I've been quite moved by what people have written. They know the television and internet media, newspapers, elected government officials, and corporations have been working together to manipulate them for years. They are really fed up with being told what to do by someone with a college degreed management position and end up still with not enough paycheck, job shipped overseas, too high of taxes, cruddy schools, cruddy medical care, and corrupt police and government bureaucrats.<br><br>My right wing friends are so excited about Trump. My liberal friends are threatening to move out of the country. I keep running out of popcorn.<br><br>Looking at the Republican convention in Cleveland, if I had a house there, I would move everything valuable out of it and relocate for the week at least 100 miles away. There is no way Trump's supporters are going to let the nomination go to anyone else. They are going to be gathering in the streets and I'm suspecting they will be armed, unlike the Black Lives Matter protestors. If Homeland Security puts up a wall around the city and shuts down all roads like they did to Philadelphia for the Pope visit, well, it will be even uglier in terms of level of emotion of the protestors and the response. <br><br>The thought of Rance Priebus running away from an unruly mob of white people with automatic weapons is entertaining.....anyway.....<br><br>Now I am wondering if that kind of pro-Trump protest will pop up in other cities around the country. Black Lives Matter protests certainly happen in many cities regularly because sadly there are very few police departments that haven't killed unarmed people. What would Trump supporters use as a symbol to protest against? Would it finally be the banks? TV stations? Government buildings?<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c9061845498534127240 title="comment permalink">3/16/16, 12:15 PM</a><br><br>

He's already released an attack ad of her barking like a dog this morning. Its only 5 seconds long and on Instagram but its incredibly effective at making her look awful.

And she can only play the sexism/female card so many times. I'm predicting she'd only pull 22-25% in the general election come November.

This makes us a nice target and makes it hard for us to defend Canada's territory if push comes to shove. I don't honestly like how much we've cosied up to China already, as I don't like how much control they seem to want over our resources, or how much influence I think they have in Ottawa and in the Oil Sands.<br><br>I wouldn't want to go up against China with Australia and Japan as allies. For one thing, I don't believe any of us have nuclear weapons, and we are all very distant from each other physically. Australia and Canada also produce enough similar products, such as farm and mine products, that means a certain amount of economic competition between us. <br><br>In some ways I wish we could do the isolationist thing, but I doubt we'd be allowed to if we tried.<br><br>An agreement with Russia would be a bit hard to get, given past historical alliances and the cold war. We are also in economic competition with products such as fossil fuels and food. They are a lot more powerful than we are militarily, and I think they would rapidly end up very dominant in such an alliance. I'd want other countries involved in such a thing as well to dilute their influence.<br><br>Commonwealth status... it becomes less relevant with each passing year. I suppose it might be useful if a bunch of countries decided they wanted to make it work. At the moment it is a bit like the human appendix. It used to be important, but these days it doesn't do much and I tend to forget about it - with one exception. Canada is still strongly legally connected to Britain, and Queen Elizabeth is still our queen. This seems like more of an anachronism as time passes and fewer of the people in Canada have close personal connections to Britain. At the moment there's still enough for there to be an emotional attachment to England and the crown, but it is noticeably weaker than when I grew up.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c5663517511903005322 title="comment permalink">3/18/16, 2:19 PM</a><br><br>

It pretty much goes like this: Trump panders to the white wage class, stokes their anger, and rides this into the White House. Once in office, he sells out, says basically "psych, sorry suckers!" and continues BAU. There's absolutely no logic to this. The same thing is behind all the fantastic schemes to deny him the nomination at the convention. Here's the brick wall that all this runs into: the RNC, as senile an elite as it may be, certainly is aware of the implications of scheming to deny Trump the nomination @ the convention, and will acquiesce in due time if nothing more than to keep the peace &amp; prevent widespread violence. Trump, having cultivated this anger, certainly knows the implications if he sells out in office. Trump's supporters are not like Sanders or Obama's supporters--they can fully be expected to resort to violence if their preferred candidate sells out. Any sort of sell out scenario that doesn't take this into account is delusional, IMHO. I think this comes from people who have made a God/Satan out of the neoliberal consensus, and doesn't realize that it is manmade, not a God/Satan, and therefore, fallible.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c7184247039888882540 title="comment permalink">3/19/16, 1:16 PM</a><br><br>

Brooks said if he had had a conversation with people who earn hourly wages he would have gotten a clue of how much they are hurting. Nice confession he wrote and said, and still hasn't had the conversations with anyone. And I laugh because it is just so absurd. Yes David Brooks, your writings don't represent anyone but the narrow circle of people you associate with in Washington.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c1885898691498037273 title="comment permalink">3/21/16, 4:52 AM</a><br><br>

The power isn't in the Congress. Its been stuck and ineffective for the past dozen years. If they were doing their job, we wouldn't be bombing civilians with drones and invading countries with oil (done without Congress's vote on it). The only thing they can agree to do is NOT do their job - budget stalemate, and now Supreme Court nomination. Its so obvious that Obamacare only got through because the lobbyists paid off both sides because the corporations would profit.<br><br>So to go back to the RNC, they made Donald Trump sign a pledge that he would not become a third party candidate. They assumed they could defeat him in the Republican primaries. But they have not. The media coverage is hysterically funny because Trump will get 30 or 40% of the vote in a field of 5 or 3, and the broadcaster will say "this doesn't mean anything". If it was anyone else, it would be fawned over - the people love him, he support is all grass roots, and on and on.<br><br>The media has been priming the pump for violence come convention time. They said Trump said it, and yes he made an off-handed comment, they act like it was a multiple point reasoned argument. The RNC is counting on that violence by Trump supporters. They will have their talking points ready so you'll see John McCain, Romney, Ryan, and whoever else thinks they have a future with this failing party, stand in front of the cameras and say "its shameful that this man inspires this in people. We can't have a president who does this." blah blah blah. <br><br>Then the real protests begin all over the country. Taking the nomination from Trump will be seen as "not fair" and Americans have this overly large sense of fairness. I suspect his support will triple at that point. A political party will be demonstrating that the votes of the people do not matter in whom the party selects as a candidate. People feel this to be true and now they will have proof. <br><br>Does Trump run third party? I don't know the rules in each state if he can. I don't know if a candidate has to file in all states in order to win the presidency. My electoral college knowledge is not all there but I'm sure there will be "think pieces" from our glorious press soon enough on it.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c2875300728467814976 title="comment permalink">3/22/16, 4:57 AM</a><br><br>

It might be an open question how big a navy they would be able to build. While Chinese people are known for their personal frugality, I can't help but notice that Chinese civilization seems to me to be extremely resource intensive, even by profligate American standards. The Huang Ho, one of the world's great rivers is said to be two feet wide at its' mouth. Imagine the destruction to the former delta. Us dumb Americans just ran out of money; chickens ain't got no more feathers; even if we wanted to, we can't spend anymore, so folks who might have based their prosperity on our spending habits are out of luck. BTW, that reality is what is behind the increasingly shrill cries of "comparative privilege". As for Japan not having nuclear weapons, I very much doubt that the world's best engineers have not come up with some next generation form of defense, and, no, it wasn't hidden at Fukushima. Some hunk of rock in the Pacific would be my guess, probably north of the typhoon belt.<br><br>Dear Varun Bhaskar, I did not include India, a country I much admire, in my speculations because I don't see India as having a strategic interest in the Pacific Ocean. Perhaps you could explain why I am wrong about that. I do tend to think that India will re-emerge as the dominant power in the Indian Ocean, perhaps in alliance with Indonesia, just as I believe it was for millennia.<br><br>Emerging hegemonic powers enjoy great prestige during the centuries or decades of their rise. See for example the prophet Isaiah on the rise of Cyrus the Persian. The Senate and People of Rome were so well thought of that Hellenistic monarchs actually willed their kingdoms to the Roman Republic, in spite of details like the destruction of Carthage and Corinth. This kind of prestige the Chinese, it seems to me, have already blown away by their conduct as people and as a country. It turns out that the ugly Chinese is at least as bad if not worse than the ugly American or Brit. Chinese investment in your country turns out to mean the importation of tens of thousands of Chinese into your country, with demands on your resources, especially water, illegal mining, poaching and so on. <br><br>About the election, I think there might be some extremely cynical calculation taking place in the upper echelons of the Democratic Party, to the effect that the GOP will do whatever it takes, including asassination, to take out Trump and then the Democrats' very unpopular candidate gets to clean up in the wake of GOP disarray.<br><br>Dear Shane W, I would invite you to consider that fascist movements usually don't arise without some kind of (hidden) elite support--you do remember the ties between one Prescott Bush, and friends, and the National Socialists of Germany? This kind of support the self styled progressives do not have nor are they likely to attract it. As for Trump and the bankers, whom do you think financed his real estate ventures? Through four! bankruptcies? I would suggest that part of the story of this year's elections is fighting among various factions of the oligarchy itself, the neo-cons backing Clinton, Wall Street backing Trump, and various factions of the military Deep State waiting it out. <br><br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c1045585041978787572 title="comment permalink">3/22/16, 9:30 AM</a><br><br>

Much of this fight, though, is an over-simplification of the problem. The US started on the path of empire many, many generations ago (at the very least, the McKinley administration, though one could argue that it goes back as far as the 1830s and 1840s), so the backside of empire that we are experiencing now is as much the consequence of those decisions as they are of any that the Boomer generation made.<br><br>Re: the Trump issue, I am for Sanders, but I do see Trump as the least dislikeable of the remaining bunch. (I asked once who'd I pick between Trump and Cruz -- I said Trump, hands down. I'll take bombastic arrogance over theocratic arrogance any day.) Between Trump and Clinton, it is as much a question of who's positions are the least bad.

One of the first rules of business is to risk someone else money before your own. If one has a mortgage outstanding or a business loan or a board of directors - then one is beholden to banks or at a minimum, the financial asset class. You basically own the business in name, but the bank or financial house is the true owner, as they put up the capital.

It's the only choice with any chance of success, the least reckless, and certainly the cheapest. Like the containment policy directed against the USSR, the goal is harm reduction until conditions become favorable for regime change. Unlike the Soviet Union, I do not expect the end game to take seventy years; they are already at the Brezhnev stage.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c568191010320604085 title="comment permalink">3/25/16, 2:20 AM</a><br><br>

I have no idea what a SJW might be when it's at home. If you are referring to various shrill factions of the Democratic Party, do realize that those very factions are about to get their heads handed to them, on account of having made extremely foolish bets on the Clinton candidacy. <br><br>If Sanders can pull out a miracle and gain the nomination he wins the general, if only because the Republicans are not about to put their vote stealing apparatus at Trump's disposal. In that event, the Clintonistas will hardly be on short lists for appointments. And that means, those factions, if that is whom you mean, will no longer be able to stymie legislation and executive action on issues which are important to some of the rest of us, such as environmental protection and regulation of genetic engineering technology, revival of water and rail transport and so on. <br><br>I do not see Clinton being elected at all, even taking into account the Democrats vote stealing apparatus. In which case, I think the Sanders supporters will bolt and form their own party. If they have the sense to seek alliances with some of the groups the Democrats recently been ignoring, like environmentalists and good food activists, to name just two, they have a winning coalition. I find it interesting to note that a few up and coming Democrats are rather publicly declining to endorse Mrs. Clinton (Merkley, D-OR) or publicly feuding with the party leadership, (US Admiral, Ret., and former Congressman Joe Sestak, currently favored to win the nomination for the Senate from Penn.) Both of these men are persons of substance and accomplishment and either would be a believable standard bearer for a new party in a general election. The great weakness of third parties recently has been their inability to field candidates who are not either crazy drama queens (Buchanan) or nose in the air academics (Stein). <br><br>Then there is future president he thinks and hero of his own movie Ben Sasse who is promising to lead a convention walkout if or when Trump is nominated. The GOP, who hate Trump, will naturally put its entire apparatus at his disposal, and as we all know, most of the electorate, other than the above mentioned factions, can't stand Clinton. And if a Sasse or someone similar is elected, I think the Sandersistas still bolt.<br><br>My point Shane W., was that an effective fascist is always backed up with a para-military party, like National Socialists, which he will have spent the previous 10 years building up, and an ideology to motivate that party. Restore American Greatness is an advertising slogan, not an ideology. Trump has never displayed the patience to work for a goal ten years out.<br><br>So, get out the popcorn or nibbles and beverage of your choice, maybe send a little cash wherever you like, and watch the show with the rest of us.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c6782037015190496611 title="comment permalink">3/25/16, 8:57 AM</a><br><br>

I'd be interested to know what other commenters make of it. One of the reasons I like this blog so much is that we seem to be all over the political spectrum, and we can discuss issues in terms of sustainability and limits here. <br>From the interview I got the impression that Trump is either interested in a topic or he is not. He seems to be focused and practical about some foreign policy and military issues, and then drift into rambling incoherence on social issues. The one question I wish they had asked is what he wants to do about American infrastructure. He says we need jobs, that spending trillions on foreign wars is foolish, and comments on the sorry state of American infrastructure that he sees when returning from overseas. He says he likes to build things. I would have asked, "are you thinking of a large federal program, CCC style, to train people and build what we really need?" <br>Several people here have mentioned the possible irrelevance of this election, taking a long term view. I at least partially disagree because some of what we do now will leave an imprint on future versions of North America. All empires leave repercussions far beyond their lifetimes and a future Lakeland Republic may be glad that we put in certain infrastructure and preserved environmental and cultural resources. <br>@Patricia Mathews. Regarding Eisenhower, I would vote for him over the candidates we have now. As Supreme Commander he always looked at the long range, big picture. He meticulously prepared, never took unnecessary risks, was averse to collateral damage, and continuously reigned in his more reckless colleagues like Patton and Montgomery. These are good qualities for a President, and seem to be lacking in most of the candidates who are prone to slap together whatever position will work for them at the moment.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c8218183441781175129 title="comment permalink">3/25/16, 4:33 PM</a><br><br>

It seems that an astro-turf lobbying group ran an attack ad featuring a salacious picture of Trump's wife. Cruz of course claimed that the group was an independent organization with no link to Cruz's campaign. Yah, right. Like anyone's falling for that particular load of malarky.<br><br>Well, now someone just leaked a bunch of info to the National Enquirer about Cruz's alleged extramarital affairs. <br><br>http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/breaking-ted-cruz-sex-scandal-appears-looming/<br><br>http://crooksandliars.com/2016/03/national-enquirer-claims-have-scoop-ted<br><br>http://gawker.com/people-have-been-talking-about-the-thing-with-ted-cru-1767029781<br><br>Personally, I think Cruz's people made a really stupid move in attacking Trump's wife. Trump doesn't play by the rules, he fights fire with fire. Shane compared Trump's rhetoric aimed at the protesters attempting to disrupt his rallies to those of a mobster, thug or dockyard tough. I think Cruz is finding out that if you start a fight with Trump like he did, Trump will punch back even harder, he isn't afraid to fight dirty and he really couldn't care less what the chattering classes, the Social Justice Warriors and the perpetually offended activists say about him.<br><br>No doubt that will turn some people off, but I think will draw a lot of support as well because it reinforces Trump's image as a tough guy and a strong leader who isn't afraid to do what must be done and can't be bullied. Most people understand instinctively that in times of crisis, strong leadership is what is needed. In much the same way, Putin's tough guy image is one of the major reasons for his popularity, and not just among Russians.<br><br>PS - Why is it that so many of these Christian conservative politicians and preachers have a whole bunch of skeletons in the closet, usually of a sexual nature?

If the aim of the third party organizing is merely to create an effective pressure group, the ethnic or racial makeup of the group can be anything. <br><br>I interpret "winning coalition" to mean the ability to get politicians who are loyal supporters of its interests elected as a majority or at least a veto proof minority in one house of Congress, or the ability to defeat any Presidential candidate who opposes them outright. I think that requires reducing one of the existing major parties to third party status. The Republican Party is not currently vulnerable to a challenge from left of center, so your coalition has to take down the Democrats, and that will not happen while most African Americans and a plurality of other non-whites are voting Democratic. <br><br>The history of American third parties (e.g. Socialist, Farmer-Labor, American Independent) indicates that such a party can achieve some success at the local and state level, but on the national level the major parties will either refuse to enter into coalitions or will sabotage their coalition partner. The USA does not have a parliamentary system and under the setup we have, only the top two get power over Congress.<br><br>Apart from the hypothetical Fascist Party of the Middle, I think the best strategy (albeit a very difficult and probably bloody one) for a third party to replace one of the existing parties would be for that party to put its highest priority on two things: devolving power back to the states and to voluntary compacts among states, and changing the legal framework in which corporations operate. Those are ideological positions, not slogans of convenience. If those were serious aims and not a bait-and-switch, they would be radical demands which would create an entirely new coalition, including social conservatives and some of the more radical elements in the environmental community.<br><br> It should go without saying that unlike the various minor hobby parties we have right now, the organizing strategy for such a party must concentrate on organizing and electoral politics at the local level, move from there up to the states, and leave national politics alone until it has both popular and institutional support in the states.<br><br>What I'm describing is utterly a castle in the air at the present time.

This is one series where Blankenhorn has a good grip on things, I think because he's dealing in concrete observation instead of pie-in-the-sky futurism. <br><br>Of course, as one of my friends pointed out, both Trumpistan and Techville" are also Guyville. In fact, an article on why black women are backing Hillary pointed out that the very aspects of Hillary that make her unpopular with a good many people, hit a lot of the black women's buttons dead-on. A strong woman, who has been much battered by insults and scorn and a cheating husband, who has stood up to all that and is still standing, resonates with their own experience very strongly. <br><br>It didn't help that The Guardian had a really stupid article on what Bill's role would be. Their first question, harking back 30 years ago over here, was "What would he be called?" That one has been settled this side of the pond for years; "First Gentleman." That's the title used in states where the governor is a woman, and if The Guardian doesn't know that (or isn't just taking cheap shots)they have reached surprising depths of ignorance.<br><br>Their second, asked in the same snickering tone one got in lady-president sitcoms from decades ago, was, essentially, "would he be asked to do wifey things?" Showing a total cluelessness about Bill's known strengths: schmoozing, glad-handing, speechifying, and all that good PR stuff; the flower arranging and hostessing would almost certainly be outsourced. <br><br>Finally, it notes that both Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama have been slammed for being too string, not 'wifey' enough.

JMG discussed this quite a while back when discussing the implosion of the left, and in posts since then. It's kind of gotten into a navel gazing, self-referential loop that is very disconnected with reality. To me, they're not taking into account the inherent limitations of Western industrial civilization and its inherently unequal, imperial nature. JMG discussed this in the original posts. There's only so much equality you can achieve in an inherently unequal imperial system. Even MLK has that famous quote late in his life, before he was shot, where he laments "leading his people into a burning church"--he understood the inherent problems with Western industrial society. The whole SJW thing is just window dressing that has nothing to do with structurally changing things. And it taps into that hideous American hypocrisy that allows things like Prohibition, the 55 MPH speed limit, and other things to continue way past their pull date. That's why people are so apoplectic about Trump--it isn't so much what he says or does--I've seen worse from self-identified SJW's, but that he doesn't give deference publicly to the whole PC SJW demands. Also, you have a difference between people like JMG, who believe that the changes in society regarding race and sexuality are structural, and not subject to change, vs. the SJW's, who see these as tentative changes that will revert any moment they stop being vigilant.<br>I'm very eager to read JMG's education post. He seems to think that many prestigious institutions will go under when the student loan bubble pops. I'm wondering if the popping of the student loan bubble will also deflate the whole SJW insanity as well.<br>As the whole "Trump--racist, bigot, Nazi" thing heats up, I'm reminded of what JMG said in his original post about the only differences Americans are comfortable talking about being those w/some basis in biology. I guess this is just the SJW's way of reframing the discussion in terms they're more comfortable with, while ignoring the underlying class issues JMG brought up. Also, you see this when Sanders is pressured to reframe his class differences/inequality in racial terms.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c3722366792299631564 title="comment permalink">3/28/16, 6:14 AM</a><br><br>

Another way is to insist on simple courtesy, keeping one's tone and posture neutral while not projecting fear, use of statements like I don't think I know you. or My name is not honey or sweetie, can be quite useful. You should never, IMHO, try to "win" an argument you have not yourself begun.

And, it should go without saying, don't give angry people an opening. Keep hands and feet to oneself, mouth shut and eyes looking elsewhere is not being "fearful", it is a strategy to make someone have to work at initiating a confrontation.

I moved to Indonesia, lived there for 4 years, moved to Sweden a bit over a year ago.<br><br>People here talk about what happens in the US affecting Europe, but I can't help but think the influence is going the other direction this time.<br><br>When I arrived in Sweden, I started work for a consulting company that had me commuting 5 days a week over the Swedish/Danish border (the Orsund Bridge). My family moved up in September. I started to see people glaring at my (mixed-race) kids. I began to see racism.<br><br>Then in November everything changed. I remember sitting at my office at the client's site and getting a panicked call from my son (12 years old), telling me that the trains had been cancelled and he couldn't get home (we live about 50km from where he goes to school).. Because there were weather advisories, I called my wife, told her I was leaving then, and she should wait to hear from me further. I assumed the closures were weather-related. I was wrong. It took me over an hour to get to Malmo, where I was greeted by police demanding to see ID. It took me 2 hours to get to the school from Copenhagen including this delay. My son was waiting in the school building but everyone was leaving. The train lines were all listed as cancelled because the timetables had been thrown out of whack by a decision to enact emergency measures and put border controls in place. The Paris attacks occurred within the next week. And now the border seems more or less permanent. My Swedish ID card is not enough -- I am told I have to show my passport and residency permit every time I enter Sweden (which is now down to 3 days a week).<br><br>This got me thinking about the political changes going on in Europe, where we have seen a rise of far-right and far-left parties over the last couple years. The old center-right and center-left parties are declining and the old far-right and far-left parties are ascendant. But what the formerly extreme parties have in common is different than what the formerly center parties have in common. We are seeing a shift, I think, from neoliberalism to a nationalist communitarianism that is deeply skeptical of the EU. Matters in Europe are made worse by the way that the Franco-German powers want to set EU policy on things like immigration or debt, and make those at the margins pay for it and so parties both right and left on the margins of the EU are rebelling both against the current arrangement (the Dublin Agreements) and against Merkel's proposals to change them (by giving resources to the margins in exchange for even more central control over these issues).<br><br>I watch Trump and Sanders and think that there is something similar going on in the US, a shift away from mass immigration and free trade towards, dare I say protectionism and a larger social safety net, and that what was center is no longer center.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c6974621865006373640 title="comment permalink">3/30/16, 10:14 PM</a><br><br>

It's nothing new. The Millenials were going to blame the Boomers for most of what they see wrong. That was baked into the cake from day one and, from what I see of the 80-year cycle, a lot of it's perfectly justified. In fact, I happen to agree with them from the other end of the spectrum (at 72, I'm a Silent, not a Boomer, and I got to see them ripping up a working system up close and personal).<br><br>That's not, however, a very productive attitude to take. We have problems, they need solutions, and to quote the sign on Harry S. Truman's desk: "The buck stops here."

India is one of those countries that is full of surprises. There are some hopeful signs. The Modi administration has enacted a bunch of programs to clean the rivers, plant trees, dig 500,000 rain-water harvesting ponds in rural areas, push an organic "green revolution," and improve water conservation.

How did the Romans or the Egyptians move all those heavy stone blocks thousands of years ago? The low-tech site has the information, without resorting to space aliens and such. <br><br>The analogy is obvious, as it is used frequently in introductory courses on electricity -- [ pressure &lt;=&gt; voltage ], and [ fluid volume &lt;=&gt; current ]. And viscous/frictional losses are similar to resistance. The reason electricity won the contest is obvious: all those heavy cast iron pipes are hard to install, hard to maintain, and relatively expensive compared to simply stringing a length of copper wire. And the analogue of a transformer is a messy arrangement of pistons. On the plus side, a water leak is less dangerous than a bare wire (given that the pressure isn't too terribly high)<br><br>I pictured it as a power solution in Retrotopia.

It's already too long, but to help keep it slightly shorter, I've made some generalizations. I accept that they do not apply to everyone, and apologies in advance to those folks here for whom they don't apply. I still think the generalization of "we" is OK, as societally, it applies. These folks are and were sadly, the outliers.<br><br>The other night I watched "The Big Short" with my teens. Very happy they were able to follow and got the basic schematic of what happened in the housing market collapse. My older one pointed out to me something astoundingly fundamental that I missed. A kind of 'Elephant in the Room', the thing we all knew and know, but I think, many of us don't really take note of.<br><br>Everyone had their hand out. Everyone, from top to bottom thought only of themselves. Everyone thought in a narrow, short term gain myopia.<br><br>Everyone refused to see the big picture because they were looking out for #1 and #1 only. The film and book are very worthwhile for breaking down a complicated process clearly for us lay-people to grasp, but equally worthwhile in that through the storyline - we saw and 'met' participants in the whole scheme from top to bottom. There were the poor schlubs who bought too much house because they were told they could flip it fast and get rich, the local mortgage brokers who laundered the schlubs's credit to profit off of the sales, the middle players to the big players. Even those savants, prescient enough foresee the collapse turned their immediate attention into shorting - "how can I profit on this information?", not "Holy cr@p! How can stop or mitigate this disaster, this looming catastrophe for all!?"<br><br>I'm coming to the conclusion, (&amp; yes, I may be very slow on the uptake) that if we Boomers, X'ers, (and we are not alone in this, Millennials - suck it up - you are right behind us in the same boat of guilt); if we are guilty COLLECTIVELY of screwing it all up - this is at the root of it.

It wasn't even integrated into social studies or history classes. It wasn't a "thing". I remember a multitude of tiny examples of shunning 'collectivism', or individual sacrifice for communal good. e.g.: I never heard anything about taxes other than what an evil they were and to be thwarted any way possible. Even amongst the most 'virtuous' of adults, no one saw anything wrong with skirting or cheating on their taxes if they could get away with it. On the contrary, they were simply thought of as foolish if they didn't take every single exemption possible, access every single loophole they could. Even as a kid, I thought that didn't make sense. This is a mindset. This mindset was ubiquitous almost unanimous in the pre-Reagan years - so when Grover Norquist made that famous statement about drowning Govt. in the bathtub - it was largely embraced. When Reagan himself said "Govt. IS the problem", it was largely embraced. another e.g. is the recent and current derision of 'other' voters for "Not voting their own interests". WHY is not voting in your own interest a bad thing necessarily!? The refrain was not "Being duped into voting for the shysters who plunder our country", it was "Not voting your own interests".<br><br> In our world view we embraced the cowboy fantasy of the strong self reliant rugged individual, but it IS just a fantasy. Pioneers and cowboys of the old west were deeply interdependent on their small communities, on each other. In a harsh unforgiving land, they wouldn't have survived without being so. Even the trappers and mountain men were intermittently interdependent on each other and often native American tribes in their vicinity. So rugged self reliance and individuality must walk hand in hand with collectivism/community, with interdependence for us to thrive. I don't think it's a big leap to say Capitalism must walk hand in hand with socialism/communism - and so it is with all economic systems throughout history. They were and are all mixed to some degree or another. They don't work on their own, but that is not represented in our underlying world view.<br><br>The world view that it's everyone for him/herself, championing individual gain over anything else permeates our micro and macro decisions. We (well, we smarter-than-thou-Liberal) "Vote our own interests", we shop for the lowest prices, even if they're in a going out of business sale or at Walmart - undercutting our jobs and communities, (yes, I know there are people who are exceptions to this re: Walmart specifically.) So pushed further - I think this explains why the Schlubs could so easily be convinced to knowingly buy more than they could afford. This explains why the mortgage brokers eagerly laundered credit for them, knowing that what they were doing was shady, if not illegal.

There are a number of Millenials that are blind with rage. Not listening to rational arguments, not concerned with fairness. The only good senior citizen is a dead senior citizen, and senior citizenhood starts at about age 40. Then the Millenials can have all the goodies for themselves, as they deserve, instead of seeing others with more than they have. This is certainly not all the Millenials, it's a small portion, but with rage far out of proportion to their numbers. And in the US, of course, most of them are armed. The eventual destination of overblown feelings of entitlement is a towering rage that the promised goodies have not materialized.

It's not that I fully disagree. I ran into a 70-year-old lady recently and came away thinking, boy it would indeed be great if this type would sit this one out and get out of the way. It's just that there are also plenty of 70-year-olds who are not like that at all.<br><br>Yesterday we went with our friends to look at the first farm they bought here in 1973 as part of the back to the land movement, largely fueled by the loss of McGovern to the presidency instead of Nixon. They moved here on April Fool's Day so it was the 43rd anniversary. If you haven't seen roads like this it might be hard to imagine. They bought a place at the head of a hollow with about 3 miles of unpaved road with such big ruts in it, and probably mud, that they had to put snow chains on their truck to get up the road. Keep in mind that it's steep. They used to do really hard things, like get out big mallets and try to break up rocks to put in the holes in the road to make it better. The husband had a job using a scythe up steep hillsides in the summer to clear electric path lines. One time a friend brought a girlfriend out to see the place, and my neighbor was washing outside in cold water using a washboard. The girlfriend freaked out.<br><br>But there was a little, narrow hollow running up the side of that property, with a tiny rivulet stream and soft spring grass, quite magical. We ate wild flowers there and I sensed a perfect fairy land.

We're the smallest generation, I believe, even smaller than the Silents (you all have been nicknamed "the Lucky Few", FWIW). I think you hit a nail on the head w/the entitlement issue. The millennials are the peak of a trend in permissive, entitled parenting that started with Dr. Spock &amp; the Boomers &amp; hit critical mass with the Millennials. It's almost the polar opposite of the "I'm hard on you, but the world's gonna be MUCH harder on you" kind of strict, old-fashioned parenting my 101 year-old grandfather received. Millennials have the misfortune of being the most coddled, most overpromised, overprotected generation at a time when those are the most lethal qualities to raise a child, when the old-fashioned "hard on you" parenting is what is needed for our future. That's the one recurring theme in my encounters with millennials, white-hot, seething rage.

The standard breakpoint between Silent and Baby Boom generations is 1946; I was born in 1943, as I like to say between the first stored program computer and the first sustained atomic chain reaction. Strauss and Howe put the dividing line at 1943, but it's not a hard and fast line. I frankly feel a lot more attraction to the Silent ideals than to the Boomer ideals. You know - civic mindedness, working together, keeping things stable, all those ideals that got trashed during "the 60s."<br><br>It's popular to look back on the period between the end of WW II and the Kennedy assassination as the "dark ages." Granted, there were a lot of things that weren't optimal from one viewpoint or another, but it was the last stability period in the 80-year cycle. I believe that JMG has mentioned that collapse seems to go in 80-year cycles with periods of stability and periods of collapse. We seem to be talking about the same thing: the generation that comes of age after a stability period always finds it stifling, materialistic and a whole lot of other pejoratives, and works very hard to legitimize it.<br><br>We're living in the time frame that we're living in; wishing we were in another time frame is not productive.

It makes me so angry that they can barely make enough money working two jobs to clothe their family. And its like this everywhere I live. People rely on handouts of free food and clothes from churches so they have money to pay bills. They don't want handouts.

The question can be asked in a different way: What is history? Is it the story of the advancement and improvement of the human race, or is it the story of a “fall”? Or perhaps a story of advancement that inevitably involves a fall? Or is history just “one damn thing after another,” or “a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing”?<br><br>“All of the above” seems to be the answer of the Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari. His book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind is an effort in the genre of universal history. Like many such efforts, it does not contain much actual history. Rather, it is a speculative reconstruction of human evolution, supplemented by the author’s thoughts on recorded history and the human condition. The book is fundamentally unserious and undeserving of the wide acclaim and attention it has been receiving. But it is worth considering the book’s blind spots and flaws — the better to understand the weaknesses of the genre and the intellectual temptations of our age.<br>...<br>And sometimes, perhaps because his book was originally written in Hebrew before he translated it into English, Harari manages to be unintentionally funny when he is trying to make a serious argument.

Back then you could graduate from HS, or not graduate, get married, walk down the street, and find a job that would let you support a family. I knew contemporaries who did just that. Often a couple would combine savings from their after school jobs for their house or apartment, car, furnishings and such. The cultural ferments of the 70s, NOT 60s, 70s, and the economic dislocations of the 80s, knocked those folks for a loop and many have never to this day recovered. People who had grown up with the expectation of stable, steady lives were forced into serieses of ad hoc arrangements which went on for years. For some working class folks, the SS check is the first stable income they have seen in decades.<br><br>Radicals tended to be East Coast urbanite 2nd or 3rd generations scions of immigrant families from Eastern Europe and they literally hated, and still can't stand, American small towns and rural people and customs. They engineered a takeover, or partial takeover of he Democratic Party in the early 70s, after which the Democrats simply wrote off whole swaths of non-urban American voters.<br><br>People tend to forget that hippies and radicals didn't like each other much. The back to the land youngsters were mostly into reviving remembered pioneer ways of life. They had learned, from Betty Friedan and others, that if you refrained from consumer spending, you could save a lot of cash, and you could buy houses or start businesses or even buy or at least rent, small farms. I suspect they were very influenced by trips to Mexico, and we need to recall that the Mexico of the late 60s was not the Mexico of today. These young people were not afraid of hard work. They were forever starting up little businesses, cooking, planting, building, quilting and sewing and so on. Their bible was the Whole Earth Catalogue which was a compendium of where you can obtain the useful tools Sears and Wards didn't carry. Some of them connected with old time farmers and crafts people and founded what was to became the organic farming sector of today. <br><br>The radicals were the sell-outs, as is detailed in the books of Christopher Lasch. They became willing lackeys of elite and business interests in return for comfort and privileges for themselves.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c587293207141776784 title="comment permalink">4/5/16, 9:07 AM</a><br><br>

As the Long Descent gains momentum, more and more individuals and groups will get tossed under the bus and the fighting to determine who goes under the bus right now and who gets to put off having tires tracks across their backs for the time being will get fiercer and fiercer. <br><br>In the end, its an attempt to delay the inevitable and the ultimate exercise in futility. There is no way to preserve the present American lifestyle.

It takes some wealth to get housing, land, tools, education, and even the experience that will be required to adapt to all the brutal changes that are coming. Just the time required for trial and error, and to be self-educated requires a modicum of wealth. Our health requires enough wealth to meet basic needs and have leisure to study and experiment. The people at the very bottom are going to be at a disadvantage, unless they already have done their preparations and know how to live without money. For the other 99% though, lack of financial resources would be a major impediment to preparation. This is what is really terrifying to me about the American future: that so many people are so mired in poverty that all their attention is devoted to surviving the present to the exclusion of a long range plan, so even if they do see catastrophe coming they will be flattened it.<br><br><a href=the-decline-and-fall-of-hillary-clinton.html#c7448561824473404795 title="comment permalink">4/6/16, 1:46 PM</a><br><br>
