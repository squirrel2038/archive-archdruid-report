<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the fifteenth installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator visits another school, catches the flu, and has his first encounter with the Lakeland Republic’s health care system...</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I made some phone calls the next morning and got my schedule sorted out for the next few days. Now that President Meeker had gotten things sorted out with the Restos, I had a lot of things to discuss with the Lakeland government, and I knew they’d want to know as much as possible about what was going to change following the election back home. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By quarter to nine I was climbing the marble stairs in front of the Capitol, passing a midsized crowd of wide-eyed schoolchildren on a field trip. The morning went into detailed discussions with government officials—Melanie Berger from Meeker’s staff, Stuart Macallan from the State Department, and Jaya Patel from the Department of Commerce—about the potential reset in relations between their country and mine now that Barfield and the Dem-Reps were out on their collective ear. They were frankly better prepared for the discussion than I was; I’d taken the precaution of printing out the position papers from Montrose’s transition team before I got on the train in Pittsburgh, and reviewed them the night before, but it was pretty obvious that the Lakelanders weren’t used to looking things up moment by moment on a veepad and I was.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We had lunch downstairs in the congressional dining room, a big pleasant space with tall windows letting in the autumn sunlight, and then it was up to Meeker’s office and a long afternoon talking with the President. I have no idea to this day if Isaiah Meeker plays poker, but if he does, I pity the other players; the skill with which he tried to lure me into saying more than I should, while gracefully evading any question of mine he didn’t want to answer, was really quite impressive. I’m pretty sure that he ended up with a clearer idea of the incoming administration’s foreign-policy plans than anyone outside of Ellen Montrose’s inner circle was entitled to have, though in exchange I think I got a good sense of how his administration was likely to respond to some of the impending changes in inter-American relations—including some I was pretty sure he didn’t know about yet. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Dinner was at a really pleasant French place two blocks from the Capitol: Berger, Patel, her husband Ramaraj, and me—Macallan had to attend some kind of event at the Texan embassy. The conversation stayed deftly on the edge between too little politics to be interesting and too much to be safe. When I finally got back to my hotel room that night, I sat at the desk writing down my impressions until well past midnight, and then fell into bed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The next morning I’d scheduled a visit to the Capitol Atheist Assembly’s school, and showed up at nine AM promptly just as classes were getting under way. The drill was nearly the same as at the school in Hicksville; I went to the office and signed in with the secretary, they found someone to show me around, and I sat in the back of the room and watched a couple of classes. I’d wanted to see their math and science classes, and I got my wish, but what I saw wasn’t anything like the math and science I was used to. The kids weren’t learning how to run programs to solve mathematical problems, or watching computer simulations of experiments—no, they were actually solving the problems and doing the experiments themselves. I watched a room full of sixth-graders work their way through a geometrical proof, and a class of eighth-graders hard at work setting up some kind of complicated apparatus with mirrors and prisms that ran out to all four corners of the classroom. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The Michaelson-Morley experiment,” the teacher explained to me as we stood on one side of the classroom and watched the students and a couple of teacher’s apprentices get everything lined up. He was an old guy with flyaway white hair and disconcertingly blue eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I don’t know if they teach that outside, but it’s one of the classic experiments in physics.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I don’t think I heard of it,” I admitted. “I’m curious why you have them repeat it, rather than just telling them how it came out.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That got me the classic Lakeland you-don’t-get-it look. “We actually have them replicate a whole series of classic scientific experiments,” he said. “That way, they learn that science isn’t some kind of revelation handed down from on high—it’s a living, growing thing, and it lives and grows when people get their hands dirty running experiments, and replicating them.” He gestured at the hardware. “And by making mistakes. Michaelson-Morley’s a finicky one; the first time they do it, the kids almost always get a different result than Michaelson and Morley got, and once that happens they get to go back over what they did and figure out what happened.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Right then he got called over by one of the apprentices to help sort out some detail of setting up the apparatus, and my guide and I watched for a few more minutes and then headed for another class. All in all, it was an interesting morning; one thing I noticed is that the kids were never just sitting there being bored and restless, the way they were in every school I’d ever seen back home. I wondered how much that had to do with the fact that the students here were actually doing something active in every class I saw, instead of sitting there staring at screens by the hour. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I left when the students went to lunch. While I’d been inside, a rainstorm had come rolling in off the lake, and though it wasn’t much more than five minutes before a streetcar came to the stop out front, I was pretty wet by the time I climbed on board. I had lunch at the hotel; by then the rain had stopped, and I dodged puddles up to the Capitol and then a block and a half past it, to the office building that housed the Lakeland Republic’s Department of Commerce. I spent all afternoon there with Jaya Patel and half a dozen other Commerce staffers, looking into possible trade deals and sorting out how those would be affected by their tax and tariff policies. It was a productive session but a tiring one, and then we headed off to an Indian place for dinner; by the time I got back to my hotel room I was feeling pretty run down.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It wasn’t until the next morning that I realized that there was more going on than simple tiredness. I felt awful, and the face that confronted me in the mirror looked even worse. I sat down on the side of the hotel bed and tried to figure out what to do. Back home, I’d simply have canceled everything for a week, taken some over-the-counter meds, and waited it out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You don’t go to a doctor or a hospital in the Atlantic Republic if you can possibly help it—a checkup plus lab work and a simple prescription will cost you the better part of a month’s income even after health insurance pays its cut, and you really don’t want to know how many people end up sick or dead every year because somebody screwed up a diagnosis, or because trade treaties won’t allow the government to pull medicines off the market even if they’re ineffective or worse. I’ve seen the numbers and they’re pretty grim. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, I wasn’t at home, and I couldn’t afford to spend the next week doing nothing. After a bit I went over to the packet I’d gotten on arrival, and paged through the paper on getting by in the Lakeland Republic. There was one short paragraph on medical emergencies and another on ordinary health care; this didn’t feel like an emergency, so I read the second one. It told me to call the concierge’s desk, and so as soon as I’d called Melissa Berger and cancelled the day’s meetings, that’s what I did. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No problem, sir,” said the voice on the other end of the line. “I’ll call Dr. Hammond, find out how soon he can get here, and call you right back. It’ll be just a moment.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
About the time I’d begun to wonder how long “just a moment” was—it probably wasn’t more than five minutes, to be fair—the phone rang. “Mr. Carr? Dr. Hammond’s on his way. He’ll be up to see you in twenty minutes or so.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Up to see me? I wondered about that. Something I’d read on the metanet once mentioned that a long time ago, doctors used to actually go to people’s homes—I think they called it “making house calls” or something like that. The idea sounded pretty far-fetched to me, but then plenty of things about the Lakeland Republic were pretty far-fetched by the standards I knew. Sure enough, right about twenty minutes after I’d gotten off the phone with the concierge, a crisp knock sounded on the door, and I went to open it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Dr. Paul Hammond turned out to be a youngish African-American guy dressed like an ordinary Toledo businessman, with a big brown leather case in one hand. We did the usual, and then he sat me down, pulled over a chair, pulled a pen and a notebook out of the big leather case and started asking me questions about my health and the symptoms I’d noticed. After he’d finished with that, he got a thin glass thing that seemed to be some kind of thermometer in my mouth, checked my pulse, used some kind of rig with tubes that went from his ears to an odd-shaped disk to listen to my breathing, and then took the thermometer out, had me stick my tongue out and shone a flashlight down my throat. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Pretty much what I expected, Mr. Carr,” he said then. “There’s a nasty little 24-hour flu going around, and I’m sorry to say you’ve got it. The good news is that you’ll be over it sometime tomorrow if you take it easy and let your body deal with it. You’ve got a mild fever, but that and the muscle aches are normal for this bug—all we have to do is keep any kind of secondary infection from getting going in your upper respiratory tract or your chest, and you’ll be fine.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He reached into his case, pulled out a brown glass dropper bottle and what looked for all the world like a package of tea bags. “Twenty drops of this in water every two hours,” he said, indicating the bottle, “and one of these in hot water whenever you feel like it—that’s to treat the muscle aches.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I picked up the package, gave it a dubious look. Yes, they were tea bags, full of what looked like bits of leaves that I guessed came from a bunch of different plants. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Hammond watched me with an amused look on his face. “The concierge tells me that you’re from outside,” he said. “So you were expecting pills, right, rather than plants.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Well, yes.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Care to guess where a lot of the ingredients in those pills come from?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave him a quizzical look. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Plants. Aspirin comes from willow bark, menthol from mint, and so on—there’s a long list. And here’s the thing—some of these plants have been bred for thousands of years to have the right mix of active compounds to treat this or that health problem. By and large, the kind of pharmaceuticals you’re used to taking pull just one compound out of the mix and use that, because somebody or other decided that it was the ‘active ingredient.’” He shook his head. “I can get you some pills if you really want them, but the tincture and the infusion will actually do you more good.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That seemed improbable to me, but I was feeling too out of sorts to argue. He wrote down some notes about what to eat, told me what symptoms to watch for, and handed me his card so I could call him if anything out of the ordinary happened. Then he told me he’d check on me the next morning, said goodbye, and headed out the door. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I put twenty drops of the stuff from the dropper bottle into half a glass of water from the tap. It tasted so bad that I filled the glass the rest of the way before choking it down. By then I was feeling really tired, so I crawled back into bed and proceeded to sleep like a stone until past noon. I called room service and got some food, along with hot water for the tea-ish stuff—I figured, what the heck, might as well give it a try. It had an aromatic smell I didn’t recognize at all, but it went down easily enough and it seemed to make my muscles ache less. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s basically the way I spent the rest of that day. By sunset, rather to my surprise, I was starting to feel noticeably better, and by morning I felt—not well, exactly, but the sort of weak-but-better feeling that tells you that you’re going to be over an illness pretty soon. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Dr. Hammond showed up again at nine-thirty sharp. He had someone else with him, a wiry kid of eighteen or so—Hammond introduced him as his apprentice Larry Soames. “So how are we feeling?” he asked, as he settled on the same chair he’d used the morning before. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“A lot better,” I admitted. I fielded his questions and then got my temperature, pulse, and so on taken again, while the kid watched and listened and took notes in a little black notebook. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Excellent,” Hammond said finally. “You ought to take the rest of today off, too, but if you do that you should be back on your feet again tomorrow.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Fair enough,” I said, “and thank you. Now how much do I owe you?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You don’t,” he said, with a broad smile. “I gather nobody’s told you how we do health care here.” When I shook my head:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“It’s pretty simple, really. Doctors like me—general practitioners—contract with businesses, churches, or citizen’s groups to provide basic health care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That used to be common all over the old United States a century and a half ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My contract’s with the hotel; I get a flat monthly salary from them, and in return I provide all the primary health care for the employees and the guests.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“What if somebody gets something a general practitioner can’t treat?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Well, of course, then I refer them to a specialist, and people have health insurance to cover that—but that’s not really that common, all things considered.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That surprised me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Back home, if you want to risk going to a doctor, you pretty much have to go to a specialist in whatever’s the matter, and if more than one part of your body is involved you’d better hope the specialists you get are willing to talk to each other or you’re going to land in a world of hurt. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You don’t have a lot of general practitioners back home, I imagine,” he said then.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I don’t think I’ve ever met one,” I admitted.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Well, there you are. Here, probably ninety per cent of the physicians are GPs, and if you want to get into med school and become a specialist you pretty much have to go through an apprenticeship and then work as a GP for at least a few years first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That way you remember that your job’s to treat patients, and not just a heart or an endocrine system or what have you.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Hold it,” I said. “You don’t go to med school to become a GP?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not usually, no.” With another broad smile: “Back in the old Union, the universities got really good at inserting themselves into just about every job category you can think of as a job requirement. It was a big moneymaker for the academic industry but it didn’t work very well for anybody else—you’d go to college and learn a bunch of things dreamed up by people who didn’t actually work in the field, and then you’d graduate and have to unlearn most of it once you were on the job. We ditched all that after Partition; outside of a very few fields, most of them scholarly, it’s pretty much all apprenticeship.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He nodded at Larry. “Six years from now, when he’s done with his apprenticeship, he’ll have years of hands-on experience to go with what he’s learning from the books, and once he passes his board exams he’ll be ready to start treating patients on his own right away. That’s the way it used to be done, you know—by apprenticeship, followed by state board exams. Doctors, lawyers, teachers, architects, all the skilled professions used to be that way, and it worked better, so we went back to it.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He got up. “But that’s neither here nor there. Take it easy for the rest of the day, and if you feel worse—or if you get any of the symptoms I mentioned—give me a call right away. Okay? Excellent. Well, Mr. Carr, have a great day.” </div>
<br>They left, and I lay back down and eventually dozed off again. </div>

I've been shopping around for schools for my 4 year old, and the thing that struck me is that the small boutique private schools that aimed for the fairly wealthy all made a big deal about how they looked exactly like, well, the Lakeland schools: Emphasising recess, hands on experimentation, learning through playing, etc. The really hard-to-get-into charter schools were the same. The general public schools seemed to have a resigned "well, we are stuck with the tests and bureaucracy, right?" attitude, and the charter schools aimed at the lower classes were big on discipline and rote (or as a teacher friend of mine put it, "they are designed to turn out obedient middle managers"). I can understand why some of the lower classes crave structure (because they lack it at home for one reason or another, not criticizing, I personally would have a hard time surviving on minimum wage!), but it seems like almost everyone actually wants Lakeland schools, it's just only the rich or very lucky who get them. And, fair disclosure, I earn a decent chunk of change, so I went for the boutique private option.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c2739507008842328677 title="comment permalink">2/17/16, 4:46 PM</a><br><br>

This postulated a post-nation-state existence where the world had split up into "philes" of various people. What's interesting is that one of the main and most powerful philes were the Neo-Victorians, who explicitly tried to recapture Victorian values (without sacrificing a number of the more receent gains). What's interesting about this world is that the more upper class you were, the more explicitly retro-tech you were (eg, the lower classes used v-pad equivalents, the upper class had proper printer newspapers). There's a certain echo in Retropia. JMG, curious if this influenced you at all?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c6631742483423973593 title="comment permalink">2/17/16, 4:50 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_b55c14" id=c4392465106602109033></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/14907269518516476574 rel=nofollow>Darby Valley</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>It is very interesting to see this addressed. I am an acupuncturist and have been in practice for 20 years. In that time I have seen the route to licensure through apprenticeship closed in state after state. I don't believe that it is an option to learn the profession that way anymore. While I did not study under an apprenticeship, my time in practice has certainly shown me many of its merits. My field has one of the highest attrition rates after graduation. At 5 years I once saw a published statistic saying 85% of practitioners had stopped practicing. There are lots of reasons for this but the core one is that book learning is not the same as clinical practice. People ask me how to pick an acupuncturist and my answer is find someone who had made there living at it for 5 years. I certainly would prefer this older way, or at least a hybrid, some things are hard to study from a book in a country office and what you see might get a little too limited. While these comments above pertain to acupuncture, I first graduated from college as an engineer. Let me tell you how humbling it was to realize I did not actually know anything and would have to learn it all on the job. It was also quite a relief because I was pretty sure I did not know how to do much and was very afraid someone was going to die from my ignorance no how many factors of safety I might use to cushion my analysis and design. Luckily most engineering employers know this and they train you with mentors and slowly increasing projects, much like an apprenticeship :)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c4392465106602109033 title="comment permalink">2/17/16, 5:11 PM</a><br><br>

As a young herbalist it is very, very frustrating that there aren't more apprenticeships! I've taken some classes with an area herbalist, which was lovely, but to actually practice with someone who's done it for decades!! How lovely that would be.<br><br>If people are interested in apprenticing through books I heartily recommend to read Matthew Wood, especially his two volumes of Earthwise Herbal. He goes into very impressive detail about the specific indications of thousands of herbs. I've validated a few of his indications and they are incredibly spot on. He also has some books that go into more detail about different plants, the western herbal modality, and the history of western medicine. All are excellent. My herbal teacher showed me a book of his on pulse diagnostics which I really should checkout.<br><br>Also, I'm very partial to Thomsonian herbalism as it makes the precepts of health very accessible to the layperson (I cover his concepts with some depth here: http://winterstrickster.blogspot.com/2015/08/kitchen-witchery-exploration-of.html). I've found his basic concepts enormously useful in my practice in a general way, while I turn to Matthew Wood for more specifics.<br><br>I wonder if people are persecuted in the Lakeland Republic for giving herbs to friends. I imagine there is no equivalent to the AMA, but certainly there are guild restrictions. I'm curious as well the different modalities practiced in Lakeland - Ectlectic? Thomsonian? Homeopathic? Ayurvedic? TCM? What are the biases of the standardized test? Surely it talks anatomy and physiology but does it mention doshas? Kidney jing? The differences between allopathic and homeopathic treatments?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c8879236712857094754 title="comment permalink">2/17/16, 5:59 PM</a><br><br>

As for changing physicians... those who are taking new patients are often only taking those who don't have a family doctor. This used to be a problem only in rural areas, but it is now a big problem even in the provincial capital. The Walk-in Clinic nearest me closed down because a doctor retired and they could no longer find enough doctors to staff it. While it was open, waiting an hour or two to be seen was normal.<br><br>Wait times to see specialists and for operations and emergency rooms are also longer than they should be and this sometimes kills people.<br><br>They also keep reducing the number of nurses to do x, which is really hard on the remaining nurses (according to a friend of mine who is one of those nurses).<br><br>MSP contributions cover doctors' visits, with a few fees attached to specific items. People on low incomes pay lower MSP premiums, or no premiums at all if your income is low enough. Even at full price it is way cheaper than the US, and there isn't a deductible for most things. For pharmaceuticals costs there is certain amount you have to pay before you are covered, and the amount varies according to income. There are a fair number of medications that aren't covered, including anything specific for fibromyalgia, unfortunately.<br><br>It's a fairly complicated system and has lots of critics. I think that the whole MSP system is needless bureaucracy that should be rolled into income taxes. It would reduce confusion and money.

Having spent most of my upwardly mobile years in US healthcare system administration, and my more recent downwardly mobile years as a herb grower and supplier to my herbalist wife, I really liked the description of healthcare practices. The introduction to teas and tincture is a great way to get started, but it could also be interesting to get into more detail with this and see how the Lakeland Republic is handling things that allopathic medicine is considered, today and by some, to be good at - cancer interventions, say, or advanced surgery. <br><br>There is in this topic of healthcare a parallel to the theme you remind us about often with energy usage - that renewables can be helpful but cannot replace fossil fuel, so we had better change our lives to need and use less energy. This rings true in "alternative" healthcare as well - herbs and other natural modalities can be helpful, but won't fully replace the full range of allopathic treatments. So we had better improve our diets, be more active, practice better self-care and, yes, get a bit more comfortable with the probability that we or those we love could die young from some unexpected accident, infection or disease.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c834349112967556960 title="comment permalink">2/17/16, 7:08 PM</a><br><br>

Who would answer parent concerns, sort out staff pay, keep policies up to date, deal with equipment orders, organise all the paperwork for camps and excursions, write antibullying procedures, not to mention ensuring that every child has a first aid plan for asthma, anaphylaxis, etc.<br><br>Almost all of these policies and procedures seem reasonable, when taken in isolation. Why shouldn't all teachers know what to do when a child has an anaphylactic reaction? Why shouldn't it be made a rule that students cannot bring the most common pieces of fruit (today, I heard it was bananas) to school in their lunchbox, because one student might have a sudden, severe reaction and die? Why shouldn't we know best practices for dealing with students with disabilities or other special needs, gifted students, students needing remedial help, students with English as an Additional Language? Why shouldn't we require safety audits and medical forms whenever we take a class outside the school gate?<br><br>Most fictional accounts of schools conveniently brush over these realities of modern school life, which is one of the reasons I had trouble with the Harry Potter bandwagon.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c5304521751958627344 title="comment permalink">2/17/16, 7:41 PM</a><br><br>

Thus I'm far from surprised that access to a good education in the US is still mostly rationed by price. As for Stephenson, nah, I haven't read anything of his but <i>Anathem</i>, and that was a sufficiently mixed bag that I wasn't inspired to go further. <br><br>Darby, exactly. I've heard the same thing over and over again, in relation to more professions than I can readily remember. A university education is very useful if you want to become a tenured academic; other than that, it's pretty much a waste of time -- but the academic industry has gotten very good at parasitizing other professions, and serving as a bottleneck to limit access and thus drive prices up.<br><br>Rob, stay tuned! Heh heh heh...<br><br>SLClaire, I haven't been to an MD in a good deal longer than that. Partly that's financial -- even if I'd signed up for Obamacare, which would have cost my wife and me more than our house payment, the deductible and co-pays are so high I couldn't have afforded to use it -- and partly a well-earned distrust of an industry in which bad care and useless or harmful "treatments" are way too common. <br><br>Juandonjuan, it's the old joke about specialization: these days people learn more and more about less and less, so eventually everyone will know everything about nothing. As usual, "eventually" is now. <br><br>Violet, good! I wondered if anyone would catch that. Dr. Hammond is a Thompsonian physician -- that's why he handed over the tincture and the herbal tea, rather than using acupuncture or some other modality. The state board exams cover anatomy and physiology, then go on to present specific case scenarios, for which each candidate must present a detailed plan of treatment, a referral to a specialist, or -- and these are the tricky ones -- a plan of treatment for a deliberately obscure condition with the signs and symptoms they would look for in order to send the patient to the right specialist. Exams are graded by a panel of judges who are familiar with the modality in which the candidates have been trained. The goal, after all, is to make sure that GPs can treat ordinary illnesses and refer patients to specialists for extraordinary illnesses -- not, say, to prop up the income of the pharmaceutical industry. <br><br>Pygmycory, in fact, the system is designed to produce a large number of GPs per capita, so that medical care is accessible and affordable to everyone. The current medical system in the US is designed to minimize the number of GPs per capita in order to drive up the profitability of the medical industry. Different goals lead to different approaches...<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c3170189882080289907 title="comment permalink">2/17/16, 7:56 PM</a><br><br>

JMG misspelled twice, and two or so of the comments have at this point perpetuated the misspelling. <br><br>Actually, I am not too sure that M-M is quite a plausible experiment for a school. I don't know how much the apparatus costs, BUT (1) you need, apart from the optics, mountings to a mass of tens or hundreds of kilograms, and (2) if you want to do the experiment in the one version which is practical in a classroom (rotate the apparatus by hand, without waiting for the Earth's motions to rotate it in a frame of reference fixed on the distant stars), you need special arrangements. For Prof. Michelson, those "special arrangements" (in the 1887 version of his work) involved floating the optical train, mounted on some slab of something very massive (stone? concrete? pig iron?), in a mercury bath. My guess - admittedly, only a wild guess - is that setting up a Michelson-Morley apparatus with "special arrangements" in today's Canada or today's USA would cost quite a few thousand dollars, even if the lab floor did not need to be braced by carpenters so as to carry the unusual weight. <br><br>There is additionally some quasi-medical problem in attending to fringe patterns. Without having seen a Michelson-Morley, I still speculate that this will be at least as hard on the nerves as working with a Michelson interferometer (which I **DID** do) - lots and lots and lots and LOTS and LOTS of fringes in the eyepiece, and you have to concentrate. <br><br>Same problem of nervous wear and tear, incidentally, is said to bedevil the Millikan oil-drop experiment for mass of electron - you apparently go crazy looking at the wee little pinpricks of light through the eyepiece, as those oil drops rise or fall in your carefully adjusted electrostatic field. <br><br>Some might contemplate giving the kids Thomson electron charge-mass-ratio-of-electron experiment. I remember this demonstrated to 1st-year undergrads in 1989 or so at Univ of Victoria in Canada: the grad student handling the equipment pointed very casually to two metal screws, across which was a potential difference in perhaps the kilovolt regime, and he said, "Put one finger HERE, and another finger HERE, and you are dead." <br><br>So the Thomson temptation-to-teach is best resisted at pre-university level. <br><br>In a school, funds might be spent on measuring the universal gravitation constant ("big G", as opposed to the banal local-value-of-gravitational-acceleration, "little g"), in a Cavendish apparatus. Apart from its inability (in contrast with Thomson) to kill pupils, Cavendish has the advantage over Michelson-Morley that the result involves lots of measuring, and therefore lots of propagation-of-uncertainties in the calculations. (If foo is known to plus-minus 15%, and bar is known to plus-minus 7%, to what uncertainty is the ratio of foo to bar known? The answer is something coarser than 15%.) <br><br>Or, alternatively, one could simply measure the speed of light, taking that as an occasion for discussing maths-of-uncertainties. This has been a first-year experiment at Univ of Toronto, and again does not suggest any obvious ways of killing pupils. If speed-of-light has not been done at pre-university level, it at any rate ought to be - at least to some coarse uncertainty, say to plusminus 20%. I think one uses Fizeau wheel with mirrors, and additionally I think that this can be done (as this type of pedagogical physics ought to be done) eschewing electronics. My guess - but again, it is only a guess - is that Fizeau setup for getting speed of light might run to a few hundred bucks, or to a thousand or two, but NOT to anything as bad as ten or twenty thousand bucks. <br><br><br>Hastily,<br><br><br>Tom <br> <br>(near Toronto)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c6611460427321854816 title="comment permalink">2/17/16, 9:18 PM</a><br><br>

Doubtless other UK ADR posters here, or a read of the UK press will provide background, though it does seem to be a crisis deliberately engineered by the senior politicians concerned. <br><br>As for minor ailments, we've got access to GPs in local clinics (until they retire and aren't replaced, as not enough bright students now want to enter medicine). For clinics in some places that might mean a two week wait, or repeated attempts to book a same day appointment by phone starting at 08.00 until you finally get through to reception.

I am an aspiring herbalist who is priced out of all the training courses--ironic for a method that is supposed to be "the people's medicine" (and I could say the same for the treatment fees and product prices many herbalists charge). As course fees go, herbalism courses are on par with other sorts of education today, but as JMG so rightly points out, those prices are getting ridiculous. Thankfully at least some of the courses do provide hands-on experience, if nowhere near as much as one would get through apprenticeship. I am convinced of the need for and benefits of herbalism, so I guess better there be herbalists that few can afford (or in some regions, find) than none at all. If the FDA and the pharmaceutical companies get their way, it will soon be illegal to practice clinical herbalism--we are already very close to that point. No doubt Nick Culpeper is spinning in his grave, though I take comfort from the fact that herbalism can still survive "underground". In the meantime, while it is still legal to say so in print, I'm betting there's also some elderflower in that tea Carr was drinking.<br><br>JMG, I agree with you on academia's self-insertion into "qualifications" for employment, and a corollary of that is the demise of humanities education--not lucrative enough, with the annoying side effect that it tends to inspire people to ask uppity questions and challenge authority. Have you seen this article about Japanese universities ditching their humanities programs (http://time.com/4035819/japan-university-liberal-arts-humanities-social-sciences-cuts/)?

The answer, of course, is that you're letting the myth of progress do your thinking for you. You don't make the transition all at once, any more than cars replaced horses all at once, and so the ordinary depreciation of the infrastructure that has to be replaced does much of the work for you.

GPs do house calls here, if there is an indication, such as an elderly person in very poor health, or someone who has chosen to die at home. Everyone also has a right to district nursing, either at a clinic or in their own home depending on mobility.

I knew I wanted to be a teacher but was appalled at the education department in my college. Because I got a full ride to do so, I went to graduate school (in Medieval Literature -- not a practical field, but I liked it) and never got a teaching certificate. I began by working at a test prep company for classroom experience then got a private school to hire me. At that point I asked every teacher I worked with if I could sit in their classes during my free periods, if I could look at their tests and lesson plans, and what I should do about a tricky student. They were wonderful people and gave me everything I needed to learn the profession. I hope I wasn't a burden to them -- a formal apprenticeship program would have been better, I'm sure -- but I knew even as a 22-year-old that the way I was learning how to teach was far superior to months spent in Blackboard 101. I now have 30+ years of experience, have trained teachers around the world and in the US -- and am not eligible to teach in high school. To become eligible I would have to spend many thousands of dollars and take several years of courses, taught, most likely, by people who have less experience than I do. We try so hard to set up bureaucratic hoops to guarantee that qualified people get jobs, but we end up just getting people who can jump through hoops.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c5440687336210677740 title="comment permalink">2/18/16, 3:54 AM</a><br><br>

The rule of thumb that we all like to ignore is that we learn about 10% of what we need from theoretical work, 20% by talking to other practitioners and (to use the medieval language of apprenticeships) Masters, and 70% by doing, failing and figuring it out. Unlike in the Lakeland Republic, this 70% seems to be ignored in most formal eduction, so people have to complete their education on the job. It's interesting that the medieval system used the right proportions hundreds of years ago and in our efforts to improve it and speed it up, we've wrecked it. As someone once said, no matter how you're trained you can't think any faster. I'm also reminded of a great medical specialist I once worked with, a father of Interventional Cardiology in Europe. A newly qualified cardiologist once came to see him to ask if he could become a fellow in his clinic and learn from the master. He was fixed with a gimlet glare by the old man who asked him "are you theoretical or practical?" Practical he answered.

We're back in Retrotopia! Thanks for sharing this with us, JGM, I want to teach in Lakeland. Any openings for an Art Teacher? :)<br><br>I can, on the front lines, concur with the assessment made by Whomever, somewhat, not totally. IMHO, the private schools are far more Lakeland, hands-on, experiential and project/process based; but they're not immune to the mad rush for an iPad on each desk "newer, higher techno-complexity-must-be-better!" There's a fear of falling behind the times.<br><br>The primary school I work in is one of those pricey private schools Whomever was speaking of, and there are a lot of 'doing', not 'showing' activities the kids are engaged in. IMHO, the reason is that as a private school, they have the flexibility and freedom from Public School requirements, mandates and laws. Standardized Testing is optional. They can afford the time to try new things, and keep them if they seem to work. "Doing" does work.<br><br>In Art class, by it's very nature, it's about 10% academic, (learning about historic and influential artists, movements, elements of design, etc.) and 90% hands on doing. Our kids also have D&amp;T, (Design/Technology, kind of a mix of wood-shop, physics, basically building 'stuff') and a science lab for experiments. We have a roof top garden that we are keeping, (My day is tomorrow with the Year-6's - planting some more pepper plants), they have field trips, camp, PE, choir, instrumental music, and Mandarin -which is a mix of language and culture study. I think that's the only time the Cookery Room gets used - making Chinese dumplings. Of all of these "doing" activities, Art and Music are the only constants they get, (one hour per week.) Most are sprinkled in amongst the academic curriculum.<br><br>AND YET: Many times I worry greatly for my little students when I see how woefully unfamiliar they are with hands-on tangible tasks. Even my Year-6's have trouble tying a knot, threading a needle, manipulating clay or paper with their fingers, even regulating hand pressure to get a dark pencil stroke or a light pencil stroke in drawing. They are missing the concept that you have to actually physically force it to do what you want it to. It's not automatic. I guess that they still do spend far too much time on computers where everything IS automatic. (If you want a light pencil stroke, you just click on the light icon, to switch to dark or heavy pencil lines, you click on that corresponding icon.) The problem is that they seem to have a great disconnect in theory/abstract academics which they are comfortable with, and the physical world, which they are not. I can only guess that our in-school 'doing' projects are the only places they get to actually 'do' more than swipe a finger across a pad. Which is not great, as we're still in school, not free play.<br><br>In these tangible areas, manipulating physical objects to make a craft project or knowing how basic things are put together and/or work in the physical world, my generation (I'm 54) is not that different than my lovely step-daughter's, (born in 1991). For my young students who are young children today - there is a vast difference. Their physical vs. virtual disconnect is profound and even doing our (very expensive and well-thought out) best; their future ability to function in the real world alarms me.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c9180963573315618205 title="comment permalink">2/18/16, 5:35 AM</a><br><br>

In WI, the legislature recently sent a substantial cut to the University system, which of course was passed down to all the campuses. The two-year campuses got wacked pretty hard, many of their positions centralized, and I would not be surprised if our local campus gets closed within the next decade.

The good news here is that top-notch teachers have been striving for decades to develop experiments and demonstrations that are grade-appropriate, and the both the internet and print books are absolutely replete with their ideas.<br><br>But I think the hands-on approach described is completely spot-on. One thing that mystified me when I was in school was that the science apparatus was not designed and built by the students themselves. So we had physics at one of the school, and shop class at the other, but nary the two should meet. What a missed opportunity! The Physics kids could have had the fundamental ideas and skills appropriate to scientific inquiry driven home by designing and using their own apparatus, and the shop kids would have the satisfaction of building useful equipment and collaborating with the physics kids to perfect the designs. What an opportunity to combine theory and practice in the real world! Instead, the shop kids kept building bird houses and grandfather clocks, and the physics kids kept using prepackaged and, incidentally, very expensive PSSC physics lab kits, and the two groups of kids kept to their separate universes.<br><br>We already live in a world where far too few people know how to build or fix things.

Sure, we have (currently) a requirement for college and divinity school in the group I serve, but it wasn't always the case and academics do not a pastor (nor a priest) make. It would make the credentialists nuts, but I could imagine a system whereby possible future clergy spend some time with their local clergy as a "shadow" before more specialized training and again after or during that training. To a great degree monastic clergy still do this. As mentioned in the blog post, you can do practical work and study books at the same time in order to learn most of the "professions." And, probably be better off for it. The better in the lab chemists are trained this way, too, in my experience.<br><br>As to re-doing fundamental science experiments, I have mixed feelings. I've done some of it in my education, and it is frustrating to use antiquated tools that barely serve the didactic purpose and have been cast aside by the profession in favor of more modern equipment. More than once, I took samples to the professor's lab where I worked to get better answers/analyses than we had in lab classes. There is some value in grinding through lab data by hand to give you a feel for how things can be "easily" solved by computer but wrong (certain types of data analysis for enzyme kinetics come to mind) or in other reviews of the old stuff. <br><br>Michelson Morely's important, but if i'm remembering the apparatus/experiment correctly, it's hardly going to be easy or the first list of experiments to replicate in a lot of schools. It's really fiddly and requires a lot of expensive single/limited use precision equipment: a huge batch of front silvered precision mirrors and a huge optically flat table that can be rotated smoothly and a micrometer/interferometer mounted on a floor that's far away from vibrations like the street cars in your fictional town or even the footsteps of other students. Same for Miliken's electron charge experiment.<br><br>As an alternative: There's also a lot of value of diving into the real problems at the edge of human knowledge. Most "hard" math was invented to make interesting problems soluble, for instance. Doing labs identifying "unknowns" with crude techniques (many of which are ambiguous at best and require grams of materials) is kind of dumb when you can go in a lab and make real unknowns---get your initial training making the "starting materials" (advanced intermediates) for getting to the unknowns.

An Ideal Republic might want to contemplate a centralized government institution, a bit like the Ontario Science Center in Toronto, but without the Science Center's present-day showmanship and glitz. In this centralized institution, there would be a basement room with a Michelson-Morley, in all its perhaps 20,000- or 50,000- or 80,000-dollar glory, mercury bath and all, and a school would schedule a two-hour session in that room by way of a field trip (I mean, by way of a school excursion). Thomson charge-mass-ratio-of-electron could likewise be kept in this centralized institution, with safety precautions. Cavendish value-of-big-G, despite what I wrote in my posting from UTC=20160218T045025Z, is perhaps also best put into this institution (with a technician handy to help, and with students booking, quite a few hours for making multiple runs on the equipment and taking multiple rows of data). <br><br>(2) An Ideal Republic might want to put the routine classroom emphasis, as opposed to the special Science Center field trip emphasis, not on the classic experiments but on problem solving. Here are three possibilities (the first two from me, and the third possibly from Prof. Feynman): <br><br>(a) How accurately can we identify direction of North, proceeding from the principle that shadows are "shortest when Sun is due South"? (First problem for the kids: explain, with reference to a telephone pole that is not quite vertical, why "Shadows are shortest when Sun is due South" is false. Next, elicit with questioning an appreciation for the need for casting the shadows, from a truly vertical gnomon, onto a surface which is itself perfectly horizontal. Then ask for experimental arrangements. Without having done this myself, I **THINK** a good way to proceed would be to form horizontal surface by pouring molten wax into approx-horizontal pan, taking the surface of the now-cold wax to be a reasonably true horizontal. To get a reasonably true vertical, we of course use a plumb line, and we can get the necessary shadow pattern by ensuring that plumb line has two knots (and we then seek the instant at which the two shadows cast by the two knots on the cold wax attain minimum separation; it is at this instant that the plumb-line shadow lies N-S). A subtle point is that (a) unless our school is at the poles or the equator, or alternatively (b) unless we succeed in stopping the Earth's rotation, our plumb line will not be exactly vertical, and indeed our cold wax surface not exactly horizontal. So I guess we get small systematic error in our results on top of the normal random errors due to manipulation of equipment: this too, might be discussed in class, as an example of the diff between random error and systematic error.) Budget: 20 bucks or so. <br><br>(b) What, from our knowledge of Coriolis Effect, can we predict as the discrepancy between direction of winds aloft (as monitored by lying on one's back and viewing clouds through a wire mesh) and direction of winds at rooftop level (as monitored with a wind vane)? (Underlying physics is that Coriolis Effect gets smaller and smaller the greater the friction between moving air mass and ground - i.e., gets smaller and smaller the lower the altitude of the wind. - Unless I am missing something here, there should be NO discrepancy if wind vane and clouds are moving exactly E-to-W or W-to-E, and there should be MAX discrepancy both when wind vane is pointing exactly N-S and (a second, equal, extremum for discrepancy) when clouds are moving exactly N-S.) Wire mesh and wind vane can be set up for perhaps twenty bucks. <br><br><br>/...continued in next posting, UTC=20160218T152148Z .../ <br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c3009058691300654766 title="comment permalink">2/18/16, 7:29 AM</a><br><br>

I have done my own research (it is a mechanical replacement of organic joint after all), as the first 2 ortho's simply told me to get it scheduled with their assistants, and handed me a pamphlet designed for 2nd graders.<br><br>During my interview process, it was enlightening to see that a choice of joint type was only brought up by ONE doctor of the 9 I visited. The type of procedure was only discussed by TWO, and one of them was defensive when I asked why he preferred the medial over the lateral method - and obfuscated and took offense at my asking a question.<br><br>My initial hip problem was ascertained via MRI, but this same ortho MISSED the 4 herniated discs in my lumber spine. He saw the arthritic hip and assumed it was the cause of my pain, even though the referred pain was obviously sciatic.

The Millikan oil drop experiment was to measure the charge of the electron, not the mass.<br><br>@JMG, in my rural high school (in Canada circa 1978) students in physics class performed a modified version of the Millikan oil drop experiment (with microscopic plastic beads instead of oil droplets). The apparatus used was smaller than an entry-level microscope and our school had enough of them to allocate one to each pair of students, so their cost could not have been exorbitant. Notwithstanding Toomas' concerns re. nervous wear &amp; tear, we young students with our sharp eyes had little trouble replicating Millikan's results, and it was a vivid enough demonstration of a fundamental aspect of our world that I remember it well to this day, including the histograms we created from our data that revealed the quantum charges so clearly.

I've never had a flu end in anything close to 24 hours, except for the so-called "stomach flu" that has very different symptoms from Carr's.<br><br>That's no big deal. Strains change over time, and so does terminology, and the setting is in the future. But I suggest that the doctor should have showed some concern that Carr, being a traveler recently arrived from a distant region, might be hit harder by a local bug that's been "going around," or might be coming down with a more virulent strain he brought in himself. Those become significant medical considerations in a less interconnected world. A doctor contracted with a hotel would be well versed in the principles of epidemiology.<br><br>@Toomas, I and a few other students did the speed of light measurement in high school, in a small and unpopular senior physics class. The school had the equipment on hand but it hadn't been used in several years. The rotating mirror was a motorized unit specifically made for the purpose, so that part was easy. (It needs to be on the order of ten thousand RPM if I recall correctly, so cobbling one together from separate standard parts would be difficult.) But our light source was poor (no lasers in schools back then) and we needed a long corridor. We used a cellar corridor, which also allowed us the pitch darkness we needed to see and align the beam. (I suspect a classroom M-M would have the same issue of needing complete darkness.)

Swenson, Jr.<br><br>I am fortunate enough to have been able, in my Jr. High School and High School years, to have been able to see and manipulate the Michelson Interferometer that my father used in his Astronomical research. This was used for FTS (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform_spectroscopy rel=nofollow>Fourier Transform Spectrometry</a>). After actually having my hands on this thing and seeing just how touchy the adjustments are to even be able to see any fringes at all let alone get the thing to stand still for hours (days, weeks that Michelson needed) I appreciate just how amazing his experiment was. And aligning my father's instrument was done with the help of a laser, much harder without the use of a good coherent light source; working only with the White Light Fringe would be a bear!<br><br>Making and aligning a Michelson Interferometer would be possible in a school setting but I have grave doubts about actually replicating the experiment. What you will see is just how good a ruler the Interferometer is, when using a laser as the light source, it’s possible to measure the bending of a 1/2 inch aluminum plate produced by light finger pressure! This same plate is also a thermometer, you can see it expanding and contracting with temperature changes.<br><br>The instrument my father used is described in this publication (pdf) <a href="http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?db_key=PRE&amp;bibcode=1973PASP...85..458J&amp;letter=.&amp;classic=YES&amp;defaultprint=YES&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;page=458&amp;epage=458&amp;send=Send+PDF&amp;filetype=.pdf" rel=nofollow>FOURIER-TRANSFORM INFRARED SPECTROMETER</a>. He later used a much simplified version that looks very similar to the “basic” one described in the Wikipedia article. This was simplified so that it would be usable at visible light wavelengths that are much shorter than the Infrared and therefore the alignment is even more difficult.<br><br>The “Amateur Scientist” columns in the Scientific American magazine of days gone past provide a plethora of great experiments that could be carried out in schools.

I loved it and probably would have gone into science or engineering if we had stayed in the USA during my high school years. It was fascinating and lots of fun, and I learned things.<br>As for the health care piece, wow, there is so much to say, so many thoughts after working in health care for 30 years. One thing I would like to point out is that current medical education, while not the strict apprenticeship system described in this chapter, typically includes some actual observation and observed practice time on real patients leading to supervised practice and eventually independent practice. Granted it’s not six years, more like six- to eight-week clinical rotations in various settings, but it’s not all power points in the classroom (though admittedly there is a whole lot of that these days). <br>The model described in the chapter would seem to require more physicians per capita than what is available in the modern western medical model. What I see happening is that general practice physicians (GP) are being replaced in many settings with the advanced practice nurse or nurse practitioner (NP) as these are less expensive to employ and are able to provide many of the services that used to be exclusive to the MD license. What happens if Dr. Hammond does not have time to see all the patients calling for service in any given day? Does he have back up? Do groups such as the New Shakers employ a GP or ensure that they have a member who is a GP on site?<br>Does the population of the Lakeland Republic display what is commonly referred to as the social determinants of health? In other words, do people in the higher income brackets enjoy better overall health and longer life expectancy than those with lower incomes and perhaps less education, less access to healthy, nutritious food, and basic preventative services? I get the sense that the food in Lakeland is minimally processed and probably does not have the sugar, salt, and other questionable additives so common in the modern North American diet. Does the Lakeland government subsidize basic preventative services somehow, or are these provided exclusively by the businesses, churches, or citizen’s groups that hire the GPs? And what if one group will provide “x” and another won’t cover that? The ever contentious birth control issue comes to mind here. Or does the payor simply pay the salary of the GP, and the GP has complete freedom to provide whatever is needed within the ethical guidelines established by the Lakeland equivalent AMA (American Medical Association)?<br>And what happens when a patient is non-compliant with the treatment regimen and as a consequence does not improve and continues to call for appointments? For example if Mr. Carr had decided that the herbal tincture was too nasty to drink, didn’t take it, and as a consequence got worse resulting in daily calls to and visits from Dr. Hammond over the ten days? Or is this considered just another part of the practice of medicine in Lakeland, i.e. more complex patient who may have other contributing issues impacting ability to recover that need to be addressed as part of treatment?<br>I guess my comment has turned into more questions than comments, and I want to say that the impression I have of Lakeland is that the overall basic level of health of the population seems to be higher and more consistent across the Tiers than what I see even here in Colorado, which is one of the healthiest states in the Union (in the top 20%).<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c6249597025204497543 title="comment permalink">2/18/16, 9:09 AM</a><br><br>

I don't have a theory of my own, but I have one to share, courtesy of the last Robert A. Heinlein book published in his lifetime, 1987's <i>To Sail Beyond the Sunset</i>. In 1897, telegraphy and telephony came to the part of Missouri where 15-year-old Maureen Johnson was 15 years away from becoming the mother of Woodrow Wilson Smith (whom you perhaps know better by his final name, Lazarus Long). Her father, local sawbones Ira Johnson, expressed his concerns about the concomitants thereof:<br><br><i>"They point out that it will soon be possible, as more people subscribe, to call for a doctor in the middle of the night. Yes, yes, surely. Today I make night calls because somebody is in such trouble that some member of the patient's family has hitched up in the middle of the night and driven here to ask me to come.<br><br>"But what happens when he can rout me out of bed just by cranking a little crank? Will it be for a dying child? No, Maureen, it will be for a hangnail. Mark my words; the telephone signals the end of the house call. Not today, not tomorrow, but soon. They will ride a willing horse to death... and you will see the day when medical doctors will refuse to make house calls."</i><br><br>Also:<br><br><i>Øyvind, how come it's impossible to go from cars back to horses when it was perfectly possible to go from horses to cars, and there was a very elaborate and expensive infrastructure around horses and horse transport that somehow got replaced? The answer, of course...</i><br><br>I submit that Øyvind might have had, or might still have, an answer of his own, and that I think it would have been an educational experience, for him and the Archdruid and everyone, to find out what that answer was.

At the expense of the knee.”<br>This story actually causes tears of both sadness and frustration. I have worked as a physical therapist for 30 years and cannot imagine why the PTs were not able to address your knee. I can only speak for myself, but I would have coded the treatment diagnosis to include the whole leg for one thing, then if that was insufficient, I would have called the referring provider to secure an additional referral that included the knee. Many of the rehab exercises that are good for the hip are also good for the knee so I do not understand why they could not have given you something for the knee. We cannot look at one joint in isolation. Bodies don’t work that way. It’s always good practice to look at the adjacent joints because the body is a kinetic chain and nothing works by itself. For the hip, it’s wise to examine the knee, the sacroiliac and the lumbar joints, as well as the feet in many cases. And don’t forget the other (“uninvolved” as we like to say) leg that is taking the brunt of the ground reaction force and overworking when you have to limp.<br>I did have a patient last year referred to PT for bilateral knee pain. He would come in complaining of severe neck pain. The neck is too far away to justify treatment when the referral is for the knees, but I addressed the neck as best I could and called the referring provider’s office to get a new script for the neck.

Up until about 20 years ago one could become licensed to practice architecture through apprenticeship in my state, now you are required to have a masters degree (thought there are still 22 states where you can go the apprenticeship route). As someone who got into the field working my way up in an office, and hit a glass ceiling due to lack of education, and who went to school to get that education, I can say that most of what needs to be learned can be learned better on the job, not at the university. (And I have worked under several very competent and accomplished architects who were licensed under apprenticeship.) <br><br>Although there are valid traditions which can (but only sometimes do) get passed on in architecture schools, the fact that they profit from students having few options other than going into debt to get what they used to get paid to learn in the field is a tough pill to swallow.

At the time the majority of osteopaths were GPs. The book I was reading said that when the legislature of a Midwestern state was considering funding a new medical school they learned that the majority of graduates with an MD go on to become specialists. The real need in the state was for GPs, so they decided to fund an school of osteopathy instead. This probably couldn't happen now. <br><br>My childhood doctor had originally trained as an osteopath because he decided on a medical career late in life (30s rather than 20s) and could not get into a conventional medical school. This would probably have been in the 1940s sometime. At some point California had put some kind of restrictions on the DO but grandfathered all the practicing DOs as MDs. As a kid I had no idea of the distinctions--I just loved being left in the examining rooms that had wonderfully gory medical illustrations instead of the Disney cutouts that modern pediatricians plaster on the walls.<br><br>It is also interesting that one of the medical shows my mother was watching on TV has a plot thread involving a hospital being sued because the emergency room doctor overruled a cancer patient's "do not resuscitate" order because he can get her into a trial of yet another promising treatment.

Now ask yourself this: however did people get by fifty years ago without all that? And has adding in all that actually improved things, or the opposite?"<br><br>Having completed a M.Ed. degree (about 4-5 years ago), I can attest to it's overall worthlessness. However, I don't think it's fair to expect that today's school environment could ever have the pared-down environment of 50 years ago, due to the huge amount of social decay that has occurred in that time frame(which dramatically impacts the students). <br><br>The number of learning disabilities has skyrocketed (and, while people love to say that it's just due to diagnosis, it isn't...I think environmental toxicity is to blame, but whatever the cause there are a lot more kids who have tremendous problems learning than when I was a kid in the 70's. These require paperwork/meetings/etc). The impact of the high number of kids who have these life-threatening allergies where they can literally be alive and fine one minute and dead the next after touching something that had a trace of peanut (or whatever) on it is huge. The impact of the number of kids who sat in my classroom that came to school hungry, with inadequate clothing, with some huge melodrama going on at home (divorce, drugs, violence, homelessness, 20 people living in a 2-bedroom apt, etc...all things my students regularly experienced was huge - these situations ensured their minds were everywhere but the classroom and in the years I taught, these students comprised ~50% of my class (and I wasn't inner city). The increase in the number of parents who sue or threaten to sue is huge (a "friend" of mine actually just did this), thus requiring a substantial trail of paperwork for every student, etc. etc. And let's not even discuss NCLB and mandated testing.<br><br>In many cases, the school districts are just playing catch-up with trying to meet these drastic changes in student needs, as well as meeting burdensome legislative requirements or CYA from lawsuits.

In the hospital, more and more, the patients are admitted to the hospital service under the management of an internist known as a hospitalist. But physician's assistants see many or most of the patients as well as managing problems overnight. The PAs are very good and they collaborate with the doctors in a similar way to an apprentice, so over time they become pretty knowledgeable. Seeing an actual doctor can be a bit luxurious, but at the same time if you stub your toe, the toe specialist is called in, if you have a kidney doctor but have a problem with your bladder, the urologist is called in, you might have up to 3 different kinds of cardiologists, and the hospitalists defer to all those other specialties to do most decisions, tests, prescriptions. I'm sure this layer of doctors increases costs. If you have a cardiologist and are having chest pain, instead of being admitted under the care of your cardiologist, they go ahead and admit you under the care of the hospitalist, who calls your cardiologist in as a consultant.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c1489394285064895003 title="comment permalink">2/18/16, 1:47 PM</a><br><br>

The point of the thought experiment is to look at things from the American past that would work considerably better than what we have in the American present, and tax-funded medical care isn't there in the source material, you know. <br><br>Alexandra, elderflower? Why, yes. ;-) The abolition of the humanities is well under way in American academia, too, though it's as driven as much by the flight of the disciplines in question into into self-referential irrelevance as anything else. The humanities as once understood and practiced -- the <i>humaniores litterae</i>, as Petrarch would have said -- are all but extinct in American universities; all that remains is the hauling away of the corpse. <br><br>Damo, that's what happens when a society loses track of the fact that it actually needs to encourage people to get useful jobs and do productive work. One of the themes of the Retrotopia series is that the luxury to ignore that need is a thing of the past. <br><br>Myosotis, find something else to do with your time that interests you more. That's usually the best way to get out from under an unproductive habit. <br><br>Emmanuel, good. In point of fact, the monopoly laws are basically no longer enforced in today's America -- if they were, Amazon would be shut down overnight for its blatantly monopolistic behavior -- and soaring prices, plunging quality, and kleptocratic profiteering by the top end of the salary class are the inevitable results. <br><br>Stuart, as noted above, the point of this thought experiment is to explore ways in which things from the American past would work better than the corresponding things in the American present. I'm not a great fan of government-managed health care, though of course it's considerably better than what we've got in the US today -- almost anything would be better than what we've got in the US today -- but more to the point, it's not the way things were done back when we had some of the best health care on the planet, thus isn't relevant to this narrative. <br><br>Damo, please try to find that! I'd be very interested to see it. <br><br>Morgenfrue, as noted above, almost anything would be better than the health care we have in the US today.

I do confess to wanting to see The Donald say "You're Fired!" to the privileged classes metastasizing out of DC.<br><br>More on subject, I've heard it said that North America has long been divided between the Red Tribe and the Blue Tribe. The Red Tribe grows our food, fights our wars, works in our dwindling industries and collects our garbage. The Blue Tribe goes to college, occupies our remaining cushy office jobs, controls the media, and elects Republican and Democrat alike. The priest-politicians of the Republicans do pay lip service to a predominately white subclass of the Red Tribe in the same way that the democrat-shamans pay lip service to the browner subclasses of the Red Tribe (and actually convince many of them that they are temporarily embarrassed members of the Blue Tribe).<br><br>Unfortunately, the Red Tribe has been accepting converts from the Blue Tribe, and their new warlord, Donald the Unstumped, has been gathering quite the warband.<br><br>My round-about point is that what you described as the 'Suicide of the American Left' (it would be more accurate to say they cut out their still-beating heart and laid it on the altar of progress) is most evident in education and in the crisis of masculinity facing Western nations. Two generations of teaching men that their highest aspiration should be to move bits of real or imagined paper around have not had a particularly great result. Something has to change. It seems to me like the most important thing a society can do to stay stable is channel the energy of its young men in at worst, a harmless direction if not a constructive one. Once you realize this, the Pyramids look like an alternate take on football or Scouting. The modern approach of telling its young men that their excess energy is bad and just a figment of their privileged imaginations is well, suicidal.

Technicians (who mainly do shelving and circulation tasks) require just a high school degree. Associates (my job position, where I work reference desks, do a little programming and other tasks similar to librarians but have less responsibility) require a college degree. Librarians must have a Masters degree in Library/Information Science from an ALA-accredited institution.<br><br>When I started working this job 2 1/2 years ago, I had no plans to pursue a Masters. Despite having become more interested in libraries, I've become even more turned away from pursuing a Masters. The thing is, the public can't tell the difference between us "associates" and "librarians." When I started my job, the responsibilities of associates vs. librarians were a lot more fluid. Unfortunately, more recently my manager created rigid roles for each job title. One of my co-workers without a Masters, who has worked for our system for 7 years, doing similar amounts and quality programming as librarians, suddenly found that she was discouraged from doing tasks that she used to capably do simply because of new rules associated with her job title. She was so upset about this she was in tears.<br><br>I've had the experience of librarians fresh out of library school coming to work in my department having had little library work experience prior. I find that associates, despite their lower job title, are teaching them some skills! I also find that associates are sometimes more knowledgeable in certain fields than librarians, maybe because they have more free time to read or have more diverse work backgrounds?<br><br>For most of library history, there was no such thing as "library school" required to become a librarian. You had to be a serious scholar or take an apprenticeship to become a librarian. I would like to see some aspect of those old patterns return. Many librarians cringe at that suggestion because they see it as a threat to how they've invested in their career; this is a common response: http://inalj.com/?p=24861 I also find that I think more critically about contemporary libraries than my co-workers with Masters degrees. Maybe it's partly just because of who I am, or my background in other fields that allows me to ask "forbidden" questions, but some of it I attribute to having less schooling. I think independently, not having been indoctrinated into the accepted orthodoxy of professional opinion.<br><br>I do think having a deeper knowledge of the library field is important to complement day-to-day skills; I'm not against demanding standards of intellectual rigor for those entering the profession. However, I think there could be other ways to value this that don't involve going into massive debt and propping up academic institutions going in a delusional direction. In small ways I have tried to pursue a different path, though I wish I had more of a support structure. For example: Every year at work I have to pick a personal goal of my choice. This past year, I decided to learn more about library, book, and printing history, and how they has shaped human thought and culture. My co-worker lent me her syllabus for a course she took, "The History of the Book," which gave me some ideas for resources, but I designed my own course of study, picking the books I wanted to read, pursuing the questions that mattered most to me, participating in a letterpress printing apprenticeship, a bookbinding workshop, and communicating with rare book scholars. I have gained much insight into library history, but all on my own, for a fraction of the cost of a Masters level course. But I don't have a transcript to show for it.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c5038898864872074748 title="comment permalink">2/18/16, 8:15 PM</a><br><br>

This was at the U. of Washington, by the way. I think the first class I took was something called "Libraries and Society." A very plain speaking instructor told us that librarianship had become a Masters program because ... librarians wanted the professional respect (and status), accorded to doctors and lawyers. <br><br>Well, I never entered the MLS program. Heck, I didn't even bother finishing my BA. But, I didn't do too bad in library land. It really depended on the administration of whatever system I was working in. Some were hard line "you-have-to-have-a-degree" people, and others were much more flexible in taking account of actual experience. <br><br>And, since, at 15, I had gone out to run a rural branch, on my own, while the "librarian" was on vacation .. well, I had experience. My last experience in library land was as a on-call substitute clerical. For a 5 county regional system. If I worked in the big branches, it was "check them in and check them out and if anyone needs directions to the bathroom, refer them to a librarian." In the smaller rural branches, however, I was often "building head." Not that that was reflected in my wages :-). <br><br>Along the way, I took a few on-line classes. Picked and choose what would be useful to me. Children's Literature, Young Adult Literature, three reference courses. I even took cataloging. Paid for it myself. Wasn't too expensive. At that time, University of Main didn't charge any more for an out of state online student, than an in state student. I took the classes to be a more valuable employee, and to be of more use to the library users.

The fever has a prupose. The elevated temperature damages the structure of the virus and prevents its replication. From memory the term "telameres" was used to describe the particular part of the virus. All courtesy of a radio program heard while feeding the cows in the nice comfortable cabin of a tractor on a filthy winters day. Some progress is really worth hanging on to.<br><br>Go to bed, rug up warm, and drink plenty of fluids, wait a couple of days and then replace the bed clothes and wash the dirty linen.<br><br>On apprenticeships and degrees. I was working as a condition monitoring tech providing predicitive maintenance services to a GM Engine plant in Melbourne, Australia. The site had hired an intern whose thesis was on implementing those proceedures into a maintenance management system. We hit it off, and when I decided multinational corporates were fraudulent enterprises not worthy of my effort he was manipulated into a really good job for a graduate. We spent a couple of months bringing him up to speed, and his comment at the end of his first day on the business end of a vibration data collector was "f..k, now I know what they didn't teach us. Then he had to analyse the data we had collected. That I could do that with only a tradesmans experience did his head in. ( I had a number of consultants as clients who took my reports and rewrote them to make it look like they had done the work) He lasted twelve months, more or less and then got a job as an engineer at a very large global mutual insurer specialising in industrial insurance.

I've loved books since childhood and chasing after factoids. I used to spend hours just looking at the dictionary! The Internet is nerd heaven. Last year I realized I was spending too much time on the Net, and of course the advice here at ADR is to reduce screen time. To collapse properly, you have to get out in the field or start making lots of things by hand, or both. Also there is a lot to get done before the collapse really sets in and we lose the chance forever.<br>In my case, appalled at international treachery, I tend to spend way too long reading the news. So as a New Years sort of resolution, I took two steps. One was to choose one day a week and really go through the news then, but otherwise just glance at my in box and deal with stuff at hand. The other was to create a screen to block off my view of the TV, to which my husband is addicted. It was easy and my husband was helpful. Just a stiff sheet of plastic and couple of blocks of wood to hold it up. We didn't even need to buy anything.<br>This has done wonders for me. On Sundays I look at the news, and get so disgusted I go back to the taxes or my novel or sewing. Anything but more news.<br>I do make an exception for JMG and the comments here. They are worth at least scanning through. Lots of intelligent folks here discussing vital subjects. Nice community!

I've known plenty of older accountants who received far more professional standing than I've ever enjoyed and most of them learned by... an apprenticeship. And they’re old curmudgeons too. Of course the apprenticeship system works, but they sold my generation down the river to keep their salaries high and it played into the hands of the voracious education industry – who lapped it up. The barriers that were raised to entry into the profession have simply been raised higher as time goes on and ever more layers of complexity get added. And the fees increase and the parasites become hungrier all of the time and they set the rules too. Aren't they clever? If they want a pay rise they just come up with a new complexity and I have to jump through new hoops, and/or they consume some of my existing income...<br><br>I'm unsure where it is all going, but I decided to take an avenue that few people in my profession were willing to take because it is considered low status and doesn't pay that well, but businesses actually need that job done. I tend to consider it a bad thing if I spend too much time in the office, as I try and spend as much time as I can in the businesses. But few in my profession actually see the world that way.<br><br>On an interesting side note, I mentioned this to you a long time ago, but I'm occasionally contrary and in my last place of full time employment long ago, I actually bucked the entire system and took on a very talented accounts person as an apprentice - who hadn't been to University and they are still working there today. And you know the funny thing about it? The business needed that apprentice far more than the profession needed to maintain its hubris. I had to fight tooth and nail to get the idea across the line too from most directions - even though it was clearly in their best interests. And years later I was at a first birthday party (they're like a form of torture to me) and someone that by coincidence was working there thought that it was OK to question me about my decision - even after many years of outstanding work by that individual.<br><br>Pah. The system as it stands is a massive scam and it eats lives and resources that would be better utilised elsewhere. Many of the older professionals got to enjoy their younger years and never had the burden of responsibility of having to juggle full time work and part time study for more than a decade. Because you have to get a post graduate nowadays to practice too.<br><br>So much corporate training has been outsourced onto the individuals - it makes me angry. Grump, grump, grump! And don't start me about people taking two week courses and claiming they understand the pain of doing an entire undergraduate degree and then coming to me and asking me for more money (that happened in a past employment life and the IT industry stinks of it - you'd be surprised what employers want to do to them...)<br><br>Oooo. I'm seriously ranting and raving! It felt very cathartic.<br><br>I enjoyed the story too and the medical industry isn't too bad down here - and the government bulk buys pharmaceuticals because they're all to aware of the desire for profit.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: I've got a new blog entry up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>A Spanikopita in the works</a>.

My wife and I have been making herbal medicines for ourselves and then our children for quite a long time, and took some of those formulations public 5 years ago when we started our craft show/farmers market apothecary Small Batch Garden (also the name of my blog). We don't diagnose, prescribe, or formulate medicines per request; we just sell the handful of products we've had great success with, and make a decent side living at it, too. For now.<br><br>But the FDA's position on herbal medicine finally crossed over into Draconian territory last year, so much so that we removed any internet exposure our little company had. We figured it would be a lot harder for them to shut us down if we didn't just walk into their sting operation with our wrists held out waiting for the handcuffs!<br><br>Then with our herbal insect repellent we deal with the EPA, which doesn't really mind herbal bugsprays, so long as you only use ingredients on their pre-approved list. Which doesn't happen to include 2 of the ingredients in ours (get this): witchhazel solution and lavender essential oil! Of all the things that can make a herbal bugspray work, I've found these two to be crucial, and about as benign as it gets. (Hmmm, maybe they know that.) Our bugspray is as good as Deep Woods Off!, but so yummy in comparison that you might just choose to wear it as perfume, too, instead of feeling like you need to walk through an industrial car wash after application!<br><br>THEN, 2 years ago my brother's wife left her high-stress corporate insurance job and went to herbalist school to become a clinical herbalist, and now tries to play the role of expert when talking with us. Jesus, the holier-than-thou alphabet soup game irritates me. Never mind that we've been living in the middle of an ecological garden for most of a decade now, or that we used most of these plants regularly for another decade before that! Or that hundreds of people have ranted and raved about our products (not that we're allowed to use testimonials in our business - that's considered drug fraud now!) for half a decade.<br><br>Go to school, get the letters to dangle behind your name, and then go to your real job, which apparently is to pour scorn on anyone who doesn't do it the "right" way!

Cave1 and Louis V. Holroyd1. American Journal of Physics 23, 61 (1955). <br><br><br>Abstract: "The construction and operating characteristics of a Michelson interferometer designed on kinematic principles are outlined. The main components are ground steel dowel pins and ball bearings which are commercially available. The construction requires only a moderate amount of mechanical skill. Preliminary results indicate that the device is quite suitable for use in the undergraduate optics laboratory."<br><br><br>Yes, that's from 1955; and uses a photo-multiplier tube (1950's tech that is still in heavy use today) as a detector. It's compact -- even more so if you update to a laser. Recommend a good solid steel plate for a base and don't use it on the 2nd floor of a building, try a slab foundation or basement. As other people have mentioned, it's really a bit much for younger students (especially to DO the experiment rather than just count fringes etc). But it's a wonderful experience. Things go wrong. Things don't work. You have to figure out why and how to fix it. That's when students actually LEARN something. So any experiment you can put in your novel involving something going wrong, where students have to fix it -- that is educational gold.

There’s been a long, slow dismantling of the Organopónicos system since 2012, already, and it seems these latest developments are already causing the system to cave in the face of global economic pressure exactly the way Carr fears Lakeland will. Barring Cuba’s other problems, the Organopónicos system has always stood out as the only nationwide attempt that exists at present for dealing with an age of limits, and it’s produced some promising results, but right now its future looks pretty grim. Perhaps enough people will continue to practice the urban agriculture model out of habit and necessity even as the economy changes so that some of the techniques that have been developed there will pass to the next generations to be readily revived when they’re needed again. I wonder if Carr has enough memory of history to be able to draw comparisons with US/Cuba relations in 2016, and ultimately, I wonder how Lakeland’s future post-embargo will differ from current events? I’m reminded of a past essay on the timing of social change: http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2007/10/climbing-down-ladder.html . In which, you say:<br><br><br>“While modern industrial societies as they exist today probably can’t survive the end of constantly increasing energy supplies, the impact of peak fossil fuel production will likely drive the emergence of other forms of industrialism adapted to a world of diminishing fuel supplies – and while those supplies still exist, these neo-industrial societies will probably still be able to wield more economic and military force than ecotechnic rivals.<br><br>[…]In the near and middle future […] the societies that will be best able to flourish are precisely those that will be least able to survive over the long term. In the near term, societies that rely on the increasingly efficient use of the remaining fossil fuels, eked out with renewable resources and high technology, will likely do much better than either the wasteful dinosaur cultures of the present industrial period or the lower-energy cultures that will end up replacing them. ”<br><br>It seems, based on that passage, that what’s currently going on in Cuba, is that with the lifting of the embargo, the Cuban economy, and the tier of scarcity industrialism it’s adapted to is entering into competition with the abundance industrialism of the rest of the world, and being overrun, and technologies and systems like Organopónicos that are emergent ecotechnic systems, are being overrun by the modern abundance oriented agricultural system. So the question there is, what’s different in the Lakeland Republic’s era? (Assuming it succeeds, which… well it wouldn’t be much of a utopian novel if it didn’t) Is the answer to that question that it’s entering the world at just the right time, The Lakeland Republic maxing out at the tier 5 counties that represent a classic scarcity industrialist model, and an agricultural system that uses urban mixed-crop agriculture similar to Cuban Organopónicos, while the Eastern Republic is still using an abundance system in an age that no longer supports it, thus representing an ecological shift that hasn’t quite happened yet?<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c3413191753761438849 title="comment permalink">2/19/16, 9:27 AM</a><br><br>

Graduates are a lot of work and more or less have to undertake an apprenticeship before they are useful and productive. And that really annoys me because the system ate chunks of my life, and who are they to set the bar anyway? Honestly, if such a system were anything other than a barrier to entry, then feedback would go two ways, but it doesn't. Just sayin...<br><br>There is a weird thing with University too that has always troubled me. There was never a subject which discusses the role of Universities, their place in society and how to think clearly and how to actually practice the art of studying. I often wondered about that lack and it is certainly telling that they didn’t cover those issues.<br><br>The post graduate - which is required in order to gain professional standing - and run by the professional body was much more relevant to the real world and lived experience, but then why couldn't that learning simply be incorporated into the University under graduate course? And everyone wants their cut of your time and resources too. And they manage to maintain that cut on an ongoing basis through the requirements of continuing professional development minimum hours (40 hours per year) requirements which is measured in hours. And then a few years back a new scam developed whereby you attend a course which may go for 8 hours. You think you'd receive recognition for the full 8 hours.

The time since something happened tends to compress in my memory; I think it came out in the 1990s or possibly the 1980s. IIRC the cover art was a US map with color-coded states, no purple ones (that was a later development). The article got enough attention that other political commentators picked up its terminology. It's possible that the title of the article was "Red State, Blue State."<br><br>If anybody else remembers reading this article maybe they can supply further details to track it down. Or look for a first citation of the term "Blue State".<br><br>I noticed at the time that the color associations were unfamiliar, and I don't think a reason was given in the article. What I figured was that the authors did it deliberately in order to avoid implying that liberals are Commies or fellow travelers. Both Harper's and the Atlantic Monthly were slightly left of center editorially and they wouldn't want to do that.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c2223792117082930809 title="comment permalink">2/19/16, 4:34 PM</a><br><br>

After a few months of surgery and chemotherapy, both are (apparently) cancer-free and back to living normal lives. Some months of recovery were needed to restore strength and energy. (Taxol and cisplatin stop cancer, essentially, by stopping cell reproduction. Cells in non-cancerous tissues survive longer, and so are less affected.) In the case with which I am most familiar, the medical staff seemed surprised and delighted that their patient actually performed the home-care activities as prescribed. "Most patients just expect us to do everything for them", I might have heard one say. <br><br>So, we enjoy ultrasonic imaging for diagnosis. General anesthesia for major abdominal surgery. Antiseptic surgical conditions. Trained and experienced medical staff. Chemotherapy that works. (Yeah, I know that taxol was originally extracted from a "taxus" (yew) tree.) Sterile single-use (plastic) IV plumbing. Blood tests for specific marker proteins, as well as lymphocytes and red blood cells. Powerful anti-nausea medications (though I hear that there's a effective herb for THAT).<br><br>As for the financial part of it, it's all a mystery. From the actual cost of consultations and treatments, to the billed costs, actual insurance payment (negotiated between provider and insurer), to implicit cost-sharing which provides some care to those unable to pay, who knows what's true? When you need treatment, you're in no position to haggle.<br><br>If you're planning to have cancer, NOW seems to be the very best time... not 25 years ago (when my first wife discovered the melanoma that killed her), and probably not 25 years from now (when morphine might just ease the pain).<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c1631720867304127897 title="comment permalink">2/19/16, 6:13 PM</a><br><br>

When I was a little boy in the early 70s, our family doctor (Dr. Bilotti) still made housecalls. And he was not a believer in fiddling about with oral antibiotics for days and days. If you came down with strep, you got a shot of penicillin in the arse to knock it out.<br><br>It has been decades since Drs. did housecalls. In fact, since Bilotti, we only had one Dr who did, Dr Connoly, who made a housecall to remove sutures after my wife's surgery. Even though our current Dr. must be seen in the office, we have been going to her for 14 years. There is a level of trust between the GP and the patient that is built up over time. This system of HMOs, clinics, urgent care, and rolling Drs. is dehumanizing and misses things. The system of housecalls was so much more humane.<br><br>Be careful with herbs, guys. Whilst herbs can be efficacious and are important, so is evidence based medicine. One of my wife's friends wanted her to drink black walnut tea.

Well, from my observations, they spend a lot of time doing personal shopping on the internet. And, looking at cute cat pictures. They develop new programs, that, since they have no contact with the patrons, or the library workers who are "in the trenches", often have very bad unintended consequences. :-). They will also take non-degreed employees suggestions, say they are unworkable, and then implement them 6 months later, and claim them for their own. <br><br>On the other hand, I've known many fine librarians in my working career. Librarians who value their customers and get a real charge out of putting the right book, or, accurate information in the right hands. There's a little charge of energy that's exchanged when that happens. And, they are fed on it. I probably worked for two of the finest catalogue librarians, in the Pacific Northwest. They wanted their classifications of books to be 100% accurate. So you could find the book or material you were looking for. That's all mostly outsourced, now, to a big company called OCLC. They hire green librarians, fresh out of library school, keep as many of them part time (so they don't have to provide benefits) and pay them near minimum wage. <br><br>One of the finest children's "librarian", I knew, finally stopped going to children's library conferences. Even though he has been in the trenches, for years, and, raised a daughter as a single parent, he only had a BA ... and not in Library Science (now called "Information Technology", by the way.) He'd be having pleasant conversations about a successful program he had developed, and, when was asked where he got his library degree from, and it came out that he wasn't degreed, they'd turn their back on him and walk away. <br><br>In library land, you have more status as a librarian, if you don't work directly with "the great unwashed." The public. We had a regional head librarian, who wouldn't even say hello to a person, unless they had a library degree. She also added a whole layer of pointless management, just to employ more degreed librarians. They do take care of their own. <br><br>Then a new head librarian came in. She began by talking to EVERY employee in the library system. From the lowliest page to the delivery guys on the docks. She stripped out the layer of useless management. Oh, the howls! I think there was even a law suit or two. That went nowhere. <br><br>Not really related to "degrees", but a similar thing happened in the chain book business. It seemed like there was a slow swinging pendulum. Between "book people" and "bean counters." The bean counters would take over the home office, things would fall apart, and it was back to the book people, again. The bean counters ended up "winning", in the end. <br><br>Well, enough ranting. Thank you. I feel better :-).

An astrocamera exposing a slow photo emulsion could be pointed to Polaris (the "Pole Star"). Polaris is close enough to the actual north celestial pole to describe an arc of conveniently small radius in the several-hours-long photo exposure. At the centre of this little arc is the exact north celestial pole, no matter how significant the plumb-line-perturbing centrifugal "force" might be in a rotating frame of reference fixed on Earth. <br><br>Finally, I now remember with a bit of a jolt that I was too swift in dismissing Thomson electron charge-to-mass-ratio as an experiment dangerous for schools.

He worked his way up from testing into a job as a "junior engineering technician" after a sound math &amp; science background in Catholic school and a couple years trying out several college majors completely unrelated to engineering. He learned on the job and through personal study, kept passing promotional tests until he reached Transportation Engineer, but couldn't progress further without a college degree and wasn't allowed to test for the Professional Engineer license. Going back to college for years while working full time and overtime, and raising a family, wasn't possible or desirable.<br><br>His father and grandfather became engineers the same way, back in the 1920s and 1940s, working up to become Resident Engineers in charge of building major highway projects. But the move to "professionalize" swept that path away, and now an engineering degree is essential to even be allowed to take the entry level tests to qualify for hiring interviews. Meanwhile, as before in his father's and grandfather's days, the experienced, years-in-the-field "bastard engineers" (let's call them B.E.s for fun) had to take the green college kids under their wings and teach them everything practical they needed to even begin to function, including people skills, building specifications and safety on major construction jobs. But the last of the B.E.s are retiring/dying out now, that path is closed, and I shudder to think about who's designing &amp; running these major jobs now.<br><br>And this was the world famous California Division of Highways in its building heyday, later rechristened Caltrans. It's a decimated shambles now and getting worse, run into the ground by politicians, the contracting industry and "professionalization", as the system falls apart from deferred maintenance and the pounding of traffic beyond its originators' wildest imaginations.

According to AlterNet and The Washington Post, the terms were coined by journalist Tim Russert, during his televised coverage of the 2000 presidential election.[1] That was not the first election during which the news media used colored maps to depict voter preferences in the various states, but it was the first time a standard color scheme took hold; the colors were often reversed or different colors used before the 2000 election. . .<br><br>In the days following the 2000 election, whose outcome was unclear for some time after election day, major media outlets began conforming to the same color scheme because the electoral map was continually in view, and conformity made for easy and instant viewer comprehension. On Election Night that year, there was no coordinated effort to code Democratic states blue and Republican states red; the association gradually emerged. Partly as a result of this eventual and near-universal color-coding, the terms "red states" and "blue states" entered popular use in the weeks following the 2000 presidential election. After the results were final, journalists stuck with the color scheme, as The Atlantic's December 2001 cover story by David Brooks entitled, "One Nation, Slightly Divisible", illustrated.[15]<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c5218999504349525680 title="comment permalink">2/20/16, 1:30 AM</a><br><br>

When I was a child the pictures about the pyramids always show some guy hitting with a whip the back of some workers (slaves) pushing a stone block on a ramp; obviously all that was a pure invention. IMHO the pyramids were, in fact, a huge re-distribution system (we could call that now “Keynesianism”) for free workers, that fit the moral parameters of that time, because it was made “in the name of the Pharaoh’s glory”<br><br>The Ancient Egypt was obsessed with the “stationary state” (eternity), and this “keynesianism” was a way to achieve the social stability (as all keynesianism), as also were the “Jubilees” in the Sumerian region, based in the periodic destruction of debt (another re-distribution system) “by the generosity of the Almighty new King”. More or less it works for more than two thousand years<br><br>In the modern times we tend to think that all the past societies were “in the brink of starvation”, that is another important part of the “myth of progress”, so the reaction to the “optimistic” writings of William Godwin was “Essay on the Principle of Population” (1798) by Thomas Malthus, where he “demonstrated” the truth that the “struggle for survival” is the natural state of the man, as was the hobbesian “poor, nasty, brutish and short” live of the men. Of course they achieve the self-fulfilling prophecies of these ideas, after the dynamic of “enclosures” and dispossession, with the “Poor Laws”, the “Workhouses” and the Irish Famine<br><br>At the end of the middle age, in Europe (for example in the “Comunidades de Villa y Tierra” of Castile) there were around 200 days of saints festivities when the peasants did not work, so the surplus was quite high those days.

We have a small-scale herb business in the north-east. I know a few others too, and they all face similar licensing and certification challenges. Most manage it with various radar avoidance strategies, or pushing into teaching and classes to make up income where product sales at higher volume gets too conspicuous. But then the field can get a bit ponzi-like with herbalists training herbalists to make money because the risk of being a practicing herbalist is too great. Also, in the couple of years that we tried to sell a lot of product - running around to farmers markets and trying to get into retail stores and selling online - well, it became a stressful business very quickly, and making money became a focus. And so then you end up flirting with the same dynamics that got the current system into trouble: the need to make money and grow. So, you have to keep it simple and that means a low level of income. Which is fine for me at my stage of life but would be more difficult if we were relying on it to raise a family. So, of course, the regulatory dynamics are not at all friendly. Although I suspect there aren't many inspectors to actually follow-up on the mass of regulations one has to consider. But there are lawyers, plenty of lawyers.<br><br>The financing model that JMG touches on in the story - the local physician under contract to provide health services to organizations and families, and integrating simple and proven herbal remedies into a general practice - makes a lot of sense. Flat salary, rather than incentives to treat or prescribe, is the way to go. Ideally, a salary structure based on health outcomes would be good, but it's very hard to implement. Impossible really. And the current US system has been fiddling around pay-for-performance and quality measures for years to no serious result. The current system will implode if it can't keep growing. And it only grows if it can keep treating and prescribing, more and more, and finding people to pay for it all. Nobody is going to "bend the cost curve" willingly, except reality will, at some point.<br><br>Years ago, my father was a salaried school dentist, working for the local health authority in the UK, as part of the NHS. He went around to schools and treated kids teeth. He didn't have to invest in fancy equipment (visiting a modern dentist these days is bit like a trip to NASA mission control). And he didn't have to spend money on marketing and administration and IT and stuff. He just rigged up a mobile RV/caravan with a dentist chair and towed it around from school to school behind his car. He was paid the same salary whether he saw ten people or twenty, or whether he applied a dozen treatments or none. Did the same thing, pretty much, for 35 years. I don't know what's happening in the UK these days, whether fee for service has gotten it's horrible claws into the practice of medicine or not. But I'm pretty sure people wouldn't be comfortable with my Dad pulling up in the parking lot with his caravan and a foot-powered drill. Meanwhile, I'm 54 and my teeth are all, mostly, intact.<br><br>Simple is always better, in my view, unless you want to grow and make a lot money.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c8388986467516495146 title="comment permalink">2/20/16, 8:53 AM</a><br><br>

Last year the BSA re-structured the Cub Scout program, and published in their monthly magazine a sampling of the new material. Group activities outside of the weekly meetings are now called "adventures," the completion of which determines the boys' advancement through the program.<br><br>The sample "adventure" they highlighted in the magazine article is one intended for Weblos (ten-to-eleven-year-olds). It comes with a rationale, a list of educational objectives, and a form that enumerates eight "requirements" for the adventure, each of which ties in with one or more of five key "principles" and requires a separate "approved by" sign-off. One of the requirements lists four different necessary "leadership roles" that the kids must fulfill during the adventure.<br><br>This exemplary adventure is <i>a three-mile walk</i>.<br><br>Each of the program elements appears meritorious on the surface.

It suffices to use some standard pre-1990 amateur procedure for aligning an equatorially mounted telescope with the celestial pole. (I say "pre-1990" because from 1990 onward, amateur astronomy has been affected by computerization, as the teaching physics lab has also been.) Once the telescope is correctly aligned, with its N-S ("polar") axis pointing to that tricky little spot just a tiny bit away from Polaris, with the tracking motor turned on, all stars, no matter where in the sky, will appear stationary in the eyepiece.<br><br>So I now suspect my idea of finding North as a school exercise is insufficiently instructive.<br><br>What would be a good exercise in problem-solving? The Coriolis cloud exercise which I proposed above, and someone's (Richard Feynman's?) exercise on determining the average thickness of the oil slick - possibly on the order of a tenth of a micron - still stand. **BUT** these two exercises do not probe deep. We need, rather, problem-solving tasks that touch the conceptual foundations of physics.<br><br>With diffidence, realizing my own deficiencies (nothing beyond B.Sc., the prescribed B.Sc. astrophys supplementary courses, and private study), I remark herewith that two general areas to consider are (A) quantics (rather notably, wave-particle duality) and (B) gravitation.<br><br>(A) In quantics, we recall that the Young double-slit experiment from ca 1800 was repeated ca 1900/1910/1920 in a deep way by someone at Cambridge. In the Cambridge work, a weak light source was caused to illuminate the slits, and the diffraction pattern was thrown upon a photo emulsion, subsequently developed. The chosen source was so weak as to make it probable that at any one instant, at most a single photon would be passing through one or the other of the two slits. From a non-quantum perspective, we would expect to find no interference pattern on developing the emulsion (exposed to its feeble barrage of individual photons over a period of days, weeks, or months): and yet there is an interference pattern.<br><br>How can this experiment now be modified? It is a key feature of the Cambridge arrangement that although the individual photons pass singly through the two-slitted barrier, the emulsion is developed in a darkroom tray all in one fell swoop. What happens if we somehow forgo all-in-one-fell-swoop photo developing? Can we arrange for each individual photon impact to be followed by the developing of just one little fragment of emulsion - say, by making a row of tiny emulsion tiles, and developing the tiles one by one, so as to track individual photon impact events (perhaps replacing tiles-removed with tiles-as-yet-unexposed, doing lots and lots of tile-removal and tile-insertion in the darkness)? Do we then still get the diffraction pattern?<br><br>My guess is "no". But what do I know about wave-particle duality? I got C- in the quantum physics course of Univ of Toronto 3rd yr (1993-1994), and have to hope to remedy my deficiencies some day with private study, AFTER progressing in the current round of radio physics (Maxwell).<br><br>(B) We could devise some kind of problem-solving to probe the puzzling fact that inertial mass (the "m" in "force = m times acceleration") is the same as gravitational mass (the "m" in "force of mutual attraction between two bodies of negligible extension, each of mass m, at separation r, is proportional to m-squared divided by r-squared").<br><br>Apparently the classical experimental authority for this is Eötvös. But we want somehow to build on the thoughts of Eötvös, not to repeat them by way of recitation.<br><br><br>Hastily,<br><br>Tom (near Toronto)<br>Toomas(dot)Karmo(at)gmail(dot)com<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c2919111567119510878 title="comment permalink">2/20/16, 11:35 AM</a><br><br>

The candidates were given a comprehensive introduction to anatomy, signs and symptoms, correct terminology and usage of many implements and treatments as well as the importance of the role of the nursing assistant in the patient’s care. It was rigorous and inspiring. The time I spent working with the nurses and doctors back then was very fulfilling…there was respect for and appreciation of every person involved in the patient’s care, including housekeeping staff. And, there was time… time enough to get “the work” done, and plenty of time to have a relationship with the patients and other staff. There was an esprit de corps that made even the most “unpleasant” treatments (involving as they did much exposure to body fluids) just part of a normal day.<br><br>I left the work world to be a full time mom and home maker, and it was many years later that I “went back” to my former occupation. Things had definitely changed, and for the worse. Now direct care staff were under trained, under paid and put in impossible positions every shift. The weekends were just horrendous…not enough staff scheduled, a certain amount of reporting out sick, and we were faced with the dilemma of hauling heavy patients around alone to render care where stated policy required two persons for such work. The question one asked was, “Do I leave Ms. X laying in her own excrement, or risk injury to do what humanity demands?” After injuring my back badly enough to qualify for workers compensation twice, I finally responded to my husband’s begging me to quit before my injuries became incapacitating, and resigned.<br><br>Back in the day, even the RNs with BS degrees would jump right in to lift and maneuver patients. In the more recent experience, it was contractually forbidden for even an LPN to assist with such work…medication and treatments only were allowed. The jobs had been “upgraded”, you see.<br><br>My husband’s experience in his field of engineering also followed a similar trajectory to many folks commenting here. The company he worked for used to promote from the ranks, but increasingly started bringing in MBAs and other forms of bean counters as supervisors and managers. The IT department made the tasks of the engineers who actually brought in revenue for the company almost impossible. Over the thirty years of his career, the last ten or so seemed to be the worst. He retired in 2014, and is a very happy man. And I am a very happy woman.<br><br>Our adult children are getting by for the most part, but each year brings more complexity to deal with and uncertainty about the future. We help when we can, but try to model the LESS behavior without preaching…not always easy.<br><br>Thanks so much, JMG, for the reminders that we could go back and find a more human and satisfying life, if we just decided to get off our glutei maximi and make the changes we can now, while building for the future.

The first step was simply to show that a momentary spark discharge on one side of the room produced a microscopic spark in apparatus on the other side. We're talking about 1886 technology: a battery, capacitor, switch, and wire, plus more wire and a microscope for the receiver. The trick is to have circuits which resonate at the same frequency in both units. There would be a bit of simple metalwork needed to build the adjustable spark gap in both units, and perhaps a tunable capacitor in the transmitter. <br><br>After making the first sparks, Hertz went on to focus his radiation with parabolic dishes (on each side), to measure the frequency (wavelength) by showing interference fringes from a plate behind the receiver (which means that the wavelength was on the order of centimeters: microwaves), polarization of the waves, and even the photo-electric effect (for which Einstein won the 1921 Nobel prize for a paper published in 1905).<br><br>And, as we might expect radio to be important in Lakeland, it would be important for the students to understand its foundations.<br><br>... not that I'm <i>biased</i> or anything... --... ...-- DE AB3NA<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c7224452254317707260 title="comment permalink">2/20/16, 4:17 PM</a><br><br>

It's fair to assume that the salaries of some well-paid specialists pump the average up, so a fair salary (in our current economy) for a GP might be $100,000 annually. And probably it's more like 250 people per GP in close urban well-off areas, and 1,000 for poorer rural areas. Still, it works out to $200 a year for 500 people to support a single $100k GP. Pretty cheap, really.<br><br>What surprised me was specialists from 2001 to 2011 going from 84.6 to 117.9 per 100,000, that's a 40% increase in 10 years. I assure you that the health of the population has not improved 40% in 10 years. In medicine as in other things, we see diminishing returns on effort, time and money invested. <br><br>I was also surprised we had so many nurses, 1,195.8 per 100,000, up 17% in those same 10 years. I suppose lots must be working in aged and disability care. <br><br>So basically for 1,000 people we'd have 2 GPs, 1 specialist and 12 nurses. So, 1.5% of the population are involved in medical care... not counting all the admin staff etc. <br>I think most communities of 1,000 people could afford 2 GPs. I'm not sure they could also afford 1 specialist and 12 nurses. But do we really need them all? I genuinely don't know. <br><br>In Australia there's been a growing movement to attach nurses to GPs and deal with more mundane stuff, like colds and vaccinations. But this is as well as and not instead of GPs. It seems to me that health and education are both things which you can always spend more money on. But again, do we really need it? I don't know.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c8772708464884850668 title="comment permalink">2/20/16, 5:20 PM</a><br><br>

I will be making my case to the local electorate over the next six weeks or so and hope to gain enough ground to land in the top three come April. I decided to go with a more conventional handle (at least for the time being), as I set up a blog for my "campaign" and figured that it would be better to have the posts signed "David" rather than the more esoteric predecessor.<br><br>englandfortworiverscitycouncil.blogspot.com, for any who are interested. I'm being very upfront in my approach, though admittedly treading lightly on the localization emphasis for now.<br><br>More on-topic, two thoughts. First, regarding the credentialing issue, I am not a PE, though I could sit for the exam, given the experience I've acquired. I have a graduate engineering degree, but not the 4-year undergraduate engineering degree generally required for the exams. (I'm more applied mathematician than engineer, but solidly within the overlap area.) Even though my employer would give a small pay bump if I got the licensing, I've decided that I don't care to perform any more hoop-jumping.<br><br>Secondly, given our repeated visits to the educational system in the narrative, I am wondering if anyone in the readership here has thoughts re the possible structures of replacement educational systems? A number of folks have commented on the apprenticeship mechanism -- which I believe is a very likely successor to "higher ed" -- but what of the primary schooling systems? Perhaps it is too early to begin building yet, as the collapse has to proceed further before there will be enough local support to do something different.<br><br>Lastly, more off-topic, my personal disintermediation efforts continue. Today saw a successful loaf of bread baked (pain de campagne, per the recipe), that cheese-making class is coming up in a few weeks, and I signed up for one-on-one banjo lessons at our local folk music shop. Baby steps!<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c6184913984902115487 title="comment permalink">2/20/16, 5:33 PM</a><br><br>

You don't know where the photon landed until you find the exposed point on the film which you can only find by developing it.<br><br>Also, photographic film (emulsion) is not sensitive enough to respond detectably to a single photon. At least, not any kind of film available to the public.<br><br>There are devices that can register a single photon immediately, and separately for each photon. Most modern versions of double slit experiments use these instead of photographic film. But a single-photon detector array suitable for a classroom experiment would be too expensive or too difficult to handle, and it would be difficult getting any school laboratory dark enough (or a housing for the experiment perfect enough) to not have random leaked photons swamp the signal anyhow.<br><br>The kind of sensors digital cameras use are getting close to single-photon sensitivity (which the human eye also already has when completely adapted to darkness), and digital camera sensors <a href=http://petapixel.com/2015/10/12/cmos-inventor-working-on-gigapixel-sensor-that-can-detect-single-photons/ rel=nofollow>might soon be able to record individual photons</a>. Even with those, a classroom version would have to put the whole experiment inside a literal black box to keep other stray light out. All the students would be able to see is the electronic signals coming out. (That might be okay if the students understand what the apparatus is doing and have already seen the visible interference pattern in a previous demonstration.)<br><br>Nonetheless, quantum mechanics (which has been tested in countless different ways in countless experiments) predicts that the interference pattern would still form in any of those cases. The only way the interference pattern would not occur is if you really did install some way to find out which path each individual photon takes (or at least, which slit it goes through) before detecting where it actually strikes the screen. Any way of collecting and retaining such information causes the interference pattern to disappear. According to some interpretations of QM this is due to "collapse of the probability wave function" caused by "measuring" (interacting with) the photon's path along the way. Other interpretations explain the outcome in different terms but all make the same prediction for what the actual results of the experiment would be.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c976308414113158533 title="comment permalink">2/20/16, 6:39 PM</a><br><br>

The attempts to upscale the job by doing two years of school, then two years on the job (electrical technologist), compared with 8 to 12 week school periods, each followed by ten months of work experience(electrician), has been limited due to the technologists frequently being only suitable for niche jobs, and not having the practical experience for the normal day to day troubleshooting required. I remember that all the high school staff were pushing university, and the trades were reserved for those not "good enough" for higher education. I note that many of those engineering type jobs are being off shored, but it is pretty hard to off shore my job of keeping the equipment running, and net wages (no student loans, earning from first day on the job) favor the trades for quite a few years.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c2463102669474810158 title="comment permalink">2/20/16, 8:51 PM</a><br><br>

About all you can do with a Bachelors is be a case manager. However, when the time came, I decided not to pursue further education precisely because of what I saw in University. Competition for research graduate programs is intense, and published research has metastasized like a tumor over the years, yet all the low hanging fruit, such as Milgram's compliance study, has already been picked. So now, most research is focused on very arcane, specific studies that only seek to move the needle a millimeter using very complex, byzantine computerized statistical programs. Psychology, like everything today, is not immune to being taken over by the technostructure.<br>On the practical side, I just could never get excited about shunting people into the System with a capital S, having no faith that it actually promoted any real mental health. I'd participated in public mental health systems and seen therapists in both public &amp; private systems, and I've never been more sane until I left that behind. I have no faith in the public mental health systems programs of medication (definitely distrust psych meds along with all big pharma), rehab (not shown to have any efficacy), job training/placement (what jobs?), and connection to social workers/etc. If I were behind the desk advising someone, it would go something like this: "the problem you suffer from is not a PERSONAL problem, it's a SOCIOECONOMIC/POLITICAL one. You're in a hopeless system designed to keep you down. Personal solutions like psych meds, rehab, job training/placement are not the answer to socioeconomic/political problems. Your grandparents &amp; great grandparents did not suffer from the problems you're suffering from, because they did not suffer the socioeconomic injustice you do. The solution to socioeconomic/political problems are pitchforks &amp; rope, and an organized effort with fellow oppressed in the same boat as you. Bringing down an unjust system that you don't benefit from and trying to create something better for your grandchildren so they don't have to suffer the indignities you do are the only things that will bring about a sense of purpose and meaning to your life."<br>Somehow, I don't think that's the kind of person they want sitting behind the desk. They'd rather have someone referring to psychiatrists for psych meds, rehab, social workers--anything to keep the underclass in the System. I wonder if the way we treat the underclass in mental health systems is not the same kind of Batesonian bind as the one that blamed housewives for their "hysteria" in postwar suburban anomie, and blamed slaves for drapetomania.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c6882108980843275472 title="comment permalink">2/21/16, 6:52 AM</a><br><br>

Drug and alcohol abuse/dependence, depression, violence/lashing out are all logical/reasonable responses to cope with as pathological a society as ours has become, yet the System does not recognize these as valid responses to a pathological system, and places all the blame at the individual's feet. My neighbor two doors down shot himself, and I find that to be a totally logical response to losing his job. Like most people nowadays, his job meant the world to him, and he'd already lost his job before and spent quite a bit of time searching until he found the more recent job he got let go from. If he hadn't of shot himself, then he'd be faced with the Batesonian bind of looking for a nonexistent job. Society says that an abled-bodied man his age should have no problem finding a job, and puts all the responsibility on the individual to find work. After a while of searching for a non-existent job, he'd get discouraged, and he'd find no support in society for being a "slacker" who isn't working. So his choice to eat a bullet instead of suffering the torture of the Batesonian bind society would put him in makes total sense.<br>I think that therapy is designed to keep people coming back to therapists by focusing on and magnifying one's problems. I forget where, but some tribe in Africa thought that the Western therapeutic practice of putting someone in a small dark room to talk with someone about their grief was bizarre. They dealt with grief by getting the individual out into the open and celebrating some kind of ceremony to lift the curse, to get the person outside his or herself. To me, that's the never ending cycle of therapy--you go to a therapist to talk about and focus on your problems, which magnifies your problems, and it becomes a never ending cycle of navel gazing whereby you become self-absorbed and personal molehills get made into mountains. Our grandparents &amp; great grandparents rightfully scorned such behaviors, and people in the deindustrial future will not have the luxury of obsessing on such trivialities.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c3214170558474602794 title="comment permalink">2/21/16, 12:38 PM</a><br><br>

Each doctor was assigned so many thousands of people and it was up to him to ensure that they stayed healthy. The kicker was that if they stayed healthy he got his full pay but that the more sick people there were, the lower his pay would be. That sounds like something that the Retrotopian Republic might be interested in with the proper safeguards in place.<br> <br> This next bit I am a bit hesitant to mention but feel it worth noting. Many people here talk about simplifying their lives, growing their own foods, etc. and I say more power to them. When the passengers on an ocean liner take to drilling holes in the ship's hull under the encouragement of the crew as a way of behaviour, it is not incumbent on all passengers to take part nor not to borrow a lifeboat or two.<br><br> There is however another dimension to this voluntary collapse in how it may be viewed by different authorities. As an example, I came across an old Civil Defense film from the 1950s at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jifD6UQ57XI which states that people abandoning cities in case of nuclear attack to be guilty of treason and worse. This film is just bizarre to watch but instructive how things can play out.<br><br> My point is how people that seek to build a post-industrial lifestyle will be viewed - as teachers and mentors to others or as personal rebukes or even threats to a collapsing system and way of life, especially to fellow citizens. By rights as things slowly get worse, more people should be encouraged to adopt such a lifestyle by their governments but I see no real sign of that happening yet.

Trouble is, knowing that doesn't fix the suffering people are going through. And in some cases the right drug can help people. I know that venlafaxine has helped me with my depression and anxiety issues and made me somewhat more functional, though it doesn't fix any of the underlying issues. I've been on and off it enough times to know that if I go off it I'll likely be back on again in a few months because my mental health has gotten worse again. I'm also using some herbal tinctures that I make based on what I learned from the local college that teaches that as well as the venlafaxine, but those herbs were simply not effective enough alone. <br><br>It is nice to be able to make some of my own meds, though, and even grow some of the ingredients myself.

A classroom interferometer is possible, as I believe others have pointed out ; there's cognitive dissonance involved in imagining gr.8s using it, but that's because I am picturing gr.8s as I know them now. In Lakeland, probably ought to be thinking of first-year undergraduates, at least, for maturity... in which case, yeah, go for it. <br><br>That said, we never did Michelson-Morley in my undergraduate classes; we did do Millikan's oil drop and Thompson's mass experiment, though. Note that Thompson's experiment does not actually measure the mass of the electron, but the ratio of the electrostatic to gravitational forces on the electron in the experiment. Other experiments are needed to find the charge of the electron, and the electrostatic and gravitational force constants if one is to derive the mass from this experiment. Millikan's gives us the charge. Coulomb's constant can be measured quite easily in the lab, from the deflection of charged spheres (here's a lab report! https://andrewsadvphyslab.wikispaces.com/Experiment+2+-+Measuring+Coulomb's+Constant ) ; Cavendish's experiment for the gravitational constant is very similar (deflection of an accurate torsion balance) but rather more finicky. That said, this suite of interrelated experiments would be an excellent one. Amazing, in fact. If I ever had the chance to plan a physics lab course... I'd do these.<br><br>Then, once everyone is convinced that the electron is a particle with discreet charge and mass, I'd follow it with a version of the Davisson-Germer experiment on electron diffraction to blow everyone's minds by proving de Broglie's wave hypothesis. (Though I think a modified version where the diffraction pattern is projected onto a phosphor screen is more impressive to students, especially if they've seen such patterns before in optics.) This is much easier than trying to recreate the double-slit experiment with single-photon detectors, and a more impressive proof of quantum theory (since 'light is a wave' isn't exactly a revolutionary concept).<br><br>@Thoomas:<br>In the double slit experiment, a single photon (or electron, or proton, or atom, or even molecule, if you're very careful and have a very good vacuum) goes "off-course" compared to the classical trajectory, even if you stop the experiment with one detection. This has been tried. It interferes with itself, because "it" is not a particle in this instance; it is acting as a wave. Yes, spooky, if you're used to thinking in particles. Eventually you get used to the idea and admit that these things are neither waves, nor particles, nor good red meat but something altogether their own and outside of our experience. Quantum Mechanics was impossible for me until I (temporarily, I hope) stuffed my common sense into a closet and told it to take a time out.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c7983326912198109846 title="comment permalink">2/22/16, 4:37 AM</a><br><br>

Also, a lot of traditional resilience in communities of color, like gardening, caning, traditional cooking, etc. has become passe and associated with the pre-civil rights era. To the extent that equality has allowed a black or brown 1-5% to percolate up to the top while everyone else stays in the same position they were always in, if not worse, then IDK how much we've ACTUALLY progressed. It seems to me like the destruction of communities of color and traditions has proceeded apace in the last 30 years.

That is devastating news. I think it brings home the absolute necessity of building our communities and being there for each other wherever we are. Who knows when 'we ourselves will be in that boat, in need of help.<br><br>I hear what you're saying about social collapse and mental health and in your general ideas, I agree. I don't think the practice of therapy itself, however is wrong-headed. I am sorry to hear your exposure to talk therapy was so abysmal. In my humble yet experienced opinion, What you saw was simply bad practice.<br><br>Certainly, for some people being brought out of themselves and buoyed up by friends and family can successfully get them through emotionally troubling times. However, not all people are in need of therapy because of their crumbling society or lack of distractions, purpose or support network. There were crummy and downright abusive parents and people well before the industrial age also. Drunkards and addicts with painful pasts. "She' always been a little OFF" or "He's just not been right in the head since the war". No one knew quite what to do about them though, so they just muddled through as best they could. I think if there were 'talk-therapists' in those days they were the local priest or minister and I understand that counseling or 'pastoral care' was one of their chief jobs. It really does help to get secrets or pains off your chest, to share with someone who is caring, but not family or friend - someone who is less involved, who has no dog in the fight and can offer objective advice or critique, if you know what I mean.<br><br> In my experience, talk therapy is hard work, can be a life-saver or a complete waste of time, depending on the therapist and sometimes just the patient/therapist dynamic. I've had experiences with both, (as a patient, not a therapist.)<br><br>The goal of talk therapy, I'm sure you know, is to face your buried problems, however ugly, at their source with eyes wide opened to reality with a caring, competent but uninvolved, (un-manipulative) ally holding your hand. Once you have found and faced the source of your pain, to 're-live' it but as a stronger, older you; then to devise behavior changes and mental habits to effect feeling changes and work on an upward spiral instead of a downward one. There is a lot more detail in how that works, but again - as you have said you have an education in this field, you probably know all of this already.<br><br>If not talking about their problems works for the most part for those African tribes-people, then good for them. It sounds great, but I'm not buying that it solves all of their emotional problems. We humans are far more complicated than that no matter how complex or simple our societies are.

One highway designer friend graduated as a math &amp; English double-major before starting with Division of Highways and worked her way up (yes, HER way, starting in the 1960s) to lead highway design teams. <br><br>Until the past decade or so, when they've "professionalized" to the point that you can't even take an entry level test without a degree (pref. Masters) to qualify for an interview, and your P.E. if you want to promote beyond basic Transportation Engineer. And the old hands who used to train the university grads in real-world civil and electrical engineering are all retiring or already gone. <br> <br>Three generations of my husband's family came up that way but that path is now closed, and the new engineers coming in are woefully unprepared for the real-world jobs.<br><br>For many decades Calif. Division of Highways/Caltrans was a top level training ground for generations of newly graduated engineers through what was called the "junior civil engineer rotation", moving them through the various specialty areas (surveys, materials, design, traffic operations, hydrology, bridges, highway maintenance &amp; electrical, construction, etc.) under the supervision of experienced staff to groom them for the real hands-on work you can't learn in a classroom, only to lose large swaths of them in the last 15+ years as soon as they completed their rotations to better-paying private industry companies. And with all the attacks on public sector workers, salaries lagging way behind private and constant assaults on pensions and relative job security, it's harder &amp; harder to get &amp; keep good people. It's not just lack of funding that's causing our infrastructure to crumble. Lowest-bidder contractors always looking to cut corners, and fewer public servants who know what their tricks are and how to manage those contracts -- and less management/political will to back them up when they go heads-up with contractors over problems in the field -- recipe for disaster, financial and infrastructure.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c5546115520044344162 title="comment permalink">2/22/16, 2:40 PM</a><br><br>

The Journeys were required before anything else could be done. Most of the Troop Leaders are from the wage class with only a high school diploma and maybe some technical school or nursing school.

The old booklet outlined great, well rounded activity badges to work on, each with a good hands-on skill or lesson to learn that could stay with them for life.

My father was a classic victim of that, for example told by his father that he must choose a library book and read it, and when Pa suspiciously asked what kind of book, he was told "ANY book!" So he got The Wizard of Oz, and was punished for that. Both parents were punishing for contradictory things, and having been younger siblings themselves, had a negative view of "eldest children," so Pa took the brunt of it. Yet he was by far and away the sanest person in our family, protecting his siblings--they looked up to him all their lives--and introducing me to Buddhism. So schizogenesis is far far more complex than that. But after reading Wikipedia, I still have very little idea what you mean by "Batesonian." Could you explain that term?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c6517669304751307813 title="comment permalink">2/23/16, 7:10 PM</a><br><br>

Not only did it involve heavy granite blocks and vats of toxic mercury, but it's one of the most important negative results in the history of science, showing the absence of evidence for an "aether wind" that needs to exist in order for light waves to have a medium to "wave" in. Because it's a negative result, you have to have impeccable experimental technique to obtain a credible result. Without a reputation for Thomas Carlyle's "infinite capacity for taking pains" it's impossible to distinguish M-M's important result from incompetence. And if there's one thing that eighth grade students don't have, it's focus and patience.<br><br>There are a lot of excellent physics experiments that can be done with technology that was available to Isaac Newton. Not only the laws of motion and kinematics, which can quickly lead to trendy discussions of deterministic chaos with simple coupled pendulums, but the phenomena that he wrote about in "Opticks" such as the decomposition and recomposition of white light and colored light, and the similarities between sound waves and light waves. Kids love to make noise under the guise of acoustics. And waves in moving media like water troughs can introduce the concepts of dissipative systems and the emergence of order in violation of naive interpretations of the laws of thermodynamics and notions of environmental stability.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c6089903340379887710 title="comment permalink">2/23/16, 10:56 PM</a><br><br>

By Batesonian, I was referring to the scenario JMG laid on in Not the Future We Ordered, where JMG explained the history of postwar "housewife syndrome" and antebellum "drapetomania", where it was socially unacceptable to discuss the very real, underlying socioeconomic causes of problems, whereby there were refashioned into false personal pathologies. So, the very clear cause and root of a problem is socially unacceptable and unmentionable.<br>The suicide is just one extreme example of our society's inability to acknowledge the death of progress and the American dream. I just got off the phone with a friend who has countless degrees, a huge student loan debt, and is still going to school--so she can avoid paying on the loans. She's my age, and she still believes in the System, and thinks she can "get ahead", eventually and find a good job in her field. Another millennial acquaintance works two entry-level jobs, smokes an inordinate amount of pot, and is frustrated that she can't get into her field. I could go on, but, basically, from the suicide on down, the unmentionable, the death and reversal of the American dream and its handmaiden, Progress, is behind all of this, yet it is not something anyone can acknowledge (I've tried referring to this blog, but it is unacceptable to them.) Part of it may be the area I'm living in, for a number of reasons. KY has always been "behind", along with a lot of the South, and perhaps because "Progress" was so late in coming, people here are reluctant to give it up--like everything, we'll be one of the last places to give up on "Progress", too. I notice there seems to be a lot of Green Wizard activity in Rust Belt areas, so perhaps other parts of the country are more comfortable with collapse? Along those lines, I live in one of the wealthiest parts of KY, with a lot of class conscious members of the wage class, who are someone insecure about living in a mid-sized city in KY that is trying to "catch up", so I've found that the memes of the blog seem particularly unwelcome here.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c17964125978482497 title="comment permalink">2/24/16, 5:34 AM</a><br><br>

In the ex-pat community here, I see the same thing and wonder why my fellow ex-pats are so very very averse to any idea of limits. Here there is also an extreme wealth divide, actually worse than in the States. No one thinks much of it, as it has always been like this - even worse historically. The working class and poor local Chinese and Filipino Domestic Helpers are eons away from the lifestyle of the wealthy locals and we, expats.

I lead my son's Boy Scout troop and my daughters' Girl Scout troop. I find the Girl Scout establishment hopelessly useless in terms of engaging the girls. Their sole focus is on selling cookies, and a $4 box of cookies nets the troop all of 55 cents. We opted out this year. No, you're not allowed to do that. We just never ordered any. Likewise, I looked through a Journey book once, and only once. Instead, I took my girls through every single badge (not merit badge, mind you!) at the Junior level, then ordered a bunch of old Girl Guides from the 30s, 40s and 50s from eBay. We worked on those old badges, too. We had a tea at the retirement community where my Mom lives; the older ladies there told my girls stories of when they had been Scouts. One woman recalls selling War Bonds along the Washington Mall as a Cadette; all the Senior Scouts were busy volunteering in hospitals. My girls have gardened, baked, made jam and canned it, baked bread, made meals for a homeless shelter, learned woodworking, followed textile production from a sheep to a blanket at Old Sturbridge Village (that one was AMAZING), and if not for today's torrential rain, we'd have been treated to a demonstration of a Working Police Dog. I joke that I can't follow a straight line with a ruler - but by heaven, my girls are engaged and interested. I blow off the stupid crap that GSUSA puts out, and teach my girls useful skills. My Boy Scouts have a better structure - though earning Merit Badges is complicated by BSA rules on who can be a "merit badge counselor." Again, I play fast and loose as Scoutmaster, and focus more on keeping my boys engaged, learning, teaching, and camping. My brothers left the selfsame Scout troop I now lead because the path to Eagle Scout diverged from earning Scout-y merit badges into "Citizenship in the Community/Nation/World" which are still Eagle-required merit badges. My boys don't know any different, though. And I feel strongly (and largely influenced by this blog and the Art of Manliness blog) that our young men no longer have a rite of passage to adulthood, and I find that Scouting can help fill that void. I realize that the Mormons have rather co-opted making Eagle Scout as "their" rite of passage, but in this case, I tend to agree with them. The boys learn to work together, lead, follow, plan, and adapt and overcome when things go awry. It's really the only organization I can find that emphasizes those skills. I get a bit crazy when I compare the Girls' curriculum to the Boys', but then I, too, adapt and overcome.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-back-to-what-worked.html#c7539825919693167281 title="comment permalink">2/24/16, 2:52 PM</a><br><br>

Around here I find the natives have no problem at all with the collapse narrative.
