I'd meant this week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> post to return to Retrotopia, my quirky narrative exploration of ways in which going backward might actually be a step forward, and next week’s post to turn a critical eye on a common but dysfunctional habit of thinking that explains an astonishing number of the avoidable disasters of contemporary life, from anthropogenic climate change all the way to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, those entertaining topics will have to wait, because something else requires a bit of immediate attention. In my new year’s predictions a little over a month ago, as my regular readers will recall, I suggested that photovoltaic solar energy would be the focus of the next big energy bubble. The first signs of that process have now begun to surface in a big way, and the sign I have in mind—the same marker that provided the first warning of previous energy bubbles—is a shift in the rhetoric surrounding renewable energy sources. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Broadly speaking, there are two groups of people who talk about renewable energy these days. The first group consists of those people who believe that of course sun and wind can replace fossil fuels and enable modern industrial society to keep on going into the far future. The second group consists of people who actually live with renewable energy on a daily basis. It’s been my repeated experience for years now that people belong to one of these groups or the other, but not to both. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As a general rule, in fact, the less direct experience a given person has living with solar and wind power, the more likely that person is to buy into the sort of green cornucopianism that insists that sun, wind, and other renewable resources can provide everyone on the planet with a middle class American lifestyle. Conversely, those people who have the most direct knowledge of the strengths and limitations of renewable energy—those, for example, who live in homes powered by sunlight and wind, without a fossil fuel-powered grid to cover up the intermittency problems—generally have no time for the claims of green cornucopianism, and are the first to point out that relying on renewable energy means giving up a great many extravagant habits that most people in today’s industrial societies consider normal. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Debates between members of these two groups have enlivened quite a few comment pages here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>. Of late, though—more specifically, since the COP-21 summit last December came out with
<a href=../../2015/12/too-little-too-late.html>yet another round of toothless posturing masquerading as a climate agreement</a>—the language used by the first of the two groups has taken on a new and unsettling tone. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Climate activist Naomi Oreskes helped launch that new tone with a diatribe in the mass media insisting that questioning whether renewable energy sources can power industrial society amounts to “<a href=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/16/new-form-climate-denialism-dont-celebrate-yet-cop-21>a new form of climate denialism</a>.” The same sort of rhetoric has begun to percolate all through the greenward end of things: an increasingly angry insistence that renewable energy sources are by definition the planet’s only hope, that of course the necessary buildout can be accomplished fast enough and on a large enough scale to matter, and that no one ought to be allowed to question these articles of faith. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are plenty of points worth making about what this sort of rhetoric implies about the current state of the green movement, and I’ll get to some of those<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>shortly, but the issue that comes first to mind—typically enough for this blog—is a historical one: we’ve been here before. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When this blog first got going, back in 2006, the energy resource that was sure to save industrial civilization from the consequences of its own bad decisions was biofuels. Those of my readers who were paying attention to the peak oil scene in those days will remember the grandiose and constantly reiterated pronouncements about the oceans of ethanol from American corn and the torrents of biodiesel from algae that were going to sweep away the petroleum age and replace fossil fuels with all the cheap, abundant, carbon-neutral liquid fuel anyone could want. Those who raised annoying questions—and yes, <a href=../../2007/03/faustus-and-monkey-trap.html>I was one of them</a>—got reactions that swung across a narrow spectrum from patronizing putdowns to furious denunciation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As it turned out, of course, the critics were right and the people who insisted that biofuels were going to replace petroleum and other fossil fuels were dead wrong. There were at least two problems, and both of them could have been identified—and in fact were identified—well in advance, by that minority who were willing to take a close look at the underlying data. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first problem was that the numbers simply didn’t work out. It so happens, for example, that if you grow corn using standard American agricultural methods, and convert that corn into ethanol using state of the art industrial fermenters and the like, the amount of energy you have to put into that whole process is more than you get by burning the resulting ethanol. Equally, it so happens that if you were to put every square inch of arable farmland in the world into biofuel crops, leaving none for such trivial uses as feeding the seven billion human beings on this planet, you still wouldn’t get enough biofuel to replace the world’s annual consumption of transportation fuels. Neither of these points were hard to figure out, and the second one was well known in the appropriate tech scene of the 1970s—you’ll find it, for example, in the pages of William Catton’s must-read book <i>Overshoot</i>—but somehow the proponents of ethanol and biodiesel missed it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second problem was a little more complex, but not enough so to make it impossible to figure out in advance. This was that the process of biofuel production and consumption had impacts of its own. Divert a significant fraction of the world’s food supply into the fuel tanks of people in a handful of rich countries—and of course this is what all that rhetoric about fueling the world amounted to in practice—and the resulting spikes in food prices had disastrous impacts across the Third World, triggering riots and quite a number of countries and outright revolutions in more than one. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile rain forests in southeast Asia got clearcut so that palm oil plantations could supply the upper middle classes of Europe and America with supposedly sustainable biodiesel. It could have gotten much worse, except that the underlying economics were so bad that not that many years into the biofuels boom, companies started going broke at such a rate that banks stopped lending money for biofuel projects; some of the most highly ballyhooed algal biodiesel projects turned out to be, in effect, pond scum ponzi schemes; and except for those enterprises that managed to get themselves a cozy spot as taxpayer-supported <a href=../../2014/03/the-crocodiles-of-reality.html>subsidy dumpsters</a>, the biofuel boom went away. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was promptly replaced by another energy resource that was sure to save industrial civilization. Yes, that would be hydrofracturing of oil- and gas-bearing shales, or to give it its popular moniker, fracking. For quite a while there, you couldn’t click through to an energy-related website without being assailed with any number of grandiose diatribes glorifying fracking as a revolutionary new technology that, once it was applied to vast, newly discovered shale fields all over North America, was going to usher in a new era of US energy independence. Remember the phrase “Saudi America”? I certainly do. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here again, there were two little problems with these claims, and the first was that once again the numbers didn’t work out. Fracking wasn’t a new technological breakthrough—it’s been used on oil fields since the 1940s—and the “newly discovered” oil fields in North Dakota and elsewhere were nothing of the kind; they were found decades ago and the amount of oil in them, which was well known to petroleum geologists, did not justify the wildly overinflated claims made for them. There were plenty of other difficulties with the so-called “fracking revolution,” including the same net energy issue that ultimately doomed the “biodiesel revolution,” but we can leave those for now, and go on to the second little problem with fracking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This was the awkward fact that the fracking industry, like the biodiesel industry, had impacts of its own that weren’t limited to the torrents of new energy it was supposed to provide. All across the more heavily fracked parts of the United States, homeowners discovered that their tap water was so full of methane that they could ignite it with a match, while some had to deal with the rather more troubling consequences of earthquake swarms and miles-long trains of fracked fuels rolling across America’s poorly maintained railroad network. Then there was the methane leakage into the atmosphere—I don’t know that anybody’s been able to quantify that, but I suspect it’s had more than a little to do with the abrupt spike in global temperatures and extreme weather events over the last decade. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Things might have gotten much worse, except here again the underlying economics of fracking were so bad that not that many years into the fracking boom, companies have started going broke at such a rate that banks are cutting back sharply on lending for fracking projects. As I write this, rumors are flying in the petroleum industry that Chesapeake Petroleum, the biggest of the early players in the US fracking scene, is on the brink of declaring bankruptcy, and quite a few very large banks that lent recklessly to prop up the fracking boom are loudly proclaiming that everything is just fine while their stock values plunge in panic selling and the rates other banks charge them for overnight loans spike upwards. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Unless some enterprising fracking promoter figures out how to elbow his way to the government feed trough, it’s pretty much a given that fracking will shortly turn back into what it was before the current boom: one of several humdrum technologies used to scrape a little extra oil out from mostly depleted oil fields. That, in turn, leaves the field clear for the next overblown “energy revolution” to be rolled out—and my working ghess is that the focus of this upcoming round of energy hype will be renewable energy resources: specifically, attempts to power the electrical grid with sun and wind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In a way, that’s convenient, because we don’t have to wonder whether the two little problems with biofuels and fracking also apply to this application of solar and wind power. That’s already been settled; the research was done quite a while ago, and the answer is yes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To begin with, the numbers are just as problematic for solar and wind power as they were for biofuels and fracking. Examples abound: real world experience with large-scale solar electrical generation systems, for example, show <a href=http://energyskeptic.com/2015/tilting-at-windmills-spains-solar-pv/ >dismal net energy returns</a>; the calculations of how much energy can be extracted from wind that have been used to prop up windpower are <a href=http://www.theoildrum.com/node/8322>up to two orders of magnitude too high</a>; more generally, those researchers who have taken the time to crunch the numbers—I’m thinking here especially, though not only, of Tom Murphy’s excellent site <a href=http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/ >Do The Math</a>—have shown over and over again that for reasons rooted in the hardest of hard physics, renewable energy as a source of grid power can’t live up to the sweeping promises made on its behalf. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Equally, renewables are by no means as environmentally benign as their more enthusiastic promoters claim. It’s true that they don’t dump as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as burning fossil fuels do—and my more perceptive readers may already have noted, by the way, the extent to which talk about the very broad range of environmental blowbacks from modern industrial technologies has been supplanted by a much narrower focus on greenhouse gas-induced anthropogenic global warming, as though this is the only issue that matters—but the technologies needed to turn sun and wind into grid electricity involve very large volumes of rare metals, solvents, plastics, and other industrial products that have substantial carbon footprints of their own. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And of course there are other problems of the same kind, some of which are already painfully clear. A number of those rare metals are sourced from open-pit mines in the Third World worked by slave labor; the manufacture of most solvents and plastics involves the generation of a great deal of toxic waste, most of which inevitably finds its way into the biosphere; wind turbines are already racking up an impressive death toll among birds and bats—well, I could go on. Nearly all of modern industrial society’s complex technologies are ecocidal to one fairly significant degree or another, and the fact that a few of them extract energy from sunlight or wind doesn’t keep them from having a galaxy of nasty indirect environmental costs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus the approaching boom in renewable energy will inevitably bring with it a rising tide of ghastly news stories, as corners get cut and protections overwhelmed by whatever degree of massive buildout gets funded before the dismal economics of renewable energy finally take their inevitable toll. To judge by what’s happened in the past, I expect to see plenty of people who claim to be concerned about the environment angrily dismissing any suggestion that the renewable energy industry has anything to do with, say, soaring cancer rates around solar panel manufacturing plants, or whatever other form the inevitable ecological blowback takes. The all-or-nothing logic of George Orwell’s invented language Newspeak is astonishingly common these days: that which is good (because it doesn’t burn fossil fuels) can’t possibly be ungood (because it isn’t economically viable and also has environmental problems of its own), and to doubt the universal goodness of what’s doubleplusgood—why, that’s thoughtcrime...</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Things might get very ugly indeed, all things considered, except that the underlying economics of renewable energy as a source of grid electricity aren’t noticeably better than those of fracking or corn ethanol. Six to ten years down the road, as a result, the bankruptcies and defaults will begin, banks will start backing away from the formerly booming renewables industry, and the whole thing will come crashing down, the way ethanol did and fracking is doing right now. That will clear the way, in turn, for whatever the next energy boom will be—my guess is that it’ll be nuclear power, though that’s such a spectacular money-loser that any future attempt to slap shock paddles on the comatose body of the nuclear power industry may not get far. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It probably needs to be said at this point that one blog post by an archdruid isn’t going to do anything to derail the trajectory just sketched out. Ten thousand blog posts by Gaia herself, cosigned by the Pope, the Dalai Lama, and Captain Planet and the Planeteers probably wouldn’t do the trick either. I confidently expect this post to be denounced furiously straight across the green blogosphere over the next couple of weeks, and at intervals thereafter; a few years from now, when dozens of hot new renewable-energy startups are sucking up million-dollar investments from venture capitalists and planning their initial IPOs, such few references as this and similar posts field will be dripping with patronizing contempt; then, when reality sets in, the defaults begin and the banks start backing away, nobody will want to talk about this essay at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It probably also needs to be pointed out that I’m actually very much in favor of renewable energy technologies, and have discussed their importance repeatedly on this blog. The question I’ve been trying to raise, here and elsewhere, isn’t whether or not sun and wind are useful power sources; the question is whether it’s possible to power industrial civilization with them, and the answer is no. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That doesn’t mean, in turn, that we’ll just keep powering industrial civilization with fossil fuels, or nuclear power, or what have you. Fossil fuels are running short—as oilmen like to say, depletion never sleeps—and nuclear power is a hopelessly uneconomical white-elephant technology that has never been viable anywhere in the world without massive ongoing government subsidies. Other options? They’ve all been tried, and they don’t work either. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The point that nearly everyone in the debate is trying to evade is that the collection of extravagant energy-wasting habits that pass for a normal middle class lifestyle these days is, in James Howard Kunstler’s useful phrase, an arrangement without a future. Those habits only became possible in the first place because our species broke into the planet’s supply of stored carbon and burnt through half a billion years of fossil sunlight in a wild three-century-long joyride. Now the needle on the gas gauge is moving inexorably toward that threatening letter E, and the joyride is over. It really is as simple as that. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus the conversation that needs to happen now isn’t about how to keep power flowing to the grid; it’s about how to reduce our energy consumption so that we can get by without grid power, using local microgrids and home-generated power to meet sharply reduced needs.We don’t need more energy; we need much, much less, and that implies in turn that we—meaning here especially the five per cent of our species who live within the borders of the United States, who use so disproportionately large a fraction of the planet’s energy and resources, and who produce a comparably huge fraction of the carbon dioxide that’s driving global warming—need to retool our lives and our lifestyles to get by with the sort of energy consumption that most other human beings consider normal. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Unfortunately that’s not a conversation that most people in America are willing to have these days. The point that’s being ignored here, though, is that if something’s unsustainable, sooner or later it will not be sustained. We can—each of us, individually—let go of the absurd extravagances of the industrial age deliberately, while there’s still time to do it with some measure of grace, or we can wait until they’re pried from our cold and stiffening fingers, but one way or another, we’re going to let go of them. The question is simply how many excuses for delay will be trotted out, and how many of the remaining opportunities for constructive change will go whistling down the wind, before that happens.</div>

Tall ceilings, transoms, planting trees that will shelter your house from the strongest sun, there are all kinds of really low-energy ways to make a huge difference. The average american house is a huge energy waster. I grew up in Hawaii where A/C was still pretty exotic when I was a kid. Locals' houses, elementary schools, etc all used passive methods of keeping cool. I remember the power going out (it did a lot in 68-69) and we kids didn't notice; we were outside playing or weeding the yard or something. Walking to the library was a good time, and we used to go play on the elementary school grounds in the summer because hey, it was school but we'd ride our bikes down the main walkway and stuff. (Main walkway was outside, whole school was as open-air as possible). <br><br>We were highly entertained by hiking or going to the beach and poking around. Radio's a good technology because you can entertain, educate, inspire, without using a lot of energy. Big screen TV's, not so much. <br><br>Whittling. A pocket knife was the ultimate toy because it was a meta-toy, that could be used to make other toys. Those were my favorite toys.

No doubt, this varies a lot from location to location. Riding a bike instead of driving a car can be very challenging, for example. I live just about three miles from a grocery store, so it ought to be a pleasant bike ride and a moderate bit of walking. Except there are several brutal high speed intersections between point A and point B. With a river and an interstate highway to cross, route alternatives are practically non-existent. <br><br>I am not a big fan of proposals like raising the minimum wage. I would much rather see proposals that, first, make it very difficult for the power elite to further trap the poor into struggling to earn money to pay for things that really wouldn't be necessary if it weren't for the clever entrapment. Second, I would like to see infrastructure efforts focused on what people of the most limited means really need. I would like to see a new interstate walkway system, with water sources every five miles and food sources and campgrounds every fifteen miles. <br><br>Living well on a low budget is partly a matter of choice but also, in significant degree, a matter of public support. <br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c3875902981322510101 title="comment permalink">2/10/16, 4:34 PM</a><br><br>

After a collapse, dry grains are likely to be the main calorie source for urban people. Brown Rice is the most common grain that people cook as a whole grain, but you can also cook other whole grains. Best to soak them a couple of days, but you get into a routine with Mason jars. Avoids the need for grinding. If you have a battery, you can wake up with the grain cooked for breakfast. Or cook once a day, while the sun is shining.

But I looked at the investment and the likely maintenance required a few times and never came up with a number that made sense.

Of course that's a crucial part of the equation -- just as the internet consists of more than your computer screen, a solar power system consists of much more than the PV cells and the inverter, and in both cases it's the stuff you don't see that accounts for most of the environmental damage. <br><br>JimK, no doubt, but someone has to take the first step. <br><br>Bluebird, true enough.

Other than that, an irrelevancy. <br><br>Ecologist, all it requires is self-knowledge and reflection -- and I suspect that the reason so many people spend so much time staring at little glass screens is that this makes it easier to avoid those things. <br><br>Robert, why, yes -- Gail and I have had long conversations at peak oil events, for example.

I read Tom Murphy's posts but I disagree. Solar energy is equivalent to a 6000K heat source. That means the maximum theoretical efficiency is around 95%. That does not mean we can use it to power industrial civilization! As always the technological and economic limitations are much stricter. But in the right environment, with the right tools it can be incredibly useful (e.g. smeltering metals).<br>- Finally one comment related to a previous post about climate change. Nowadays I am almost completely convinced by your catabolic collapse theory, except for the possible impact of sudden climate shifts. I am not talking about near term human extinction, just major enough changes to, for example, make money in large parts of the world worthless (to build on another commenter's thought).<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c5602070133006083276 title="comment permalink">2/10/16, 6:07 PM</a><br><br>

I have no issue with a single word in it. After reviewing the results of the NH Primary last night, it would seem this is indeed the last fling of the experiment of representative Democracy. The establishment, represented by Clinton &amp; Bush, is in a full meltdown panic trying to find a way to entrench the <i>status quo</i>, in full opposition to the will of the people who, represented by the support for Trump and Sanders, clearly see it broken and want something <i>different</i>. <br><br>In the meantime, whenever the topic of renewables comes up, aside from the sobering numbers of the energy and industrial processes required to deploy those technologies, I always was left with a question. – "How the BLIP do you turn wind or solar generated electricity into plastics, lubricants, fertilizers, and the 1001 other petroleum-based products other than fuels. <br><br>I have heard the argument, that the more we supplant fossil fuels with renewables, the more we can sequester precious pretroleum for non-fuel usage. But that's a game with a decidedly limited lifespan. But we can play it a hell of a lot longer if, as a species, we learn to get buy with a LOT less... well, <i>everything</i>. Other sets of sobering numbers concerning overshoot and sustainability reveal we're already using WAY more than the Earth can rightly provide.<br><br>No, the Middle Class American Industrial lifestyle is as endangered as Bluefin Tuna and the sooner put out of it's misery, probably better. Having recently abandoned the urban sprawl of NYC and it's suburbs for the semi-rural Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, we're consciously down-scaling, and are reasonably content to do so. Most of what comprises the Middle Class American Dream is empty trophies and material accumulation for no particular purpose beyond "keeping score." But what will bring on considerable unrest and misery will be the utter resistance of the affluent and the wealthy to consider giving up a single bit of thier extravagant lifestyles for the common good. <br><br>As George Carlin once famously said, <i>"They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying. Lobbying-- to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else. But I'll tell you what they don't want.<br><br>"They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don't want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them. That's against their interests."</i><br><br>It's not going to be a boring century. Those of us paying <i>attention</i> will be doing what we can to try and decline gracefully, and land on our feet and not our faces.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c6526431287562034910 title="comment permalink">2/10/16, 6:52 PM</a><br><br>

Just this afternoon, I was listening to a local call in show about our provincial speech from the throne, which focused on our government's continuing ridiculous hopes of creating a new booming economy from liquified natural gas plants, as yet still un-built, not economically viable, and being actively protested.<br><br>To field questions from callers, the show had brought in an energy economist from Ontario as a pundit. Many callers expressed the belief (quite common here) that this LNG scheme was a fool's errand (for a host of valid reasons) and that instead these investments should be made into renewable energy. Quite so. Finally, a little exasperated, the pundit said, "you know, here in Ontario, we HAVE made those investments in renewable energy, and is hasn't really worked out. They require enormous subsidies, don't work as well as projected, and don't produce the jobs in the volume promised. We just don't get the economic benefits from renewables that you do from fossil fuels."<br><br>Aha! I wanted to shout. Exactly! So the missing point, which I will be shouting from the rooftops as often as I get the opportunity, is that both of these points of view are correct. We DO need to move away from fossil fuels quickly and dramatically. AND we won't end up with as productive an economy as we now have. Yep.

The night before Reagans inaguration I attended a concert by the late great singer/songwriter and social justice activist Harry Chapin. Part way in to his set Harry put down his guitar, and sat down on the edge of the stage. I don't remember his exact words, but he told us, how with the election, we were entering a dark time, and if we couldn't reverse the era of greed, meaness, and disregard for cooperation and the common good we were headed for difficult times indeed. I was young and didn't fully understand what he was saying that night but he looks to have been quite a prophet. A few months later Harry died in an accident on the Long Island Expressway.

They've gotten about 40 people into a temporary shelter, but the others are refusing to move and more keep coming to Victoria so it doesn't end up getting any smaller. Not the sort of thing Canada likes to show to the world, especially in a tourist town like Victoria!<br><br>I visited yesterday, brought food, hung out at the firepit for an hour or so, asked how things were going, why they were there, and what they were hoping to achieve. I was struck by a few things: the number of tents, the multiple tarps over and under everything in an attempt to keep things dry, the number of pet dogs and the cat on leash,the structures built out of pallets and other discarded objects, and the strong sense of community and how welcoming people were.<br><br>According to 'Grandmother', who the others at the firepit seemed to hold in respect, what they want is a permanent solution and not to be split up. It sounded almost as if they'd happily build their own makeshifts if they were given a bit of land on which to do so, rather than being temporarily warehoused and shifted from place to place with their belongings outside getting stolen, or out on the streets depending on political whim that month.<br><br>Another interesting thing with regard to native spirituality you mentioned a couple of weeks back: the firepit was the 'sacred fire' and Grandmother was First Nations. A disproportionate number of homeless people in Canada are First Nations, so that's not entirely surprising. <br><br>I suspect we have more of this type of thing in our near future.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c887122391281393726 title="comment permalink">2/10/16, 7:38 PM</a><br><br>

You can piece together enough odd jobs and sales to pay your taxes and live, especially if you mostly do for yourself in terms of food and are conservative about energy, but I have seen even modest mortgages murder people fairly routinely out here. Unless you have family land or can buy in cash, it is probably a losing proposition, and it will take at least a few years to build out enough infrastructure to become even remotely self sufficient, plus you will likely end up needing at least some expensive repairs or equipment. No mortgage and at least some cash reserves going in is my strong recommendation.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c5935973022291474892 title="comment permalink">2/10/16, 7:46 PM</a><br><br>

I’m commenting now as this March 12th I will celebrate four years physically disconnected from the grid. Our three bedroom suburban home in Oceanside California has been powered throughout this period solely by 6.25 watts of solar panels supplemented by a one kilowatt (maximum output at 26 mph) aluminum windmill seated atop a 35 foot post. On the topic of life off grid, I reckon that makes me very qualified to speak authoritatively. Our deep cycle battery backup consists of, effectively, 15 kilowatts. Batteries are recyclable lead acid types (Trojan 105’s to be exact).<br>Firstly, life off grid is VERY different from life on grid. Simply put, you MUST “trim your sails to the sun (and wind). High energy activities such, say, running the clothes washer, are for sunny days after the house battery bank has recharged. As for drying, well, that is solar too: a clothesline! If necessary, located inside. It is necessary to develop the habit of always minimizing power use at non-prime time hours. <br>Running the central heating in winter at night or in cloudy weather is impossible. This is because the forced air blower is a massive current suck which drains the batteries nonlinearly. Deep cycle batteries are not optimal for delivering high amounts of current for a sustained time period. So, winter mornings getting up for work below dawn it can be high 40’s F. Try stepping out of the shower into THAT folks!<br>Some winter days my wife and I have to declare to be “minimum energy days.” We actually love these because we spend more time together, play board games, and…well use your imagination. Our life inside is DIRECTLY connected to varying amounts of sun and wind OUTSIDE. Our home exists within nature, not isolated from it. We have always had power through these past four years by living like this.<br>Our energy system itself represents a departure from standard “McSolar” installations. Aside from being non-grid tie, with deep cycle batteries instead of the grid, the basic design is very different. Standard solar installation practice is to place all panels facing as nearly due south as possible. We have four separate arrays which, essentially “follow” the sun from dawn to sunset. We are not a grid tied net metering system. We must maximize our total daily intake of power throughout the entire day. On winter days with no sun this produces the most power for our battery bank.<br>The windmill produces about 2 kilowatts per day, averaged throughout the entire year. This is not much, but, in winter, it can be an energy lifesaver. We purchased it with the rebates from our solar system. If you can do this, it is useful for off grid systems. The windmill blades are aluminum. For whatever reason, birds see and avoid it. This is not true of blades made of composite materials, though, I confess, I do not know WHY.<br>We have come to accept our off grid life as “normal” over the years. However, it is indeed, very different from the on grid lifestyle of our neighbors.<br><br>Michael Byron, Oceanside, CA<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c8623971479462280525 title="comment permalink">2/10/16, 8:39 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not certain that's a bad thing though if you consider some of the likely alternatives. <br><br>Some governments have gone big on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power for governments owned electrical power companies. I don't think these governments really think renewable power is the answer in and of itself due to the high costs (relative to oil), intermittency, and low power production per unit. These governments are the actual users and so, as you indicted, they ought to know. <br><br>The hope is that these energy sources are less environmentally destructive than say just building a new oil fired power plant for roughly the same power output. My guess is that, all things considered, this is probably true. <br><br>I take it as a given that such renewable sources are more expensive than oil fired power plants for the same power output. Were this not so, most governments would have gone renewable long ago. In the case of economic hydro and geothermal power, this is in fact so.<br><br>Running costs on renewables are presumably lower than oil powered plants. The main running expense is maintenance, the energy source itself is free.<br><br>Thus the capital costs for renewables must be much higher than oil power plants for the overall costs for renewables to be higher per Kwhr. <br><br>Electrical power projects capital costs are typically paid for by public debt. To my knowledge, governments never really pay off their debts. They just roll it over. Destruction of the governments or sovereign default are the ways government debt is reduced or eliminated. Governments do not actually paying down on the "principle" of their debt. <br><br>So renewables are not economically viable compared to oil fired power plants ... if the government doesn't default. But lets face it, all governments will default (effectively if not in fact) as the global economic crisis continues. Its just a matter of how soon and in what order governments default. The trick is to be one of the last in the next wave of sovereign defaults. <br><br>My point here is: Yes there will be a boom and bust, but since we are talking about relatively cleaner energy that (probably) keeps producing after the bust (at least until the running costs cannot be covered); the situation is not nearly as bad as losing that (centralized) oil fire plant that is shut down because one can't afford the fuel oil. Further, renewable energy is generally delocalized to begin with (thus its higher capital cost). As things become more local, the potential exists or it to be broken up for local grids i.e. it can be scaled down in a way a large central oil plant cannot. To be honest though, I expect most of those huge windmills to stop forever once a bearing goes.<br><br>Still, I'm not seeing the downside to large scale government funded renewable electrical power generation. No its not the answer to keep the system going indefinitely, nothing is. It may; however, be a partial answer to graceful (versus catastrophic) degradation of the industrial way of life. <br><br>Might not this be a reasonable post peak (i.e. now!)strategy to keep the game going a bit longer? When a government defaults, it no long pays the debt service on the capital costs. At that point the lower running costs will appear as an advantage compared to oil fired plants. <br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c2382180523897091165 title="comment permalink">2/10/16, 8:46 PM</a><br><br>

Right now I am finding it very difficult to talk to people about oil depletion when the world supply of crude is overflowing the storage facilities. I know it is only temporary but explaining that to someone who believes in progress is tough. I was thinking about this idea of sustainability and how it is used. Tesla motors boasts that it has a manufacturing plant that is run solely by electricity from solar and wind. However, when people talk this way I tell them that if they can show me a trail from the mining, transportation, to smelting and fabrication of the building and equipment, without fossil fueled equipment, then maybe I can concede their point. I think what people are referring to as sustainability is after everything is installed and up and running. Even then, without continued fossil fuel input, it is dicey.<br>Keep up the good work.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c3292018876066330648 title="comment permalink">2/10/16, 9:32 PM</a><br><br>

You. For. Getting. It.</b> Now is there any way we can fix that insight on the business end of a branding iron and start applying it to some tender backsides? <br><br>Clay, I remember Chapin well, though I never got to attend a live concert of his. I wonder how many other people who were there admit to remembering those words. <br><br>Pygmycory, good. That's the question that needs to be asked, of course. <br><br>Kyoto, not a chance. ASPO is flat on its back and gasping -- do you recall how long it's been since they've even been able to host a conference? -- and the Depletion Protocol, like so many other good ideas, was dead on publication and as far as I know has never been seriously considered by anyone capable of acting on it. Nor are there more than a very few of us, out here in the archdruid-haunted wilderness, who are ready and willing to cut back on our energy usage right now in order to provide our descendants with a livable world. <br><br>Patricia, Granny Weatherwax's recommendation is good enough for me!<br><br>Shastatodd, I made an exception to my usual rule about profanity because I appreciate hearing from someone who's actually been out there in the trenches. Many thanks for the report from the field! I used to live in Ashland OR, a few hours north of you, and got to see the same thing a little earlier; my favorite example was the expensive house with a full set of PV panels on the side of the roof facing north, away from the sun, because that faced the street and allowed the homeowner to parade his ecological virtue to the passersby. <br><br>Eric, yes, and that kind of case-study rhetoric -- which pays no attention to the issues involved in large-scale PV usage -- is among the things that will be used to fuel the sales pitches for the allegedly renewable future.<br><br>Sojan, it is indeed -- the author, Andrew Nikiforuk, is among the best commentators on energy and peak oil news out there, and very much worth following. <br><br>Pygmycory, I'm glad to hear that 40 tents counts as a giant homeless encampment in Canada. Seattle, based on what I've been told by friends there, has half a dozen such encampments with populations ranging up into three digits. You're quite right that there'll be more of this to come -- as the industrial economy unravels, this is the new reality. <br><br>Bryan, excellent! To my mind, that kind of systematic conservation means quite a bit more than any shiny technological gimmick. <br><br>Dennis, good. Have you considered acting on that recognition? <br><br>Michael, welcome back! It's exactly the testimony of people who are actually living off the grid that, to my mind, is the best source of guidance for what works and what doesn't, so thank you. <br><br>Agent, the devil as usual is in the details. Right now, with the price of fossil fuels as low as it currently is, the operating costs for a PV system of comparable wattage to a natural gas power plant may actually be higher -- the lack of fuel costs are offset by much higher maintenance costs, since the PV cells have to be cleaned regularly or they lose efficiency, the devices that pivot them toward the sun take constant repair, etc., etc. In some situations PV plants might be useful; in others, they're subsidy dumpsters -- and while governments can come up with the money by the simple expedient of borrowing it out of thin air, the energy, resources, labor, and other real costs involved are not so readily manifested. <br><br>RPC, vast government subsidies for the corn and ethanol industries were needed to make that happen. Of course ethanol could be used, on a modest scale, as a fuel source; cornstalks make a viable feedstock, for example, if you're willing to use relatively inexpensive fermentation methods. But you can't power an industrial civilization that way.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c6298803317079389760 title="comment permalink">2/10/16, 10:06 PM</a><br><br>

However, it will probably be a century or longer before landlords start accepting labor, or homespun goods, in lieu of rent checks. I can learn all the skills I want, but that doesn't mean my landlord will accept a basket of eggs, or a pair of handsewn leather boots. <br><br>As I see it, living through the crash is going to be a lot harder than living after the crash. It is a bit ironic, that those living hard homesteading lives right now will likely be living what is considered a life of luxury several decades from now simply virtue of their owning title to land.<br><br>Since homesteading is out of the question for me (I don't have the capital to make it happen before thing really go pear-shaped), I reckon the best skill anyone can have is an adaptable mindset.

I come from a Tennessee tobacco farm and recognize what has happened to agriculture in the lifespan of my late father (born 1902) and myself (born 1951).

Seriously, though, reading your work these many years has helped me through the natural binary thinking that plagues so many of us. I still have to work hard at keeping my focus on the real work ahead, and not on my own doom fantasy that allows me to stay passive. Your weekly reminders make a big difference to staying on track constructively.<br><br>@Justin: I think many feel your dilemma. But if you are in a job that's got a reasonably viable short-to-medium term future, a walkable/bikeable urban environment,a reasonable cost of living, and a strong community network, etc in your current life, then you have a lot going for you. If what you don't have is land to grow food, why not try and address just that? There are many ways to access land to grow food that don't involve you buying it yourself. Some folks are "farming" other people's unused yards in exchange for a cut of the produce. Others lease land just outside of town; others grow on vacant lots or community gardens, or start growing on vacant land until it becomes a community garden. Others still do "guerrilla gardening"--planting food in unobtrusive places around the city in secret or semi-secret. Be creative! You won't be alone in your position in your city--find others who will help you create a solution and your whole community will be more resilient and better connected. It's so easy to fall into the mind trap of "if I need it I must own it myself!" But that's a very recent, and very north american way of thinking, and it's not the past nor likely to be the future.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c4272054455727947913 title="comment permalink">2/10/16, 10:55 PM</a><br><br>

Just yesterday a friend posted something on social media about a motorbike in Brazil that is 'fuelled by water'. I pointed out to him that it didn't run on water, it ran on hydrogen extracted from water using grid electricity generated by burning coal. He was good-humoured enough to accept this fact but he still kept repeating "Yes, but the only pollution it causes is water vapour and at least it isn't using fossil fuels." This kind of inability to think puzzles me deeply - it's something I'll probably never understand.<br><br>I bought some solar panels from eBay a few weeks back. They came direct from the factory in China and arrived in England within four days - so I'm assuming they flew them over (no horse can run that fast). The reason I bought them - along with a modest charge controller - was so that I would have a power backup at the caravan in my woodland. I already have a small inverter to convert 12v to something my laptop, some lights and a music system can use. Anyway, this setup was about 20% of the cost of the last setup I purchased, back in 2004. <br><br>People like to claim that this price drop is due to increased efficiencies etc, but I think it may have more to do with overcapacity in China and a hugely subsidised industry that is struggling to get rid of its products. I don't have any illusions about what renewables are capable of (having lived with them in the past) but I certainly appreciate their usefulness in the short to medium term while everyone else works through their delusions and arrives at the same inescapable conclusion.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c778842722468542402 title="comment permalink">2/10/16, 11:20 PM</a><br><br>

I remember being quite dismissive and then surprised later when all the local buses announced they were running on 10% biofuels (or whatever it was). Being so young, we hadn't fully absorbed the assumptions or the desperation of the cornucopian renewables crowd, and young people are far less invested in their beliefs than older ones in any case. Unfortunately - there's a lot more to be said about this, but it's kind of off-topic and would max out the character count for three or four comments - suffice to say that since 99% of young people, like 99% of everybody, have barely an inkling of the wider issues involved, that doesn't necessarily help.

Specifically, coniferous forests.<br><br>For many centuries, coniferous trees were tapped for their resin. All of them produce it as defense against wounds, pest infestations etc., with various species of pine producing the greatest amount. This resin can then be distilled to extract turpentine - which in turn has chemical properties very similar to those of diesel fuel. It can be used as an additive, replacing up to 30% of oil-derived fuel - or indeed as a fuel in its own right: the first Honda motorcycle, built right after the 2nd World War when petrol was in very short supply in Japan, did run on pure turpentine. A pine tree can be tapped over a long period of time - 20 years or more if a suitable technique is used - and while a single tree yields only up to 2 litres of turpentine per year, there is of course a lot of trees.<br><br>It would also be a relatively easy sell to the public. Not only does it use a sustainable resource, but also tree tapping is by necessity local thus creating jobs in the rural areas! And not just in parts of the country blessed with geological history conducive to the formation of oil deposits, but potentially anywhere with a climate suitable for tree growth. <i>And</i> tree tapping cannot be easily automated, so the jobs would be there to stay.<br><br>...of course a question of energy return on energy invested still remains. As for profitability, well - at current low oil prices it's a non-starter. It may become competitive when at the pump diesel prices reach 6 dollars per gallon; I am not sure what oil price would that imply. This does not count the cost of building all the infrastructure necessary to convert resin into marketable fuel, which may be considerable.<br><br>The wider implications of mass-scale adaptation of resin extraction may include: destruction of broadleaf forests, to make way for pine plantations; destruction of the existing coniferous forests through overexploitation, improper tapping techniques etc.; destruction of forest fauna by pesticides; and all the corresponding secondary effects of the above.<br><br>But hey, by a back of the envelope calculation the US <i>could</i> extract a million barrels of turpentine a day from its forests (under a number of optimistic assumptions). This is a significant amount whichever way you look at it; I can see it becoming a serious proposal in the future.<br><br>MigrantWorker<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c3560211587743825593 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 3:42 AM</a><br><br>

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c3626900760286476419></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/05139197061386426472 rel=nofollow>deedl</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>When looking at the production curves of wind and solar here in Germany as well as on the energy consumption my assessment of the future energy production and consumption patterns are as following: <br><br>Electricity: While solar production is much lower in winter, wind production is much higher in winter, so there are no seasonal shortcomings to expect. Except for some events in autumn, weather conditions that are both cloudy and low in wind speeds are rare. Water power provides some (low level) baseload and biomass is a subsidy sink and will not play any significant role. Electricity is 1/3 of total energy consumption. Of this electricity, 70% is used by industry and 30% by households. Industry has to align ist electricty use with the weather to cope with intermittency, which will greatly impact the rhythms of industrial workers life. But total post fossil impact here is low, since electricity already is at 35% renewables.<br><br>Heating: Heating Buildings makes up roughly another 1/3 of energy consumption and is mainly done by burning fossil fuels. Superinsulated buidlings and heat pumps can warm buildings using quite small amounts of electricity, but badly done insulations are at the moment a subsidy dumpster because many buildings start rotting beneath the insulation. However, because of the thermal mass of buildings, (renewable) electricity based heating can be used to flatten the intermittency of electricity production. But if and how the amounted of heated space that is available now for everybody can be ensured in future is questionable. The post fossil impact here is medium. <br><br>Transportation: This is the remaining 1/3 of energy use. Although electrical cars will replace ice-cars in the years to come, I am sure that large parts of the middle class will not be able to afford an individual car one generation into the future. The trend for growing bike use is already here and the public transportation system of electrically driven trains and trams is dense and convenient. Replacing ice-buses by electrical ones does need much fewer resources than replacing all the individual cars. I also think that plane rides and subtropical fruits will be out of reach for most middle class people. On the transportation sector post fossil impact is high. <br><br>Alltogether life will change significantly for most people, that are now used to having a car, flying on vacation to Spain and eating mediterrane vegetables in winter. However the settlement structure is still in large parts the same as before the times of mass car use, so chances are that basic transportation needs can be met in the time to come. The high population density means that per head costs of grid are lower than in other countries, so public transportation and electricity networks have better chances to survive than in other parts of the world. Chances are good for common people to have access to electricity and public transport, there is no shortage of rain and water for agriculture and sanitary use, but many people probably have to wear warmer clothing at home during winter time. I also see a dramatic decrease in meat consumption, but basic food needs can be covered using (labour intensive) ways of local production (as two world wars have shown). The conversion of office jobs to agricultural jobs will not go without complains. <br>So the future here in Germany will be neither a renewable business as usual nor a revert to preindustrial times. I think in terms of energy use it will be a sort of lower level industrial society with many of todays convenience being unaffordable for the majority of people.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c3626900760286476419 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 4:01 AM</a><br><br>

Bird-killing wind power stations: is it current situation? Because I was looking at the problem a few years ago, and at the time it seemed, that most of the killing was done by old, small and fast turning turbines. Typical current turbine is 150 m or even 200 m high, which may be too high for at least some of birds, and its angular velocity is slow, which should make it avoidable.<br><br>2. Photovoltaics in Spain: the problem IMHO is, that the study includes too many things on input side. For example, factoring in expenses for police protection (because maintaining order is necessary for running the station) is IMHO too much. May be, if we include so much of common expenses of society among inputs, then EROEI of 1.6:1 is not that bad...<br><br>3. Low net energy of wind: EROEI of wind is usually given as 15 - 25, which is not a miracle, but still more then the value of 10, allegedly necessary for running a civilisation of our type. Of course, that is without counting loses in storage and grid.<br><br>4. And as a reaction to one of your comments: AFAIK green movement is aware of better performance of water turbines. The problem is, that hydro power is now more or less on its potential - the best places are already used. And, as anything else, even hydro power has its externalities.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c4790003458031431734 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 4:02 AM</a><br><br>

The first is that not enough is said in the Western world about energy conservation. The average Australian household uses 14kWh/day - and that's with gas water heating and cooking, the electric ones use more. One electricity retailer website looked at the payback period of the Tesla Powerwall battery and had a case study of a real home using 35kWh/day! And the case study did not mention replacing the battery at some point, apparently it has not occurred to people yet. <br><br>So average 14kWh, and case study 35... meanwhile in our home we use 6kWh/day on average, and we are not making extraordinary efforts, we do use aircon <i>when needed</i> (35+C days) and so on. If everyone did similarly, domestic electricity consumption would halve. In terms of climate change and fossil fuel depletion, a 50% reduction of consumption is the same as being 50% renewable, even in the magical world where renewables have zero fossil fuel consumption or carbon emissions. And rather than a cost, we save money. <br><br>The second thought is that people's reducing consumption may actually lead to large grids becoming economically unsustainable. About 20 years ago we privatised electricity production, and the buying companies didn't invest in infrastructure. Consumption rose, and there were blackouts on hot summer afternoons. So government stepped in and forced the companies to invest in infrastructure to deal with future consumption rises.<br><br>The companies responded by raising prices. Consumers responded to rising prices by... consuming less. Companies are now responding to lower consumption by... raising prices. Which will lead to... and... and... <br><br>At some point this positive feedback loop leads to companies going bust: either the companies get taken over by government who then run the electricity grid as a loss-making public service (like pension funds or our public healthcare), or the companies can no longer afford to maintain the grid of production and distribution for everyone and just keep it up for a wealthy few. <br><br>Whatever the energy equations of the whole thing, energy conservation is an <i>economic</i> threat to the age of the One Big Facility. So while in principle simply conserving energy could have similar effects to closing down coal etc stations in favour of renewables, I don't see how it can happen economically. And while individual households can live "off the grid", I can't see that happening with tens of millions of households - the minimum-wage home isn't buying a Tesla Powerwall any time soon.<br><br>Small-scale grids as Greer describes seem inevitable. That or permanent blackouts - but I doubt most people will just stumble into oblivion, Third World slums show how inventive people will be when they need to.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c7487054011371478032 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 4:46 AM</a><br><br>

So that's supposed to show us that a renewable sustainable economy is possible, and they also mentioned the falling price of photovoltaics.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Costa_Rica#Exports.2C_jobs.2C_and_energy<br>--------<br>Costa Rica has not discovered sources of fossil fuels—apart from minor coal deposits—but its mountainous terrain and abundant rainfall have permitted the construction of a dozen hydroelectric power plants, making it self-sufficient in all energy needs, except oil for transportation. Costa Rica exports electricity to Central America and has the potential to become a major electricity exporter if plans for new generating plants and a regional distribution grid are realized. Mild climate and trade winds make neither heating nor cooling necessary, particularly in the highland cities and towns where some 90% of the population lives.<br>----------<br><br>I also notice from Wikipedia the GDP per capita is about $15k, low by U.S. standards, but lower incomes might still make for a good life if the cost of living is lower too. OTOH, I see the inflation rate 5.6% if sustained will quickly move people into poverty.<br><br>Anyway, at least it reminds me that when oil economy is gone, we will enter a world of differential geographical assets, and some regions may prosper for decades while others will fall into chaos, even now, like regions of war now leading to huge refugee movements.<br><br>Donald Trump might be wrong about his Great Wall of America aspirations, but you have to think modern liberalism of more "open borders" is a temporary feature of cheap energy, and the future will contain more intense defending of boundaries, for anyone who likes what they has, while their neighbors failed to have the same good fortunes or prudent ancestral planning.<br><br>I've also remembered you quote from 2010 in regards to communal boundaries. <br>http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2010_01_01_archive.html<br>"In my experience, there are at least two things essential to any viable community that the vast majority of Americans find completely unacceptable. The first is an accepted principle of authority; the second is a definite boundary between members and nonmembers."<br><br>I can see the reason multicultural liberalism tries to break boundaries is they are by nature discriminatory, giving special treatment to tribal ingroup members and shutting out people who are different.<br><br>But if individualism must end with cheap energy, then we will have to relearn how to deal with tribal thinking, and use its best qualities for resiliency while moderating its vices.

Timely too, as our federal tax return hit the credit union account yesterday, and my wife and I sit on the couch sipping coffee, finalizing details for our modest off-grid PV system installation. We've lived without any electricity to speak of for 4 years now - less than 30W total, including tiny pathway lights between the front gate and the porch. And the system we're installing probably won't be much more than an order of magnitude larger, but I have to say that having a refrigerator will be like heaven! A 'fridge!! Yee-ha!!! And a few fans and high quality LED lighting instead of oil lamps and gas lights with $8 mantles that break every time someone slams the front door (obviously that didn't take long to do away with...)<br><br>This post reminds me that perhaps the best gift we've given our two young children is the gift of comfort with intermittency. When the old laptop runs out of charge and the kids' movie goes dark, the children quietly stand up, close the lid, and go play. No tantrums, no "Aaaaaw, crap," no nothing.

Here the easy answer is that local policies are being changed before things can get going. Or something to that effect.<br><br>To me, the current hi-tech renewables (as opposed to the 1970s lo-tech that you espouse)is another example of the increasing complexity of systems. Or, as Ivan Illich would say, the watershed point where renewables made sense has long been passed. Just because something gets more complicated, does not mean it is better or more "efficient." See our educational system, health care, transportation, etc. Not to mention politics. Like these tools, our energy system is now mostly occupied with the task of keeping itself (and our lifestyles) in existence as much as it is in providing a reasonable assist to the basics of living in the world. We just never know when to say when when it comes to technology. Humans!<br><br>An example I like to use is the side view mirror on automobiles. Once it was a humble slab of mirror attached to a basic frame that swivels on a ball joint that could be adjusted by rolling down the window, sticking your hand out, and moving it into a useful position. Now it is operated electronically by several switches, and costs many hundreds of dollars to fix or replace. And for what? To save a few calories of small muscle movements? (It doesn't save time, these things take longer to adjust.)<br><br>I read recently that now automakers are set to roll out camera systems to take over this function, similar to the cameras that have replaced the rear view mirror. This of course further adds to the cost and complexity of cars.

Dogmatic adherence to "the solution du jour" is just as bad as burying one's head in the sand. The only thing I would add is that our monetary system is also reaching a point where the rubber hits the road. Much of our privileged existence is due to a bizarre economic paradigm which has enabled so much of the malinvestment (fracking) present in our system. The USD and and all it's complex derivatives is on a collision course with reality.

Also, here in the Pacific NW the windpower boom has already played itself out with all the local companies that made the steel towers ( the rest is imported) having been closed down and auctioned off. The once vaunted Oregon Department of Energy which was started by Governor Tom Mcall and was the original gathering place of much of the crew of 70's appropriate tech magazine RAIN is under fire for bad renewable energy loans.

As we are forced to move away from such energy sources, either due to scarcity or climate change, we could use renewables to provide a very limited (compared to today's average usage)level of electricity to run a much more austere household (compared to today's typical household). Although austere may only mean moving back to a 1950s, 1920s, or 1850s lifestyle per Mr. Greer's Retrotopia model. It would take some getting used to, but it would not be like going back to the stone age. An advantage some older adults in the U.S. have is that they lived a much simpler lifestyle in their youth, so some of these changes will not be so foreign to them. For example, I grew up on a farm that had no indoor toilet, where we took baths from water gathered in a cistern, grew an acre+ garden (in addition to grain and livestock), always used old cars, did not take lavish vacations (often they were spent near home at relatives or local woodlands/parks), and made do with limited materials goods, many of which were handed down or recycles. We never felt poor, although by today's standards we would be judged as having lived in poverty. <br><br>The use of a very limited amount of renewable energy in the future is going to be constrained both by the simple fact that such sources can't produce power at nearly the same level as the current fossil fuel-based energy grid, and because the manufacturing infrastructure we have today that would be used to produce solar panels, wind turbines, and the like, cannot function without fossil fuel inputs.<br><br>For me, this means I have to scale back my use of energy in every area of my life. Relearn how to depend on shoe leather or a bicycle to perform many of my errands. Cut back on natural gas and electricity to light and heat my home (in other words, make the home better insulated, or go small so that it is easier to heat, and have a couple of alternatives that don't rely on the grid or fossil fuels). Quit buying so much stuff. Try to grow at least a portion of our own food. The real problem for me is getting to work. The distance to be traveled is great enough, the weather is weird enough (and getting weirder), and the roads between here and there are dangerous enough (crazy traffic and drivers), that daily biking is problematic. And, since the location is in a rural area, there is no public transport to the place (a school). <br><br>The good news is that I will retire in not too many years, and my follow-on job after retirement (assuming I can find one) will hopefully be close enough to where I live to make walking, biking, or using public transportation viable options. Boom, get rid of an automobile, save money on maintenance, insurance, and fuel. Put that money into things like seeds, tools (which I have been amassing over a lifetime), and more importantly, learning as many practical skills as possible (another lifelong endeavor). I live in a small city (less than 20,000) and have a pretty good sized lot that needs to have more of the land converted to growing fruit trees, as well as perennial and annual plants that produce things we can eat. <br><br>The point of all this rambling is that I understand that renewables can only play a very limited role in my future, and that I should not become dependent on them. The real future lies in adopting a different way of living that more realistically stays within the energy inputs outside of our current fossil fuel economy. <br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c2358852676190728373 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 7:03 AM</a><br><br>

I don't even have to go off-topic to relay news from Japan.<br><br>For the past couple of days, the TV over here has been moralizing about a dire need to forge ahead bravely with technology. First, a popular prime-time documentary series about space that has a high degree of credibility brought up the rumor of a neutron star heading toward the solar system, due to arrive 75 years from now, presenting it as a fact. The only hope for humanity, they said, was first to colonize Mars and then, based on that experience, build a huge toroid biosphere for as many people as could fit and boogey on out of the solar system. I'm not making this up, and it's not April, and they don't even have April Fools Day over here! I told my husband I could find no credible sources on the neutron star, but he is still really upset, and I wonder how other people who watched it are feeling. I see the hand of the nuclear lobby at work in the background here, because their big argument is that we NEED a high-energy future, and here's why for all the doubters. Seventy-five years! Perfect timing. All our dear little rosy cheeked grandchildren will be trying to reach their golden years when this cosmic wrecking-ball thing arrives (undoubtedly sent by the space lizards).<br><br>There was another documentary on yesterday about medicines, but I blocked it off, because it was too high blown, with a lot of moralizing, but what I suspect was going on is an attempt to soften up the Japanese for the TPP transnational corporate dominance "trade" pact, which the Japanese delegate signed along with a bunch of other countries', with its over-priced drugs and GMOs. The minority that understand the TPP's contents are freaking out, but the rest will probably just stumble into it blindly if it goes into force, wondering whatever happened to things they took for granted.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c1727422731126129906 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 7:09 AM</a><br><br>

Perhaps a bit of the current financial downturn we are about to go stumbling down is the result of people who finally see the rust showing through the chrome cities in the sky promised, but never delivered and have simply said, 'I can't follow this anymore'.

You cannot have a mortgage unless you have sure-fire-way to pay it off, quickly. If you can't make it to a rural lifestyle, it really is about mindset, afterall. JMG calls it 'Collapse In Place'.

You want to be the person who can do things because you cannot afford to hire done what you need. Furthermore, when you build things take time and do it properly.

The negative side of amateur radio today is the seemingly greater reliance on the maintenance, of repeaters (VHF, UHF), digital modes of communication, and always transmitting power (more and more power up to the legal limit). Such thinking, and operating methods, seem to me to be at odds with the original aims of the hobby which is to do more with less power, in fact, the least amount of power necessary to complete a communication.

QRP operators can do this with very models solar inputs or very small batteries that can be charged using a panel delivering only a few watts, or with a micro hydroelectric set up. <br><br>This assumes the contacts will be simplex (not rely on repeaters, analog or digital), that is, directly radio to radio. <br><br>Does anyone have any thoughts on this?<br><br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c5272823712957521212 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 7:36 AM</a><br><br>

This post really touched on a lot of things I've been thinking about and dealing with for the past couple of years as I try to downshift my lifestyle. Sorry for the longish comment but there are two topics I wanted to highlight that this post really hit home for me.<br><br>I think your prediction that solar PV and wind power will be the next energy bubble has a great chance of becoming reality. They will probably earn some big blue chip companies and hot start ups some very large subsidy checks and tax breaks from the federal government. Unfortunately, those will be the only entities allowed at the feeding trough. If some "collapse now and avoid the rush" folks wanted to take advantage of the bubble pricing, new tax breaks, and so on to get a really cheap solar thermal water heater system or a 2 to 4 kwh solar pv system to power some lights and ceiling fans and maybe a small fridge/freezer...forget about it! Those types of systems will not qualify or be part of the bubble. Only giant windmills and PV solar plants the size of a small town will qualify.<br><br>The other topic this post got me thinking about is the claim that solar and wind are rapidly approaching parity with coal for power generation. I have never seen anything factual that clearly demonstrates that claim. I have been kicking around the idea of installing a small solar PV system to power the well on our farm. It feeds water to our house, the main barn, some outbuildings and our garden. Long story short, every time I get some proposal for it and price it out (tax break included) against what I'm paying now it doesn't even come close. For example, assuming a 20 year service life and assuming that the average rate for coal powered electricity during that 20 years is DOUBLE today's rate, the cheapest solar system I have gotten pricing on is more than 150% more expensive than sticking with the grid. Now of course, there are all sorts of other assumptions one could make. Will the grid be on 24/7 in 20 years, will the USA even exist as a nation in 20 years, yadda yadda. All other things being equal on a dollars and cents analysis solar PV doesn't even come close!<br><br>So basically I guess we will see the government and big business waste time, effort and money to build out solar and wind subsidy dumpsters when the government could have helped individuals and communities build out realistic renewable energy infrastructure. What a shame...<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c1103796004390180970 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 7:54 AM</a><br><br>

Before we built and moved, we did an analysis of our energy use, eliminated the obvious and chose a system we felt would be enough. Our PV panels are only 1.2 KW plus 300W that only power our well pump. It's enough, and we do not feel constricted in our life-styles at all. Our house is less than 1400 square feet, passive solar and our heat backup is a masonry heater. Yet I look around and see people building and bragging about their eco-homes with more than 4KWs of panels and grid-ties to make up the difference. None of these well-intended folks are willing to give up the luxuries they feel are necessities. When the grey days in December come (as happened this Christmas), we cut back our electrical usage, then cut it again until the sun returns. We close curtains in summer to block the extra sun and open them in winter to let the solar heat in, then close them at night to hold the heat. A bit of common sense and a pro-active lifestyle and we are making it, and do not feel any restrictions in the life style we want and have.<br>But so many visitors, neighbors and friends still shake their heads. I would agree that solar will never work at a commercial, grid-tie level, but at the small, personal level, with low consumption rates, it's working fine. But it requires personal effort and a willingness to live without "stuff."

What is facing us now is an entirely different industrial-scale animal, funded with huge amounts of capital, selling the idea that we can continue our lifestyles as is by putting 6 kw of PV on the roof of our wood-chips-and-glue tract houses.

The new generation of batteries coming out now means that we may get 3 or maybe 4 days of stored power before having to switch on the generator. But then of course we will need at least 2 days of clear weather to charge back up to 100%. Solar power is about understanding the privilege of living minimally and still being relatively comfortable. But, for example even in the summer with 14 hours of strong sunlight, air conditioning is out of the question. In the winter we wouldn't even use an electric kettle to make coffee. Using electricity to generate heat is extravagantly wasteful. You overall point is exactly correct: it is about using a lot less power to live our lives. The only alternative is using none.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c4135772925956321095 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 8:24 AM</a><br><br>

Having to make mortgage payments with the income off a rural property is likely to be a severe test. This is why most successful family farmers inherited the family farm and just rent additional land.<br><br>As Jen stated -- and I can second from my own experience -- it takes time before a rural property can provide subsistence and generate income unless it's already a turnkey operation. Turnkey properties usually command a substantial price. Therefore, having savings that will enable you to span the gap is vital. Or you can work in town, either physically or by telecommuting. This will lengthen the time needed to set up your property, but if you need to work for a number of years to pay off the mortgage anyway, the timing may work out for you.<br><br>Finally, everyone involved has to be on board. The rural lifestyle isn't for everyone, and making a go of an agricultural enterprise is a team effort. If anyone is not behind it, animosities will likely arise.<br><br>I can recommend two books on this subject: "Five Acres and Independence" by M.G.Kains (1935) and "Ten Acres Enough" by Edmund Morris (1864). These are old classics, but because they were written in times when fossil energy use was not nearly as intensive as it is nowadays, they may actually be of greater interest to Archdruid Report readers than newer titles (some of which are also very good). They both include early chapters on what to look for in a rural property, and they describe their failures as well as their successes. The failures are highly instructive of pitfalls to avoid.<br><br>Thanks to JMG for your usual instructive and thought-provoking post, and to commenters here who provide additional information and food for thought.<br><br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c8782180067702041453 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

Some people hearing “industrial society” get caught up in the mind-trap of technological determinism and think of it in terms of the “industrial age” which got supplanted by the “atomic age,” the “information age” and will eventually be supplanted by the “quantum age” or somesuch (interestingly enough I’ve never seen renewables play much of a role in that particular narrative). Other people contest the claim that the US is an industrial nation by pointing out the transition of the US economy from industrial manufacture to service jobs in the ‘80s and ‘90s. Others seem to confuse the term “industrial” with the concept you define as “technic” and assume in suggesting that Renewables, Fracking, Biofuels, Nuclear Power, etcetera, can’t power an industrial society you’re referring to everything from the jumbo-jet to the cotton gin… Others think of an “industrial society” in terms of the base resource of the technologies it powers, (taking the stone age/iron age/ industrial age/ atomic age/ refers solely to the type of energy that’s powering it, and thus that a trans, respond to “renewables, atomics, etcetera can’t power an industrial society” with “of course not, they’ll power a renewable or atomic society.” Still others seem to think in terms of industrial society as opposed to agrarian society, and think you’re saying that other energy sources can’t power a society with urban centers, international trade, factories, and mass production of any sort.<br><br>Is there anywhere either in past ADR essays, or in a book that agrees with your definition of the phrase that offers a clear set of parameters for what exactly constitutes an industrial society, what distinguishes it from other models of society, what specific details set an industrial society apart from other forms of technic society, what suites of technology that are associated with industrial society at present are unique to industrial societies and so on? Some things are obvious, but other places can be much more difficult to know where the line gets drawn… Things like energy per capita obvious quantifiable features, but are much harder to qualify, Centralized power grids and other infrastructure systems are important features but it’s much harder to say just how big a power grid or other infrastructure system has to be to be considered an industrial power grid… fossil fuels are an important feature but is that related to energy per capita or is it a necessary feature (i.e. would a society powered by renewables that maintained the same energy per capita still be considered an industrial society? Or would it be considered something else by definition?). Mass production and factory manufacture are important parts of the definition of industry, but they had plenty of industry by that definition in the ancient world. Automation is another important feature, but the concept of automation itself goes more under what you’ve termed “technics,” and could be maintained with a lower degree of infrastructure in a non-industrial society. So, with the concept of “industrial society” I’m kind of stuck in a situation where I can point it out where I see it, but most of the distinctions I can see between industrial and non-industrial societies involves degrees of scale, rather than specific clear parameters that I can use to define it in a concise way, since by some people’s definitions a nation-state on about the infrastructure scale of ancient Rome plus a few wind powered home or neighborhood sized power grids for lighting, heating, and long distance communication with factories playing an important role in the national economy and a rail system connecting some of the larger cities would count as an industrial society (which is a type of society I could see popping up in some future civilization).<br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c5726384328376519956 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 9:25 AM</a><br><br>

We are also somewhat unique in that we own a considerable (for our size) amount of generation -- two solid-fuel boilers powering three steam turbines. Right now, we co-fire biomass (good) with coal and pet coke (not so good), but have already established air permits to allow up to 100% biomass consumption (very good). I have been lobbying for the development of more localized fuel sources for biomass, as supply is our primary constraint. We are surrounded by farmland and I have proposed the idea of us producing our own pelletized fuel from crop residue. I see this as a multiple win -- farmers receive a revenue stream, we take greater control of our own supply chain, and we secure long-term access to a fuel supply less dependent on rail transport. reception has been mixed.

However, this study is only one of many and over the years the literature has come up with a range of values from 2.45 to 12 (I think!). The average being 5 to 8. Not great, yet not abysmal. <br><br>When reading the literature it is quite clear that coming up with an accurate EROEI is problematic and will be most probably never be settled to everyone's satisfaction. <br><br>Furthermore, EROEI figures change in accordance with materials and manufacturing processes used, it is NOT a simple function of thermodynamics. Actually, no one knows how high EROEI figures can reach for solar PV. I have not yet seen theoretical studies that would put an upper figure on the above for instance. <br><br>From my perspective, to argue that "the numbers are just as problematic" based principally on the Charles study weakens your argument significantly for it ignores the range of values different studies generate, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. <br><br>Of course, where you are correct is that we cannot power the whole grid on solar and wind and even less an american lifestyle. You are right but for the wrong reasons, says I respectfully. <br><br>It is not necessarily the lowish EROEI that is problematic but mainly because solar and wind start off from a very low base, are variable in nature and grids have been designed for stability. Furthermore, solar and wind require electrical power storage which is still fairly expensive and difficult to deploy at will. Actually, we do not even know how low EROEI must fall before it becomes impractical to use. Of course below 1 the source becomes a sink. <br><br>The good news is that we do NOT need to have a grid solely dependent on either solar and wind. As we more or less know now, we are facing not an abrupt collapse but a gradual decline, hence as time goes by fossil fuels prices go up and down violently and supply may become variable. What we need is a way to dampen the impacts of those variations so as to retain a viable grid that can sustain a viable economic system. Of course we urgently need to cut down on wasteful consumption as at the same time. <br><br>This is where renewables come in. Hopefully they can help us to gradually reduce our dependency on fossil fuels while retaining a viable but most probably lesser economic system.<br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c4757154553945717970 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 11:14 AM</a><br><br>

The study you have quoted just makes a rough estimate of the upper limits of world wind potential to 1 TW, a huge amount by any standards. They then compare it to the world current consumption of 17 TW of primary energy, They are comparing apples with oranges, for wind gives electrical power directly usable whilst 80% of primary energy is fossil energy that must be burned before becoming usable to society and in so doing wasting away some 2/3 as waste heat. So 1/3 of 80% of 17 TW is 5 TW. No longer that negligible. <br><br>I note that you have not discussed the EROEI of wind energy, which ranges from 20 to 80 (I disbelieve the latter figure!) and the fact that it is now just as cheap as coal fired electricity. Furthermore, we tend to forget that in using coal we must burn it and so waste heat is generated, hence the EROEI of coal used to generate electrical power ought to be adjusted by reducing by 2/3 giving 1/3 of 80 = 26. Within the range of wind EROEI. <br><br>However, as discussed beforehand, wind is intermittent and electricity is expensive to store, making wind useful as power but difficult to power the grid with. <br><br>Finally, the main reason why renewables won't save our current industrial civilisation is that they cannot be used easily to power transportation, we need oil for that. We have a problem of non-susbtitutionability there. This is the elephant in the parlour that will wreck many things. <br><br>I do apologise for the length of that post and hope I have offended no-one and not made a nuisance out of myself!<br><br>Thank you!<br><br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c2222849972456065337 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 11:17 AM</a><br><br>

Six to ten years from now, we'll know for sure, won't we? <br><br>Ed, and of course that's another issue as well -- what's the effective lifespan of big grid-tied renewable systems, remembering that they last only as long as their least durable irreplaceable part, and what kind of energy and resource inputs will be needed to replace them? <br><br>Cristina, on the other hand, Iceland did manage -- unlike every other country in the world -- to respond to the 2008 banking crisis the right way, by letting the banks fail and jailing the bankers for fraud. That bespeaks a very pleasant level of common sense, which might get you through this in one piece. By the way, who is Guðmundur bóndi? I'm guessing he's the Icelandic equivalent of John Doe, but inquiring minds want to know. ;-)<br><br>Mark, glad to hear it. I figure if I keep on bringing that up, it's just possible that sooner or later enough people will grapple with it. <br><br>Chloe, I certainly wish you a fast fracking bust -- no question, as energy bubbles go, fracking has some of the worst blowback. I admit there's also a certain amusement value in trying to imagine some English politician in wellies and a raincoat standing there in the pouring rain, making a speech at the construction site for a big new solar power facility...<br><br>Ien, the future's a big place, you know, and I think there's probably room in it for Retrotopia, and also for the splendid ecotechnic civilizations of the far future -- which will make use of renewable energy, of course, because that's all they'll have to work with. <br><br>MigrantWorker, no doubt that'll have its place in line.

Your comments here, and those of my other readers who have direct personal experience of living within the limits of renewable energy, contributed quite a bit to this post. <br><br>Deedl, it's quite possible that Germany could manage to downshift to a post-petroleum and post-coal economy, for exactly the reasons you've sketched out -- the built environment still follows pre-fossil fuel patterns, and what's been done with renewables so far, though it's an immense subsidy dumpster, may give you a little more wiggle room on the way down. Other than England -- which is hopelessly overpopulated -- and those countries that will simply vanish beneath the waves as the seas rise, I could see that happen to a fair bit of Europe. Over here? Not so much, outside of a few corners of the east coast. <br><br>Pavel, the bird- and bat-killing is an ongoing issue here in the US.

The issue is that here on the East Coast of Canada, small towns have been so eviscerated that unless people start moving back, many of them will cease to exist in 20 years. What I am more concerned about was JMG's prognostication (which I agree with) that most North Americans will be squatters in 20 years. I do not think I will become some kind of independent farmer overnight, or over 5 years, or over 10, but I do not want to be a squatter or a tenant. I better hope that 50 lb bags of rice and beans are still available in 2030.<br><br>The issue that I am facing is that in 5 years, I likely will no longer be employable as an engineer because of the implosion of the North American economy - right now my employer benefits from cheap commodities and a low Canadian dollar, but ultimately still depends on the ability of the American consumer to buy our customer's products.<br><br>My internal conflict comes from the fact that right now, I could buy property in one of the smaller towns in Eastern Canada, but would have no realistic way of paying the mortgage. If I stick around in Halifax, I'll eventually have enough saved to buy a place, especially if the housing market crashes and my money stays valuable. Until then I am kind of in limbo. Maybe the best thing to do is buy a car and commute into town from the outskirts, although that would strain my ability to save money.<br><br>And yes, I know I am lucky, I have a good job for now, in a walkable city.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c5726028328901444215 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 4:59 PM</a><br><br>

It's really quite impressive, all things considered, to watch the amount of effort people are willing to put into inventing and believing daydreams that will let them think that someone else is going to fix everything. <br><br>Sherril, I hope he has the chance to practice that smirk behind bars for a good long time. <br><br>John &amp; Louise, thank you! <br><br>Kyle, exactly. The most likely trajectory as I see it is a rough, crisis-laden transition in which grid power to rural districts goes away, starting of course with the poorest first; large-scale grids gradually get cut apart into smaller, more sustainable grids; the more than occasional disaster of one kind or another (climate, war, terrorism, industrial accident) shuts down sections of the grid, and each year the likelihood of replacement goes down. Eventually you end up with those areas that have long-term sustainable power sources (such as hydro) with their own microgrids, while everyone else either generates a little 12v for their own uses or simply does without. <br><br>Ares, my guess is that for centuries to come, those districts that have viable hydroelectricity will either be centers of political and military power, or the most tempting targets for conquest by those who have political and military power, and the risk of being overrun during periods of mass migration won't be small. My guess is that it will be a lot safer and more comfortable to be somewhere that doesn't have much in the way of hydro. <br><br>Fred, it's unquestionably true that the salary class and the wage class have very different cultures. I consider myself fortunate to be comfortable with both. <br><br>David, that's one of many problems. The one that strikes me as the most important is that hydrogen isn't an energy source, it's an energy storage system, and not a very efficient one at that. Again, you have to put more energy into making it than you get back from burning it -- those dratted laws of thermodynamics, again!<br><br>Pathman, that's no surprise. SolarCity is one of Elon Musk's enterprises, and he's basically the nation's leading manufacturer of subsidy dumpsters. All his enterprises are simply ways of funneling public money into his own pocket. <br><br>Heretic, yep. So far, at least, Obama's avoided the kind of military confrontation that would lead to a military debacle, but we'll see.<br><br>Trippticket, congrats on the forthcoming solar system! It's people like you, who are collapsing well ahead of the rush and finding their feet in the deindustrial future, who make this blog's project seem worthwhile to me; thank you. <br><br>M, a very solid point. White's law argues that economic complexity is a function of energy per capita, and so a viable strategy for the future involves sharply reducing complexity so we can handle decreasing energy per capita. Very simple and very obvious -- except, of course, that it's not obvious at all to those who have their heads stuck in the assorted orifices of the mythology of perpetual progress.<br><br>Pine, it'll be interesting to see whether the current mark-to-makebelieve economy does in fact come crashing down, or if it simply spins off into irrelevance; I know a lot of people who expected things to fall apart long before now, and it may be the case that hallucinations need not obey the law of gravity.

The thing that concerns me is that a renewables bubble may be inflated now precisely because the solar industry is in trouble, and launching a bubble may be the only way that Elon Musk et al. can keep on raking in those government subsidies. <br><br>Brian, well, look at the bright side -- the steel and rebar from all those defunct solar installations will give a couple of generations of rural blacksmiths a local source of raw material, while the trade routes that will ship chunks of defunct skyscraper out from abandoned downtowns get up and running. <br><br>Bigsky, thanks for the data point! Complexity is a crucial issue, no question -- and that suggests that one of the core strategies for getting ready for the deindustrial transition involves eliminating excess complexity wherever it can be found. Hmm. I may want to do a post on this down the road a bit.<br><br>Pentrus, thank you! That's exactly the point, of course -- the only strategy that will get anything of value through the mess ahead starts with changing our own lives to use less energy and less resources. Any proposal that doesn't begin with that simply isn't serious. <br><br>Patricia, why don't they just send Gojira and Rodan to fight the neutron star? Sheesh... ;-)<br><br>Renovator, if you're right -- if people are finally beginning to see that the Great God Progress is a hollow mask in an empty temple where the paint is peeling off the walls -- then we may just be able to accomplish more than the sort of emergency salvage operation I've had as my Plan A. The abandonment of blind faith in progress is the one thing that might lead a significant number of people to grapple with the realities of our situation, and maybe even do something useful about it. That is to say, I hope you're right!<br><br>Phil, okay, that's worth knowing. In other words, you don't have the capacity for a Victorian-style industrial society on 5% of current energy input. That said, more research is definitely needed to get a sense of where the breakpoint lies. <br><br>Patricia, good -- that might inspire a lot of people to cut their energy consumption instead. Japan before 1868 managed an impressive level of culture and comfort on a very, very modest level of energy per capita; revisiting some of the lessons of the Edo jidai might be a good strategy now. <br><br>Lou, but that beast is so maladapted that at this point more and more people are being forcibly excluded from it. The question is how they'll react. <br><br>Wolfgang, excellent! That first sentence -- "The color of energy, regardless of where it comes from, is essentially brown" -- earns you tonight's gold star, for crisp enunciation of an unwelcome truth. <br><br>Ekkar, the only reason the urban-industrial model of society has become so widespread on the planet is, again, lots of cheap energy from fossil fuels. As that ends, I expect to see towns, roads, and the like vanish from fairly large regions that are now more or less integrated into the urban-industrial model, and human settlement in those regions will cycle back to horticultural, pastoral, or hunter-gatherer lifestyles. Thus it's not so much a failure of memory as the imposition of a human monoculture on the planet, and when that goes away, I expect the options to expand considerably.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c4436421511690649844 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 6:48 PM</a><br><br>

All things considered, our current civilization may not leave many useful legacies for the future, but a simple, sustainable, flexible method of communicating across continental distances is one thing worth keeping. <br><br>Wolfgang, I've heard that from others, including quite a few people with extensive knowledge of desert ecology. Not that such concerns will slow down the faux-green promoters...<br><br>Allie, exactly. One of the necessary realizations in this business is that the government is not here to help you -- it's here to help the rich and their pet corporations. The most you can hope for is to slip past under the radar, and do what you need to do yourself. <br><br>Nathan, thank you. This blog has been a great place to learn that particular skill set. <br><br>Wes, exactly! It's perfectly possible to live a comfortable, decent, humane life using renewable energy sources -- and indeed to have a more comfortable life than most human beings have had. It's just not possible to maintain the absurd extravagances that characterize modern industrial lifestyles. <br><br>Erik, thanks for the numbers. <br><br>Phil, of course. Just because it's carbon neutral doesn't mean it's not wrecking the biosphere in some other way!<br><br>Gavin, thanks for the link. <br><br>Friction, exactly. I'm also a great fan of solar energy; solar water heating, passive solar space heating, solar ovens, solar greenhouses, and plenty of other ways of using the diffuse low-grade heat sunlight generates so readily are all wonderful technologies that deserve much more use than they currently get. I suspect the future will also make much use of solar electric technology, though I'm guessing that Seebeck-effect generators using bimetallic strips heated by reflecting concentrators will be more sustainable and rugged than any PV-effect technology. My point is simply that trying to force solar energy to do something it can't do -- that is, power a modern American lifestyle -- is an exercise in futility at a time when we have many better things to do. <br><br>Glenn, thank you, but Google won't let me access that page via your link. <br><br>Ralph, exactly -- and thank you for joining in and helping to remind people what it's actually like to live on renewable energy. <br><br>Dylan, that's a great story -- and a useful reminder that humanity's supposed ownership of the Earth is not of great interest or importance to most of its other tenants. <br><br>Patricia, that's the thing about historical parallels. Once you know what makes people stop thinking and start going through pointless repetitive actions, you can predict it to a fare-thee-well and be right every time. <br><br>Glenn, I've long had my doubts about the tubes -- too fussy, too many things that could go wrong. A good old-fashioned circulating solar water heater is a lot simpler and sturdier; admittedly, Maine may not be the best place for that particular technology.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c3802219036851142672 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 7:13 PM</a><br><br>

When people start those, I make it a point to roll my eyes and walk away, because someone who uses definition games isn't actually interested in a discussion -- only in scoring points. I don't offer any definition of "industrial society." I use the phrase "modern industrial society" -- note the first word -- as an ostensive label for something we all recognize readily enough, the particular mode of human social and technological organization that currently obtains in Europe, North America, Australasia, and the eastern shores of Asia, as well as some other places in the world. When I say "modern industrial civilization is unsustainable," I'm not trying to state an abstract principle that belongs to some category labeled "industrial civilizations;" I'm making a specific observation about the specific phenomenon we all see around us right now. <br><br>Robo, that may be the case -- but I'm interested that you think that Trump and Sanders make no practical sense. Did you think their rivals make some kind of practical sense, then? <br><br>111DFC/David, au contraire, money is just a token -- it's because it means nothing in and of itself that it can be loaded with so many illusory meanings by those who manipulate it. <br><br>WW, if you got it in eight, you're doing far, far better than a lot of people out there! Thank you for making the effort. <br><br>Buddha, all of that is good to hear. Best of luck in the primary! <br><br>Mark, PV is a very mixed bag. Have you looked into a solar water heating system? That can chop 10% off your annual energy consumption quite readily, depending on where you live. <br><br>Zaphod, if that's the way you want to live, fine. If not, why do you choose to keep living that way? <br><br>Karim, yes, I've seen those numbers as well. If sun and wind produced the kind of net energy that their proponents claim, neither one would need government subsidies to make them profitable -- and yet we see that neither one sees any kind of widespread adoption without substantial subsidies. The thing is, as I noted in the post, nothing this blog says is going to stop the renewables bubble; over the next six to ten years, I expect to see billions of dollars in new investment in solar and wind electrical generation capacity, and if they really do perform as well as their promoters insist, that should be the leading edge of a lasting boom. If, on the other hand, I'm right, a decade from now we'll be looking at cascading bankruptcies in the renewable industry because the numbers really didn't work. Shall we see what happens? <br><br>Pygmycory, good! Okay, we have the Hillary Clinton. What about the Ted Cruz sandwich? Canadian bacon and Cuba cheese on sourdough? <br><br>Mrs. Loris, that's good to hear. That anybody's mentioning conservation at all is good to hear. <br><br>Pygmycory, Seattle's in the middle of a tech bubble, so rents are being jacked up exorbitantly, and of course the city council and mayor are weeping crocodile tears over the plight of the homeless while doing nothing to change the situation. Tings are just as bad in a lot of other coastal cities, and even in the inland states, homelessness is rising rapidly as more people every month enter the ranks of the permanently unemployed.

This could be a good idea or a very bad one, depending on the details. It is only a good idea if you can count on enough rental income to cover property taxes, maintenance and mortgage payments. Don't expect a positive cash flow; that usually only happens after the place is paid off or the area gentrifies. <br><br> The property has to be nearby enough for you to keep an eye on it and do most of the maintenance yourself. Before you buy, you want to make sure that the place doesn't have costly or unfixable hidden problems or criminal neighbors and you need a realistic plan to get a good tenant. Don't rent to a family member whom you won't get rid of if they fall behind on the rent. You should be well informed on what your legal responsibilities would be as a landlord, what the law requires you to do in order to perform a legal eviction, and you will want advice on how the rental property will affect your taxes.<br><br>If this works out well, you will have a steady long term tenant covering your costs of ownership. When you are ready to retire from your town job, either you wait until the tenant's lease is up and move in, or sell the property to the tenant or someone else and use the proceeds to buy a home for yourself. It's also possible that you will find being a small scale property manager congenial and sufficiently lucrative to become your post retirement occupation.<br><br>Being a responsible landlord requires some knowledge, skills, and time spent.

We have a friend who wanted to do his part for a "greener" future, and had a solar panel system installed on his roof and hooked up to TEPCO's grid. He paid so much for it that the amount he saved on electricity bills wouldn't make up for it for more than twenty years, when it would start needing replacing. Furthermore, after Japan's big earthquake and Fukushima, when TEPCO's grid shut down, his solar system was shut down with it. That's necessary when you're attached to the grid, for the safety of repairmen.<br><br>Better deals emerged in the wake of Fukushima, and people took advantage of them to go into business, but Japan's electric companies started refusing to buy the electricity, and I'm hearing about resistance from established power generating companies everywhere.<br><br>Lots of people after Fukushima would put up a solar panel, but not know how to store the energy. They'd attach it to a light or something, which would only work when the sun was shining. Then they'd just give up. Information can be surprisingly hard to obtain here.<br><br>We put up a few panels and fixed up a way to swivel them, which basically doubles the amount of energy we get. The swivel unit consists of my husband, with a replacement unit available. A friend in car repair has given us a lot of old car batteries. With this and energy-saving light bulbs, we manage to light the house quite well, but not much more. We are still on the grid for the refrigerator and this computer, which is essential for my work. We have the potential for hydro out back of our house, with which we might become independent of the grid, but unfortunately, TEPCO owns the rights to all hydro in the area.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c4627920694371467713 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 10:26 PM</a><br><br>

They don't emit gases. They can operate on a personal level. No noise. Etc. The main issue with people's hopes for solar/wind/etc lie in the fact that they tend to only see it a piece of technology in their hands, doing what it does. No matter how well solar does what it does, they can't match fossil fuels pound for pound in energy production. <br><br>This led to my other point, more hard fought for it to be considered, that solar and wind are both recipients of huge fossil fuel subsidies. For a solar panel to be made, requires large inputs of fossil fuel energy. The mining, transportation, manufacture, maintenance of factories. All of it has raw crude lubing its path from concept to product. The other option is that it is that essentially all the materials and subsequent aspects of the supply chain are done by physical labour, which would make them a luxury item and not a worldwide energy solution. <br><br>I think people just don't wanna hear things that they think are negative or likely to discourage a transition towards the usage of renewable sources of energy via things like wind farms and solar panels. But it just has to be said, it's not about discouraging people away from cleaner forms of energy concentration and capture, it's about putting it in context. There is not a bauxite mine on the planet that sources its electricity from solar panels and its fuels and lubricants from bio-diesel or other non-toxic means. And If you were to divert all that low-grade power production to try and match what fossil fuels do, then there would be no bauxite mines because it would be cost prohibitive and and generally unfeasible.<br><br>I also brought up the idea of mini-grids, and even perhaps having a local producers of solar energy from whom others paid/traded for power. My gracious boss who did not mind arguing these points with his new staff member took issue with it, suggesting that the major grid network offers so many benefits. It does, it's true, but at what cost? And to what end? The modern industrial experiment has made the impossible possible, the inaccessible accessible, for some. By absolutely no means all. But the cost has been so great that it threatens the health of every ecosystem on the planet. Decentralisation, and there fore localisation of energy capture, concentration and distribution will be the only way to maintain an even mutant resemblance to our current habits of consumption. <br><br>Then came the argument for efficiency, and how all products are becoming more and more efficient. My response was, that there will come a time in the future, where from out of a bunker-lab emerges the world's leading efficientologist carrying the world's most extremely efficient thingy, to present it to an empty scorched earth, laid to waste in the quest for the most efficient way sustain unlimited growth on a finite planet.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c8180332681979913822 title="comment permalink">2/11/16, 10:59 PM</a><br><br>

Well done, you've hit a nerve here.<br><br>Thank you for writing that as my experience has taught me that it is an unwise gamble to bet the farm on renewable energy sources powering the sorts of consumption that people enjoy today. I mean, honestly, how many readers here could cope with only 4kWh of electricity in a single day and then do it again the next day, and the day after etc.? Not many at all I reckon. The funny thing is that visitors don't even notice that the house is not connected to the mains grid. 4kWh is a massive amount of energy too and few people realise that.<br><br>Incidentally relying on solar photovoltaics solely for electrical energy means: Making hay whilst the sun shines, but then so many other systems here revolve around that simple concept too.

This week, Austrian media are reporting on the biggest bancruptcy so far this year, coming from *drumroll* - a solar power company! With only 3 employees in Austria and a plant in Ukraine, the company managed to amass a debt of half a billion Euros, with assets of just 19 million. - Try to get that kind of loan from a bank for a proper business of your choice ;) And that doesn't, to my understanding, include any government subsidies already consumed.<br><br>Given, in this case it may have been a corrution and ponzi scheme from the start that exploded in the face of its creators early due to the regime change in Ukraine - but the dimensions involved and the willingness of mainstream banks to hand out that much money for practically no securities (but hey, what could go wrong?

Of course a clever person could take out a cell or two or more really, here and there and connect the panel straight up to a 24V DC battery or even rewire the panel so that it can work with a 12V DC battery. It doesn't have to look pretty to be effective.<br><br>There are plenty of salvageable 24V DC items - look to the trucks as they use 24V DC equipment as standard...<br><br>On that point too, so many people want an off grid system to provide them with the sort of comforts that they enjoy today which if they are of the average consumption persuasion, is generally impossible. But that does not mean that a tiny little system isn't highly useful. Quite the contrary, a small system can power: radios (including ham radios); water pumps; lights; air compressor; soldering iron; refrigerator; fans even a television or computer. You name it, it can do it - no worries. Just don't expect heating - I actually tried an electric heater here and it was more effective to simply open the window and let the warm air into the house. Seriously! And the load it put on the equipment just wasn’t worth it.<br><br>Oh yeah, most of the grid tied inverters are boat anchors as they have no application to an off grid system. They are like a pump that can only ever run at one speed, whereas off grid inverters are far more complex beasts and can vary the output and provide for huge peak loads (mine can go up to 9kW for 5 minutes). It is one of those things that people don't realise but some electric motors – like induction motors can require huge amounts of energy to start functioning before backing off on their demand. A lot of cheap and simple off grid inverters can't power them and I've heard of many sad tales about that sorry story. A lot of the hybrid systems that people like to talk about have no hope of even running those sorts of peak demand loads. Some hybrid inverters can though, but they are very expensive hybrid inverters. People think of this stuff as being cheap, but to be useful it isn’t cheap.<br><br>That reminds me too: Batteries are only ever 80% efficient and they are a very old and mature technology, regardless of what anyone says. There are no easy gains to be made there. Just sayin... Oh yeah, and if one more person tells me about the Tesla powerwall – honestly, the off grid people down here have slam dunked them.<br><br>I've read most of the comments so far and am rather enjoying this topic.<br><br>Oh incidentally, the concept of running off to the boonies to set up an organic farm takes a whole lot of work and time. Years down the track, I still learn things every single day and I've learned enough to know that some of those errors would have been fatal to either myself, or the bit of infrastructure here that I was playing around with. Nothing can replace the time taken to gain the experience, and anyone thinking otherwise is daydreaming.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: I've got a new blog entry up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Tomato Jungle</a> where coincidentally I show the 4.2kW off grid system performing as well as it is ever going to (which is only 80% efficient!). I hack a path into the now feral tomato jungle - yes you read that correctly! There are before and after photos – it is feral. I'm storing firewood which is a nice form of concentrated solar energy.

Enough battery capacity to deliver the 230V/50Hz electricity I need while staying there, but I am not running any mod-cons, just basics such as lighting, power for the radio, computer and recharging the phone. You learn to question what you need electricity for, and how much you need, and you learn quite a lot about conservation, if you're smart.<br><br>As JMG writes, those who believe we're headed for a glorious renewable future, with no let-up on our energy use, don't have any practical experience with domestic renewable sources. You need to learn quite a bit, in order to ensure that your set-up is at optimum -- and there's a lot that can go wrong if you don't pay attention. <br>Yes, I did what most do: I destroyed a battery bank. One bit of advice I got was that "your first bank should be a cheap one, as you're going to kill it."

And if the dimension is right, you can run mod-cons, not as conveniently as with on-grid, but enough. Only trouble is that it's going to cost you, a lot.<br>Installers have lots of stories about people who calculate their energy needs, prior to getting a bid for the installation. Without fail, they have ludicrous requirements, and it takes some effort to talk them down from their expectations. Some get angry, when told what it would cost for them to have "everything as it used to be, but now off-grid". <br><br>After having run my solar/wind for over three years, I've become so good at it that I could sell my generator. Sun and wind are supplying enough energy to keep the batteries healthy, without a need to juice them up with the generator. But that took adjusting how much I demanded from the set-up.<br>The difference between what I would like to have on hand, and what I realistically should expect to have on hand, is probably nicely mirrored in society as large: what we'd like to do is far in excess of what we should do. It took breaking a battery bank for me to respect the difference; "society" will break a lot more, because it won't accept the difference.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c7817039039156458589 title="comment permalink">2/12/16, 3:25 AM</a><br><br>

In other words, you don't have the capacity for a Victorian-style industrial society on 5% of current energy input.

I just read my own comment again and see I left Scotland out of the UK.)<br> <br>In that earlier comment this week - see also the reference cited - I calculated British energy consumption (expressed as coal equivalent):<br><b>Per capita UK in 1900 = 4.42 tonnes ce; 1950 = 5.6 tonnes ce; 1990 = 6.5 tonnes ce</b><br>One tonne of coal equals 0.6 tonnes of oil or 7.1 MWh of electrical energy or 1.016 long tons<br><br>Yes – always more research is needed! Good job I am retired (lower complexity! ;-)), and that we make compost and my wife is into veg gardening! I have a whole string of questions about breakpoints. <br><br>First-up question might be – why does the USA have double the energy consumption per head compared with Britain and the European average? And as a subsidiary question, at the same time why should the USA have such a poor and expensive health insurance system given the vast resources serving the economy? My first guess is that Kunstler is right when he points to the American suburb as 'the' major expense / 'consumer-good' needing (and getting) cheap oil / gasoline, but see also Elizabeth Warren, below.<br> <br>[Elizabeth Warren back in 2006 pointed to the threat to the USA middle class – basically income insecurity – and to the then current major household expenditures for mom &amp; pop and two kids. Big changes since the 1970s; and no, it is not expensive clothes and household goods and cost of food and running a car. See rather, larger mortgages from inflated house price, more cars for two jobs (and taxes), health insurance, and the biggest increase, childcare.]<br><br>Where does that leave complexity? [Next major research project ;-)] Maintenance of legacy-complexity is first up in my view, which includes inter-generational maintenance of, in particular, ‘knowledge’. My guess is that some ‘knowledge’ is relatively easy to maintain while other types become prohibitively expensive. (Some knowledge is exterminated and the ‘DNA’ is lost?) From analogy with ‘key species’ in specific ecosystems, there could be ‘key-knowledge’. Look around – there are planetary human systems that ‘get-by’ on 10% of British energy per head or 5% the energy consumed by a USA citizen. Some of these ‘lower energy-cost’ systems are dependent in some critical regard – at the critical margin - on the legacy of industrial civilisation, perhaps something like vaccines or a small number of IC engines, or even on the hand-ons of the Big Consumer. But … and so on and so on: research continues. :-)<br> <br>Some places get by with adequate complexity on not much more than 15% of American per capita energy, like Cuba, and a few on only 5%, with enough ‘surplus’ to maintain a ‘knowledge base’ given their own legacy civilisation. On the other hand, others at higher levels fly apart already.<br><br>best<br>Phil<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c6384495027390871978 title="comment permalink">2/12/16, 5:44 AM</a><br><br>

Thinking about plastic and oil and my dependencies on the course of it. And how our system seems reluctant to ask the inconvenient questions of our leaders and candidates (let alone ourselves). As we enter the age of the tail of oil, when will we get serious about the end of oil? Uncontrolled by oil. For example, rather than pour $4 billion from the federal larder into driverless car research, as has been proposed recently by some technocrats, you'd think we might be wiser to start disfavoring the auto.

I think they round off what JMG has written quite well. Apart from thermodynamics, there is "whole systems kinetics" which includes societal aspects. If you like physical analogies, then I guess you can describe leaving the modern industrial society as a phase transition. Again, kinetics are often crucial in real world applications. If you have a steel alloy you want to make a knife from - the way that you transition from point A to point C is critical. <br>This is where anthropological information would be really useful, because you can try to get to certain societal configurations if you know under what conditions they exist in a relatively stable way. What is technologically viable in these societies won't be easy to predict from a BAU/always-on-grid perspective. <br>Like Andy said, if you aren't even experimenting with alternative models while you have the ability to learn and plan as a society - you are stumbling into the twilight with eyes closed. Why not offer an alternative tax scheme? Why not have 3 days off per week on the days the weather is not right for energy intensive work? You'll directly condition people to use less energy in their spare time. Of course education (that is something I dearly missed in retrotopia by the way), paperwork, perhaps travel or military training should be affected (did you know WWI was delayed because Austria's army still had to bring in the harvest before they'd be ready?). <br><br>Re industrial renewables:<br>@Backyardfeast: When I see energy related pie charts (which sort of imply that, yes, you will be covering a 100% of demand) I like to just imagine a significantly bigger pie around it. If you have the chance, it is easy enough to draw and label it "shed". Then you can focus the ensuing discussion on the relationship of the part of the pie that says "efficiency" and the big pie. Between the question of "efficient at what exactly?", systems thinking, and perhaps the likelihood of being in the "inner circle" (conveniently loaded phrase) - you can have a lot of fun. <br><br>By the way there is currently a de-industrialisation datapoint in the making for the company German Pellets (high grade wood pellets), which is in the process of going broke. As far as I know they did not use a lot of subsidies though and are probably partially a victim of the oil price. I guess split logs will have larger market in the future.<br><br>@SamuraiArtGuy: BLIP = e.g. Kristian Olaf Bernhard Birkeland (from thin air).

But, it takes energy to get the hydrogen out (electricity, typically) and you lose energy with each transformation like separating the hydrogen out of water, recombining it into water (whether with a flame or an electrode). Better to use the electricity directly. Similarly, hydrogen can be a by-product or intended product of transforming some forms of fuels, but again, better to use the fuels directly because of losses in transformations (at least 15% with each one). And, finally, hydrogen lacks the energy density and ease of handling of gasoline or diesel fuels. Sure, it was used on the space shuttle and other rockets because of its high energy density when burned with liquid oxygen (and both the hydrogen liquid and oxygen liquid were used to cool the the rocket nozzles) but who wants to build a car with cryogenic tanks? Or let non-specialists refuel such cars? And, who wants to drive a car with that kind of fuel if there's an accident (and there will be!). Liquid fuels are dangerous enough in a crash, hydrogen!

Though he holds out the possibility of sweeping techno-progress changes throughout the piece, Krugman seems to honestly confront the compelling argument that the party may just be over. The final two paragraphs are worth quoting:<br><br><i>"It’s a shocking prediction for a society whose self-image, arguably its very identity, is bound up with the expectation of constant progress. And you have to wonder about the social and political consequences of another generation of stagnation or decline in working-class incomes.<br><br>Of course, Gordon could be wrong: Maybe we’re on the cusp of truly transformative change, say from artificial intelligence or radical progress in biology (which would bring their own risks).

Just because solar won't work for you in January doesn't mean it is a bad idea for April! Gradualism in changing your lifestyle is so much easier than going in whole hawg with everything. From what I have seen, those who attempt the latter usually wind up running out of steam, or resources, not even halfway through, and then live in a half-functional pastiche of incomplete projects.<br><br>A few years ago I put in a solar home heating system. When I mention that, people usually assume something fancy involving PV or heat exchangers or big barrels of wax or whatever. Nope. All I did was make a black-painted south-facing room out of part of the attic, replace the metal roof over it with polycarbonate, and put in inexpensive ducts and fans to blow hot air into the rest of the house. Nothing that you can't buy in hardware stores, cost of a few hundred $$. Sure it doesn't provide all the heat we need in midwinter, but it provides a significant amount, and it does provide just about all the heat we need in September, October, March, and April, and a large portion of the November and February needs. And in Dec-Jan it significantly reduced our use of wood and supplemental electric. <br><br>Same with hot water. I have not put it in yet just because it hasn't gotten to the top of the project list. But the fact that it might not give me all the hot water we want in January is irrelevant. It still would reduce the use of the electric water heater, especially if I put it online as a pre-heater for the electric one. <br><br>And of course if the grid and fossil fuels become less affordable and/or less reliable during your lifetime, you'll still have *something* instead of nothing!<br><br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c7643003900487517861 title="comment permalink">2/12/16, 9:33 AM</a><br><br>

They never pay for excess power. They only offer credit towards future electricity bills, and that credit expires after a year or so. That means that a household on "net metering" must use a significant amount of electricity on winter nights to use up those credits - hopefully a heat pump, but some use resistive heat. Of course, THAT electricity is coming from other sources, mostly fossil. And the ability of the grid to accept the excess power on summer afternoons is a direct result of there being enough other customers who are using air conditioning. As I keep telling people, the grid is not a battery, and storing credit is not storing energy.<br><br>I believe this scheme was accepted by the utilities and the powers that be only because it does not cost them any market share: it actually helps them smooth out the summer peak demand. And they make money selling the renewable "credits" to other utilities (enabling them to legally burn more fossil fuels).<br><br>Me, I designed and built a small back-up power system that is not connected to the grid (although the house it on the grid). It includes PV (at first 400, now 800 watts nameplate), charge controllers, batteries (lead-acid, about 5 KWH nameplate), an inverter, thick copper cables, circuit breakers, etc. In such a system, the parts other than the PV panels are far more expensive than the PV panels - despite buying the electronic components used, and doing all the labor myself. And the batteries are only good for a decade or so.<br><br>I did this not to save the planet, but to be more resilient in case of prolonged outages, which I expect will be more common in the future (as they are already more common than in the past). That system is just large enough to run a couple of lights and a small chest freezer - a bit more in the summer, a bit less in the winter. With the well pump now a 115V soft-start model, it too can run on the inverter. So can the boiler that heats the water on demand - it burns propane, but needs some electricity to operate. A hot shower while the grid is down, now that's how I define "resilience"! Yes I know that can be done with thermal solar etc, but not so well here in the frozen north. And relative to the space heating, the propane amount used for cooking and hot water is small. At least I get most of the space heating from a wood stove and a heat pump.<br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c6256978953507165511 title="comment permalink">2/12/16, 10:00 AM</a><br><br>

How much would my annual household budget needs be reduced if I quit my job, could then pull our daughter out of costly daycare, go down to one car, finish weatherizing the house and get into passive solar heating for hot water to cut down on energy bills, and reduce our grocery bills by devoting time to the garden and raising chickens? There are plenty of assumptions built into that (not least of which is the elimination of some consumer debt, and figuring out emergency funds), but the potential is there to reduce our annual budget needs by a third!<br><br>On the note of renewables, in Ontario the government has an incentive program so that homeowners who purchase solar panels and tie into the grid are paid so-many-cents per kw/h on a 20 year contract. That's all well and good and the panels would pay for themselves over time, but it's amazing when you go to suppliers / contractors and try to have a discussion about installing panels for personal home use instead. It's as though you are speaking Klingon. No one has the notion of personal use in mind when discussing solar panels here.

Years down the track, I still learn things every single day and I've learned enough to know that some of those errors would have been fatal to either myself, or the bit of infrastructure here that I was playing around with. Nothing can replace the time taken to gain the experience, and anyone thinking otherwise is daydreaming."<br><br>Sounds like an extraordinary claim doesn't it? What I actually meant by using the word "fatal" was that if a person was relying solely on those systems for survival then my errors would have been fatal. Not that I haven't had the occasional accident here though...

It is not going to be pretty either. I was reading the physical newspaper this morning and noticed a few articles in the business section, of all places, calling to the wealthy to take a hit to their wealth for the benefit of everyone. I reckon it is a timely reminder to the very wealthy to avoid the possibility of retribution of the lamp post sort, but if they fail to hear or learn from history, then so be it. Anyway one article from a guy that works in the advertising industry (which I'm always a bit wary of and for good reason): <a href=http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/inequality-is-no-recipe-for-prosperity-20160211-gms6gb.html rel=nofollow>Inequality is no recipe for prosperity</a>. Anyway, in amongst the hooplah and advertising speak, there is a fascinating statistic provided by Professor Joseph Stiglitz. It quotes his latest book, The Price of Inequality and the general conclusion is that: "He warns us that the last time inequality reached such alarming levels was just before the Great Depression."

Mate, it is complex. Your question is an excellent technical question, no doubts about it.<br><br>But a little 12V DC system is a good thing. It has to be a "little" system because larger 12V DC systems require really thick copper cables in order to allow the energy to pass through them without converting that energy to heat. If the copper cables get too hot because you are pushing (or drawing) too much energy through them, then you get the magic black smoke and the cables will literally catch fire. Not good. Think of it like pushing too much water through a small pipe and the heat is sort of like the equivalent of friction in the pipe. As the voltage increases, that friction becomes less, but it doesn't go away and a huge chunk of the electricity generated anywhere disappears as heat into the environment. Ever wondered why electrical cables are suspended in the air? It is because they're generally under sized to save money and they need to get rid of excess heat losing electricity in the process – it literally disappears over the entire system - everywhere. Bury an electric cable and you'll find out that it is an expensive process.<br><br>The surprising thing is that thick copper cables can often cost far more than the PV panels themselves.<br><br>The inverter helps by increasing the voltage, which means that your appliances can use smaller cables and down under we use 240V AC for mains whilst over in the US it is I believe 110V AC which means that you lot have to use thicker cables than we do (or we get the same ones in our appliances which is more likely and so our stuff runs cooler). Without the 24V DC to mains AC inverter you have run really thick and expensive cables which means the inverter actually saves you money.<br><br>Hope that helps!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c5258921452068562299 title="comment permalink">2/12/16, 4:40 PM</a><br><br>

A passing remark by me in a discussion on Usenet apparently launched the term "fluffy bunny Paganism" on its way to its present ubiquity, so it's in character.<br><br>Karim, if your energy per capita is modest enough and rising sea levels don't become too much of a problem, I could see renewables working tolerably well in Mauritius, at least as a transitional measure. As I noted in my post, the issue isn't whether renewables are viable energy sources, it's whether they can prop up the wildly extravagant lifestyles that pass for normal in America today; if you haven't adopted those lifestyles in Mauritius, you'll have a much easier time of it. <br><br>Dau, ouch! I hope your shinbone heals up promptly. <br><br>Stravinsky7, in today's America everything, without exception, gets turned into an excuse to spend money and stare at little colored pictures on a screen, so why should renewable energy be exempt? <br><br>Cherokee, you're welcome and thank you. Your comment about overgrown toddlers is spot on -- and there's a particular sort of thinking common to toddlers that's all too pervasive in people these days, which will be the theme of an upcoming post. <br><br>Flo, thanks for this! Fortunately my knowledge of German, though spotty, was enough to pick up a fair number of the details. I wonder how many more dubious companies of the same sort are already all over the renewables scene!<br><br>Cherokee, here in the US 12 volt is more common than 24, but the principle's the same. One of the huge advantages of a homescale system in the US is that you can skip the inverter, use 12v DC across the board, and equip your home with devices that are designed to run off an automobile's electrical system -- there are still a fair number of things for sale that will plug into the cigarette lighter! Keep the end uses close to the batteries and the batteries close to the panels, so you minimize losses to resistance, and a very modest secondhand system can give you a few lights, a radio and CD player, a laptop computer, and a small and efficient refrigerator -- that is to say, lavish comforts by the standards of a century ago. <br><br>Stein, thank you for this! Your last comment is spot on, of course -- I suspect that we'll break industrial civilization before it really sinks in that, yes, we really do have to live within our energetic means. <br><br>Eric, it's based on the lifespans of the fracking and ethanol booms. You have three to five years of sales pitches and delusions of grandeur, which can flower freely since the new projects take that long to be built; then you have three to five years of desperately trying to keep reality from interfering with the gravy train of investment dollars and government subsidies. That's been the profile for both previous booms, and so it seems reasonable to expect a repeat. <br><br>Phil, many thanks for this. Why do Americans think they need double the energy per capita of people in England, and three times the figure for people in continental Europe? Because we waste energy in ways that would literally make you gulp in disbelief. When I'm over in Britain, it always impresses me to see how modest your energy use is compared to ours. You don't respond to any modestly warm day by cranking the air conditioning so that it feels like the inside of a refrigerator in most houses and all stores; you actually walk to the pub three blocks away, rather than driving, and you don't have thirty-six flat screen TVs blaring away in every pub; and so on. It's really quite simple; when it comes to energy use, Americans are frankly a bunch of spoiled crybabies. <br><br>Jim, you can also make cheap, modestly efficient PV cells out of some metals, and there's always bimetallic Seebeck effect generators, which I still think are probably the wave of the far future.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c3081617264849048159 title="comment permalink">2/12/16, 5:05 PM</a><br><br>

Running with original inverter, grid tie, battery back up. 4 12volt batteries. <br><br>I lose grid power power alot in winter, so have alot of experience running off just the batteries. We adjusted our needs before install, which is why we decided 2kWatts would be sufficient. This house is all electric, no gas or propane, no generator. Heat is woodstove. Solar hot water panels, closed loop propolyne glycol, flat panels I bought used. Electric element in hot water storage tank for back up. Used to have a run thru the wood stove for back-up, presently unhooked. Electric range and oven. <br><br>When running off just the battery storage, there are 2 main things that change, main one is no showers/baths unless the sun is out. Any hot water is heated on pot on top of the woodstove for dishes and washing up us. Second is that we cant use the electric range/oven, the cooking has never been a problem. We just switch to cooking on top of the woodstove and eat well. Just cant do any fancy baking of chiffon cakes and such. When the sun is out, I do use solar ovens alot -- I have 2 sun ovens, they do alot, but not fancy cakes. We do often use plug in cooking appliances off of the batteries/inverter, such as: electric breadmaker, electric kettle, toaster if we are running out the door and arent going to build a fire. We have the refrigerator powered, the internet boxes and the laptop computer and lights in the house and barn. The well pump and the pressure pump we decide at the time, as I can leave then off or not judging how long until I think we will have sun to recharge the batteries. I have water to the house without the pressure pump, from gravity from the water storage tank, but it is lower pressure and just downstairs then -- it is sufficient to shower with downstairs by swapping out the low flow shower head back to the old one, if the sun is out and have solar hot water. <br><br>I have run dishwasher (asko, built in water heater) and clothes washer even, when running off batteries/inverter in the summer when they could recharge, but I usually dont do that and wash dishes by hand with hot water off the wood stove. <br><br>My thoughts on a more constrained future are like this : It would be nice to have water catchment (passive, no pumps) and next time the well pump wears out, if I am still here, I will replace with a DC pump and move a few panels off the house roof and over to the barn roof to pump water to the storage tank when the sun is shining. It is no problem having this task intermittent and with alot of electronics and conversions. <br><br>The thing I would miss the most without an AC power system would be the clothes washer. I hope to always have a power clothes washer as I am disabled and couldnt do such a hard task by hand. I havent had a clothes dryer (other than the R.A.C.K.) for 19 years. <br><br>I have been thinking of the refrigerator lately. I have little need of one, realy. But, I do have dairy goats and chickens, and I store milk and homemade cheeses in it as I live in such a hot climate. I can save all the vegetables and fruits out of season by dehydrating and canning, which I do. Eggs dont have to be so cold, so something could be arranged with no fridge, but the milk would all have to be used soon -- fresh cheeses and yogurt and not able to be saved as hard cheese, not in this location. But, I would give up the refrigerator before the washing machine, so I think that Kunstler is correct about that and having his story making a community laundry<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c829218623104528409 title="comment permalink">2/12/16, 5:50 PM</a><br><br>

You're counting the booms and busts together and measuring from oil price spike to oil price spike, rather than the ~5 year path from peak to trough. You might see some useful turnarounds when the next round of demand destruction takes out solar without having to wait the full cycle then.<br><br>The bursting of the Fracking bubble wound up being the event that's caused my friend in the oil industry to start listening to me on the subject of peak oil, which has always been a touchy, brittle, no-go zone with him that we didn't discuss if we wanted to keep our friendship in tact. He's started asking everything he can think of, and is interested in borrowing my copy of limits to growth... Right now he's mostly just scared and looking for a plan B to get out of the industry, while at least listening interestedly on the subject of conservation and skill building rather than shutting down. I hope it's not too late to do some useful gliding down to a lower level of living and I'll do my best to guide him through some of the process, but it definitely shows that even this low oil price side of energy cycles that provide the illusion of an overly successful technology rather than an energy bubble in a failed technology can be enough to shock some people awake and get them thinking about making some shifts.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c7700180586694570085 title="comment permalink">2/12/16, 6:31 PM</a><br><br>

I think, based on my kids and neighbors and most everyone I know, that one of the things that makes this difficult is expectations.<br><br>Humans tend to have very unrealistic expectations in almost any endeavor. We are no more 'special' than caribou or monkeys. We just have bigger brains, so big they are capable of really big and crazy expectations. <br><br>Expecting tomorrow to be like yesterday is a common problem, when things change.<br><br>Expecting electricity to be always there, like when the light switch is flipped, is something many people will be upset about when things get just a little more stressed in the coming years. <br><br>There is already a clean water problem, but then, we have been raised to 'expect' clean water as almost a right - when it isn't.<br><br>Closing your eyes and thinking about your own insignificance is helpful, provided you don't get trapped in a loop doing it. <br><br>It is a shame that most Americans have never been elsewhere in the world, and many haven't even been elsewhere within the continent - seeing other do with less, expect less and then finding how easy it is for you to do the same, tends to relieve a LOT of stress.<br><br>Unrealistic expectations can cause a lot of personal and social issues, and in this country, the expectations are very, very high concerning most every endeavor. Learning to lower ones expectations is going to be required in the very near future. We have done very well lowering our expectations of government - we are going to need to do the same with many things sooner than we think.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c4006509689544566901 title="comment permalink">2/12/16, 6:43 PM</a><br><br>

This new technology, called Human Powered Agriculture (HPA), will solve a multitude of problems, create millions of good jobs, and improve the nation's health! In addition, with its companion technology, Organic Nutrient Reuse (ONR), it will lower the cost of food production, use much less energy than the old-fashioned agricultural methods, as well as dependency on rapidly depleting inorganic chemicals! Additionally, these new technologies will allow producing a wide variety of food on small plots of land, as opposed to the soon-to-be-outdated technologies that require vast acreages to produce single crops.<br><br>We also look forward to yet another companion technology, the details of which I'm not at liberty to discuss just yet.

It reminded me of some of your older posts, years ago, where you were taking about (sorry, I'm paraphrasing here) "Modern electrical-grid-dwellers think that all ways to generate electricity are equivalent, because by the time power gets to your home outlet, 100 volts is 100 volts . . .. but if you are generating your own power, you'll find out that certain means are better for certain tasks, and crappy for other tasks. For example, pedaling a stationary bike is efficient to power gear-based machines, like your old-timey butter churn or clothes-washer, but it's really terrible for powering a computer or electrical device. Use solar panels for that stuff instead."<br><br>Sorry if I got that wrong, it's been a few years.<br><br>I know you've got a massive backlog of things to talk about, but I'd love it if you someday talked more about what should power what, home-electricity-generation-wise.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c8622781001696365072 title="comment permalink">2/12/16, 8:13 PM</a><br><br>

The numbers don't add up, and never will. <br><br>However, within this, there few byways and regional or national anomalies that could ultimately add up to something important, for those lucky to have them. There are places where both centralised and decentralised grid-distributed renewables make economic sense, and where they will be able to be sustained in some form for many years to come, even as fossil fuels dwindle. New Zealand, Scandinavia, the Pacific North-West, and much of Canada come to mind here. China and India aren't badly off either, and neither are many African nations.<br><br>Once you have a grid-backbone of hydro, other renewables rapidly become economic too. Geothermal, wind, and probably marine sources. Given the right environment, it can work without subsidies, although, the true cost is the loss of wild rivers. <br><br>I say this because most countries that developed renewables early - i.e. hydro - did it largely with human and animal power. They even built their grids with the same energy resources, wooden poles, humans and animals to install them, but with help from fossil fuels to mine the minerals to make the wires and build the generators and turbines themselves. Bear in mind that these were regional grids, it was only post WWII that grids were connected into national or international systems. <br><br>Even on the steel supply there are options. NZ runs an interesting operation for steel production. Feedstock is iron-sand, rather than taconite, using a direct reduction process, rather than a blast furnace. As such, coal is required as a reducing agent, rather than a primary energy source. It would be challenging, but not impossible, to use renewable resources to make the reducing gas. <br><br>So I hold out some hope that we can maintain some electricity production, however, it won't be possible to maintain industrial society. <br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c1501639384234549321 title="comment permalink">2/12/16, 10:26 PM</a><br><br>

My partner and I live in a small two-room shack on the Big Island of Hawai'i - as such we don't have the need of either heating or cooling the house. All of our electricity comes from a PV system - no grid connection, no unsightly poles or wires hanging in the air. We have 2.2KW of PV, from which we can get about 1750W on a clear day. Our battery system provides about 3 to 4 days of headroom to get us through cloudy/stormy days, of which there are sometimes plenty.<br>Our needs were modest going in, but I over-specified the system, as we both still rely somewhat on a couple of computers and the internet to make a living. We have two small high-efficieny DC refrigerators. No freezer, but we have the energy capacity to run one if/when we decide it is needed. A clothes washer is a luxury my partner wanted, and we have plenty of power for that, though we try to run it only on sunny days. We happily employ a variation on the R.A.C.K. that has so revolutionized laundry drying. I am able run a table saw, mitre saw, etc..., though again, we try to limit our heavy electrical usage to what I now call "Sun Days". I derive a little pleasure from using an electric string trimmer to help keep the jungle at bay (using the power of the sun to cut grass !), but on cloudy days or for big jobs, I sharpen up the scythe.<br>In short - after five years, we still love it. Yes, it requires some attention to energy usage and maintenance of the system, but for all that it provides us, the added effort seems totally worth it. We don't dwell much on the economics or 'payback period'. We prefer instead to see it as 'we bought some equipment, installed it, and now get free electricity from the sun.'<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c4107464506767140842 title="comment permalink">2/12/16, 10:51 PM</a><br><br>

You'll let everyone else in on the secret... ;-)<br><br>Momma, thanks for the further data -- this sort of thing is extremely useful for readers who are trying to make sense of the haze of claims and counterclaims around renewable energy. <br><br>Asier, it's funny to me, too. For the humorist, the F-35 Lardbucket is the gift that just keeps on giving -- pity it isn't actually useful for any military operation other than carrying out devastating raids on the Pentagon's budget...<br><br>Sylvia, yep, a properly made leatherbound book isn't cheap; the upside is that it lasts for a very long time. There will be a trade paperback edition out eventually. <br><br>Eric, that's really good to hear. If that proves to be more generally the case -- if the implosion of the fracking bubble forces a significant number of people to see what's been in front of their faces all along -- here again, there are things that might become possible. <br><br>234567, no argument there. The expectations Americans have about technology, in particular, rise to the point that "delusions" is arguably a better term for them.<br><br>Cherokee, I'm not sure if Wordsworth didn't have children or if he kept them neatly sedated on laudanum. As for the glass window, sounds to me as though the manufacturer is shipping out inadequately tempered glass -- the plunging quality of manufactured products is a major force these days. <br><br>Dwig, you'd better hurry up and get your Continuous Carbon Sequestration to the market right away -- I know quite a few people who have proof-of-concept models already installed on their property, and I expect to see things moving ahead to plant construction as soon as spring comes around!<br><br>Tokyo, no, you got it basically right. I'll consider something along those lines down the road a bit. <br><br>DeVaul, it's like those poor schmucks who write for <i>The Onion</i> and other satire magazines, who have to come up with something more outrageous than everyday life -- and usually by the time their stories have been up for a week or two, everyday life has topped it. <br><br>Peter, of course. One of the things that the end of the industrial age means is that there will no longer be one model of human society that everybody everywhere is expected to follow. Some regions will be well suited to technic societies, and some won't; some will have agricultural societies, some nomadic pastoral societies, some hunter-gatherer societies, and some -- for example, a broad band of lifeless desert connecting the long-abandoned ruins of Las Vegas and Phoenix -- will have no human inhabitants at all. <br><br>Dragonfly, many thanks for the data points. That's just it, of course -- if your electricity needs are modest, and you live in a good location for solar, you can do very well indeed with solar energy.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c7350077831082228388 title="comment permalink">2/12/16, 11:19 PM</a><br><br>

I suspect that it is a kind of ego repair mechanism that kicks in when it becomes undeniably clear that the masses you attempt to engage simply aren't going to buy into the bs you want to push on them. Having failed to convince them after attempting to reach out and make them conform to its agenda, the ego seeks to reestablish separation and superiority while licking its wounds, now trying to convince itself that it doesn't actually need to convince the people it sought to convince. At least that is how it looks to me. Do you perhaps have a take on this, John? A timely example of this in Europe right now is how the supporters of unchecked mass immigration go very patronizing very quickly whenever the inevitable consequences show up on schedule and leads a lot of people to start asking hard questions, like the organised mass rapings in Cologne.<br><br>Dunno if this is happening a lot of places, but here the commercials belted out by the digital tech industry is also getting increasingly hostile, cornucopian and defensive.

Yup, watch the world and its worries float away... Actually when I was a kid, they used to have ads saying things like: Life is better on Bex. I even clearly remember the little blue box that it was supplied in. It looked very cheery really. And you know what, I had know idea what those things were, but I believe they were some sort of tranquiliser. Who'd have thunk it? I've never used such things as I don’t need to, but it is not as if they weren't around back then and even today. I suggested to someone once that they slip their kids a tranquiliser before a long haul flight and they looked horrified...<br><br>Sorry, I'm rambling. Just also thought that I'd second your opinion about the evacuated tube solar hot water panels. They seem very fiddly to me and I've often wondered how tough they'd be in a decent hailstorm. Probably not very well, is the answer. I use two very old school low tech flat black box with glass and copper pipes and it works fine for almost 10 months of the year. Today, the water is too hot to even touch. Ouch!<br><br>Yes, I reckon it is a huge problem and I reckon I got done on that glass, so I'm going to another supplier and going to utilise stainless steel bar to hold the glass in place rather than the more traditional steel flats. Mind you, I spotted a bridge the other week that the authorities have been doing some serious and urgent looking re-work on and it was only a year or two old...

The boss was fuming.<br><br>"Where the hell is CARR?" he shouted.<br><br>"He failed to submit his biweekly report, sir. But we believe he is still in Toledo."<br><br>"Why didn't he post his dispatch? Every two weeks. That's the deal."<br><br>"I know sir, but he didn't send it this week."<br><br>"Has anyone been able to reach him?"<br><br>"No sir.

The photograph on the front, taken from the top of Toledo's incomplete Capitol dome, showed four smiling construction workers waving to the camera. The city of Toledo was spread out behind them, with Lake Erie in the far distance. Colorful block letters in a wide arc along the top of the card read "LAKELAND BUILDS!"<br><br>He flipped the card over. In slightly tentative handwriting—the writing of a person not used to using a pen on paper—there was a short message: "All is well. —Carr."<br><br>The boss hurled the card at his secretary, shouting, "I want Carr.

Nothing to look up. <br><br>He dangled the device out over the slowly moving water of the canal. He held it there for just a moment, then shook his head and put it back in his pocket.<br><br>As he strolled slowly back to his hotel, he whistled a tune he once heard in a barbershop.<br><br>***<br><br>Here's hoping that Mr. Carr does not fail us next week.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c3981800348219715073 title="comment permalink">2/13/16, 4:56 AM</a><br><br>

If I make the bread myself, it takes at least a half hour of my (active) time, plus equipment (pans, ovens, etc), and I need to be in the house for the last 40-60 min so I can take the bread out of the oven. <br><br>Sweaters:<br>I can buy a wool sweater for less than $100. I am a few hours from finishing a knit vest, for which I spun the wool. I'm sure the material cost was less than $100, but not necessarily much cheaper, and I don't remember how long it took to spin. The wool was commercially prepared, it would have taken even longer if I had started from the sheep.<br><br>Books:<br>Trade paperbacks, in the 5-10 dollars (American) range. Hardcovers, $25-100, depending on whether or not it is a college textbook.<br>To compare, our host's leather-bound work goes for $350, and a bit of quick searching finds a lovely, leather-bound "pulpit" bible for $650.<br><br>(my assumption that price for books is approximately proportional to human labor is questionable, but I'm not going to dig any deeper.)<br><br>The predicted post industrial lifestyle, based on these data points, is going to have enough bread, just barely enough clothing, and only a couple of books to a household...

I like to travel the more back roads and see the real country, but the downside in it is possible to be stranded approximately 150 miles from where the nearest used transmission could be located.<br><br>A little buttonholing of locals at a fuel station found me a good mechanic who got the dog and me into a decent motel and took the truck to his shop and began looking for the parts. I was surprised he was willing to drop everything at 5pm and jump on my job till I saw his shop the next day. He said he normally likes to keep about a 2-week backlog, but the shop was empty. He had time yesterday to make the drive to Lubbock and get the transmission.<br><br>It seems to be much the same story along the main highway strip that makes up the economic hub around here. A lot of closed businesses. The side streets, where the people mostly live, appears pretty derelict, also. I have not seen the downtown, or any subdivisions within walking distance, so my data set is as yet incomplete, but plan to explore when I troubleshoot the job.<br><br>Then this morning I walked the dog over to the edge of town, just a few blocks from my motel. There I beheld a fully-loaded train, about half of my view in one direction, and as far as I could see in the other, with very strange looking cars.

I saw it being done in the old country. A long time ago my parents took us there to visit. I was still a kid but old enough to form solid memories.<br><br>While most of the clan had left the farms for either nearby towns or the Americas, some stayed. And we visited my parents' old farms. Nobody lived there anymore, tools and implements pretty much where my parents left them.<br><br>What I saw in those hills were small farms, ancient two storey stone houses, farm animals on the ground floor, the family's living quarters upstairs. No central heat, no natural gas, no electricity, no refrigeration and no running water. No machines, no tractors. Everything was human or animal powered. They cooked using heat from stone fireplaces and pumped water by hand from a well. No radio, no TV, no newspapers. Most people of my parents's generation got just a few years of schooling.<br><br>City dwellers tend to have a rosy view of farm living. They picture robust, ruddy cheeked people happily labouring in the fields, farm wives and little ones milking cows and raising chickens and pigs. And lots of fresh air and sunshine.<br><br>One way or another we're going back to a life of low energy consumption so we need a clear eyed look at what's ahead. Because what characterized this early 20th century agricultural life was malnutrition, sickness, death in childhood and in child-birth, unaffordable or unavailable medical care. <br><br>A simple case of diarrhea, that is, maladies that are easy to cure here and now, could well have been a death sentence back then. My dad said that if a farmer was lucky enough to make it into his sixties he'd be toothless and bent.<br><br>No need to do a recitation of 20th century European history but if I had to put it into just a couple words I would say those were times of anger and despair, these sentiments rooted in living conditions. And a source for these woes being an abusive landlord-ruling class. Sound familiar? Some things never change.

But, hard numbers are lacking. I’m not aware of any rigorously generated scenario detailing a credible plan aimed at snuffing out GHGs while simultaneously keeping our wall sockets juiced and our vehicles moving. So, if such a scenario (tipping the scales to favor success in areas of genuine uncertainty) could still fail to forecast that happy landing, your viewpoint could stand on firm ground. <br> <br>Absent this hypothetical scenario, your views – and historical analogs – have persuaded me that the energy baton pass won’t be a clean one. But at this juncture, I refuse to slam the door on the feasibility of sustainable energy delivery picking up the load, if perhaps a bit tardily. The incentives are enormous, and proving a negative is a hazardous errand. But I am doubting whether saving our energy-driven lifestyles would be wise. Even if this new energy delivery system were environmentally benign and as cheap as it now is (forgetting today’s externalities), where would we be? With such energy available with the flip of a switch, we could still hunt rhinos to extinction, we would be depleting our water tables, we would be paving over the lands of the indigenous people and the remaining wildlife, and we would bekilling our enemies with WMDs instead of clubs. No, I think we have amply proven we can’t handle such amplification of our ability to carry out our urges. I think it’s a good thing that we will have burned through nature’s “firewater” before we can totally wreck the place. As we deal with this hangover, and no booze is left in the cabinet, a galaxy of challenges unfolds: physical survival skills, and how to treat one another in the reshuffled world. Tragically, many innocents will become collateral damage in the reshuffling.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c3996427694518276605 title="comment permalink">2/13/16, 8:59 AM</a><br><br>

I am also well aware that as a profession, the trade's days are numbered, but hopefully not before I can taper off into some sort of genteel retirement and train to become a crusty zen curmudgeon, as opposed to working till they pry my withered claw from my mouse and wheel my rigored frame from my workstation. But I have been watching the slow degradation of collapse for the majority of working Americans from a front row seat. I think your recent analysis of a separation of classes by welfare, wage, salary and investment is astute. And correct, the wage class has been devastated. I collapsed from salary to wage class post 9/11 when I lost a quite comfortable Senior Art Director post in a 30% contraction of design and professional services in the NYC area following the attack. I have since been largely full time freelancing. That might be a separate small subclass, but most of my work is on an hourly rate. <br><br>I gave up that front row seat, bailing to Berkely Speings, so long as I have a roof, access to the 'Net and 'lectricity, I could keep working, if scaling down. Provided of course that we condense our lifestyles. So we are, a little at a time. <br><br>But reading down these comments I realize that for the majority of Americans, the renewable bubble is ALREADY OUT OF REACH. Even with tax credits or subsidies, they just do not have the financial resources to put in photovoltaics or extensive wind systems. These people are already dirt poor and have largely been hammered out of technological society. The affluent folks able to make the investment in high tech renewables are, in general, not the least bit interested in giving up on their consumptive lifestyles. <br><br>Our political system is ill-positioned to addressing it in any meaningful way. There is not a candidate alive at either end of our conservaliberal corporatist party that will get a microsecond of traction running on "collapse gracefully." Furthermore, any such candidate would be swiftly punished by their corporate sponsors who have not the slit east interest in ending the gravy train of government subsidy much less dismantling their own system. The wealthy will fight tooth and nail and expend fortunes to preserve their wealth, privilege, political power and extravagant lifestyles. <br><br>But there are consequences for impoverishing the vast press of the people. Market destruction. The corporations depend on having a market to purchase their good and services. While they busily rush to impoverish their own workers in the name of profit, they rely on their markets being "other, more affluent people" (certainly not their own low wage employees) But when too many companies follow this strategy, there aren't really <i>enough</i> of these fabled "other, more affluent people" to go around and keep the whole ponzi pyramid inflated. If a pack of sharks eat all the trout in the swimming pool, all the sharks starve, <i>all at once.</i>. <br><br>People reduced to paying rent, buying subsistence food (beef is nearly gone from our menus), and gas to and from work, are not in any position to invest in high tech solar or wind tech. For the most part these folk largely rent, and don't even have the option. As the salary class is being increasingly degraded from the bottom, this bubble could be particularly short lived, as the market is not vast. <br><br>As for Paul Krugman, he is rather old,school, favoring pre-reagan economics, but you don't get a Noble prize is you can't do the math. So he still shown more relative sanity than most of the rah-rah cheerleaders for the Wall Street cabals than most and ocassional flashes or reality grounded relevance.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c1267750246485728876 title="comment permalink">2/13/16, 9:52 AM</a><br><br>

I started paying attention to peak oil in early 2012, and at the time The Oil Drum was full of predictions about how fracking was likely to run into geological problems very quickly that would cause the boom to be a relative non-event. Specifically, fracked wells decline much more rapidly than normal wells, so in order to keep boosting production, an ever-increasing number of wells would have to be drilled (the so-called "Red Queen" problem). Further, they'd run the sweet spots out preferentially and quickly end up trying to produce oil from more marginal areas. The net effect would be that the boom would be short-lived because of physical constraints, and we wouldn't even approach the old 1970 peak in production.<br><br>This turned out to be completely wrong. There actually was plenty of shale oil worth extracting at $100/bbl, more than enough to beat the Red Queen for years. US production rocketed up to nearly its all-time peak in 1970. There's still probably enough to have kept production skyrocketing for years past 2014, had oil stayed around $100. The real constraint turned out to be that the Saudis really don't like competition, and deliberately glutted the oil market even at the price of having to cut back on the lavish subsidies to their people that keep them afloat. Of course it's likely that the frackers might have triggered a glut all on their own a couple of years later even if the Saudis had cut back like usual. But even then, the economic constraints would likely happen well before the physical ones. The physical constraints are still real, but more distant than the economic ones.<br><br>I agree with you about solar PV and wind. Once gas producers like Chesapeake go out of business for good, prices for electricity will start to rise again, adding to the already substantial subsidies for wind and solar PV. Suddenly these will start looking like more attractive investments, and Wall Street's spigots will turn on. A solar and wind boom will begin, and even the big oil companies will get in on the action. There will be a bunch of articles about the renewable revolution and the "bright green" types will pat themselves on the back and squeal with delight. They'll hop in their Teslas and go for long drives, safe in the knowledge that a somewhat higher proportion of the electricity in their batteries comes from solar and wind than used to. But then the surge of renewables will glut the electricity market, especially in the crucial peak times in midday where solar production is at its highest. This has already happened in places like Germany that reach something like 10% PV: the spot prices for midday electricity now sometimes crash to 0, squeezing the producers. Then of course there will be a messy wave of defaults, and the cycle starts anew with thorium reactors or something.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c440545325055670710 title="comment permalink">2/13/16, 11:16 AM</a><br><br>

How about "bigger" and NASA technology? For example, "Sandia (a NASA lab) sizes up Wind Turbine Design"-http://www.designnews.com/document.asp?doc_id=230008 . This is ok, but to raise not megabucks but real money, we need a hook, a visual--something with sex appeal.<br> <br>My google-fu fails me, but I remember a story about a whole different kind of Wind Generator. The inventor, the "guy who invented John Glenn's space helmet", just stacked wing sections up to the sky, and let them go up and down in opposed pairs* and left the generating equipment on the ground. (*You don't want net lift on a large structure in heavy wind. Trust me). The wing sections could be built with high tech materials like wood and fabric.<br><br>But for me, I would add in another, umm, "growth" industry. If we build this in multimegawattt size, we get the "wind shear" problem, where the wind direction is different at the top than the bottom. We could solve this problem by hanging the wing sections from a very large central shaft and let each pair be pointed separately. Now visualize the result in motion--it looks like a four hand treat your salaryman would pay a whole months wages for!

Or it would be sodium-sulfur batteries, and similarly, peak Sulfur! <br><br>If I were making recommendations for retrotopia, I'd probably tell them to go with nickel-iron batteries.

I'm going to remember your kind advice when future crises arise. For global warming, Mothra might be useful.<br><br>@Everyone, yesterday the replacement unit was outside snorting, grunting and rooting around like a boar in the garden, and it (i.e., I) got a subtle, yet unmistakable sensation, a sort of "oomph" (that's all I can say to describe it) that says "spring!" This is the moment each year when the plants start going at it. I always try to get outside at noon on any sunny day in winter, so I frequently catch it. It is an uplifting, powerful sensation. the opposite of "depression." The day before, the weather reporter had said "Haru Ichiban?" (first gale of spring). It had already warmed a bit, but not that much, and this was before the gales arrived, overnight. And it'll freeze again and again until May, but spring is here and the plants and I all know about it. And darn! I didn't schedule my misogi until Friday! I'll move it up to Monday. Spring is here.<br><br>I think this is what Stephen Harrod Buhner was talking about in his "Secret Teachings of Plants." If you don't spend lots of time outside with plants, and if you've never heard about it, you'll miss this vital part of life. This relates very strongly to happiness, as my friend Tony Boys keeps trying to get people to appreciate. I think people dismiss this because they have no experience on the personal level that they can relate to. It is said that the sensation is experienced with the heart, literally, not the brain. I think that's why I experience it as "oomph."<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c4664515536990822343 title="comment permalink">2/13/16, 5:30 PM</a><br><br>

I'm a physical trainer, and I focus on strength training, especially for older and beat-up folk, so I have a profession which is very useful to help people prefer for a reduced-energy world, but which would not itself be viable in that world, or maybe only in a different form (like the 19th century gyms, hmm now there's a thought). I'm 44, so I'm fairly confident I can stay employed for a while longer, given that collapse is not an instant process. <br><br>I was working at a gym 30' drive away, now it's 20 steps to my garage. This has meant I've gone from filling the car every 10 days to every 60 (at most). Of course home electricity consumption is up a bit since I'm home more, but in energy terms it's overall less. <br><br>Old consumption:<br>Car, 38lt or 338kWh per 10 days = 3.4kWh/day equivalent <br>Home, 5kWh/day<br>Sum 8.4kWh/day<br><br>New consumption<br>Car, 38lt per 60 days = 0.6kWh/day<br>Home, 6kWh/day<br>Sum, 6.4kWh/day<br><br>Obviously it could be lower, but - well, in the gym I tell people about the weight on the bar, "progress is progress." But here we might say, "regress is regress." <br><br>It's saved us money as you suggested, not only from reduced fuel costs (note, average fuel price was $1.31/lt, which is about 15c/kWh, compared to electricity costs of about 30c/kWh - petrol is too cheap!), but also reduced childcare. And of course, I believe this has improved our quality of life - being my own boss, more time with son, the house being cleaner, etc. <br><br>Many people focus on earning more for a better life, but sometimes earning less to free up time for other people and things can make life better anyway. Likewise, I think, energy consumption... My son has more fun splashing under a hose than sitting watching tv with the aircon on. <br><br>And even if you just care about money, spend $1,000 less, earn $1,000 more, the balance is the same... main difference is, you are not taxed on reduced spending.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c8193860460887731266 title="comment permalink">2/14/16, 4:18 AM</a><br><br>

It's waste-not-want-not day in my kitchen, where I go about trying to use up the week's odds and ends instead of letting them go to the compost, animals, or garbage prematurely. I had planned to steam some beets that had been lingering in the crisper bin, but remembered that the sun oven sitting on my back porch still works at surprisingly low temperatures (relatively speaking- we're not freezing around here in northern CA this week), as long as it's sunny. It just takes longer, both to heat up and to bake. I just usually don't think to use it except in the summer, when I don't want to add any additional heat to the kitchen. Thanks to the continuing kick in the pants from the good folks here on ADR, I decided to haul it out, wipe it off, and start using it again, even though it will probably take hours for those beets to be steamy-good, rather than the 15 minutes or so if I were burning propane to get the job done. That's OK, they weren't getting any younger in the fridge either. I'll just eat them with dinner instead of lunch. <br><br>Obviously, three beets and some small quantity of propane saved doesn't add up to much, but changing unthinking habits and adjusting expectations *can* matter, over time.

I think we need to look at exactly how these figures are determined to get useful insight. The easiest way to make that claim is to calculate "national energy use / population", right? But that's only a lower bound on the personal energy consumption. We also need to think about industrial energy (e.g., the energy used to extract energy!), and commercial energy (e.g., air conditioning the Wal-marts). If Europeans don't drill for oil, dig for coal, or refine ores into useful metal, their personal habits could be exactly like North Americans', and the statistic would mislead us regarding their virtue. And then there's the military-industrial-complex, which consumes vast amounts of energy on forging armor-plate, tank turbines, exotic materials for military aircraft, etc. And then, they burn more hydrocarbons for training, transportation, and operations. If we're to have significant impact on national energy consumption, we'll have to address these consumers, as well as our own individual consumption habits.<br><br>Lately, statistics have been released showing that Americans have become more energy efficient: higher GDP per BTU (or something like that), and the claim is that we create value through "the services economy". If/when (they imply) the rest of the world reaches our exalted state, we can all be "richer" on less energy. Of course, this just ignores the fact that a lot of the energy-intense industries have simply left for Asia, and we import the "embedded energy" of their steel, chemicals, plastics, etc. Shame on them for burning all that dirty coal, to produce the steel we buy!<br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c9043816296685545564 title="comment permalink">2/14/16, 5:41 PM</a><br><br>

Electrical power is measured in Watts, and power is the product of current (in amperes) times voltage (volts): P=I*V. So, you deliver the same power (120W) with 10 A * 12V, or 1A * 120V. When the current passes through a resistance (R), the power (heat) is I*I*R resistance. (Also, if you have an ideal voltage source, like a power grid, the current will be equal to the voltage / resistance, so you could save P=V*V/R. However, a PV panel is not an ideal voltage source.)<br><br>The wire between your power source and your load device has some resistance (Rw), and the power wasted will be I*I*Rw. If you need to supply 120W at 12V, you need to drive 10A through the wire, but only 1A at 120V, so the loss is either 100*Rw or 1*Rw. If Rw is 1 ohm, that's either 100W or 1W wasted. If you have a 12V source, and waste 100W in the wiring, you only have 20W left to do anything useful (and only 2V at the load). If you design the system to actually deliver 120W, your source needs to put 22V into the wiring to get 12V to the load. <br><br>I chose 1 ohm of resistance to make the math simple and dramatic, but you can have 1 ohm in 600 feet of #12 copper wire (typically used for house wiring). If instead it's 30 feet from your power source to your 120W load (60' total), the resistance is just 0.1 ohm, so the losses are 10W and 0.1W for 12V and 120V. Maybe you can tolerate losing 8% (delivering 11V instead of 12V), but it's actually more efficient to convert the solar panel DC voltage to AC, transform it to a higher voltage, and rectify it back to DC at the higher voltage, than to just transport it at 12VDC.<br><br>On my grid-tied rooftop solar system, in fact, each of 21 panels has a power conditioning unit which adapts to the current local conditions to absorb the optimum amount of power such that when all 21 panels add their voltages together, it will add up to the 600VDC that the inverter is designed to accept. This means that the 6 kW {name-plate capacity} inverter never gets more than 10ADC, rather than 500A at 12 VDC. It also means that any one, two, or even 20 panels can be taken out of service and the system should keep working, though at lower capacity. The two functions of "optimum power point tracking" and "grid interface" are done in separate units.<br><br>*Optimum power point tracking: the more current you draw from a PV cell, the lower its voltage is. Max voltage is zero current -&gt; zero power. Max current is zero voltage -&gt; zero power. Somewhere in between, depending on sun angle and clouds (and even snow accumulation), is the optimum compromise.<br><br>120W might have been merely one bright light bulb 30 years ago, but we can get by with much less power for lighting now, and for entertainment, but heating and cooling appliances still demand hundreds of watts power.<br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c2746288655940923737 title="comment permalink">2/14/16, 6:19 PM</a><br><br>

The only harm in letting generation credits expire is that they're a gift to the utility, which one might have used instead to run an electric heating system.

It's clearly a good opportunity for DIYing, and a good place to start applying JMG's principle that if you want to have access to some particular technology in the future, learn that technology. Unfortunately that can't extend to making your own solar cells or LED emitters, but assembling the system components is a good starting point, and learning to design power supply circuits, charge controllers, etc. from basic or salvaged components, to adapt or repair devices, is possible if you can follow a good textbook e.g. Horowitz and Hill.<br><br>Of course, being worth the cost doesn't require achieving costs per kWh that beat the electric company at today's prices. There's additional value in the resilience (either entirely off grid or as backup), the experience managing limited energy "funds and flows," and hedging against future rises in power costs. I've mentioned before that if you turn on a flashlight with AA alkaline batteries in it, you're paying somewhere between one hundred and three hundred dollars per kWh. If price per unit of output were the only issue, those things would never be able to compete against grid power, and yet every store sells them.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c2555847254160178512 title="comment permalink">2/14/16, 6:41 PM</a><br><br>

When I claimed mine, there was a form that had to be submitted by a "certified PV installation electrician". Maybe that's part of the "green jobs" scheme: solar power creates jobs, not just in (mostly off-shore) manufacturing, but in installation, and in TRAINING of installers, and in MANAGING the certification of installers and installer trainers, etc. Or maybe it's part of the incentives: "hey, electricians - if you pay to get certified, you won't have to compete against uncertified electricians and DIYers". Most likely, I think, it's just part of getting the utility companies to go along, without assuming unbounded risk from improper installations of grid-tied systems. Tying into the grid (which is the only way we're going to charge those electric cars, of course) without risking its safety and reliability is kind of important.<br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c3559646195105515759 title="comment permalink">2/15/16, 4:31 AM</a><br><br>

In the most recent agrarian past as well as in later industrial times, Britain’s rapidly growing urban population became notorious for poor health. Rapidly growing London from 16th to 19thC simply 'ate' infants and children of all classes rich and poor alike, (mostly because of infectious disease), though people continued to migrate to the city. Even in 20thC industrial times when control of infections – public hygiene, immunisation - vastly improved, British working class (i.e. an urban large majority) continued to experience frequent poverty, which was and continues to be critical for lifetime health. For example, army conscription for WW1 etc showed-up average poor health in 18 year olds. On construction sites, recruitment of robust young men from rural Eire was a commonplace even in my early years. (Poverty is inadequate money, income, livelihood – at the extreme it manifests as ‘pauperisation’.)<br><br>I suspect therefore that frequent poverty has been perhaps the main reason for lifetime ill-health in both agrarian and urban contexts. Without any 'wide-area' ameliorating system of 'insurance' and ‘trade’, then subsistence or semi-subsistence farming is very risky. There must be continuity of nutritious food – there is evidence that given even a very modest sufficiency of calories, green vegetables are key; more so than ‘protein’. And there must be necessary farming resources - seeds, tools etc. and in most contexts a way to pay for them. True self-sufficiency farming with adequate nutrition is pretty much a myth unless there is a special case of sufficient recourse to wild food to back-up a mix of vegetable gardening and staple food production using very local tools; for example gardening in a beneficent rain forest. Without that ‘natural’ back-up, agrarian economy always needs a secondary craft and trade economy along with secure enough regional storage, and also needs I think financial or other kinds of organised access? Farmers in historical agrarian civilisations as a rule needed to borrow; (Solon's reforms; debt Jubilees anyone?).<br><br>best<br>Phil<br><br><br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c7259662825978342412 title="comment permalink">2/15/16, 6:17 AM</a><br><br>

Thinking about electricity generation and use, on-grid, off-grid, hybrid grid, pros and cons, difficulties and positives, solar and wind, I became overwhelmed realizing that this is not an area of any sort of expertise on my part with the exception of standard conservation, i.e., turn off when not in use, dimmers on lights, timers on heaters, then bring in the solar garden lights and locate that hand crank radio when the electricity is out and wait patiently for it to come back on.<br>There is so much to know and learn and habits to change, it can be horribly discouraging. And I started to drift into a mental pattern of thinking that it’s okay if I don’t know how to set up an off-grid solar array, that I know about other things, that somehow my ignorance would protect me from the consequences of not having the skill set to establish a household energy system, that somehow I could get a pass on this one, everything would be fine. This produced a deep emotional comfort until my inner archdruid (have we not all developed an inner archdruid after so many years of reading the ADR?) chimed in to say that not knowing, not learning, not changing, not developing some sort of resilience in this area would not protect me at all. If the grid goes down and I don’t have other means of power generation, then I will be living quite simply in a house with no electricity at all. Reality stings, yes indeed. There really is no degree of exceptionalism and there is no excuse or level of bargaining that will allow any escape from the realities of the future. Thank you for a stunning, thought provoking essay and comments this week. It’s been particularly juicy for me.<br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c5258918909701844115 title="comment permalink">2/15/16, 10:35 AM</a><br><br>

But as tide is changing freqently, a lot of outcome will be there anyway. However any way we will reach the limits of growth, from which is coming unavoidably collapse and thereafter a compulsory simplification of life.<br><br>I imagine there will be one or several million years of human existence on earth still to come. So there is time for many turns. As we had in 10.000 years a thousand civilisations and cultures revolving. For how many more there is still space in time to play around. Lots!<br><br>I feel, that one religious order to go trough the centuries to come, will be one in the fashion of Isaak Asimov´s historian society. Safekeeping the wisdom of sience and understanding of human behavior, to influence the shape of future human societies. So my hope and desire is to partake a little in its making.<br><br>Joseph Tainter is influencing me much. His repeating matrix of history as a texture of humans organising ourself is also helpful. I understand him saying, that societies, who get too good in problem solving via enlarging complexity, do stumble in the end over their own feet. The succes is the initial for their demise.<br><br>A faszinating example here for me is Teotihuacán. The greatest of the Mezoamerican civilisations. Yet misted in history. Only their stones are telling us some of their story. One of their successes has been their effective acriculture, strongly assisted from their vulcanic habitat.<br>Its attractivity spreading 1000 cilometres at least. People pilgrimed and settled there from far and wide. At the peak of its popularity it began declining and perished finally. So its success became the source of its demise.<br><br>That turns me to the question, what factors tend to produce better conditions in agrarian societies. There are many, as we had plenty of flourishing agrarian societies. Yet some of them succesfull agrarian society got blown up from their initial success and toppled. Beside there are also enduringly stable agrarian society like the Neuguinean higlanders keeping a sort of cultural unity in diversity.<br><br>What I want to say, is, that we humans tend to stability and to success (aka wealth and plenty of stuff). But often stability contradicts success and vice versa. We humans might be not as brainy as believed, but we are resilient. So we will continue to live, prosper, die and be born again.

As it was originally theorized, you can think of electricity as some sort of fluid, like compressed air or water, that's able to flow through solid metal. "Voltage" is another name for the pressure that's pushing electricity through the wire. "Current" is the flow of fluid; it's how many electrons pass through the wire per second. "Voltage" is named after a scientist named "Volta". Current is named after one named Ampere. (Spend some time reading about the lives and times these men!)<br><br>Resistance is the word we use to describe the relationship between pressure and flow: I = V / R (more resistance means less current; more voltage means more current). (Just to be confusing, some authors refer to voltage as "E": electromotive force. "I" is used for current because it is "Induced flow".) A "resistor" is analogous to a restriction in the water pipe: the pressure is higher on one side than on the other, and the greater the flow, the greater the pressure difference.<br><br>(By the way, just when you think you're getting comfortable with these equations, you're likely to discover that, in general, the quantities are actually measured with complex numbers (vectors). I guess that's kind of the boundary between electricians and electrical engineers.)<br><br>It's too bad you didn't study physics when you had the chance in school! You'll never know how many ways it might have become important to you later in life.<br><br>As for something to read, I recommend any of the annually-updated versions of the "ARRL Handbook" for amateur radio (the exact title varies, but this is a good search string.

I would point out that in most places today it is not possible to fund the production of basic goods, as you have pointed out yourself for your own town, let alone any major infrastructure. At the same time there seem to be plenty available for pointless speculation, luxury housing that few can afford, office buildings that are mostly empty, destroying foreign countries, flying Edsels for the Pentagon, etc...<br><br>Its obvious that "The Economy" assign resources in a warped and irrational fashion and in a way that satisfies the priorities of a blinkered elite. Under the current system of manipulation and deceit, does anyone know the real cost and value of anything with any certainty?<br><br>On collapse, I would point to Pennsylvania. During the 50s and 60s it was an industrial powerhouse bigger than Germany, today its a scrapyard with its society showing the same sort of social collapse that is seen in many indian reservations. Of course the above will never be reported in the press and the elites are so blinkered that they don't see the importance of this. For Pennsylvania collapse is history, not the future.<br><br>As for fracking I see it as something like industrial agriculture, a testimony to the modern ability of combining the maximum expenditure of resources with minimum real production of value, what would be called value reducing activity. This is how resource consumption and economic numbers go up while actual living standards go down. The wonders of Progress, more scrap, more slums, more beggars. Isn't Progress supposed to be about more of everything? :)<br><br>For all practical purpose America has undergone economic collapse with that being concealed by an imperial tribute economy that propping up the elites and its clients, its now undergoing social collapse and political collapse is not far away. In my readings of history economic and social collapse precede political collapse since social strength is the foundation of power, remove the base and the rest goes.<br>America is now in a condition where a crisis or defeat that would have been shrugged off in its prime will trigger a major political crisis.<br><br>For building a more durable system, were not going to know what can be done until the current dysfunctional imperial system has been scrapped and that will not occur volutarily since this means the shutdown of the rent income of the middle class and the elites. The middle classes will crash suddenly to the level of the working class and much of the elite will experience the fate of William Crapo Durant who founded GM, was worth 4 b$ in the 1920s, was ruined in the depression and died in 1947 with his probate totaling $100.<br><br>Keep up the good work!<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c1662132341170040981 title="comment permalink">2/15/16, 3:06 PM</a><br><br>

Stay with me for this one. What I take away from this week's post is that although we may be able to power our homes in future (at least for awhile), that there is no source that can power all our industries that make all the goods and services that we use. Whole industries would have to be wound up and then cannibalized for their residual resources.<br><br> Now consider - for decades countries such as America have shut down their industrial companies and shipped them overseas for profit. America's industrial base has been gutted. When the collapse comes, most of the industries that would have to shut down have already done so a long time ago. The disruption of all that has already been gone through. A cynic would say mission accomplished!<br><br> As well, millions of workers would find their places of work gone and would have to scramble for a living - or starve! At the moment however, millions of American workers have already removed themselves from the official employment rolls. They have not just rolled over and died, you know. They have simply given up on a broken system and gone to try to make a place for themselves in the unofficial economy. When the collapse comes, these workers are already set and can perhaps help the other workers make the transition to a post-industrial economy.<br><br> You know what really riles me? When I was a kid and saw dystopian societies in movies I used to wonder how the people could not notice that they were living in one. How could they get used to it?

The equations are exactly the same. The geometry is different, because we generally think of heat flowing through surfaces, which are much wider than they are thick, while electricity flows through wires, which are long, skinny things, but that doesn't really matter. An insulated wall consists of several layers of thermal resistance: an air boundary layer, interior surface, insulating fill, exterior sheathing, and exterior air boundary. Each has a thermal resistance, and the total thermal resistance of the wall is their sum. The heat flow (in BTU/hour, perhaps) is just the difference in temperature (analogous to hydraulic pressure or circuit voltage) divided by the resistance.<br><br>Sometimes it's easier to consider the reciprocal of resistance, conductance, whether we're talking electrical or thermal. When you have parallel paths, such as a wall, a window, and a door, each with a different resistance, convert the resistance to conductance, and the conductances can be added together to get the overall conductance of the room. Take the reciprocal of that to find the overall thermal resistance of the room.<br><br>You can use these calculations to figure out the most cost-effective insulation upgrades. Compare the heat flow through a ceiling vs. the flow through a window. Windows typically have relatively little resistance to heat flow, especially if they're just a single layer of glass. But the ceiling has a much greater area. So, which upgrade will minimize your energy consumption? Or, to put it another way, which one will leave you the most comfortable when we run out of heating fuel?<br><br>Math! It predicts the future, conditioned on our ability to use it wisely. But perhaps that's a topic for the other blog.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c232775244688286529 title="comment permalink">2/16/16, 7:10 AM</a><br><br>

It is apparent, from the current situation in oil extraction, that there may not be a graceful transition between "pump the wells you have, no matter how low the price", and "it's going to be a few years (at best) before we can get new wells, no matter how high the price." The current financial system (or maybe it's just the attitudes of short-sighted management, encouraged by the financial system) does not do long-term planning. When, as now, oil and gas are cheap, why would anyone invest in the solar power infrastructure that we'll need when oil and gas become expensive? It's not good for the quarterly profit reports!<br> <br>I don't find it particularly significant that we don't see "solar-powered solar panel production". In the marketplace, most buyers don't look past the price tag. If cheap hydrocarbons can be used to make a solar panel 5% cheaper (just to pull a number out of the air, unsupported by research), then even if the solar EROEI is positive enough to support production, it won't be positive enough to compete for sales. <br> <br>Personally, if I knew that my PV system had a guaranteed break-even date 20 years from now, that would be enough to justify getting them. However, there's some risk of unexpected maintenance expenses, and subsidies help cover that. With all of the incentives received and expected, I should break-even in 7 years.<br><br>This is not to argue that Business As Usual can be sustained with alt-energy. As others have noted, some uses of electricity are so appealing that we'll pay hundreds of times the current rate (that is, buy alkaline batteries) to support those uses. Solar panels from solar-powered factories may end up costing as much as these batteries, and we'll still be glad we have them.<br><br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c1513357160402035405 title="comment permalink">2/16/16, 7:54 AM</a><br><br>

Most of the area north of me has seen large population declines as the coalfields were depleted, leaving lots of abandoned industrial equipment and dilapidated company houses (now covered in cheap vinyl siding) that were definitely not intended to last as long as they have. There's actually a whole town called Centralia that was abandoned because the coal in mines under the town caught on fire. Holes in the ground routinely open and it's definitely not somewhere you'd want to live. Sound familiar from Star's Reach? Also, the houses are gone but the streets are still paved, leading to an equally erie resemblance to Detroit in Star's Reach. Of course people in many towns and urban areas (like the one I live in) that were never dependent on mining or logging have maintained a middle class american lifestyle thanks to the American overseas wealth pump.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c2556392701471577942 title="comment permalink">2/16/16, 12:00 PM</a><br><br>

I am a long-time reader but first time poster today. An engineering academic in the UK, this blog and others such as Tom Murphy’s Do the Math have been very influential in developing my views in recent years, and my engineering judgement is that the stance that JMG and Tom take is substantially correct – but I feel I am in rather a minority voice among many of my peers who still retain a confidence in a techno-centric future!<br><br>Another author who has influenced me in recent years is William (Bill) Janeway, who writes of the role of bubbles in his book "Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy". If I understand him correctly Janeway says that we do not achieve transformative change by making economically rational judgements about investment (the uncertainties in transformative change are too great). We do so by investing for strategic reasons (e.g. the German autobahns in the 1930s) or for prestige, national development or security (the French railway system, the US transcontinental railroad or the interstate highway system, the French nuclear plants) or we invest through bubbles (the British railway system, the Internet at the end of the last century and so on). At the end of a bubble many investors have lost their shirts but we may be left with a new and valuable network. So Janeway says that not all bubbles are bad, and I hope if we are having a 'renewables bubble' it will at least leave us with a useful network of resources.<br><br>I quite agree however that renewables will not remotely provide the level of energy supply to maintain our industrial society at current or projected rates of consumption, and certainly studies like ZeroCarbonBritain by the UK Centre for Alternative Technology (http://zerocarbonbritain.org) assume very significant reductions in consumption to go along with a shift to renewables. I completely agree that this means lifestyle changes and<br>using different technologies - in fact a complete redesign of the artificial world - but instead much of the current discourse I hear talks of adding a further layer of technological complexity in smart cities, smart grids, autonomous systems etc.<br><br>On the discussion of historic patterns of energy consumption in the UK, I think Gandhi got it right when he said, on visiting the UK in 1928, "God forbid that India should ever take to industrialisation after the manner of the west. The economic imperialism of a single<br>tiny island kingdom is today keeping the world in chains. If an entire nation of 300 million took to similar economic exploitation, it would strip the world bare like locusts."<br><br>JMG please feel free to edit if you think this is too long.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c6446944121264377068 title="comment permalink">2/16/16, 1:06 PM</a><br><br>

So, yes, heat loss thru conduction has that relationship, depends on amount of insulation and temp difference. Convective losses vary due to pressure differences and due to things we do to impede convective currents (ie, fiberglass battings in walls are there to stop/slow down convection loops inside the walls. A closed valance on top of the curtains keeps convection loop from going across the glass of the window, etc...) radiative losses are slowed down by reflection, the shiny coating on modern windows, closing any type of curtain so that the room has a barrier to the dark night sky, painting a roof white to NOT get as much radiative heat, painting a batch hot water tank black TO get more radiative heat....<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c7900841596077909949 title="comment permalink">2/16/16, 4:47 PM</a><br><br>

Wind power is literally the biggest invader of rural scenery this century. It can't be rightfully compared to old mining scars, which tend to conglomerate in known regions and are hidden by topography in many cases. Even fracking is physically much smaller and that land can be restored (at least above ground). Wind power is now all over the place where the wind happens to blow. This is unforeseen blight with an unrivaled vertical footprint and horizontal spread over thousands of acres per "farm." The current 250,000 turbines that litter the world are slated to grow to several million in starry-eyed scenarios.<br><br>To embrace wind power, one must cynically decide that the last remnants of natural &amp; bucolic scenery are expendable, or pretend that rows of huge machines are "beautiful" based on a hypothetical utopia where nature takes a backseat to Man. Some of us will never stomach those attitudes. Wind turbines are routinely built on prominent mountain ridges to catch the most wind, and the apathy with with that destruction is allowed is chilling to watch. I have no idea how it became known as "green" but people have made big mistakes before.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c8831362916135523555 title="comment permalink">2/16/16, 6:48 PM</a><br><br>

While walking the aisles in the grocery some of them had just recently been relaid with merchandise with all the items "fronted and faced", as is done in retail. I was astounded at the reduction of variety of items. This particular store has always had an enormous selection of cookies--domestic brand names we all recognize and many imports.<br>The cookies have always moved well, but the cookie aisle I estimate to be less than half of its former size. I thought that this might be a logical retail decision, but I kept getting to areas where the same thing was true. The volume of merchandise seemed the same, but the selection was greatly reduced.<br>I ran into a lady whom I did not know who excused herself for cutting me off with her shopping cart and I took the opportunity to ask her if she had noticed the same thing I had. She had indeed and said it had been going on for a few weeks. I live out of town and go in that store never more than twice per month and some months not at all, so I had not noticed it before.<br>Our conversation turned to the economy and she told me that she believes that people are now being very careful in their shopping, but my hunch is that there is less in the pipeline than there was in the past. I have noticed that since the Chinese bought Smithfield that hams seem only to be available at the holidays. <br>I suppose I am getting paranoid in my seniority but I wonder if there really is a nefarious connection between Walmart and the US government? Are the soon to be vacated Walmart stores to be turned into human holding pens as is alleged on the internet? We all know the direction this is taking and I believe the next few years are going to be unlike any we have ever seen.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c7070849048650021204 title="comment permalink">2/16/16, 8:57 PM</a><br><br>

The world's 1%, that is, not just the American 1%. Industrial society is not going away quickly. But boom-bust cycles and resulting economic dislocations are going to increase inequality. As the American 99% starts to slide into the lifestyle of the worldwide 99% we'll wonder why and most people will blame other people. Social cohesion fraying and all that.<br>I think Soylent Green is a far too accurate portrayal of our future, circa the latter 25 years of this century, if TPTB don't start a nuclear holocaust, or if nuclear fusion doesn't become a reality. The 1% of the Soylent Green society had all the luxuries, although even there the building manager admitted that the cameras no longer worked because the company went out of business years before.<br>But your point still stands. There was never enough fossil fuel energy to provide an American middle class lifestyle to the entire world by the time the American middle class lifestyle became an "ideal" (post-WWII). Oh but Americans will reap what they have sown, they complain about the 1% now, not realizing they ARE the real 1%, and stand to lose all of it within a generation or so.<br>Elysium is another fiction that is possible. The global 1% perpetuating a high-tech industrial lifestyle on the backs of the 99% (slavery reborn). I remember the "feel good" ending to that movie, thinking, great, now everyone is a citizen of Elysium, but this will all grind to a halt within weeks once the resources are depleted. Elysium will be ransacked, drained, overrun, and as wretched as the planet beneath shortly.<br>We will have to wait and see. I, for one, am supportive of the 1% (in the resource-shortage scenario) as a matter of necessity. To allow some humans to have all the comforts of industrial technology is to maintain the ability for someone to solve nuclear fusion. Then maybe somewhere down the road the excess energy will be available for everyone to live comfortably.<br><br><a href=renewables-next-fracking.html#c7965575809864628253 title="comment permalink">2/17/16, 1:42 PM</a><br><br>

To me, blight is their biggest flaw. Their inefficiency just adds to the environmental hypocrisy. Noise is another big problem, and of course bird &amp; bat deaths are growing as turbines multiply. The usual rationalization is that other structures kill more of them so far.<br><br>Wind turbines (of the tall, industrial type) are the most visible man-made invasion of the countryside in history. Their size and spread surpasses oil rigs and far more people see them than coal mines on a daily basis. So-called environmentalists who insist on calling wind turbines "beautiful" make me angry. Did the landscape and seascape suddenly become invisible or expendable in its unfettered form? Man's carbon footprint is just one of many we need to limit. Physical impact on priceless landscape mustn't be trivialized. Even if all potential sites are filled, wind power will never replace fossil fuels' energy density &amp; portability (for industry and heavy transport) and it needs them to exist, anyhow. "Fossil fuel extenders" is the common term. <br><br>Wind turbines number over 250,000 globally and most of them were forced onto the landscape with little say from locals. That's changed in recent times but there's still a ton of propaganda convincing naive people to back the colossal structures. Previous visual impacts in wind turbine zones were less contrasting masts and power-lines with no kinetic distractions, or low-lying structures like barns. No grain silos approach the height of wind turbines.<br><br>Some studies (e.g. Jacobson &amp; Delucchi) call for nearly 4 million wind turbines down the road, and I wince thinking about landscapes and ocean views of the future. The world could become a very stark place.
