<div class=MsoNormal>
While we’re discussing education, the theme of the current series of posts here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, it’s necessary to point out that there are downsides as well as upsides to take into account. The savant so saturated in abstractions that he’s hopelessly inept at the business of everyday life has been a figure of fun in literature for many centuries now, not least because examples of the type are so easy to find in every age. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That said, certain kinds of education have more tightly focused downsides. It so happens, for example, that engineers have contributed rather more to crackpot literature than most other professions. Hollow-earth theories, ancient-astronaut speculations, treatises arguing that the lost continent of Atlantis is located nearly anywhere on Earth except where Plato said it was—well, I could go on; engineers have written a really impressive share of the gaudier works in such fields. In my misspent youth, I used to collect such books as a source of imaginative entertainment, and when the jacket claimed the author was some kind of engineer, I knew I was in for a treat. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I treated that as an interesting coincidence until I spent a couple of years working for a microfilming company in Seattle that was owned by a retired Boeing engineer. He was also a devout fundamentalist Christian and a young-Earth creationist; he’d written quite a bit of creationist literature, though I never heard that any of it was published except as densely typed photocopied handouts—and all of it displayed a very specific logic: given that the Earth was created by God on October 23, 4004 BCE, at 9:00 in the morning, how can we explain the things we find on Earth today? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That is to say, he approached it as an engineering problem.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Engineers are trained to figure out what works. Give them a problem, and they’ll beaver away until they find a solution—that’s their job, and the engineering profession has been around long enough, and had enough opportunities to refine its methods of education, that a training in engineering does a fine job of teaching you how to work from a problem to a solution. What it doesn’t teach you is how to question the problem. That’s why, to turn to another example, you get entire books that start from the assumption that the book of Ezekiel was about a UFO sighting and proceed to work out, in impressive detail, exactly what the UFO must have looked like, how it was powered, and so on. “But how do we know it was a UFO sighting in the first place?” is the one question that never really gets addressed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s occurred to me recently that another specific blindness seems to be hardwired into another mode of education, one that’s both prestigious and popular these days: a scientific education—that is to say, a technical education in the theory and practice of one of the hard sciences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The downside to such an education, I’d like to suggest, is that it makes you stupid about politics. Plenty of examples come to mind, and I’ll be addressing some of the others shortly, but the one I want to start with is classic in its simplicity, not to mention its simple-mindedness. This is the recent proposal by astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson, which I quote in full: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<i>Earth needs a virtual country: #Rationalia, with a one-line Constitution: All policy shall be based on the weight of evidence— Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) June 29, 2016</i></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That might be dismissed as just another example of the thought-curtailing properties of Twitter’s 140-character limit—if a potter makes pots, what does Twitter make?—except that Tyson didn’t say, “here’s the principle behind the constitution, details to follow.” That’s his proposed constitution in its entirety. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
More precisely, that’s his sound bite masquerading as a constitution. An actual constitution, as anyone knows who has actually read one, doesn’t just engage in a bit of abstract handwaving about how decisions are to be made. It sets out in detail who makes the decisions, how the decision-makers are selected, what checks and balances are meant to keep the decision-makers from abusing their positions, and so on. If Donald Trump, say, gave a speech saying, “We need a new scientific method that consists solely of finding the right answer,” he’d be mocked for not knowing the first thing about science. A similar response is appropriate here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That said, Tyson’s proposal embodies another dimension of cluelessness about politics. Insisting that political decisions ought to be made exclusively on the basis of evidence sounds great, until you try to apply it to actual politics. Take that latter step, and what you’ll discover is that evidence is only tangentially relevant to most political decisions. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Consider the recent British referendum over whether to leave the European Union. That decision could not have been made on the basis of evidence, because all sides, as far as I know, agreed on the facts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those were that Britain had joined the European Economic Community (as it then was) in 1973, that its membership involved ceding certain elements of national sovereignty to EU bureaucracies, and that EU policies benefited certain people in Britain while disadvantaging others. None of those points were at issue. The points that were at issue were values on the one hand, and interests on the other. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By values I mean judgments, by individuals and communities, about what matters and what doesn’t, what’s desirable and what isn’t, what can be tolerated and what can’t. These can’t be reduced to mere questions of evidence. A statement such as “the free movement of people across national borders is good and important” can’t be proved or disproved by any number of double-blind controlled studies. It’s a value that some people hold and others don’t, as is the statement “the right of people to self-determination must be protected from the encroachments of unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.” Those values are in conflict with each other, and it was in large part over such values that the Brexit election was fought out and decided. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By interests I mean the relative distribution of costs and benefits. Any political decision, about any but the most trivial subject, brings benefits and has costs, and far more often than not the people who get the benefits and the people who carry the costs are not the same. EU membership for Britain was a case in point. By and large, the affluent got the majority of the benefits—they were the ones who could send their children to German universities and count on border-free travel to holidays in Spain—and the working poor carried the majority of the costs—they were the ones who had to compete for jobs against a rising tide of immigrants, while the number of available jobs declined due to EU policies that encouraged offshoring of industry to lower-wage countries.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What made the Brexit referendum fascinating, at least to me, was the way that so many of the pro-EU affluent tried to insist that the choice was purely about values, and that any talk about the interests of the working poor was driven purely by racism and xenophobia—that is to say, values.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As I’ve noted here in numerous posts, the affluent classes in the industrial world have spent the last four decades or so throwing the working poor under the bus and then rolling the wheels back and forth over them, while insisting at the top of their lungs that they’re doing nothing of the kind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Wage earners, and the millions who would be happy to earn a wage if they could find work, know better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Here in America, for example, most people outside the echo chambers of the affluent remember perfectly well that forty years ago, a family with one working class income could afford a house, a car, and the other amenities of life, while today, a family with one working class income is probably living on the street. Shouting down open discussion of interests by insisting that all political decisions have to do solely with values has been a common strategy on the part of the affluent; the outcome of the Brexit referendum is one of several signs that this strategy is near the end of its shelf life. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the real world—the world where politics has to function—interests come first. Whether you or I are benefited or harmed, enriched or impoverished by some set of government policies is the bedrock of political reality. Evidence plays a role: yes, this policy will benefit these people; no, these other people won’t share in those benefits—those are questions of fact, but settling them doesn’t settle the broader question. Values also play a role, but there are always competing values affecting any political decision worth the name; the pursuit of liberty conflicts with the pursuit of equality, justice and mercy pull in different directions, and so on.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To make a political decision, you sort through the evidence to find the facts that are most relevant to the issue—and “relevant,” please note, is a value judgement, not a simple matter of fact. Using the relevant evidence as a framework, you weigh competing values against one another—this also involves a value judgment—and then you weigh competing interests against one another, and look for a compromise on which most of the contending parties can more or less agree. If no such compromise can be found, in a democratic society, you put it to a vote and do what the majority says. That’s how politics is done; we might even call it the political method. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s not how science is done, though. The scientific method is a way of finding out which statements about nature are false and discarding them, under the not unreasonable assumption that you’ll be left with a set of statements about nature that are as close as possible to the truth. That process rules out compromise. If you’re Lavoisier and you’re trying to figure out how combustion works, you don’t say, hey, here’s the oxygenation theory and there’s the phlogiston theory, let’s agree that half of combustion happens one way and the other half the other; you work out an experiment that will disprove one of them, and accept its verdict. What’s inadmissible in science, though, is the heart of competent politics. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In science, furthermore, interests are entirely irrelevant in theory. (In practice—well, we’ll get to that in a bit.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Decisions about values are transferred from the individual scientist to the scientific community via such practices as peer review, which make and enforce value judgments about what counts as good, relevant, and important research in each field. The point of these habits is to give scientists as much room as possible to focus purely on the evidence, so that facts can be known as facts, without interference from values or interests. It’s precisely the habits of mind that exclude values and interests from questions of fact in scientific research that make modern science one of the great intellectual achievements of human history, on a par with the invention of logic by the ancient Greeks. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the great intellectual crises of the ancient world, in turn, was the discovery that logic was not the solution to every human problem. A similar crisis hangs over the modern world, as claims that science can solve all human problems prove increasingly hard to defend, and the shrill insistence by figures such as Tyson that it just ain’t so should be read as evidence for the imminence of real trouble. Tyson himself has demonstrated clearly enough that a first-rate grasp of astronomy does not prevent the kind of elementary mistake that gets you an F in Political Science 101. He’s hardly alone in displaying the limits of a scientific education; Richard Dawkins is a thoroughly brilliant biologist, but whenever he opens his mouth about religion, he makes the kind of crass generalizations and jawdropping non sequiturs that college sophomores used to find embarrassingly crude. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
None of this is helped by the habit, increasingly common in the scientific community, of demanding that questions having to do with values and interests should be decided, not on the evidence, but purely on the social prestige of science. I’m thinking here of the furious open letter signed by a bunch of Nobel laureates, assailing Greenpeace for opposing the testing and sale of genetically engineered rice. It’s a complicated issue, as we’ll see in a moment, but you won’t find that reflected in the open letter. Its argument is simple: we’re scientists, you’re not, and therefore you should shut up and do as we say. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s take this apart a step at a time. To begin with, the decision to allow or prohibit the testing and sale of genetically engineered rice is inherently<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>political rather than scientific. Scientific research, as noted above, deals with facts as facts, without reference to values or interests. “If you do X, then Y will happen”—that’s a scientific statement, and if it’s backed by adequate research and replicable testing, it’s useful as a way of framing decisions. The decisions, though, will inevitably be made on the basis of values and interests. “Y is a good thing, therefore you should do X” is a value judgment; “Y will cost me and benefit you, therefore you’re going to have to give me something to get me to agree to X” is a statement of interest—and any political decision that claims to ignore values and interests is either incompetent or dishonest. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are, as it happens, serious questions of value and interest surrounding the genetically engineered rice under discussion. It’s been modified so that it produces vitamin A, which other strains of rice don’t have, and thus will help prevent certain kinds of blindness—that’s one side of the conflict of values. On the other side, most seed rice in the Third World is saved from the previous year’s crop, not purchased from seed suppliers, and the marketing of the GMO rice thus represents yet another means for a big multinational corporation to pump money out of the pockets of some of the poorest people on earth to enrich stockholders in the industrial world. There are many other ways to get vitamin A to people in the Third World, but you won’t find those being discussed by Nobel laureates—nor, of course, are any of the open letter’s signatories leading a campaign to raise enough money to buy the patent for the GMO rice and donate it to the United Nations, let’s say, so poor Third World farmers can benefit from the rice without having to spend money they don’t have in order to pay for it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
These are the issues that have been raised by Greenpeace among others. To respond to that with a straightforward display of the logical fallacy called <i>argumentum ad auctoritatem</i>—“I’m an authority in the field, therefore whatever I say is true”—is bad reasoning, but far more significantly, it’s inept politics. You can only get away with that trick a certain number of times, unless what you say actually does turn out to be true, and institutional science these days has had way too many misses to be able to lean so hard on its prestige. I’ve noted <a href=../../2015/03/the-view-from-outside_18.html>in previous posts here</a> the way that institutional science has blinded itself to the view from outside its walls, ignoring the growing impact of the vagaries of scientific opinion in fields such as human nutrition, the straightforward transformation of research into marketing in the medical and pharmaceutical industry, and the ever-widening chasm between the promises of safety and efficacy brandished by scientists and the increasingly unsafe and ineffective drugs, technologies, and policy decisions that burden the lives of ordinary people. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are plenty of problems with that, but the most important of them is political. People make political decisions on the basis of their values and their perceived interests, within a frame provided by accepted facts. When the people whose job it is to present and interpret the facts start to behave in ways that bring their own impartiality into question, the “accepted facts” stop being accepted—and when scientists make a habit of insisting that the values and interests of most people don’t matter when those conflict, let’s say, with the interests of big multinational corporations that employ lots of scientists, it’s only a matter of time before whatever scientists say is dismissed out of hand as simply an attempt to advance their interests at the expense of others. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That, I’m convinced, is one of the major forces behind the widening failure of climate change activism, and environmental activism in general, to find any foothold among the general public. These days, when a scientist like Tyson gets up on a podium to make a statement, a very large percentage of the listeners don’t respond to his words by thinking, “Wow, I didn’t know that.” They respond by thinking, “I wonder who’s paying him to say that?” That would be bad enough if it was completely unjustified, but in many fields of science—especially, as noted earlier, medicine and pharmacology—it’s become a necessary caveat, as failures to replicate mount up, blatant manipulation of research data comes to light, and more and more products that were touted as safe and effective by the best scientific authorities turn out to be anything but. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Factor that spreading crisis of legitimacy into the history of climate change activism and it’s not hard to see the intersection. Fifteen years ago, the movement to stop anthropogenic climate change was a juggernaut; today it’s a dead letter, given lip service or ignored completely in national politics, and reduced to a theater of the abusrd by <a href=../../2015/12/too-little-too-late.html>heavily publicized international agreements</a> that commit no one to actually reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Much of the rhetoric of climate change activism fell into the same politically incompetent language already sketched out—“We’re scientists, you’re not, so shut up and do as you’re told”—and the mere fact that they were right, and that anthropogenic climate change is visibly spinning out of control around us right now, doesn’t change the fact that such language alienated far more people than it attracted, and thus helped guarantee the failure of the movement. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Of course there was a broader issue tangled up in this, and it’s the same one that’s dogging scientific pronouncements generally these days: the issue of interests. Specifically, who was expected to pay the costs of preventing anthropogenic climate change, and who was exempted from those costs? That’s not a question that’s gotten anything like the kind of attention it deserves—not, at least, in the acceptable discourse of the political mainstream. We’ll be talking about it two weeks from now.<br>

Moreover, if any person is to begin developing and exercising their critical thinking ability to use in questioning conventional wisdom, they will likely go thru a phase of being into crackpot theories, until those too are rejected, and their instincts in critical thinking improve. Those people are on the right track, we should encourage them. <br><br>Also, there's a book on the phenomenon of people being smart about science but dumb about politics:<br><br>Disciplined Minds: A Critical Look at Salaried Professionals and the Soul-battering System That Shapes Their Lives, Jeff Schmidt, 2001.<br><br>Parts of this book are about exactly the phenomenon you describe, and about how the training process makes it so. The writing is a bit brutal and driven by the authors personal experiences, which give it a dark edge :-(. In 1 sentence, it says that highly educated professionals, even when they are staunch defenders of scientific integrity and political independence within their field, are much more likely to be conformist (politically submissive) outside their field. <br><br>-pb<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c7122691097729494373 title="comment permalink">7/13/16, 6:44 PM</a><br><br>

The disturbing thing is that I am skeptical about climate science for a number of reasons. I won`t touch the funding feeding frenzy and argument from authority issues, as those are well-documented. I won`t talk about the club of celebrity climate boosters who live fantastically carbon-intensive lives. I`ve read the IPCC reports and made an effort to understand the physics, and although I can`t really speak from authority as an engineer who has had nothing to do with thermodynamics since my last exam on the subject, I think there are serious issues.<br><br>Nobody, not climate skeptics, nor climate scientists, nor Al Gore, properly understands the effects that water vapor and clouds has on the planet. In fact, I think IPCC 5 (I went on a climate paper binge about a year ago, after taking a certain prediction about 2030 seriously for about a week, I haven`t paid any attention since) even admits that there is essentially no way to properly model the water vapor-cloud system`s effects on the climate even in a vague-but accurate long term sort of way. On top of that, human activities such as agriculture, putting aerosols into the atmosphere, air travel, etc have serious effects on this system that are not properly modeled. I don`t mean to say that everything will be fine, I`m saying that based on my reading of the facts, nobody really has a clue what`s going to happen including myself, except that it probably will not be a good thing. Of course, maybe I think this way because I`m an engineer.<br><br>It's also worth considering that based on the actual actions and statements of the 'climate community', conspiracy theories about global governance aren't really as illogical as your average climate scientist will claim they are.<br><br>One strange (bright?) spot here in Canada is that the Conservative party has adopted "because it's the current year" as a quasi-slogan. I read this as a direct mockery of the popular liberal notion that because it's, well, the current year, X should be Y. Of course, my perspective on the issue is fairly slanted due to sharing the author's views about progress.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c8120435807159844411 title="comment permalink">7/13/16, 7:09 PM</a><br><br>

It's the old "I've got a hammer so everything looks very nail-like" argument. Science and politics are different fields, so we should expect that different tools will be required. One must pay attention to the matters under discussion to determine which toolbox to bring.<br><br>Back when I was an underpaid philosophy lecturer, I tried to drive this point home to my students. I forced my poor freshmen students to read Alan Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence." Not just the "nine objections," but the whole damn paper. I had an agenda for this. After reading the paper, I asked my class what the most important point in the paper was. Way too many pointed to some of the tables or explanations of how discrete state devices work. Others would point to the idea of the Turing test. After allowing my class to discuss for a few minutes, I directed their attention to this paragraph:<br><br><i>It was suggested tentatively that the question, "Can machines think?" should be replaced by "Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?" If we wish we can make this superficially more general and ask "Are there discrete-state machines which would do well?" But in view of the universality property we see that either of these questions is equivalent to this, "Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?"</i><br><br>That is, Turing is equating intelligence with intelligible behavior (i.e. some form of behaviorism or functionalism). If you disagree with Turing's premise about what constitutes intelligence, then the rest of the paper will fail to convince you. In short, pay attention to what is actually under consideration. (The same thing holds for John Searle's Chinese Room rejoinder to Turing in "Brains, Minds, and Programs" - which always struck me as an elaborate exercise in circular thinking. Gee, John, if we assume that you are right about the nature of consciousness, then you are right about the nature of consciousness.)<br><br>I like to think I got some of my students interested in probing some underlying assumptions. At least a few of them even dared to question their lecturer on occasion.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c2591420758272532495 title="comment permalink">7/13/16, 7:32 PM</a><br><br>

The issue of who benefits from a technology is not really a question of values, per ce, but rather one of social science. If it is the case that a genetically modified rice is going to make the life of ordinary peasants worse because they can no longer seed save, that is something that can be shown by social science research. I would posit that many of the problems Greer is talking about come from scientists doing something that is a total scientific no-no, speaking outside of their area of expertise. The values issue is that a lot of people in the hard sciences think very poorly of social science. That sounds like old fashioned arrogance to me. <br><br>Personally, I'm of the opinion that science is pretty much a process of developing consensus rather than TRUTH. That's what the whole process of moving from hypothesis to theory by using things like falsifiability and peer reviewed journals is all about. In the same way, my experience of politics is also about developing a consensus through a series of labourious mechanisms to allow a "meeting of minds". I'd suggest that that's what the whole campaign of Bernie Sanders was all about---trying to bring new ideas into a Democratic party that was pretty much moribund.<br><br>Anyway, Mr. Greer is an expert at crafting narratives that explain the world. I don't have exactly the same narrative, but there is overlap. So I will leave it at that.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c2715781947198290801 title="comment permalink">7/13/16, 7:50 PM</a><br><br>

I don't think I've read one of these columns with so many issues that I feel a need to respond to. <br><br>First, I'm an engineer, and really proud of my training and how it has molded my thought processes. Yet I have to agree that I, too, have seen a scary number of goofy non-technical proposals put forth by engineers.<br><br> However I don't think that the fault lies specifically in the training that engineers receive but it is more related to the confidence engineers accumulate by actually making things happen and the ease with which engineers can assemble relationships with ideas combined with the lack of training, and interest, engineers have in social and value concepts. This issue is made worse by, what to me, is one of the most incredible characteristics of the human mind. That is the ability to compartmentalize different subjects and put impenerable barriers between them. For example, a person can be quite talented at, say, solving complex math problems related to physical subjects and not be able to balance their checkbook. I attribute this dichotomy to interest, or values. I had an engineering mentor many years ago that was a wonderful engineer and a young earth creationist. It boggled my mind that he could be so clever and resourceful on technical subjects and simply accept his parent's religion without thought.<br><br>About politics and compromise. I'm suprised that in your discussion about interests and compromise you left out what to me is the core of our political problems today, power. If you have the financial power to tempt, cajole and threaten the people who find politics a way of life your interests simply dominate the playing field. The compromises that ensue have nothing to do with any kind of balance between the parties. The compromises end up being essentially chaff thrown to the parties with the least power.<br><br>We agree that there is a great deal of distrust of experts. This distrust is spread over all levels of "authority". Scientists aren't trusted. Politicians (especially) aren't trusted. Business people aren't trusted. I attribute this problem much more to the abuse of power much more than to confusion between facts and values.<br><br>Regarding climate change I feel that the scientists have done a good job of identifying a problem and making the problem public. However solving the problem shows promise of breaking the rice bowl of very, very powerful organizations and people and those people and organizations have thrown fortunes literally at obscuring the scientific data and personally discrediting the individuals who have done the work. <br><br>I agree completely with you about the reaction of people to globalization, but isn't this too an issue of power? The policies have been put forth in collaboration with those having the power to move politicians and the media into making globalization fait accompli. But there is a value issue here too. Millions of Americans have suffered from the effects of globalization. Tens of millions of Asians have benefitted. I honestly can't say it is evil but my guess is that the life expectations of the Americans have suffered more than the aspirations of Asians have been met.<br><br>Thanks again for the steady diet of thoughtful discourse (even tho' I don't always agree!)<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c6759600339023312672 title="comment permalink">7/13/16, 7:54 PM</a><br><br>

As far as the respect that engineers command, well, it's simple. Engineers are (by definition in most of the world) university educated, and work primarily with their heads, or at worst, with delicate measurement tools. And yet they're a necessary part of doing very real things, unlike, say, climate scientists, gender studies professors, economists or politicians. So salary class types will respect us without the cognitive dissonance involved in say, respecting someone who welds or grows wheat for a living.<br><br>Back when I worked as an engineer (not that long ago), there was very little that I liked about sitting in an air-conditioned office drawing things on a computer and periodically going down into the shop, with all it's trappings and discomforts, to sort something out with a welder. Although I do believe that I was gifted with the particular kind of mind well-suited to the sort of informal optimization process involved in designing custom machinery, I've learned not to consider it to be a source of generalized virtue. It wasn't that the division of labor was inappropriate, but I was never really comfortable with the upstairs/downstairs divide. I liked going on installations, where I would plunk my laptop down on whatever surface was appropriate and maintain an active dialogue with the workers I was responsible for directing.<br><br>Ironically, partially due to the financialization of the Canadian economy, I now work almost entirely with computers in a stupidly abstract sort of way. I like it a little bit better - I miss the interactions with real things that I can touch and working class types, but I don't miss the uncomfortable classist undertones of the typical custom fabrication shop. The thing I disliked the most was the need to stay dressed up, which was obnoxious because touching a piece of machinery or shaking a worker's hand when needed became an exercise in remembering not to touch your clothes afterwards without appearing bothered by the grease or whatever on your hand. On the other hand, I might have to develop some sort of smartwatch that dispenses blood pressure medications and sedatives if it detects John Oliver, Degrasse Tyson or their ilk on the Apple TV in the work lunchroom again.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c8668125602395618494 title="comment permalink">7/13/16, 8:54 PM</a><br><br>

It may be a mystery to Homo domesticus, but anyone who spends a significant amount of time outdoors knows that a cloudy day is cooler than a sunny day. A little more subtle, but well drilled into every gardener in a temperate zone, is that it is the cloudless nights that have the greatest danger of frost. The climate scientists have confirmed in their own way these opposing micro effects. Figuring out which is dominant is in the long term is difficult, if not impossible -- once the computational power required is significant enough to have its own effect on climate, all bets are off.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c4585968892461960553 title="comment permalink">7/13/16, 9:25 PM</a><br><br>

Although, I must say I disagree with your passing comment about Dawkins being a brilliant biologist. He is one of the last biologists to think that the gene is the target of selection (an idea he unwittingly and unknowingly disavowed in his book The Extended Phenotype). Ernst Mayr explains why he is not very brilliant in his interview with Edge Magazine:<br><br>'The idea that a few people have about the gene being the target of selection is completely impractical; a gene is never visible to natural selection, and in the genotype, it is always in the context with other genes, and the interaction with those other genes make a particular gene either more favorable or less favorable ... Therefore people like Dawkins in England who still think the gene is the target of selection are evidently wrong ... Yet the funny thing is if in England, you ask a man in the street who the greatest living Darwinian is, he will say Richard Dawkins. And indeed, Dawkins has done a marvelous job of popularizing Darwinism. But Dawkins' basic theory of the gene being the object of evolution is totally non-Darwinian. I would not call him the greatest Darwinian.'<br><br>https://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/mayr/mayr_print.html<br><br>Mayr was being very polite. To paraphrase Gould, Dawkins is at best a caricature of a Darwinian. <br><br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c1996536508427625554 title="comment permalink">7/13/16, 9:48 PM</a><br><br>

More importantly, I can sometimes detect when I'm making a decision with one of these beliefs, and correct the decisision or thought. I also sometimes recognize when somebody says something based off these assumptions which is false.<br><br>I have always been a truth seeker, and now I finally found the explanation to many of today's and tomorrow's problems. Now I know how to prepare for the future and what to expect, along with ways of avoiding the worst of the collapse.<br><br><br><br>On the other hand, I have always lived the suburban affluent air-conditioned McMansion lifestyle. I never experienced any violence, conflict, change, or pain. Now I wish I was born 50 years earlier, and this thought haunts ne every day.<br><br>Also, I have taken an interest in computers and technology since I was a toddler. I have spent thousands of hours learning about programming, hardware, systems, and networking. I am also going to college in a month to study information systems. Knowing that most of this will be useless after the collapse makes me feel hopeless. My parents also work in high-tech jobs which would probably be gone immediately when the collapse starts.<br><br>You frequently mention that the upper classes of society have neglected the lower classes and environment, while insisting they weren't. Knowing that I am part of the upper class, and have believed the talking heads on CNN for years without thinking of the damage I have caused to my own future and upcoming generations, makes me feel guilty. Even more so, growing up around computers and knowing that automation has made hundreds of millions of people poorer, while benefiting people like me.<br><br>I know you've said many times that high technology and material wealth doesn't make people happy, beyond a certain point. I am sure I could adapt to a 1940's middle-class lifestyle, or higher, without being unhappy. But the prospect of change, especially with the violence and conflict involved, weighs down every day.<br><br><br><br>Therefore I don't know whether the burden of the truth is worse than all the pain I can avoid. Hopefully you can tell me that it isn't?<br><br>Unless this is just a useless, off-topic rant and I wasted your time.

I can't wait. <br><br>I'm currently reading more southern gothic fiction from the forties and fifties. I know that's not old enough for you assignment, but there are many phrases and themes to make young people today squirm. I just finished The Violent Bear it Away by Flannery O'Conner. Now that's a heavy religious ride! As familiar as I am with the south and these type of novels, some of it had me asking internal questions. And I'm about half way through Truman Capote's Other Voices, Other Rooms. Definitive gender roles, race roles, class roles. Whoa. I don't know if many college students could handle it. But, as hard as some of these issues can be, the beauty and art of these kind of novels always keeps me coming back for more. You know, I've a copy of Stars Reach and Twilights Last Gleaming and I am often recommending them. Not one person I know has been able to get through either novel. What do you think that means? <br><br>One last thing....I honestly can't even remember what brought it up...but my husband and I were JUST talking about how engineers can inadvertently cause more problems than they solve.

That struck me about a year ago, as I noted the increasing tendency on the part of many people to be unable to think through any statement that takes more than 140 characters to express...<br><br>Whomever, too funny. No question, California's on track to become the Rust Belt of the 21st century -- they're making all the same mistakes that were made in the old industrial heartland in the mid-20th century. As for Doctor Investment Syndrome, this makes perfect sense to me, based on the physicians I've known! <br><br>W.B., thank you. I'm not making any money off the print edition, any more than I make off this blog -- the subscription price pays for the cost of production and mailing, and that's pretty much it -- but I don't mind; as with the blog, it's publicity rather than profit, and I figure that people who like either one will buy my books and/or put something in the tip jar. As for questions about the print edition, see the comment by A Post-Millennial above. <br><br>Aaa, science fiction and fantasy authors tend to be on the skeptical end of things, oddly enough. I suspect the pressure from fans in both genres to make the details consistent and convincing makes us authors hypersensitive about logical lapses!<br><br>Ixtlan, <a href=../../2015/03/the-view-from-outside_18.html rel=nofollow>I think it was someone familiar</a>... ;-)<br><br>Marcu, you're welcome and thank you. I suspect a society run by engineers would proceed with the maximum efficiency and rationality toward profoundly irrational goals...<br><br>Justin, no question, the detailed forecasts on offer from IPCC et al. are dubious at best. That's why I base my predictions on paleoclimatology: "what happened the last time these conditions occurred?" tends to be a much more accurate source of predictions than abstract models of poorly understood whole systems. <br><br>Chris, I think you're missing the point of Searles' metaphor. What he's shown is that a given set of behavior -- the ability to respond to messages in Chinese -- can be an indicator of two wholly different sets of mental processes. Since each of us has experienced those processes directly in our own minds, and knows the difference between them, it's not necessary to presuppose the accuracy of his model -- just that, as each of us knows, there's a difference between rote repetition of behavior and actual understanding of a process. The Turing test, at least to me, seems to presuppose that there is no such difference. <br><br>Siliconguy, all I can say is that I've read a great many books by engineers who, for all intents and purposes, and in contexts where marketing and management weren't involved, demonstrated a complete inability to question the starting point of their investigations. <br><br>Nestorian, while (as you know) I don't agree with you about the age of the Earth, I'll certainly grant that most would-be debunkers of young Earth creationism (and everything else defined by the current pseudoskeptic scene as pseudoscience, for that matter) rely constantly on circular reasoning, ad hominem arguments, and logical howlers old enough to have names in Latin. If these guys are the defenders of science and reason, science and reason are in real trouble. <br><br>Yeast, he also hasn't realized that so many people have tried to use dire predictions to scare others into agreeing with them that, these days, that strategy basically doesn't work any more. David Cameron's attempts to bully British voters into voting for Remain by waving around threats are a case in point; these days, when you trot out the scare stories -- even if they're true! -- people just roll their eyes and walk away.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c1092906543047216119 title="comment permalink">7/13/16, 10:48 PM</a><br><br>

Didn't work in Plato's time, won't work now. <br><br>Owl, er, you may need to reread the post, as you've gotten confused about what I said. Who benefits from what technology isn't a matter of values, it's a matter of interests. While you're right that social science research could, in theory, determine the probable economic consequences of introducing GMO rice, I trust you don't think Monsanto's going to hand over a grant to any social scientist who might say "Actually, this is a really bad idea." That said, you're right about speaking outside one's field of expertise; that was my point, or part of my point, in suggesting a tweet by Donald Trump about the scientific method, as Tyson apparently knows about as much about politics as Trump does about science.<br><br>Jim, I think it's more than confidence based on experience, as I've met a lot of newly minted engineers who have the same attitude -- thus my speculation that it's the product of common trends in engineering education. As for the power of vested interests, it's been a constant refrain of climate change activists that that's what's kept them from accomplshing their goals -- but every reform in history was carried out in the teeth of resistance from those who benefit from the existing order of things. Other movements for reform have succeeded anyway. Climate change activism has flopped. The core difference, I'd argue, is that those other movements played their cards well, while climate change activists have by and large played them very, very poorly. More on this as we proceed!<br><br>Bryan, funny. These days, though, I think we should talk less about virtual reality and more about vicial reality. Vicial? Yep; it relates to "vicious" the way that "virtual" relates to "virtuous"...<br><br>Jim, thank you. It's been ongoing for ten years, and I plan on keeping things going for the foreseeable future.<br><br>Jessi, I'll certainly consider that. There are so many kinds of induced stupidity these days that it's kind of like shooting fish in a barrel...<br><br>Dennis, betrayal is indeed a vicious emotion. I wonder if the people responsible have any idea just how much rage is directed at them these days. <br><br>Richard, not at all. It's too late to prevent a real mess, but it's not too late to take concerted action to give our descendants a better world than they'll otherwise get -- and the insistence that we might as well just keep on driving our SUVs is, to my mind, just another copout. <br><br>Repent, thank you. If you have the chance, you might want to check out Charles Hapgood's book <i>Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings</i>, which I believe is back in print -- Hapgood's the guy who originally noticed that there's data on some very old maps that can't be squared with current theories about the state of geographical knowledge in ancient, medieval, and early modern times. It's a thought-provoking book!<br><br>Timothy, I believe that the people who are issuing the print edition (I'm not one of them -- I just provide content) will be doing that; drop a note to A Post-Millennial, at the email address included in his comment above, if you want to know the details. <br><br>Doubt, I may have misread Dawkins, then. I took what he was saying to mean that, for reasons rooted ultimately in statistics, evolution in a population functions as though individual genes were competing with one another against selective pressures -- which in turn could be rephrased as the more modest claim that a model working along those lines is an effective predictor of actual evolution. Still, I may have gotten that from my college classes in ecology and mapped it onto Dawkins' writings.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c8121081069473853836 title="comment permalink">7/13/16, 11:07 PM</a><br><br>

The first thing I'd say is that any harm you've helped cause was done in ignorance, and guilt isn't merited. The thing to do is consider your lifestyle now and say, "What am I prepared to change?" You don't need to go whole hog -- in fact, that's usually a really bad idea. I'd encourage you to consider doing what a lot of Druids do, which is to choose three things to change in order to decrease the burden you place on the environment. They can be little things, especially to start with. Do them, stick with them, learn from them, and once you've learned that you really can change your life, consider what further changes you want to make. <br><br>As far as your schooling and career, collapse is not a fast thing. The US has been in decline, by measurable objective standards, for several decades now; that decline is accelerating -- but even so, you're likely to be able to use computer skills for some time to come. You might consider, as time permits, learning how to do something that isn't dependent on computers -- the example I like to suggest to people is learning how to homebrew beer, since that means you can produce a commodity for which there will always be a market! <br><br>It's been pointed out many times that waking up to the reality of the hard future ahead is like experiencing the death of a family member. You're going through the grieving process right now, and that's difficult. On the other side is a world full of new possibilities -- and knowing that it's coming, and that the future promised by the myth of progress is never going to happen, will make it possible for you to help the people you care about navigate the rough waters of the years ahead. To my mind, that makes the knowledge worth the grief. <br><br>Genevieve, the medical industry is terrified of the placebo effect. It works better than most medicines, it's <i>cheap</i>, and physicians are lousy at using it these days because they've forgotten how to interact with their patients. No wonder you couldn't get funding! <br><br>Wendy, you might want to email A Post-Millennial, who put his email on an earlier comment, and ask him if there's some other way you can pay for the subscription. My guess is that Stone Circle Press will be happy to work things out. As for my two novels, hmm! Have you asked people why they haven't been able to get through them? <br><br>Hammer, that could be it. <br><br>Weogo, that is to say, it's standard agribusiness groupthink, producing a product that would work perfectly in a predictable world and works very poorly in ours. <br><br>Roy, thank you and congrats -- may the guild flourish!<br><br>Mark, that makes absolute sense to me. I've also noticed that people who play too many video games lose the ability to solve problems in the real world, because video games create an imaginary environment in which every problem was invented by a human being and therefore has an answer that makes immediate sense to the human mind. <br><br>Patricia, and that's a crucial point, of course.<br><br>Tim, fair enough!<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c1398318463028663888 title="comment permalink">7/13/16, 11:25 PM</a><br><br>

Obviously I disagree. I'd point out that the parts of England and Wales that voted overwhelmingly for Brexit are exactly those parts that have seen working families driven into poverty and misery by policies, furthered by the EU, which benefited the affluent at the expense of the working poor. People in those regions who voted for Brexit were responding rationally to their own interests, and the extent to which so many Remain supporters keep trying to spin the discussion to erase the conflict of interests strikes me as good evidence that they know perfectly well what the score is. <br><br>Gottfried, my first thought when I heard about Sanders selling out was that he'd been promised the VP slot. Clinton's people may have finally gotten around to realizing just how vulnerable she is, not to mention how widely hated, and that would be a logical attempt at damage control.

Being an engineer by myself I wanted to add two things, one regarding the questioning of given task and problems, the other one regarding the submissiveness to non-engineering fields. <br><br>I work in a government institution that provides other government institutions with software either by making it by ourselves or by acquiring it from software companies. Those two ways of acquiring differ totally in their approach, because the letter one involves contracts and money. When evaluating software, it has to be verified and validated, which are two different things. Verification is testing whether the product behaves as required (solving a problem), while validation is checking if the software required by the customer improves the situation of the customer (questioning the problem). So in engineering there is a scientific concept of questioning a given task, called validation. However, when a piece of software is developed by a contractor, the contractor does not care about validation, because he is paid to deliver what is required by the contract. So he will verify to prove that he has fulfilled the contract, but he does not spend resources to care whether the product improves the situation of the customer. When we develop the software by ourselves as an intergovernmental service, we don’t have to care about money and contracts so we can spend much time together with the customer validating our doings to improve his situation. So I think the problem of engineers not questioning the task lies at least partially in most of them being embedded in a market economy with all its restrictions. <br><br>I think engineering stands out from other scientific fields in the way that the work that is done by engineers is constantly tested under the most complex test condition - in reality. Thus engineers know that their scientific tool box is right, because planes fly, computers compute and televisions show moving pictures. Thus all engineering is based on tons of empirical evidence. Most scientific fields do not have a permanent testing field for theories with trillions of test cases done by billions of users every day, so many other fields are full of untested theories and opinions. Not being aware of this, many engineers assume that other scientific tool boxes are as true and as based on empirical evidence as their own one. This I think makes them at first submissive to other scientific fields. However, being trained to evaluate their works on the hard empirical evidence of using a technical system in reality provides them also with the mindset and toolbox to thoroughly question other fields' scientific theories.<br><br>Those two points may help explain why there are on the one hand engineers who do not question anything and are submissive to non-engineering science while one the other hands engineers show brilliance in uncovering bogus science in fields as economics or nutrition.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c2002097615791441843 title="comment permalink">7/13/16, 11:53 PM</a><br><br>

I've seen so many examples of this among engineer friends and colleagues. Especially when you mention resource constraints they start arguing about e.g. fusion power and maglevs. I am an engineer, but when I was around 18 I also decided to go through the library and learn a bit about every subject, something I've kept up since then. I think that kind of approach should be mandatory for students in all fields. Many engineering students of course will hate studying totally "irrelevant" subjects such as egyptology, but in the long run it will broaden their mindset.<br>As I see it, too much focus nowadays is on education for a certain specialised job.

How could an entire government agency staffed with dozens of highly competent scientists start with a set of premises regarding the collapse of a certain engineered facility, provided to them by politicians with clear political motives and personal interests, and--never questioning it--proceed to construct elaborate explanations and models for how it must have occurred, and when their best model fails to reproduce the observed behavior in test runs, disregard it and present their explanation to the public as an unassailable truth? Of course, you know what I am talking about, and also why I don't name it for fear of slanting readers' opinions. Politics as it stands says you cannot touch this topic with a ten-foot pole, and I am sure any secretly dissenting scientists among that group, if they exist, are clearly aware of that fact.<br><br>A few months ago, in discussing social justice activism, you cleared up another mystery for me. I had a dear acquaintance, now deceased, who was a humanitarian activist. She introduced me to Amnesty International. I thought the world of her, and yet her personal relationships within her family were dreadful enough that I strongly suspect her of sociopathy. She was terribly manipulative, and two of her four children were likewise, with the other two being terribly neurotic in response. Since what I've read about sociopathy leads me to think such people would not do anything that did not provide them real rewards, I wondered about her apparent altruism. Now I have a better idea of what she was getting in return for her activism.<br><br>And finally, the assignment two weeks ago was just such a brilliant idea. Reading objectionable material as a group like that was so much more fun than slogging through it alone. Having not been able to access the whole book I chose, I am motivated to find other objectionable articles and read them. It is important to know exactly what the opposition is saying and what their form of argumentation is. To try to counter them without doing them the favor of seeing what they are actually saying only weakens one's own argument.<br><br>Furthermore, the Net has produced so many distinct echo chambers, where we all go skipping off in our own favorite direction with nothing much to bring us back to reality. It is very important to read stuff you disagree with.<br><br>(The Indonesian novel I initially selected for the assignment has not disappointed either: within three pages, I had a florid vocabulary for cell phone use. I am having a lot of fun reading it, though. Real slow going at this stage--I liken this point of language learning to a rocket launch. All the parts assembled, and now, real sustained effort to get it going.

One which your posts continue to highlight so eloquently.<br><br>If you consider the patriarchal tropes current in Victorian times - "who can understand how women think" and "who can resist a woman's wiles" - you can see the power dynamic at play. A man had so many legal and other means to directly disadvantage a woman, and therefore to directly pursue his own interest in his relations with women, that he could absolutely dispense with making any effort to understand her point of view or interest. For her part, having all direct routes to pursuing her interests blocked, a number of indirect routes present themselves. The impact of her use of them on the men in her life would be perceived by them as "wiles".<br><br>The point of this worked example is to show that having the wherewithal (money, influence, institutional support, public prejudice in your favour, capacity to inflict pain or disadvantage with a minimum of consequence) to pursue your interests DIRECTLY is to have power, and consequently, the ability to be clueless about the interests and values of people who can only pursue their interests INDIRECTLY, by, in some way, managing YOU, and accessing power through YOU.<br><br>There are some obvious consequences here: <br><br>The less powerful you are in a relationship, the more time you are likely to spend studying the values and interests of the other, as such study is key to all INDIRECT routes to the pursuit of your values and interests. But also, the better you are able to understand the other, and sometimes, the more likely you are to empathise with the other. <br><br>The more powerful you are in a relationship, the less interested you will be in studying the values and interests of the other, and ALSO, should you develop any curiosity in this regard, the less likely you will be to actually hear truths from them. YOU are yourself both the obstacle and the means to the other's direct pursuit of their interests, and the more this is the case, the less likely they are to risk your displeasure or vengeance by giving you their truth.<br><br>In these comments, I use "relationship" both in the personal sense and in the class/interest group sense, although in real life, the terrain these encompass between any specific two people is messy and complicated.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c6527306431383344459 title="comment permalink">7/14/16, 3:15 AM</a><br><br>

Human societies being as complex as they are, a lot of the "facts" involved are not as simple to establish as the date we joined the EU. For example, the question of whether immigration is "good" may come down to values, but the questions of whether immigration leads to growth/raises or lowers average wages/causes friction in a community is in principle resolvable via evidence and investigation. In practice, of course, those questions are no easier to answer than, "What will the weather be next Tuesday?" and it's easy enough for somebody with a soapbox to pick one or the other crude attempt at an answer according to their preferred values. When over time that adds up to a series of failed predictions and retractions you end up with skepticism of "experts" on one hand and a devaluing of both fact and evidence on the other. As one of your commenters has already pointed out, the Brexit campaign consistently quoted the "£350 million" figure long after it had been thoroughly debunked. Far from agreeing on the facts, people quibbled over the simplest.<br><br>That issue of complexity goes some way to explaining the issue scientists have discerning between facts and value judgements. Facts do illuminate situations: the question of immigration looks very different if it seems to benefit a community or harm it. It's very tempting to believe, from there, that if you simply follow the evidence you will reach a point where all the facts are laid out for you, naturally weighted, and showing you precisely what you must do. I suspect Tyson, if challenged, would be willing to admit that we don't currently have enough evidence to make all the right decisions, but would insist that such a point is reachable - and the current situation looks much the same regardless of whether he's right, or right in principle but wrong in practice, or flat-out wrong. That it's the last is only clear if you understand that the evidence which gave the "right" answer already existed within a value framework (Which community? What benefit? What harm?) and, as we've established, scientific education doesn't cover that particularly well.<br><br>(If your calculations tell you that throwing a cat off the roof will kill it, that may tell you it's wrong to throw the cat, but only on the implicit understanding that it's wrong to kill the cat in the first place.)<br><br>Then again, there are aspects of scientific thinking that are very applicable to politics. Physicists and engineers I can excuse, but it's always a disappointment when biologists fail to note that politics (a game of self- and in-group interest reliant on competition, strategic cooperation, occasional altruism, and various forms of predation, parasitism and mutualism) follows many of the same basic rules as natural selection, and for much the same reason, following the intermediates of human behaviour and psychology. Scientists tend to make the mistake of assuming all people think like scientists, when of course all people - including scientists - think like people; and I suppose many engineering majors chose their field to get away from that. But the way people think is another of those areas that can, theoretically, be understood and explained in terms of fact and evidence, and this can to some extent inform the choices you make. You just can't draw any value judgements from it.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c2650837777294324745 title="comment permalink">7/14/16, 3:20 AM</a><br><br>

Engineers are awfully uncritical about the human implications of solutions, I had a fellow engineering friend who suggested that we should simply outsource all production to the robots and cut human population to one-tenth. When I started dismantling his argument using the very systems engineering methodologies we both had learnt, he got very hot under the collar.<br><br>Us engineering students simply loathe all law and commerce grads. Most of us think that these lot have no problem-solving tools and see everything as process, and not function. You can see this in the typical places lawyers go: Government, where they run around in circles and in tangents from, but nowhere near the actual huge problems.<br><br>Perhaps the reason so many climate change deniers see the evidence as being consensus based, i.e. apply the political method, is because so many scientists apply the scientific method to their political opinions.<br><br>My point is that no one tool is good for every situation: as an engineer, I understand very little about ecology or the law, so I think we should leave those decisions and counsel to them. The problems occur when (as I see it) a certain subset of society makes all the decisions. In the Anglosphere, that means that certain types of humanities professionals (lawyers and economics) make all decisions, including health, infrastructure, and investment. When was the last time the Health Minister was an actual health professional? This, as expected leads to disasterous results. A society run exclusively by engineers or economists or any other group would be just as bad.<br><br>We need people with wide-ranging multidisciplinary knowledge. That's why I positioned myself in a double degree, learning both engineering and arts.<br><br>YCS<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c487393701766128019 title="comment permalink">7/14/16, 3:21 AM</a><br><br>

When the USSR and its allies collapsed, hundreds of thousands of scientists suddenly became considered redundant by their societies, and many had to find new employment (it was perhaps the first big collapse of a "science bubble", and might portend what will one day happen in the West).<br><br>Quite a lot of those scientists (particularly physicists and mathematicians, it seems) became politicians, and some rose to leadership positions. Some examples: Angela Merkel (East Germany), Viktor Yushchenko (Ukraine), Askar Akayev (Kyrgyzstan), Boris Nemtsov (Russia).<br><br>The pattern I seem to see is that the politicians from scientific backgrounds have made memorable yet disastrous political leaders, with tendencies towards idealism and principles that initially make them popular... unfortunately, accompanied by blinkered dogmatism, treating people as things, staying on a particular path long after the point where it should've become obvious to anyone that a course correction is needed, and brutal dismissal of opposing voices even if the price is destroying one's own country (you can definitely see that in the leaderships of Merkel, Yushchenko and Akayev - all of whom slowly and methodically sowed the seeds for their country's destruction, most visibly in Ukraine - and Nemtsov would've likely done likewise if he'd been higher up the ladder and had been allowed to stay longer).<br><br>The most effective (longest-lasting and most internally popular) political leaders in Eastern Europe seem to have come from very different spheres: sociology/agriculture (Orban), agriculture (Lukashenko), secret service (Putin), metallurgy (Nazarbayev). Perhaps the one thing all of those fields have in common is that they require working closely with, and for, other people...<br><br>(also, an honourable mention for "professions that make horrible politicians" goes to chess players. Exhibit A: Garry Kasparov, who has managed to alienate almost everybody even on his own "side" and made his own causes toxic among the population he claims to speak for.

I illustrate this point for my students with this question: "what do you call a scientist who falsifies data? Not a scientist." <br><br>Guardians live by another syndrome. They follow precepts like "deceive for the sake of the task," and "treasure honor." Jacobs argues that traders and guardians are both needed to have a functioning society. La Wik adds: "Conflicts occur, according to Jacobs, when the precepts appropriate to one syndrome are applied to the other. This always generates problems. Furthermore, it is inevitable that problematic intermixing of the syndromes will occur over time, resulting in what she refers to as monstrous moral hybrids."<br><br>Imagine telling a police officer, a guardian, that he should be efficient and raise revenue, too, not support justice and social peace. You get Ferguson, MO, where 25% of the city budget was raised through traffic fines. Then, even when a police officer legitimately tries to keep the peace, he is attacked in his patrol car and winds up shooting a man who should have seen the police not as government highway robbers, but legitimate force. The city burns.<br><br>Scientists who attempt to use the force of the state eye become guardians, a monstrous moral hybrid. One problem with climate change is that it is phrased like a sin in the religion of Progressivism. Those opposed to accepting it know well that the power elite wants to use the "Science" to show them not just as people needing to change and adapt, but as Sinners. That becomes a religious/guardian issue. Science is concerned with true and false, and religion with right and wrong. Both are necessary to a properly functioning society. <br><br>The corruption of science can belaid at the feet of the politicians who turned it into a government-supported enterprise. The Federal government supplies about 1/7th of the money spent annually at Higher Education in America, but every dollar spent by an institution receiving Federal funds must comply with Federal rules. This has turned university science into an arm of the State, the ultimate guardian institution. Ultimately, the wage class knows who is paying for the scientist: the salary class that runs the State. This is an utter disaster going forward, and you're right: cosseted scientists like Tyson cannot see it.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c7343028512552078569 title="comment permalink">7/14/16, 7:15 AM</a><br><br>

But which of these situations is anomalous? A reading of the literature yields the impression that for most of industrial civilization the working class has had barely enough resources to survive and reproduce. The worker of forty years ago was the beneficiary not just of the New Deal, but also of the remainder of the world being destroyed in WWII (and using American expertise and equipment to rebuild), to say nothing of the burning of a whole lotta domestic coal and oil. I think restoring a set of policies more favorable to the working class is A Good Thing, but the comfort of forty years ago is probably now forever out of reach.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c565072848215828081 title="comment permalink">7/14/16, 7:36 AM</a><br><br>

I believe it is a question of 'habits'. I have a aquaintance who is a Menonite minister. He is a great guy, but he drives me effing crazy simply because there isn't one topic he doesn't have an opinion on. He understands everything, and will go to great pains to let you know what you should really be thinking. One day, I put two and two together. It is simply because people ask his opinion all the time, and every Sunday he gives a sermon listened to people who think just like him, otherwise, they would have probably gone fishing instead of to church.<br><br>Another person I know is an engineer. He was deeply offended when I told him that as an experienced tradesman, engineers were just another problem we had to work around, and that many actually knew very little of the scope and sequence of how a building goes up, or how a project is completed. One day, a Govt engineer came to inspect a fish hatchery I helped construct, (I was the foreman). He remarked that we had put in the plumbing on the 'wrong' side of the building. I replied that to install it as designed we would have had to make several tight 90 degree turns and pass under the driveway. We would have also had to do more drilling/blasting through bedrock. The way we installed it gave us a straight shot into the building, used less pipe, was easier to install, and offered less friction and better flows for the rearing areas. He demanded we redo it. I refused, as it was by now all under concrete. We argued, and then finally got to the nitty gritty of the matter. His reasoning for wanting us to redo the installation was that it was the way he had drawn it up on the blueprints. The construction had to conform to the blueprints. I told him that his design was wrong, and that it was easier to redo the blueprints and do a 'mirror image' of the plumbing installation than change the building around. We call that doing an 'as built' drawing. He was a Fisheries engineer and probably would not have survived in Industry. Nevertheless, he had the degree and people usually followed his orders.<br><br>Another engineer (boyfriend of my wife's friend) remarked to me with irritation in his voice that he simply did not understand why the 2nd crossing of Burrard Inlet (Vancouver) was called the Ironworkers Bridge? It offended him as he did not like ironworkers. (Sometimes, they are pretty hard to like). He was from Toronto and did not know our local history. Anyway, I told him it was because so many ironworkers died in the construction of the bridge due to a faulty design and project construction plan. He denied that the bridge had ever collapsed and that a properly engineered bridge could never fall down if details were adhered to. I told him to go and look it up....and have never heard back from him.<br><br>These three examples are people who have had years of authority linked to their training and job title, reinforced by people who had not questioned them, ever.

Likewise, whether you jump up and down, swear, scream, have a stroke or heart attack will have no bearing at all on my decision to volunteer for the Trump campaign.

I totally agree that it may be entirely possible that Trump sells out his supporters, but I fully believe that if that happens, his supporters will form the insurgency. I'm not really interested in stopping the tides, Bill, but trying to figure out the tides and surfing them. To me, Hillary is an unacceptable alternative that will unquestionably lead to Civil War or war with Russia, or both, and if there's even the remotest chance that Trump may follow through on some of his campaign promises, he should be given the opportunity to do so. Honestly, Bill, I'm not so much of a war monger as you are making me out to be, in that I think that Trump is our best sliver of hope to avert insurgency, and should be given an opportunity.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c4721502447920882835 title="comment permalink">7/14/16, 7:58 AM</a><br><br>

All of the legislative and executive institutions of the EU operating out of Brussels are made up of elected officials. The main ones: <br><br>The EU Parliament by direct vote of the citizenry of the member countries. <br><br>The EU Council that is made up of the heads of state of each member country, who are all in their position due to their parties or coalitions being voted into power by their countries citizens. <br><br>The Council of the EU (not to be confused with the EU Council above). It is the other legislative body of the EU. It is made up of the executive governments of the member states. Those governments are elected by their national parliaments, who were in turn elected by their citizenry. <br><br>The European Commission is the executive body of the European Union responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the EU. There is one member per member state. One of the 28 is the Commission President proposed by the European Council and elected by the European Parliament. The Council of the European Union then nominates the other 27 members of the Commission in agreement with the nominated President, and the 28 members as a single body are then subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament.<br><br>As you see, everyone is technically elected. It's just that, as you see from my descriptions above, it all gets rather derivative in a hurry. The guy who is in charge of the day to day biz is elected by another guy who was elected by this other dude, who you voted for in the last national elections. And being so far detached from direct elections, it might as well be unelected. Trying to nitpick on that technical inaccuracy results in this long winded description that just makes peoples eyes glaze over and they think to themselves "I can't wait to vote leave."<br><br>Now the European Central Bank is a totally unelected institution and it isn't based in Brussels. Also since the UK isn't in the Eurozone it isn't directly impacted by the ECB and more than it is impacted by the Federal Reserve.<br><br>I wish there had been more realistic talk from the Leave camp for making the UK more self reliant with important things like domestic food production. They currently import about 40% of their needs. But again, I'm just nitpicking. I think they did the right thing...I just don't think the Leave leaders have any sort of real plan after the vote.<br><br>Lastly, thank you so much for mentioning that awful open letter about Golden Rice. I would simply add to your comments about interests and values, the statement "golden rice doesn't work as advertised" is a fact. The field tests in the Philippines in 2012-2013 failed to produce the same yields as commercial strains. And didn't have significantly more vitamin A. <br><br>https://source.wustl.edu/2016/06/genetically-modified-golden-rice-falls-short-lifesaving-promises/<br><br>http://gmwatch.org/news/latest-news/16043-golden-rice-is-it-vaporware<br><br>http://www.march-against-monsanto.com/genetically-modified-golden-rice-15-years-of-failure/<br><br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c2310867428919806550 title="comment permalink">7/14/16, 8:02 AM</a><br><br>

You couldn't build a better system to prevent honest investigation if you tried. It was only in my childhood that tectonic plate theory was a tinfoil hat theory refuted by honorable geologists despite the self-evident appearance of the African and South American coasts.

I often have to explain that winning a bid for work often has more to do with perception of our capabilities (true or not), how well we get along with their Engineers or how crazy our ideas are to potentially conservative buyers. The buyer sees risk where the Engineer sees innovation.<br><br>This also goes to the argument between atheists and philosophy where the crowd of Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, et al seem to think everything can be solved by science but I'm more inclined to think that many things in life are value judgments and will never be solved by science. <br><br>Your rice example is a wonderful nod to this and is the kind of issue I discuss with the Engineers I work with to no avail.

Mary Midgley does something very similar in her more recent book 'Wisdom, Information &amp; Wonder'.<br><br>'Study of Man' Michael Polanyi p.37<br>I have moved deliberately from facts to values and from science to the arts, in order to surprise you with the result; namely, that our powers of understanding control equally both these domains. This continuity was actually foreshadowed from the moment that I acknowledged intellectual passion as a proper motive of comprehension. The moment the ideal of detached knowledge was abandoned, it was inevitable that the ideal of dispassionateness should eventually follow, and that with it the supposed cleavage between dispassionate knowledge of fact and impassioned valuation of beauty should vanish.<br><br>A continuous transition from observation to valuation can actually be carried out within science itself, and indeed within the exact sciences, simply by moving from physics to applied mathematics and then further to pure mathematics. Even physics, though based on observation, relies heavily on a sense of intellectual beauty. No one who is unresponsive to such beauty can hope to make an important discovery in mathematical physics, or even to gain a proper understanding of its existing theories. In applied mathematics - for example in aerodynamics - observation is much attenuated and the mathematical interest often predominates; and when we arrive at pure mathematics, for example, number theory, observation is effaced altogether and experience is alluded to only quite dimly in the conception of integers. Pure mathematics presents us with a vast intellectual structure, built up altogether for the sake of enjoying it as a dwelling place of our understanding. It has no other purpose; whoever does not love and admire mathematics for its own internal splendours, knows nothing whatever about it.<br><br>And from here there is but a short step to the abstract arts to music. Music is a complex pattern of sounds constructed for the joy of understanding it. Music, like mathematics, dimly echoes past experience, but has no definite bearing on experience. It develops the joy of its understanding into an extensive gamut of feelings, known only to those specially gifted and educated to understand its structure intimately. Mathematics is conceptual music - music is sensuous mathematics.<br><br>And so we could go on extending our perspective, until it took in the entire range of human thought. For the whole universe of human sensibility - of our intellectual, moral, artistic, religious ideas - is evoked, in the way illustrated for music and mathematics, by dwelling within the framework of our cultural heritage. Thus our acknowledgment of understanding as a valid form of knowledge foreshadows the promised transition from the study of nature to a confrontation with man acting responsibly, under an over-arching firmament of universal ideas.<br><br>*<br><br>And here he attacks the brute scientism of this time (which is a feature again shared with Midgley):<br><br>*<br><br>p.20 I agree that the process of understanding leads beyond - indeed far beyond - what a strict empiricism regards as the domain of legitimate knowledge; but I reject such an empiricism. If consistently applied, it would discredit any knowledge whatever and it can be upheld only by allowing it to remain inconsistent. It is permitted this inconsistency because its ruthless mutilation of human experience lends it such a high reputation for scientific severity, that its prestige overrides the defectiveness of its own foundations. Our acknowledgment of understanding as a valid form of knowing will go along way towards liberating our minds from this violent and inefficient despotism.<br><br>-<br><br>Dermot.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c4575518749253477531 title="comment permalink">7/14/16, 9:21 AM</a><br><br>

Profs who are busy, and are rather Aspergery in character, and are perhaps even a bit lonely, and are inclined to be rather trusting (they are not blessed with the deep reserves of cynicism we may hope to find in police detectives, or again in monastery abbots) make fine targets for manipulation. <br><br>This might end badly.

I accordingly write "====2====".) <br><br>Although largely agreeing with your various contentions this week, I do have to add a few brief sentences of corrective to the following remark in your current essay: <i>/.../ specific blindness seems to be hardwired into another mode of education, one that’s both prestigious and popular these days: a scientific education—that is to say, a technical education in the theory and practice of one of the hard sciences.</i> Although one can hardly dispute the charge of "specific blindness", it does have to be added that the current system offers not one but two cultures in "scientific education" in "the hard sciences", and that these two are dissimilar. <br><br>Take, as an illustration, the University of Toronto main ("St George") campus. (A) On the west side of St George street is the physics tower, with a nice adjacent 1950s-heritage brick lowrise for astrophysics. On the same side of the street, not too far away, although in three separate places, are three separate centres of pure mathematics - the Maths Dept, the maths library, and the Fields Institute. (B) On the east side are multiple buildings for engineering. <br><br>East is east, and west is west, said Kipling, and ne'er the twain shall meet. <br><br>I am rooted in the west-side culture. I think I speak for many when I say that the east-side culture is, on the whole, rather bad news: maths regarded as a mere tool, I believe, and connections with corporate money outright celebrated and flaunted (there is a "Hall of Fame" in one of the engineering buildings, explaining with little vitrine exhibits how Prof. I.M.Doing-Ratherwell helped develop Ontario tantalum mining, or how Prof. Plutus designed a new kind of hydraulic control for that evil which is the passenger jet). <br><br>We give the east side more respectability than it deserves, since our culture (as some other JMG ADR commentator lately remarked) fetishizes technology. The social-wellbeing truth is that we should have no home computers, no passenger jets, no private motorcars (the cops, the doctors, and the like do admittedly have to have cars), no broadcast television - that, in short, we should be back at something like the technological level we were attaining in 1914, the year future historians may well be taking as a convenient start-marker for the Collapse of Western Civ. But because technology is presently fetishized, we are tempted to paint physics as above all the search for more elementary particles, to seek an "application" even for General Relativity (there is one big application, namely GPS - but this we need just as much or as little as coffee percolators need steering wheels), and so on. <br><br>As real science commits suicide, through the unwise mass-media pronouncements of the Cohen-Tannoudjis and Penziases and Baliunases and Soons, engineering will to some extent endure. The warlords will need their drones. Perhaps the remote future of the University of Toronto is one in which "applications" still get explored in those labs on the east side of St George, while the west side is mothballed.<br><br><br>Hastily, respectfully,<br>hoping that science education is destined to be duly dissected at JMG's ADR and elsewhere <br>with mention of the academic divide between theoretical work and engineering, <br><br><br>Tom<br><br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a> <br><br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c1931965434450848423 title="comment permalink">7/14/16, 10:43 AM</a><br><br>

I used to collect conspiracy theories, but after a while I ran into one that stated that many of the conspiracy theories were disinformation to discredit the real theories, and that the definition of a conspiracy also included the official explanation, which meant that what we were looking at were competing theories. I settled on "I don't need to know the truth to know I am being lied too", and that regardless, most don't affect my day to day life other than general directions the world is going. <br>For your homework assignments, I tried to read Henry James "portrait of a lady", then the De Sade link from someone in the comments. With both I found a bigger gulf from the class issues than the age differences.

The explanation given by the scholars is that both creationists and engineers think in terms of intelligent design (I wonder if a similar correlation exists today between computer geeks and creationists? "Information"!)<br><br>You´re statements about politics are spot on. This is one of the reasons why Plato was wrong when he attacked democracy with the argument that "just as a ship must have a competent captain, and only one, and you can´t have the crew elect him, a state needs a competent leader", etc. The leader of a state isn´t like a ship captain. (Of course, Plato - on the standard interpretation - was a utopian, so in his strictly ordered state, I suppose there could be "captains".) In a real state, there is always "class struggle" and/or attempts to mediate it. <br><br><br>As for scientists, I think both they and "real" intellectuals would love to have political influence, are resentful because they don´t have it, or (in some cases) wrongly imagine that they *do* have it. This often leads to conundrums of various kinds. Sometimes, the cluelessness of scientists is almost comic - regardless of what you think about Greenpeace or genetic engineering, it´s not savvy to attack them in a way that simply confirms the picture of arrogant "Nobel Prize winners" in an ivory tower looking down on the common man. The fact that politicians aren´t Platonic captains, doesn´t mean they should be clueless! Another classic was the attempt to rebrand atheists as "Brights"... <br><br><br>As for Dawkins, I think one of his problems is that he constantly repeats the same sound bites over and over again... They may have been interesting the first time, but the shtick is getting old after 10 or 15 years! He tried to rebrand himself as an anti-Muslim tweeter on Twitter, but it seems this too has grown old (perhaps surprisingly). Today, Dawkins is even attacked with impunity by the "SJWs", suggesting that he has lost his status as a culture icon. I kind of like the old rascal and his gung-ho documentaries, despite not being a hard-core skeptic myself, but his reductionism and purely negative criticism of religion/spirituality was, I think, destined to have a relatively short shelf life within the general culture.<br><br><br>One of my fears is that science and the scientific method (which are indeed achievements of the human mind) will be destroyed by the cluelessness of really existing scientists themselves... <br><br>I sometimes feel *they* could need an authoritarian captain to navigate the stormy seas of the long descent!<br> <br><br><br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c1252836573018449886 title="comment permalink">7/14/16, 1:32 PM</a><br><br>

One, it is almost always stated as a problem, and they have the solution. However, when pushed to specifics, the best case solution to even 100% ceasing of burning fossil fuels will take over a hundred years to return to normal. The other issue is that it is stated as 100% man-made problem, with man-made solutions possible. I believe that climate change is occurring, but am not sure it is all mankind's fault, or even if burning carbon fuels is the main driver. If the main message was that climate was changing, (not just heating as originally stated) the end result is that we are now in a predicament, and need to be working on solutions to survive. What we see is big celebrity spokespeople burning lots of carbon, working on schemes to extract and skim wealth from the regular economy, with no practical result.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c5042075221302850218 title="comment permalink">7/14/16, 2:41 PM</a><br><br>

I finally went to attend a conference where the leaders of the organization were speaking (I was around 13 or 14 at time), and during the Q&amp;A I asked them some questions: one was about the 4 million years worth of pre-human hominids in the fossil record, and whether they are transitional forms that pose a challenge to creationism. Their answer was that God created them to “prepare the Earth for the creation of Man,” My other question was, if everything on earth was created for the benefit of humankind, why were there so many species that went extinct before humans were created. Their answer to that one was that God had to keep the earth populated with a large amount of biomass for eons before he created humans, because he needed to ensure that humans were endowed with the biodeposits necessary to launch and sustain a global high technology civilization that could ensure that Christ’s followers could distribute the gospel throughout the world in a short time, rather than a long time. That conference turned me into a reluctant theistic evolutionist, and was the beginning of a long journey. So I got to work through the logic of engineer thinking… and out of it at a fairly young age.<br><br>One thing that does concern me about the crisis of legitimacy in science is just how complete it could be, and how irreversible. There are some aspects of our scientific knowledge that we may have only had one shot at gathering, especially in paleontology. In addition to depleting natural resources for economic growth such as fossil fuels, we’ve also depleted our reserves of actual fossils. Would a combination of peak fossil, and a revolt against the sciences potentially lead to a permanent loss of the records that allow us to see how whales, birds, and humans evolved, and what the deep history of the planet looks like? If our civilization rejected that, we might be the last civilization to have that chance, and the best records of the evolution of life might never have a chance to emerge again.<br>In some of your early posts on this project, you’d explored the possibility of nature religion as a new religious sensibility, and that such concepts as human kinship with other life, the smallness of humanity in the eye of deep time, and human impacts on the environment as playing a major role in the mythos and ethos of our successor civilizations. In your solstice trilogy, you even had a culture that treated the Origin of the Species like scripture. Has the new sensibility ship pretty much sailed as anything that’s ever going to appeal to any but a tiny few? A part of me had been thinking that there’d eventually come a point where we realized that ecological devastation, recourse overuse, pollution and climate change and an array of other factors had run their course, some form of environmental ethic on a collective scale would follow… now it looks much more likely that we’ll be blaming religious freedom, racial and gender equality, homosexuality, and any number of other things unrelated to the causes of our downfall… and ultimately placing the blame on the scientists who tried to warn us themselves… which ensures that there isn’t going to be much of a place for an ecological worldview in the world that comes out of this one…<br><br>“Let them perish, and all their works, their names, and even their memories. Let us destroy them all, and teach our children that the world is new, that they may know nothing of the things that went before. Let us make a great simplification, and then the world shall begin again.”<br>-Walter M.

So my training only reinforced what was there. So politicians are likely those whose propensity is both getting attention and problem solving in a social way (ie: they like negotiating - or at least until our country became so polarized). Scientists like problem solving, but only if the problem keeps still and doesn't talk back! ;-)<br><br>I do wonder these days if it's just too complicated to manage, even if we are aware of these different kinds of skills.

If resources are meager anyway, the choice between "free trade" and "protectionism" (or open borders and immigration) will no longer be decided solely on the basis of interests, but on that of values - perhaps to a larger extent. If free trade can no longer entice the majority with promises of a higher standard of living, why not choose protectionism, even if it makes us somewhat poorer (or seemingly so), since we at least can keep our independence?

Facts, I told her, are things you can verify mathematically, chemically or physically; truths, I told her, are beliefs, values and attitudes that you can’t scientifically prove and don’t need to. Everyone’s entitled to believe their own truths, but they have to back up their facts. (Of course, we come up with more complicated nuances as part of the game.)<br><br>I’m amazed at how often people confuse these things. National Geographic magazine, for example, ran a cover story last year on “anti-science” beliefs, with a list of common examples on the cover -- “Climate change does not exist,” “The Moon landing was fake,” and “Vaccinations can lead to autism.” Fair enough; climate change is fairly well-established, and links between vaccinations and autism seem to have been disproven.<br><br>To my dismay, though, they also included the line, “Genetically Modified Food is evil” – a disingenuous addition, as “evil” is a moral judgement. Genetic experimenters can splice insect genes into a berry or grow a human ear on a mouse for amusement, and that's fact; only we can decide whether they should. <br><br>Similarly, I saw a recent magazine article that began with a list of things “you shouldn’t be allowed to believe anymore,” beginning with “that vaccines cause autism,” and “that gay people shouldn’t get married.” Whatever your opinions of gay marriage, I was astonished that people would confuse that value-based question with a scientific test result. <br><br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c6995998680738243466 title="comment permalink">7/14/16, 4:03 PM</a><br><br>

I suspect part of the reason is because there is a willingness to change one's position when one treats a decision as a problem to be solved rather than a battle to be won, and politicians today seem to do the latter without exception.

I can't do anything about how the environmental "movement" has conducted itself over decades, but I can do the face to face political work this particular organization is doing now: circulating in-person petitions, writing and soliciting hand-written letters to elected officials and letters to the editor, and (on occasion) lobbying in person in my state capitol. Our current efforts are focused on public support of the Clean Power Plan, a too-little too-late (and highly complex) measure created by the EPA and the Obama administration. It mandates state-by-state programs (to be designed by the individual states within a common framework) to reduce carbon emission from electrical power plants by about 30% (varying a little by state) by the year 2030.<br><br>Why am I bothering, considering that the work is way outside my personal comfort zone, the Clean Power Plan looks like it will be tied up in court for years, carbon emissions from my state's power plants are already going down at a faster rate than the plan mandates, and it will likely all be moot by 2030 anyhow? Partly because my state, Pennsylvania, is a major exporter of electrical power to other states, so how its citizenry and government respond could be influential regionally and possibly nationwide. Pennsylvania has been part of the historical origin of U.S. coal, oil, and gas production, so it seems fitting. Partly because even token efforts to reduce power plant emissions have a good chance of resulting in useful gains in conservation, renewable energy, and grid resilience. And partly to influence my fellow activists by example. (Many of them are young urbanites, and already have small footprints, but others are fellow suburbanites who are often rather surprised to learn that it's actually possible to walk six miles each way to attend an event. Sure they can't yet imagine doing it themselves, but it lends weight when I tell them they're fooling themselves if they expect to reduce carbon emissions without reducing energy use.)<br><br>But I can't say those benefits add up rationally to being worth the effort. Intuitively, I feel it's the right thing to be doing right now, and I don't know exactly why.<br><br>Interestingly, a clear majority in all demographics in PA appears to be in favor of measures to reduce carbon emissions despite the expected costs in e.g. higher energy prices. The salaried liberals want to save the planet (without changing their lifestyle, of course) and think they can afford it. The already-struggling urban working and lower classes aren't expecting their kids to have class immunity from the eventual consequences, and are already using less energy themselves, so they see little downside in supporting reductions. (Their kids are also the ones getting asthma attacks from particulates from dirty power plants in their neighborhoods). The rural working class is more ambivalent, being directly threatened both by energy policies (higher fuel prices, loss of coal and gas income) and by climate change effects (on agriculture, for instance), and so is far from united either for or against climate measures. The main political opposition really does seem to be from moneyed interests influencing the legislature, rather than from some broad class or racial contingent that distrusts the science.<br><br>I look forward to reading, in two weeks, your thoughts about the un-discussed interests aspects of climate measures. Who would be expected to pay seems pretty clear to me, but the "who would be exempt?" aspect is one I hadn't considered. I assume the answer is more complex than "the wealthy, as usual."<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c3443859179036506265 title="comment permalink">7/14/16, 7:49 PM</a><br><br>

Plus, your mention of class interests makes a good jumping off point and I've been wanting to introduce you to the [anti-]economist, Steve Keen, for some time. First, a couple of quotes:<br><br>"I see the main class struggle in Capitalism as not Workers vs Capitalists, but Workers vs Finance. And the tragedy is that Finance is winning under Neoliberalism. But of course it leads to a crisis. And we need to say directly what's happened and take that battle on... to abolish private debts, and to use the capacity of the state to do it," Steve Keen, (20m 05s). <br>Steve Keen: The Alternative to Neoliberalism <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXSmaPGmEVU<br><br>[Describing the ultimate end-point of the "bad equilibrium" in his model:]<br>"...And then the Employment Rate plunges because the increase in Debt is now more than counter-acting the fall in Wages Share. But the last people to know Capitalism is coming to an end are the Capitalists because for a while those two forces balance each other out... and everything's fine for them until the [private] Debt Ratio goes exponential and the Profit Level collapses. So the Capitalists are the last to know their system is coming to an end," (32m 19s). <br>Inequality, Debt and Credit Stagnation by Professor Steve Keen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY5rto-ivoA&amp;list=PLeTlY33FDoJzvjsQoLBbCHiJFa2LmVJNH&amp;index=6<br><br>His basic starting point is three definitions that he turns into partial differential, non-linear dynamical equations to model the economy. His conclusion is that because banks create money endogenously when they issue loans, rising private debt-to-GDP ratios and rising inequality are symptoms of an economic system headed towards a financial crash. His work was first published in 1995 and he started warning about the Global Financial Crisis in 2005. His theory explains why most of the world is stuck in economic stagnation: net-new loans and gov't deficits are the only two mechanisms for creating money - which creates growth in a monetary system - and both have stalled out. Most people are [sensibly] trying to deleverage, and government austerity means they can't do so without shrinking the economy.<br><br>I hope you take the time to peruse a couple of his seminars, which are posted on YouTube. The two I have linked to are excellent primers, as are:<br><br>Why Capitalism Needs a Modern Debt Jubilee to Survive<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpfLiKRqhQw&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLeTlY33FDoJzvjsQoLBbCHiJFa2LmVJNH<br><br>Talk to Bristol University Rethinking Economics Society<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCKo9HxgDrk&amp;index=12&amp;list=PLeTlY33FDoJzvjsQoLBbCHiJFa2LmVJNH<br><br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c3028485123142286374 title="comment permalink">7/14/16, 8:12 PM</a><br><br>

It is only very recently that I have developed more appreciation for the soft sciences especially history. Wikipedia has been a great source to quench my thirst of knowledge for history. Part of my interest was sparked due to your extremely interesting writings on western roman history and particularly your thoughts on its collapse.<br><br>I have some observations to make<br><br>engineers are not trained to simply solve problems. We do try to figure out how to avoid and reduce the problems. I work as a software engineer and that is why we have something called QA/Testing to try to avoid problems. Apart from QA/Testing, we frequently do something called as Root Cause Analysis to figure out why problem occurred and if possible how to avoid it.<br><br>You are looking at brexit rather simply as a case of elites vs non-elite classes. However in my opinion, that is rather simplistic. The exact vote percentage is 52 vs 48, this is rather more close. And this is a very divisive issue, there was campaign to have a revote and that campaign attracted 4 million votes. And you have in my opinion failed to look at it from the angle of old vs young people. There was a yougov poll which showed a majority of young Britishers cutting across all types of class, gender and race voted overwhelmingly for Bremain. The question then arises as to what old people want to establish with their brexit ? do they want to go back to the glorious past of british colonialism and british empire ? <br>And I think there is an amount of racism and xenophobia towards non-britishers involved here. The old britishers who are not adequately skilled to take on competition from the young folks from outside Britain are the ones who votes overwhelmingly for Brexit.<br><br>In this article, you made a point about why don't powerful western companies give away their technology for free to help third world farmers. I get your point about the hypocrisy, but I think trade and globalization does benefit poor people all things considered. I come from a poor country called India and I have personally benefited from the offshoring and outsourcing as I work in a global MNC. But having said this I do realize, though I am well paid by Indian standards, by US standards of professional class I am not well paid and by US CEO standards, my salary is probably 1/1000th or something. I realize the wage gap is significantly high across all developed countries, but it is especially worse in US compared to even other developed countries in EU and countries like Japan, South Korea etc.<br><br>Lastly, I dislike feudalism. I come from upper-caste and I know first hand the drawbacks of feudalism. Lower castes are not going to go back to feudalism, ever. They are not going to allow the system to go back to a state where upper caste lord over lower caste ever again. That phase is over at least in India.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c1298869632007746420 title="comment permalink">7/14/16, 9:44 PM</a><br><br>

That's why I am trying to apply the scientific method and prove myself wrong. For example, I don't think climate change movement ever had a chance. Yes, some activists approached it the wrong way, but there were plenty of people doing the right thing and they got ignored (or killed, like the activists researching Amazon deforestation). The explanation is very simple: the world is too big for us to stop the tragedy of the commons. It's true for air (CO2) for oceans (over-fishing) etc. <br><br>On a different note, I am shocked how many people continue to misunderstand your criticism of the science (or maybe I misunderstand you?). Just because humans are fallible and corruptible and this ruins science as a social endeavor, that does not reduce the power of the science as a tool for investigating the world (and even ourselves, Buddhists use something similar in meditation). <br>The reason I bring this up is all the comments I see from people that are YEC or CC deniers or moon landing hoaxers etc.<br><br>One quick reply to Nestorian: I am not trying to be snarky but of course creationist are better at logic (or rather sophistry), that's all they have. Remember that logic is just a tool, not a goal in itself. And one of the reason the anti-YEC people are mean is just simple exhaustion after rehashing the same arguments millions of times.<br><br>I listened recently to John Searle's chinese room analogy and I tend to agree with Chris - he does not touch on anything related to Turing test. He does point to the difference between understanding and parroting (like JMG says) but that has no bearing whatsoever on the question if the brain is just a UTM (universal Turing machine).

Slightly off topic, but its worth noting the lengths the National Executive Committee of the UK labour party are going to, to try and prevent Jeremy Corbyn winning the Labour leadership again. Firstly they voted 18 -14 to let him take part in the contest automatically. Great you might think. But the NEC rules are crystal clear that he doesn’t need any ballots to take part, so why did 14 vote against them? They have introduced new rules so that the thousands of new labour party members who have joined recently can’t vote for him. They have also banded all local branch meetings of the labour party in the meantime, to try and stamp down his support as well. It’s clear that the labour establishment will do everything they can to try and force him out. The idea that this may in some way backfire does not seem to have occurred to them. I suspect he may win even a larger mandate, and in turn this could lead to a split in the party. Corbyn’s appeal is he is seen as an anti-establishment character to voters who are fed up with hollow rhetoric from Blairite clones. He is seen as ‘one of us’. Labour party members like his policies that are likely to benefit them more than all the neoliberalism they have subject to for decades. Corbyn does not fit the standard mould of what is considered a ‘leader’, but that simply reinforces the ‘one of us’ image.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c9211423822816864162 title="comment permalink">7/15/16, 12:56 AM</a><br><br>

This debate is similar to the discussion of whether science and religion can or should occupy separate domain. I view there being two kinds of "truth": narrative truth, which include values and factual truth. Science seeks factual truth. The missing piece is that while there can be multiple valid narrative truths, narrative truths can be invalid. I would define an invalid narrative truth as one that conflicts with factual truth.<br><br>Using the Brexit example, there can be reasonable value and narrative truths on both the remain and leave side of the camp. If someone bases a leave narrative largely on an incorrect fact that there were 30 million migrants in London competing for jobs, or if someone bases a remain narrative on the incorrect fact that income increases from EU membership was exactly distributed among populations, both narratives would be invalid.<br><br>As an engineer and scientist myself, I give the scientist/engineer emphasis facts more benefit of the doubt, but I still agree with most of your arguments. I would argue that both the engineers/scientist and political scientist mindsets are needed though for healthy debate to both weed out factual errors from the discussion while maintaining the ability to compromise between conflicting valid sets of values and narratives. The problems arise when the engineers/scientist focus too much on errors in minutia facts and miss the forest for the trees or when political scientist get their facts so wrong that their narrative can't hold together.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c1858901662999275863 title="comment permalink">7/15/16, 4:38 AM</a><br><br>

Until approximately the start of the 20th century, science and engineering operated almost entirely within domains where that was mostly true. Sure, a bridge might collapse or a steam boiler explode from time to time, but that had to be (and usually could be) attributed to some specific error such as a miscalculation or some particular overlooked variable.<br><br>(A perfect divine Creator would of course not be prone to such errors or omissions, so even a deists' God who did not intervene in the world would still have anticipated everything that ever happens in it.)<br><br>That, I'm pretty sure, is the reason why the "mad scientists" of literature had to be mad! Madness was the only justification for the "contradiction" of how a scientist could be able to create something but unable to predict or control it.<br><br>With our current awareness of nonlinear dynamics, complex systems theory, and chaos mathematics, the false equivalence between reductive understandability and behavioral predictability is no longer tenable and is being abandoned. (This appears to even be affecting some of the aforementioned deist views in interesting ways.) But not everyone has gotten the word. Engineers and most scientists still work primarily within established regions of stability and predictability. In many cases they, like most people, are unaware of how unusual those regions are within the overall space of possibilities—even to the point of being unwilling to accept the well-evidenced conclusion that the extreme behavior of a certain engineered structure that departed the stable region due to certain extreme conditions was neither precisely predictable nor surprising in hindsight.<br><br>So we have a public convinced that because forecasters can't correctly predict the weather all the time, they are only pretending to understand anything about how weather works in the first place. Mad meteorologists! And biochemists, and neurologists, and seismologists, and ecologists, and epidemiologists… It's a horrendous communication problem.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c7266835519038404565 title="comment permalink">7/15/16, 7:36 AM</a><br><br>

They were were professional rhetoricians and logicians, and were highly venerated among the elites, who would market their ideas, products and policies as being endorsed by this or that well-known sophist and therefore worthy of public respect and admiration, much like today's celebrity scientists (as in the cases of the appeal to authority examples referenced in this week's essay). The fact that regular people failed to be as impressed as the elites who staked their reputations on sophistic endorsement can be seen in the rather more pejorative legacy of the word "sophistry."<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c8771780660166086446 title="comment permalink">7/15/16, 9:02 AM</a><br><br>

Even though I am a charter reader of this blog, I have never felt quite at home in its general cultural atmosphere, due to the fact that my fundamentally orthodox Christian convictions are rather alien in that atmosphere. So I want to say that this generally positive reaction to one of the culturally most reviled aspects of traditional Christian faith (including among many traditionally-minded Christians themselves) helps make me feel a bit more at home here, and in the Peak Oil community generally.<br><br>Another general comment I have to make relates to JMG's prior reading assignment of reading a book promoting ideas that the reader finds repugnant. For those of you who might want to undertake this suggestion with regard to Young Earth Creationism, I have two particular suggested readings:<br><br>1) "The Modern Creationist Trilogy, Volume 2: Science," by Henry Morris and John Morris (1996).<br><br>2) "Shattering the Myths of Darwinism," by Richard Milton (1997).<br><br>Both are available cheap on amazon and the like. Henry Morris is probably the single most prolific Christian creationist writer of the 20th century; he also happens to have been a professor of hydraulic engineering who authored a standard textbook in the field. Richard Milton is a British science journalist who is actually quite hostile to Christianity, but who is more than willing to engage in irreverent attacks against the scientific establishment on account of the gaping logical and evidential holes in many aspects of scientific evolutionary orthodoxy. <br><br>Later today or tomorrow, I hope to write another post that addresses some of the particular issues raised in replies to my original post.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c5955167122864461599 title="comment permalink">7/15/16, 9:28 AM</a><br><br>

Maybe she reads the Report.<br>I don’t know if we have an “official” stance, but I can tell you my personal stance at this point. According to the most recent review of vaccination policies across the globe, mandatory vaccination that doesn’t allow for medical exemptions is practically unheard of. In most countries, people trust their regulatory agencies and have very high rates of vaccination through voluntary programs. In the US, however, regulatory agencies are routinely packed with corporate lobbyists and CEOs. So the foxes are guarding the chicken coop as usual in the US. So who wouldn’t be skeptical? I think dropping vaccinations rates that can and must be fixed in order to get at the vaccination issue: the widespread distrust of the medical-indsutrial (sic) complex.<br><br>Vaccines in general have made a huge contribution to public health. Reducing or eliminating devastating diseases like small pox and polio. In Canada, where I happen to have some numbers, hundreds of annual death from measles and whooping cough were eliminated after vaccines were introduced. Still, vaccines should be treated like any medical procedure–each one needs to be tested and regulated by parties that do not have a financial interest in them. In an age when industry lobbyists and CEOs are routinely appointed to key regulatory positions through the notorious revolving door, its no wonder many Americans don’t trust the FDA to be an unbiased source of sound advice.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c8909320707816276677 title="comment permalink">7/15/16, 9:31 AM</a><br><br>

First off, a very large thank you for the work you do, and how you have helped me to break through some of my own disfuntional narratives. I've read almost every post since that first one, and it has been worthwile each time. <br><br>It's really intersting to hear you speak on brexit, migration, class-issues, The scientific establishment etc in the way you do. It's so depressingly rare these days to come across a narrative that's not just the same old 'neolib establishment' or the 'alt right anti-establishment' point of view.<br><br>A good friend of mine (ex-environmentalist), recently revealed to me, that he is now a full-blown (pretty far) right libertarian. He is a very honest &amp; intelligent (and even spiritual) individual, so our recent conversations gave me much material for contemplation. A lot of his opinions came as quite a shock to me (making me want to yell nazi-moron schoolyard insults at him), but I held back as I could see that he clearly had a couple points. <br><br>I'd be very curious on your thoughts on a few of the issues we've been discussing.<br>First off, (you've touched on that a bit already) environmentalism &amp; climate change. One thing the right is obviously pretty worked up about atm is Political correctness. Ie - because there is so much silencing of dissenting voices in the environmental movement it must all be joke, created by a joint-operation of corrupt scientist and a power-hungry government.<br><br>How do you view the level of corruption within the environmental sciences especially climate science? Or this more just right wing propaganda?<br><br>Second, Anarcho-Capitalism. It seems to become increasingly popular these days, especially amongst people who spent too much time on youtube. I wonder whether you've come across the influential poster-child of anarcho-capitalism, Stefan Molyneux? He has managed to built up a cult-like following (like seriously cult-like, involving cutting off your all your family ties etc...) esp among young male adults, by posting hour-long youtube videos about the evils of centralized government, and what not. <br>all in all it's a further perfect example of another utopian political philosophy, derived from a single ethical principle. (I guess this was more a comment than a question, but mabye you've got some thoughts to offer..)<br><br>best regards,<br>Jeff<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c3104488547851956831 title="comment permalink">7/15/16, 9:56 AM</a><br><br>

Always amazing how often one needs to make this point about values and interests not being the same as objective facts. From where I'm sitting (academia) this reluctance to recognize the reality of the irreducibly subjective elements of human social life has a lot to do with the ongoing backlash against the lazier exponents of post-Nietzsche relativism and the excesses of "critical theory." All of this got mixed-up into a toxic stew, that left people searching for some new authority. But those in the thrall of "Science" forget that Nietzsche wasn't just knocking over idols for kicks - he was right about many things. Namely that science, as a consequence of its own best methods, can't supplant religion in the emotional and psychological life of a culture. One sees this desire even among otherwise very astute philosophers of science, who really should know better.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c4836636239687336288 title="comment permalink">7/15/16, 10:44 AM</a><br><br>

She released a video statement: "Donald Trump and Mike Pence: building a great, big, beautiful wall between America and progress."<br><br>It’s interesting. I recall once reading about a speech given by Alfred E. Smith, governor of New York in the early 1900s. I can’t remember the contents of the speech but I believe it was about child labor laws. He made an appeal to morality and what struck me was that he made reference to something in the Bible. I can’t recall exactly what. It was an appeal to the authority of a book which, although I personally would consider an authority on moral matters, I would never expect anyone on the street today to take seriously as an authoritative text in a public speech. How strange, I remember thinking, that such an argument—an appeal to religion—could work back then. Yet how powerful and effective. It left me wondering if such an appeal to religion could ever be employed today. If so, it certainly would be less effective in today’s unraveling culture.<br><br>I guess we have our answer. It’s just not an appeal to the religion that most people assume—or I myself had assumed at the time—is the most popular religion in America.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c1110709469830349768 title="comment permalink">7/15/16, 11:15 AM</a><br><br>

The professor was a terrific teacher, a very personable, knowledgeable and enthusiastic authority on the subject. He was a local go to expert for News crews whenever events of a geologic nature took place. Whenever there was a heavy season of rain the professor would be on the News talking about how heavy rains cause landslides in the West hills of Portland, Oregon. <br> <br>One day in class I asked a question of the professor: Coastal bluffs at Arch cape on the Oregon coast had been rapidly eroding away for decades. My uncle had built a cabin there back in the late 1950's. The area was forested and stable into the late 1970's but then after extensive logging, sections of the bluff began falling away during heavy rains. <br>Over two decades, our family saw the original 100 feet of yard on the seaside of the cabin get reduced to about 6 feet. Other cabins along the same bluff had fallen onto the beach 50 feet below. <br> <br>A class lawsuit had been brought against the logging companies by residents and owners along the bluff who had seen their property eroded away. The hills above the bluff had been clear cut and the resulting landslides and mud earth movements had obviously triggered the erosion and destruction of the bluffs below. But the residents did not win their case. <br> <br>Years later, when I asked the professor about this, he responded in a hostile and defensive way that was very uncharacteristic of him. I am sure the entire class felt the ire in his response. He began by saying that "the people who build down there were fools". The land along the bluff is geologic slate and so is inherently unstable and so on. The clear cutting did not cause the bluffs to erode, it was the geologic slate. <br> <br>I was so shaken by this out of character, aggressive and illogical response that I did not know what to make of it. Not only did he call my uncle a fool in front of the entire class, but he made no mention of the lessons he already gave the same class having to do with how deforestation can cause landslides. How many thousands of years had those bluffs been there without experiencing rapid erosion before the 70's clear cuts? Later it occurred to me that this well known and highly regarded professor must have been hired by logging company attorneys to provide expert testimony in the class action suit. They paid him to lie. He was not about to contradict his previous testimony in a class when questioned about the same formation. <br> <br>This was a sad lesson. If this very smart and prestigious head of a Univ. Geology dept. can be hired to give false scientific testimony, then how common it must be that public issues today are tainted by similarly purchased expert opinion, when we know that so many scientists and science grads are unemployed, underemployed or low paid when they are employed. <br><br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c1976883001937893177 title="comment permalink">7/15/16, 12:47 PM</a><br><br>

In order to wring as much meaning as possible out of the texts, many forms of interpretation have been used, including symbolic ones. This practice goes back two thousand years. <br><br>The doctrines of Biblical literalness and inerrancy are primarily tenets of Protestant fundamentalism. They arose out of two needs that the Protestant movement had: that Jesus's resurrection be regarded as a historical event that took place on a specific date, and that the Old and New Testaments by themselves are sufficient guides for a religious person. The Orthodox and Catholic branches of Christianity don't rely directly on the Bible as the sole authority, rather the Bible as applied and interpreted through the ages by the teachers and institutions of the Church. That's what Luther tore down.<br> <br> Judaism does not depend on belief in the historicity of any one marvelous event. To the extent that Judaism is a revealed religion, the revelation was or is (opinions differ) cumulative. Rabbinic Judaism thinks that studying Biblical texts together with later commentaries in a group discussion under the guidance of a learned teacher is far better than just reading the Bible by itself. What a day might have been before the Sun existed is not a problem that greatly troubles Jewish readers of In The Beginning, because it's not the point of the story.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c1797730950225700138 title="comment permalink">7/15/16, 12:53 PM</a><br><br>

Modern mapping techniques using radar confirmed that coastline in, I believe, 1957. Hancock's work has been comprehensively rubbished down the years as has that of his colleague Robert Bauval who worked on the theory that the Sphinx was eroded by water, which dates it many hundreds of years prior to current egyptology dating.

I think a lot of folks in America are deeply embarrassed by Trump. He embodies every crass absurdity about America they hate. Stepping back a little bit, the opinion overseas, to the degree it is not influenced by hysterical US-dominated TV coverage, seems to be that Trump is 95% crazy and 5% patriotic, putting him head and shoulders above his treasonous opponent (lifted from someone over on the Saker's blog). I am reminded of a joke I once heard about a team of anthropologists from Harvard going into the wilds of Oklahoma and reporting back that the natives were superstitious, loved rituals and would gather in colorful, boisterous festivals each week to worship a giant named Gard. Seen from this perspective, they are not quite as threatening. But it is an uprising of the natives, and I fear what firepower the US will use to put this one down. I suppose my biggest concern is that if it doesn't get its way, the US elite will do a primadonna and call in a nuclear war.

We have all seen this movie many a time - the entrepreneur who tries his hands at politics because everybody knows that running a business is exactly like running a country (http://www.salon.com/2015/09/11/the_gops_autocratic_businessman_obsession_why_running_a_company_is_horrible_training_for_running_the_country/), the MBA who just knows that it does not matter what industry he goes into as what he learnt getting his MBA applies everywhere (http://www.personneltoday.com/hr/why-mbas-can-be-an-expensive-mistake/) or the Silicon Valley billionaires who figure that they should be put in charge of their own society so long as they get to scrape the rest of us off their boots (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Californias &amp; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueseed) but you get the idea.<br> In thinking this over, perhaps the underlying fault-line is that modern humans way of thinking is still stuck in old patterns and modes and is just not up to task anymore. We actually need to revamp the way that we think in everyday life. De Bono's Lateral Thinking (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking) was a recognition of this simple fact. The state of modern education thus becomes a reflection of how faulty our way of thinking has become.<br> If anyone doubts this, consider the following examples of where our way of thinking has failed us. Fact, that after two centuries of modern medicine, there is still no simple statement of what the optimum daily diet of an average human being should be. Seriously, this should have been nailed down a century ago. On a deeper level, we have had philosophy in a developed form for thousands of years but there is no agreement on how a good life should be led. From the outside, it seems that this field of learning was abandoned to religions in favour of more esoteric philosophical points long, long ago which is why for most people philosophy, rightly or not, is simply regraded as irrelevant for everyday life when it should be at the heart of everyday life.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c488115186804138558 title="comment permalink">7/15/16, 6:35 PM</a><br><br>

These people are selected by those people who are chosen by these other people, and your vote has some influence on who one of the last category is? That doesn't make the first category elected. The core of democratic process is that the people get to select, by vote, the people who make the laws. The more layers of insulation you put between the people and the lawmakers, the less democracy you have. <br><br>Professor D., the acceptance of tectonic plate theory was a good deal more complex than that! I watched it happen, so can testify to this, and it's only in very recent years that there's been an attempt to insist that the scientific community didn't reject it at all. Your broader point, though, stands; Thomas Kuhn's discussion of the way that "normal science" does its level best to ignore anomalies is highly relevant here. <br><br>Over the Hill, the difficulty is of course that this word "science" means so many different things. It means skeptical inquiry. It means a set of beliefs not yet disproven. It means a constellation of influential institutions that claim the exclusive right to say what is and isn't truth, and constantly maneuver to expand its share of government and corporate largesse. It's in the intersections and deliberate confusions between these very different things that the trouble comes.<br><br>Nrgmiserncaz, exactly. This notion that the privileged owe nothing to the rest of society, even when the latter is what supports and makes possible their privilege, is one of the sure signs that tell you that a privileged class is about to end up dangling from lampposts. <br><br>Varun, by all means use it! <br><br>Spinozarina, many thanks for the data points. <br><br>Donalfagan, it's good to see that they recognize the huge issue around irreproducibility. That's a stake through the heart of science. If results are not systematically checked for reproducibility, then science isn't happening -- it's as simple as that. <br><br>Hereward, the Piscean age wasn't very Piscean, all things considered! By all astrological logic, the greatest and most brutal campaign of conquest in the history of the world -- the conquest of most of the planet by a handful of European nations -- should never have happened in an age ruled by the least warlike of the signs; nor should such forerunners as the Mongol conquests and the rise of the Ottoman Empire. That is, I'm far from sure current ideas about the implications of precession hold water when compared to the evidence from history. <br><br>Dermot, I'd call it more a transition from fact-centered to value-centered thinking, rather than from facts to values, but that's a quibble. <br><br>Onething, I wasn't praising peer review as such. I was praising the ostensible goal of the scientific process, which peer review sometimes furthers. <br><br>Dermot, so noted!

I think you are arguing outside your area of expertise as you have stated that you never play these games. <br><br>You are right of course that games are designed to be played and solved and therefore are not a good model of the real world. However 99% of my real world problems were also designed by humans, and many of them can be solved by looking around for the solution in a similar way to in a game(maybe not 99%, call it 50%). A sub-set of problems exist which are not at all like a game. Thankfully I do not only play games and have the real world experience to deal with these problems as best I can. <br><br>You argue that when presented with a predicament with no simple solution I will be more confused than my non-computer playing counterpart. I could argue with the same logic that reading fiction books makes a person unable to see the real world for what it is, that instead they merely see fixed narratives and unalterable story-lines which is not the way the real world works. If you had never really lived in the real world and read nothing but fiction you might be socially inadequate and unable to cope with the randomness of the real world. Such people as exist who only read books or only play games will no doubt be confused and frightened by reality. You might counter this argument by saying that most people understand that a book is just a book. But I also understand that a game is just a game and not a basis for understanding reality. <br><br>A computer game can be more than just a simple book-style storyline with some target practice thrown in these days, featuring moral ambiguity, unsolvable puzzles, multiple choices and blah blah blah I could go on for pages, but you wouldn't know about that as you don't play, in fact I would guess you actively avoid knowledge of the subject. And in discussing this I am just trying to bring one of your very own cognitive biases to your attention. Not because I think it is important for you to face it but because it rankles me to be told that I will struggle to make real world decisions. It would no doubt rankle you if I said that pulp sci-fi and fantasy rots your brain(incidentally I love a good sci-fi book).<br><br>I can of course see your point, but would refine it to say that if one plays a lot of games growing up and never examines how the real world differs from them would be bad for ones understanding. But most young people will come against these differences on a regular basis in their school and work lives. And there my rant ends. <br><br>Oh and the article was great and very thought provoking as you can see.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c7534134908581861117 title="comment permalink">7/16/16, 12:56 AM</a><br><br>

It's exactly b/c Trump is such a polarizing figure that I volunteered for his campaign. There's a skill to phone banking and even door knocking, and that's when the issue/candidate is not as polarizing as Trump. The goal is to find, identify, and motivate supporters, not waste time arguing w/opponents. For the 10-15 mins. you spend in a counterproductive argument, you could have hung up, put on the "do not call" list, and moved on to the next call/door to identify a supporter. As a call center veteran, it takes a special kind of psychology/magic not to personally take on people's tirades, and I fully expect phone banking for Trump will yield some doozies. I'm expecting that a lot of his volunteers won't have experience, so training them will be important.<br>Secondly, America's very essence in one of isolation, insularity, and provincialism. It's who we are as a people. It's who we are geographically, with two huge oceans separating us from both the Eastern &amp; Western Old World, and an even more geographically isolated northern neighbor. It's why people come here. We don't speak second languages, we don't measure in metric. We're a very bad superpower, we're very bad at diplomacy, we simply do not belong on the world stage. As a nation, we should only be slightly more open than North Korea. The biggest tragedy of all this is plopping a poor kid from rural Tennessee or inner city LA down in a Middle East that he knows nothing about and is totally baffled by to fight a guerrilla war. If Trump offers some small chance of returning the US to it's insular, provincial roots and backing away from neoliberal empire, he should be given the opportunity.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c6460060973740127745 title="comment permalink">7/16/16, 7:45 AM</a><br><br>

If, as JMG says, white privilege is on the way out, and we are becoming a "minority majority" nation, it makes sense not to approach minorities monolithically. Trump seems to realize this, as he has avoided saying anything negative about the black or LGBT communities, and has often been supportive. Then again, studies show that immigration hurts black employment, and the Islamic world is among the most homophobic. So black interests are different, to say the least, than Latino interests, and LGBT interests are different, to say the least, than Muslim interests. Lumping them all together under some monolithic "minority" umbrella is a disservice at best. No wonder Le Pen is polling 25% in the Marais. It does seem to be a time for LGBT conservatism. There are now rainbow versions of both the Gadsden and Rebel flags.

The basic reason IMO would be that he is more interested in being called Mr. President and making money off of his improved “brand”, than he is in actually being President.

It's seems surprising (said the interviewee) that evangelicals would support a three-times married man with a history of adultery and no good credentials as a Christian, but the thing is that Trump has promised to make Christian evangelicals important in public life again. Cruz (supposedly the evangelicals' favorite) only promised to make room in public life for evangelicals, and to keep them from being pushed aside and overruled by "secular" and non-Christian interests, but Trump promised to bring back the days when Christians were (or at least perceived themselves to be) dominant and central in this country. "We won't be saying 'happy holidays' any more; we'll be saying "Merry Christmas!". <br><br>My comment: I guess we can put that alongside his promise to coal miners in West Virginia to bring back coal, and his promise to farmers in California to bring back water for farming.

After reading your post, I opened Jose Ortega y Gassett's <i>"The Revolt of the Masses"</i>. In Chapter XII titles <i>"The Barbarism of Specialisation"</i>, Ortega analyzes the evolution of the the modern clueless specialist, whom he calls <i>"the learned ignoramus"</i>.<br><br>He says that the reason behind this is that the modern people of science are "narrow specialists", that is, they don't know much about anything outside their own field. But this will not make them hesitant to pass judgement on other aspects of life, because they are so self-confident from their success in a narrow field that they forget they really know or understand very little about the world.<br><br><i>"For, previously, men could be divided simply into the learned and the ignorant, those more or less the one, and those more or less the other. But your specialist cannot be brought in under either of these two categories. He is not not learned, for he is formally ignorant of all that does not enter into his specialty; but neither is he ignorant, because he is "a scientist", and "knows" very well his own tiny portion of the universe. We shall have to say he is a learned ignoramus..."</i><br><br>I have seen this life several times: the post-doc professor who has forgotten how to teach basic concepts to undergrads; management suits from top business schools who are clueless about human behavior; several educated, affluent people who complain that their life is awful, while even the most cursory glance at people around them and history will indicate that their life is objectively better, etc.<br><br>Ortega suggests that this is a self-terminating feature built into our modern civilization, which will bring its end.<br><br><i>"the civilisation of the last century, abandoned to its own devices, has brought about this rebirth of primitivism and barbarism"</i><br><br>If he is correct, I am sure we will see even more clueless words and actions in the days ahead.<br><br>Ramaraj<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c3052791200836170838 title="comment permalink">7/16/16, 10:25 AM</a><br><br>

Blairites have imposed candidates upon the local constituencies that the constituency bases didn't want. Classic example is Angela Eagle, the atrocious challenger to leader Jeremy Corbyn. Socialist Labour members spent years doing backbreaking work to narrow a huge Tory safe seat to a 256 vote marginal. Once it seemed that the local lefty (Lol Duffy) was close to winning, Labour centrists like Frank Fields asked Labour members to vote Tory to keep him out.

Or, it has developed into a kind of cynicism here....(Not that the Cynics weren't actually a school of philosophy back in THE Athens. I'd love to know more about them). I think you'd agree with me, it's important to keep ourselves open to alternate possibilities. AS I have been saying, Trump and Clinton aren't far apart : two sides of the same coin. It does seem sadistic to want the former, a bit sado-masochistic to desire the latter. What you have made clear to my fogged-over mind is that this election, at least in the way Trump has garnered support without even really trying, is unprecedented. The guy is running neck and neck with the establishment candidate and he does nothing but get (free) negative press (publicity). It is amazing. But here I am running my mouth again when I should be out exploring my neighborhood. Final thought: this is virtual space.

Now the wall finally collapsed.<br><br>Well, I'll start by not getting a car (it only goes 3.5 mph and I'll use it little during college), delaying my computer upgrade for a year (it's fast enough for my games and the next gen will be better) and setting the air conditioning 2° higher (preparation for the future).<br><br>I'll take on electrical/electronic engineering as a hobby. Do you think that's safe for the next 20 years?<br><br>However I think the collapse will start sooner rather than later. Since 1960, a recession has happened about every 8 years. We're due for one within a year or so. I just think this recession will start the collapse, considering the debt piling up, low interest rates, and slow growth. This time the investors might realize the recession isn't temporary like the last one, and their growth expectations are all false.<br><br>Also I think we're at the peak services+food+industrial output, looking at the Limits to Growth graph. I know it doesn't make specific predictions, but it seems like the 8-year cycle is timed perfectly with the peak.<br><br>But you're right, I'm just in doomsday mode, maybe because modern culture can only think of either business-as-usual or doomsday.

The ebb and flow of civilization as a whole (particularly Western civilization) may well be more in tune with the theorized "Planet Nine" which, if it has an orbit closer to the 20,000 years that is the maximum projected, would change signs roughly every 1600 years which would be in keeping with the Bronze Age/Roman Empire/likely timeframe for full modern collapse.<br><br>@Fred<br><br>I have noticed this too.

It's not that we've achieved equality, not by a long shot, but just that we've accomplished as much as we possibly can under the Civil Rights/equality paradigm, and our most pressing issues are not to be solved w/in that paradigm. We need to move on to other, more pressing issues. I know I've gotten a lot of pushback for suggesting such a thing.<br>Somebody had mention the black community as an exception to peak working class wages in the 50s-60s. From my understanding, the black community is not an exception, b/c the black community was disproportionately affected by the deindustrialization of the urban rust belt starting in the 70s. There was only a tiny window between the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the onset of deindustrialization w/oil embargoes of the 70s.

As for "healthy lifestyle choices," though, please remember that we're talking about some of the poorest people on the planet -- Third World subsistence farmers. What they get to eat is rarely a matter of choice, you know. <br><br>Toomas (part one), I also worked as a research assistant for a time, when I was finishing my degree. The research team in which I was a lowly work-study student, doing bibliographic work, engaged in straightforward experimental fraud -- a series of experiments that were supposed to be double-blind were nothing of the kind, and the people whose job it was to assess the data knew exactly what they were supposed to find if they wanted to keep the grant money flowing in. Of course they found it. I've had a hard time with claims about the honesty of science ever since. <br><br>Patricia, if Sanders sold out to get something into the platform, he's a chump. Both party's platforms go straight into the recycle bin the moment the election is over.<br><br>Alvin, Taleb is almost always relevant!<br><br>Toomas (part 2), that's an interesting point. I haven't noticed, though, that theoretical scientists are any more adept at politics than applied scientists. <br><br>Grim, of course! The word "upgrade" always means "make it more complex" these days, and for reasons Joseph Tainter sketched out in detail, at this point along the curve of increasing complexity, that amounts to "make it worse." <br><br>Avalterra, the funny thing is that up here in the north central Appalachians, I have yet to see anybody doing the Pokemon Go thing. <br><br>Dennis, it would be interesting to research the correlation between the spread of CAD programs and the rate of catastrophic design failure...<br><br>Tidlösa, the funny thing there is that in the days of the Spanish Main, pirate ships inevitably elected their captains, and managed prodigious feats of seamanship under that elected leader. That is to say, Plato was dead wrong. So are the scientists -- and I suspect you're quite right that a lot of it is simply the craving for unearned power that pervades so much of contemporary life. <br><br>Dennis, good. Yes, and we'll be talking about this shortly. <br><br>Eric, dead on target regarding climate change. Have you noticed, too, that whenever something climate change activists have been warning about starts to happen in a big way, they stop talking about it, or even insist that it's no big deal? It's really quite eerie, in a way. <br><br>As for the change in religious sensibilities, no, I don't think that's over. We're still in the very early stages of that game. That's going to take another post, but have you noticed how many hardcore defenders of scientism are overtly or covertly contemptuous of living nature? They're the ones who are waxing rhapsodic about space travel and uploading their minds into robot bodies, after all, while it's more often people more detached from scientism who are expressing the ideas of the new religious sensibility.

Read any good cookbook that has country recipes from an East Asian society, and you'll find quite a lively assortment of vegetable crops alongside the rice. <br><br>Tidlösa, an interesting speculation. We'll see...<br><br>Brian, yes, I've seen the same thing. It's very easy to set up a straw man saying "GMOs are evil" and thrash it; it's far less comfortable to talk about why people distrust the big corporations and their pet scientists who are trying to push GMOs on the world. <br><br>Christopher, you've simply demonstrated that these days, people who are into politics suffer from another form of political stupidity, and I won't argue with that at all. The fact remains that scientists who try to intervene in the political arena routinely defeat themselves and undermine the causes they support, and that's worth talking about. <br><br>Shane, good. Sam Harris is a fine choice -- the combination of saliva-flecked fury and hamhanded misrepresentation and cherrypicking of facts is worth the $1.48 price of admission. <br><br>Rita, thank you for both anecdotes! I love the attorney's comment...<br><br>Cherokee, among many, many, <i>many</i> other things, yes. <br><br>Myriad, kudos for rolling up your sleeves and getting to work. If that's the thing you feel you should be doing right now, go ye henceforth and do it. <br><br>Adrynian, long time no see! Thanks for the heads up -- I'll put Keen on my get-to list. Does he have books you can recommend? I'd much rather get ideas that way, as compared to seminars. <br><br>Siliconguy, one way or another, those four guys on horseback will be making that decision. <br><br>Indian Blogger, of course some of the people who voted for Brexit were motivated by racism and xenophobia. My point is that trying to claim that this was the only motivation is dishonest, and attempts to erase the interests involved on both sides. <br><br>Unknown, no, you understand me perfectly. Science as a method of inquiry is one of the half dozen or so truly great creations of the human intellect. Science as a human institution, staffed and paid for by fallible human beings, is no better than the people who participate in it, and is subject to all the usual human troubles.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c505987220400042585 title="comment permalink">7/16/16, 11:29 PM</a><br><br>

This is the first time in a generation that ordinary British voters have had the chance to cast a vote in which all sides aren't supporting the same "benefit the affluent, screw the working poor" policies, and they turned out in droves.

PV panels seem to function as religious totems to a lot of people on the greenward end of the left. Believe in them, and ye shall be saved! Our weather is sultry, sweltering and damp -- pretty normal for the area, all things considered, but summer is my least favorite season here. <br><br>Averagejoe, the Blairite "New Labour" types are trying to defend a state of affairs in which only those policies that benefit the affluent can be brought up for discussion. Corbyn is kicking holes in that setup, so yes, they're terrified. The irony here is that if they throw him out, they guarantee the emergence of a new party that will render theirs as irrelevant as the Liberal Party became in the early 20th century. <br><br>Scotlyn, hmm. When each party regards the other as an object to be manipulated -- whether the manipulation is for advantage, on the part of the dominant party, or survival, on the part of the subordinate one -- how much actual communication takes place, and how much vanishes down a corridor of mirrors where each party is trying to second-guess the effect of a communicative utterance on the other?<br><br>Unknown Eagle Eye, so noted -- but why, then, the proliferation of crackpot literature from engineers, when the influence of check-writing bosses is rather less at issue? <br><br>Chloe, I think it's more complex than that. I've seen repeated collisions with unwanted facts cause people to rethink their values, for example.<br><br>Doc Tim, I certainly don't suggest that the scientific or engineering mindsets can be dispensed with! It's simply that the acquired political stupidity that seems to come from a modern scientific education has itself become a massive political fact in our time, and needs to be discussed if we're to make any sense of our predicament. <br><br>Shane, and it's also a year in which a lot of people have their backs to the wall. That breeds anger and hatred. <br><br>Unknown, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Myriad, I think there's more to the mad scientist motif than that. The madness of the mad scientist shows in his willingness to create things that <i>can't</i> be predicted, and his lack of interest in the consequences. "I shall make a giant robot with death-ray eyes!" "But, Professor Zardek, what will it do once you make it?" "Who cares -- it'll be so fun to watch!"

All of the rice-eating cultures I've spent time with consume a healthy amount of fruits and vegetables and have traditional knowledge of wild plants with which to supplement their diet. Aside from folks that couldn't give a fat rat's bottom about vitamin A deficiency, the only other people that might benefit from golden rice would be prisoners who cannot obtain vegetables. It would probably be preferable to the mouldy rice of the same color.<br><br>@A Post-Milennial, I share Nastarena's problem of Paypal not liking me. Since I do not remember in what form I told it my mother's maiden name, I cannot use it. Could I send you a good-old-fashioned check?<br><br>@Everybody, finally back on topic, the University of Colorado School of Engineering recognized how poorly educated the average engineering nerd was in the humanities, at least in the late 1970s when I went there. So they required us to take a certain number of humanities classes, and put forward some recommendations for the confused. Thus in my freshperson year I took a literature for dummies sort of class with a bunch of other engineering students, and they had us all sit around a big table facing each other. I still recall the twelve other silently miserable or annoyed faces I saw twice a week. Not a one us us had a clue what the right answers were that the teacher (poor guy) was attempting to elicit from us.<br><br>That flopped, but later on there was as philosophy for engineers class that I was persuaded somehow or perhaps required to join, pass/fail so we didn't have to worry about getting the wrong answers, and the teacher was brilliant. That class is one of the few things I really remember from my schooling (along with the teachers of my Japanese and anthropology classes--they were great). The most important lessons that he got across to us were "progress" might not be "upward" as such, which could lead to a dead end (like a minor peak on a major mountain) if we did not take account of the whole terrain; and that once you worked through your figures and solved a problem, you needed to step back and determine whether or not the solution you had was realistic. I knew from experience that it was too easy for me to get off by an order or so with minor errors, but he also gave us an example of an ice cream cone. You can stand it on its pointy end, and theoretically there is a position of perfect balance, but even in an ideal situation of no wind, given an infinitesimally small point, the probability of it staying standing is also infinitesimally small.<br><br>The class got us to think about reality, but I also recall a more mature lady student in my senior year advising me not to let schooling get in the way of my education. That made me think, too, but it wasn't until I graduated that I finally had time to begin observing people and learning things of real value.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c5516594466343920218 title="comment permalink">7/17/16, 2:26 AM</a><br><br>

Engineers are accustomed to performing projects. Writing a book is a project. If your lifestyle is one of running the business for the boss for your 8 hours a day, and then enjoying leisure, your crackpot theories may be more likely expressed in a conversation over a beer or two, but not a book.<br><br>2. Engineers tend to have more income than average. Self-publishing requires discretionary cash. A crackpot without the cash to self-publish would have to get his manuscript past a publisher.<br><br>3. Engineers may be thought to have more credibility than the average crackpot, so a publisher has <i>something</i> to put in the bio-blurb on the book jacket. An engineering degree may not be the best credential to cite, but a better credential may defeat the development of a crackpot theory in the first place.<br><br>4. Engineers may be more susceptible to finding The Flaw in the conventional wisdom, because preventing engineering failure often depends on identifying crucial details in designs or materials. I'm thinking of a subtle geological feature that could put a sinkhole under a highway, a missing minor component in an alloy, or a minor contaminant in a chemical feedstock. Details matter. But being unable to resolve the flaw can lead one down the rabbit hole into wonderland.<br><br>5. Engineers, having passed through a relatively rigorous program of education, tend not to be bothered by the fact that most other people don't see things the way that they do. Those other people simply need to be better educated, which provides motivation for writing (crackpot) books.<br><br>In summary, the existence of a crackpot book requires not just a theory, but also a belief that others will appreciate the theory if they hear of it, the ability to put the theory into manuscript form, and the ability to get a manuscript published.<br><br>Why, yes.

The original use in Western astrology has nothing to do with zodiacal location: it has to do with planets making aspects to specific stars by paran. That is, if a planet rises, sets, culminates or crosses the IC at the same time as a specific star (1 degree or 4 minutes of time orb), that aspect is activated. Notice that this varies by latitude! Current practice has nothing to do with the way it was done originally; this just might have something to do with why the subject has been marginalized. The limited testing I’ve done shows that the original method works quite well, and it lends itself to a strictly observational astrology that has no need of calculations.<br><br>Re: voting<br><br>I’ve had to tell two people so far that I’m voting for Cthulhu.

In my youth the age of the earth did not seem to worry any of the pastors or teachers who taught me the truths of our faith, including my parents. <br><br>Later on, after I left my faith, my father and I argued about creation/evolution (though he was not passionately "young earth" per se) and later again, I came to the conclusion that in those debates we had both fallen prey the same foundational assumption. That for one to be true it was necessary for the other to be false. <br><br>I no longer think this way. I see both evolution (in all of its diverse tellings) and creation (in all of its even more diverse tellings) as narratives to weave human meaning out of the strands we can disentangle from the chaotic mess that is data in its raw state. <br><br>There is nothing in the evolutionary narrative that entails that creation cannot be true. And there is nothing in most creation narratives that entail that evolution cannot be true (although unless one adheres to an extreme form of relativity, probably a story aeons long will not reconcile with one only a few centuries long).<br><br>And the rabbit hole that these debates become is because simply finding holes in the other narrative is reckoned by ALL parties to be sufficient to claim "success" in upholding one's own. <br><br>Nestorian, I'm glad you've dared to name your faith here in a blog so expertly moderated that you could do so with confidence.<br><br>As for myself, I would say my personal disagreement with the YEC creation narrative is that the meaning woven out of it is too small - I cannot conceive of so many billions of galaxies, so many billions of micro-critters, each with unplumbed complexities, purposes, interior lives of their own, being brought upon the stage simply as props to a short little story about us humans and a small little God with no interest in the rest of the "props". <br><br>I can grasp that we humans obviously *think* we must be the whole point of creation (or of evolution), but I can't see the God that Haldane famously quipped was so "inordinately fond of beetles" agrees with us. <br><br>But in any case, the meaning you weave from the story you tell is your own, and no one should think it necessary to demolish it in order to uphold theirs. In my view, none of us have the "god's eye view" or the "omni-science" which science tries to have after dispensing with God. But we each can weave a cloak of meaning that suits us, that cements our place in the world and guides our relationships with who we will encounter there.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c5980782855064145752 title="comment permalink">7/17/16, 6:42 AM</a><br><br>

Jorgensen,<br><br>To answer your question briefly, I am a YEC because I have a vested interest in the historicity of the Gospel accounts of Jesus of Nazareth's death and resurrection. After I became sufficiently familiar with the Judeo-Christian scriptures about 10 years ago, it finally became clear to me that the historicity of the Gospels stands or falls with the historicity of the early parts of Genesis.<br><br>This is, of course, a circular mode of reasoning, in that I am presupposing a faith-based conclusion and then creating an intellectually plausible conceptual edifice that encompasses biblical studies, ancient history, empirical science, etc., to sufficiently justify that conclusion to myself. This deviation from the strict requirements of logical thought cannot be avoided, as all reasoning involving faith-based pre-conceived beliefs as conclusions to be justified is circular in this way.<br><br>The thing is that this circularity applies to the evolutionary position also. The atheist philosopher of science Karl Popper famously (or infamously, perhaps) demonstrated that evolution is a non-falsifiable proposition, and thus falls outside the realm of being provable by the scientific method. Just like with my belief in the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, the belief in evolution, once presupposed, can be bent and adjusted to any conceivable set of empirical scientific data. As such, no set of empirical data could ever possibly disprove evolution to someone who remains doggedly committed to believing in it. <br><br>A good example of this metaphysical, non-scientific, faith-based sort of stretching of the data to fit the evolutionary presupposition is the use of punctuated equilibrium in biology, and of neo-catastrophism in geology, to accommodate the burgeoning of scientific data to the increasing untenability of neo-Darwinian and Lyellian gradualism, respectively in the 1970s and 80s. <br><br>YEC polemicists quite justifiably hammer away at the way in which this shift from gradualism to saltationism revealed that the evolutionary position is ultimately just as faith-based, and just as logically circular, as the creationist attempt to maintain the resurrection by accommodating scientific data to a literal interpretation of the Scriptures.<br><br>At the end of the day, if both positions are logically circular, there is no need for me to feel intellectually inferior to evolutionists.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c7522061130593040026 title="comment permalink">7/17/16, 6:39 PM</a><br><br>

On the one hand, I'm quite aware that vaccination has saved countless lives, and some of the claims made about its noxiousness don't hold water. On the other hand, some of the claims about specific vaccines do seem to be well founded, and the arrogance and obvious conflicts of interest on the part of medical science are both massive problems. "A worthwhile technology, increasingly badly mishandled" might sum things up. <br><br>Jeff, there's been some evidence of massaging of data in climate change science, though nothing like as much as the right likes to claim. The joke's on our species, though, because even the estimates based on fudged data are turning out to be way too conservative -- things that were not expected for decades are already happening. As for anarcho-capitalism, I glanced over it years ago and rolled my eyes -- it's a very familiar kind of nonsense that catches on among the clueless privileged, who haven't noticed that the rule of law established by government is the only thing that keeps their privileges intact, their wealth protected, and their throats uncut. <br><br>H. Bustos, agreed -- most of the people I've encountered who think they're post-Nietzscheans, or for that matter anti-post-Nietzscheans, don't appear to have grappled with the issues Nietzsche raised at all.<br><br>Blue Sun, exactly. "In the way of progress" -- such perfectly vacuous buzzwords, given apparent meaning only by the folk mythology of our time!<br><br>Matthias, look into the rise of the mystery religions and Christianity in the late classical world. As I read it, it was exactly the failure of rational philosophy to solve the problems of that age that drove so many people to religious revelation instead. <br><br>Blue Sun, Pence is impeachment insurance. Trump knows perfectly well that he's likely to end up facing a Democrat-controlled Congress at some point in his time in the White House, so he wants someone as VP that Democrats absolutely can't stand. <br><br>Ed-M, that is to say, we have a kleptocracy rather than a democracy -- a system in which those with influence use it to plunder the system. That also has its rules. <br><br>Nick, yep. I've seen the same thing way too often. <br><br>Sara, Hancock frustrates me, because he combines a lot of interesting material with an inattention to historical detail that I find embarrassing. I've read most of his books; all things considered, though, I find Hapgood's original book better. As for May, yes, that startled me. If the Tories actually follow up on May's words with actions to better the lives of working class Britons, Labour is in even deeper trouble than it presently appears to be.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c3285212436180945324 title="comment permalink">7/17/16, 6:53 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, indeed, it's going to be a very rough road from here on down!<br><br>Barrigan, fascinating. I haven't read much recent science fiction at all -- I got bored several decades ago with the endless rehashing of the same old themes -- so had missed that. <br><br>Shane, experienced hands are exactly what Trump doesn't need. If he tries to pursue this campaign along the lines of ordinary politics, he might still lose. He wins by going right over the heads of the political system, speaking to the people, and saying the things they want to hear -- which are not the things Clinton or any of the Dems are saying, now that Bernie's dropped out. <br><br>Kevin, no, there you're falling into a common fallacy. There is no optimum diet shared by all human bodies, because human bodies differ from one another in a galaxy of ways due to heredity, environment, health conditions, and life history. Thus they need different diets. In the same way, there is no definition of the good life that fits all, for the same reasons. Human beings are not interchangeable components, and the modern attempt to treat them as such is at the root of a good many of the preventable disasters of our time. <br><br>Mark, interesting. Many thanks for the input!<br><br>Allexis, I've discussed this with college professors, and they say the same thing -- their students who play lots of computer games are consistently bad at solving real world problems, and the more obsessively they play them, the worse they get. The thing I'd point out is that nearly all of the problems faced in the real world are not deliberately designed and set up by human beings for the purpose of entertainment, the way problems in computer games are. As it happens, I would readily agree that too much science fiction reading also leads to certain cognitive problems -- you have no idea how often I run up against people whose ideas about technology are completely shaped by science fiction, and as a result they have a very hard time getting their heads around how limited, and limiting, technology actually is. Equally, too much fantasy fiction is not an advantage to the student of occultism, for similar reasons! <br><br>I think it's quite possible to balance computer gaming with plenty of experience solving problems that haven't been invented by a human being for the purposes of entertainment, and avoid the problem I (and the teachers with whom I've discussed this issue, one of whom is a former gamer) have noticed. I trust you'll do that, so that your choice of entertainment doesn't limit your cognitive ability -- just as I balance my reading of science fiction and fantasy with plenty of other material, nonfiction as well as realistic fiction, to keep my choice of entertainment from limiting mine...<br><br>Synthase, yes, you've just demonstrated my point. That attitude makes it impossible for you to relate to people who don't share your ideas about evolution, even if there are plenty of other subjects on which constructive mutual action would be a good idea -- and politically speaking, that's just dumb. By contrast, if you accept that nobody you meet is ever going to agree with you about everything, and learn to look for common ground and bracket the disagreements rather than looking for an opportunity to cast heretics into the outer darkness with wailing and gnashing of teeth, your chances of bringing about constructive change are much higher, and you might even succeed in convincing the creationists with whom you interact that, despite Richard Dawkins, evolutionists really can be decent human beings...<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c3062528942412226408 title="comment permalink">7/17/16, 7:17 PM</a><br><br>

Police in today's America are in roughly the same position as US soldiers in Indochina in the later years of the Vietnam war: thrown into a ghastly, violent, high-pressure situation, all too aware that their leaders have no idea what they're doing and no meaningful strategy, expected to make up for that with inadequate resources and training, and thrown to the dogs when that's expedient for the higher-ups. That's the kind of environment where you get the collapse in morale that resulted in the My Lai massacre, and the hundreds of little My Lais going on each year in this country are the logical consequence. Factor in a nation in accelerating economic decline, and a society fractured along ethnic, cultural, and economic lines, and you've got the incipient domestic insurgency I've talked about here at length. <br><br>With regard to upstate New York, welcome to the rest of America! As for lawn signs, I see a fair number of Trump signs in the poor parts of town, and there was one big Bernie sign in the well-to-do part of Greene Street, though it's been taken down now. I have never seen a Hillary sign, bumper sticker, or button. If Cumberland's a surrogate for middle America, her campaign is in very deep trouble. <br><br>Owen, the thought of engineers as demons reminds me irresistibly of a bit from <i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</i>, so thank you!<br><br>Over the Hill, you're welcome. <br><br>Zach, where did you see that? I occasionally miss something, and that's not a turn of phrase I would normally put through. <br><br>FLwolverine, nah, Pence is impeachment insurance. No Democrat is going to vote to impeach Trump if that means Pence is going to get the presidency. This notion that the Donald is somehow going to step aside and not become president strikes me as a remarkable bit of wishful thinking, by the way; it would be exactly his style to serve four or eight years, and then go on to something else, with all the perks and income ex-presidents get to feed his ego. <br><br>Nestorian, now, now -- the coming of the Antichrist, if I understand Christian theology correctly, is an event ordained by God as part of the sequence that leads to the Second Coming. If God's decided that now's the time for the Antichrist to pop up, who are you to stand in the way? <br><br>(It also occurs to me to ask whether Christian scripture requires the Antichrist to be male. If you want someone who likes to start wars and behaves with a remarkable lack of interest in morality, it seems to me, Hillary Clinton might be as good a candidate. I'll see if I can figure out how to make her name add up to 666... ;-)<br><br>Ramaraj, thank you for the reminder -- it's been way too long since I've read Ortega y Gasset. <br><br>John, I'm not a great fan of the "great ages" concept myself, as you may have gathered! My own astrological interests these days tend to focus on what I suppose you'd have to call early modern astrology -- Alan Leo and Llewellyn George's astrology, the sort that was practiced in the era that gave rise to the occult systems I work with -- and while those give lip service to the "age of Aquarius" business, it doesn't have any significant role in their practical work, which is just as well. <br><br>Thymia10, oh, it's going to get far more absurd.

When games try to recreate real life instead of tell a linear, satisfying story... beware the buttmad.

I think a moderate view is common among people my age, which is to say early Baby Boomers. When we were born, a handful of vaccines existed. If our parents had access to medical care, as infants we received the combination shot DPTP which was for diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and something else that starts with a p. When we were school age we had to be vaccinated for smallpox. Then an effective polio vaccine was developed, and everyone wanted their children to have it, because they remembered Franklin Roosevelt and knew children who died of polio, wore braces on their legs or spent their days in an iron lung.<br><br>I think the vaccine issue illustrates the law of diminishing returns. Smallpox was such a serious disease and so contagious that even the risky eighteenth century version of the vaccine was worth taking as a preventative measure. The other early vaccines were for diseases both contagious and lethal, or in the case of lockjaw, just a horrible way to die. People weren’t as mindful of side effects to medical treatment then, but if they had been, the benefits of protecting one’s children from those diseases far outweighed the risks. <br><br>A lot of the vaccines that have come on the market since the 1960s seem to me to have more even risk/benefit ratios. IMO people ought to be encouraged rather than coerced into receiving them, and requiring infants to be vaccinated for diseases that they are not likely to be exposed to is abominable.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c1360616168452446189 title="comment permalink">7/17/16, 11:34 PM</a><br><br>

They are closed-minded and intolerant on some issues, but the comments sections often include laugh-out-loud runs of wordplay, and some blog entries cover British politics closely. A day or two ago, a comment to one of the post-Brexit blog posts pointed out that the Tories have a history going back more than a century of implementing reforms that benefit the working class every now and then; that their flexibility in this respect is one reason why they have been the majority party in Parliament most years for a very long time. Unfortunately I cannot remember the specific examples of reforms listed in the comment, but there were at least half a dozen of them. This would seem to be an example of Burkean conservatism--make changes when necessary to preserve the class system, law and order.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c5136654649969112437 title="comment permalink">7/17/16, 11:50 PM</a><br><br>

Their acceptance of use of violence to solve problems, bloody murder, revenge portrayed in Iliad constantly - it all confirms what I previously posted. Humans were more violent but more creative and intelligent living closer to nature. Their simple religiosity combined with their obvious worship or admiration of nature taken from this text shows they were not as human centered egoistic as we are. <br><br>Following up on that thought I would ask religionists if perhaps another animal with high intelligence and long life span has a vision of god as being dolphin, elephant, etc and have mythologies perhaps if not orally then telepathically transmitted over thousands of years and if life exists elsewhere in the universe the same phenomenon occurs. We all, all life forms, consider the obvious eternal questions, wherever we come into existence. I read a book by a former fundy who got cured by going to bible university and reading original texts. The copying from generation to generation by monks allowed more mistakes and bias creep in than actual words in text itself. Original text is lost. Meaning is hopelessly distorted by this process and by politics. Science perhaps no better and history as well. Each generation gives everything its own meaning.<br><br>Predicament without simple solution is what we face now. Out of box thinking is not accepted by elite so outsiders like Trump, internet channels win. There are no easy solutions to PO crisis, overpopulation, terrorism, climate change as this is not a chess match. Trump, hordes of terrorists, banking evildoers are like genghis khan.

I could not talke the monolithic pilosophical and rhetorical approach anymore. <br><br>Science and the scientific method are a whole nuther matter of course. They are tools, not a worldview. Turning them into a religion is the problem. As an aside note, something akin to the scientific method (empirical evaluation of ideas by observation and experiment) can be used in other frameworks. The Bible suggests something like this approach when it tells you "By their fruit shall ye know them." <br><br>Dawkins in no way speaks for all evolutionary biologists or other scientists. Many despise his dogmatic atheism masquerading as science. <br><br>And I should note to Nestorian that the changes in evolutionary theory over time are the changes that all scientific theories go through over time as more information becomes available.

With the record low approval ratings both of America's current two presidential candidates have, they're going to have an uphill battle winning the necessary public affection to fit the shoes of that particular villain.

The simplified version is that if you were born at night, that Jupiter in Pisces would be emphasized because of the night rulership, while if you were born during the day, that Jupiter would not get the boost in importance from being in the sign of its rulership. You can see some of this in the Major Arcana of the Tarot, which was used to teach basic astrology during the Renaissance in a way that kept it out of the hands of the Church. The card for Pisces is Fortitude, which, while it’s one of the classical virtues, is not a “nice” virtue: it’s needed during the bad times.<br><br>Jupiter is called the Great Benefic because that’s exactly what it is: in hororary and in transit analysis, Jupiter tends to bring the goodies. It doesn’t say <i>how</i> it brings them, however. One of the very few large-scale studies of the effects of the planets demonstrated fairly conclusively that Jupiter is not a “nice” planet in that regard. Those benefits are just as likely to be unearned as earned, and they’re just as likely to come from someone else’s misfortune than from good fortune that benefits everyone. Jupiter is the heavyweight that gets its own way because it is the heavyweight, not because of any moral or pragmatic goodness.<br><br>As to why your teachers didn’t mention it. A lot got lost during the Endarkenment. For several centuries astrologers were rather thin on the ground; the art didn’t start to be revived until it got included in Masonic symbolism, and didn’t really take off until the latter part of the 19th century. By then a lot had been lost. Modern psychological astrology was a late 19th century invention, motivated by a desire to keep Alan Leo out of jail for fortune-telling.<br><br>I’m hoping that JMG gets into it sometime on the other blog.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c4691603686173059902 title="comment permalink">7/18/16, 8:39 AM</a><br><br>

I looked back through the ADR archives and noticed that my first comment was in 2007 under an alias I used back then. Which in turn caused me to reflect on the deeper impact the posts and conversations here have had personally. One small example: I no longer use aliases online. Just my real name. Participating in discussions here led me to realize that owning my words directly keeps 'em real. Just a small thing, but I’d bet many long-time readers have gained a few insights at the personal, emotional and spiritual levels, as well as in the rational and ecological planes that the blog focuses on overtly. <br><br>Back on topic: The discussion of scientists’ and engineers’ often spectacular failures in the political realm reminded me of the brief flourishing of the Technocracy movement back in the 1930s. I looked it up and found a familiar name: M. King Hubbert, founder of peak oil theory, along with a self-taught engineer named Howard Scott, was one of the founders of this spectacularly unsuccessful attempt to create a new politics based on physical science.<br><br>Technocracy is an interesting case study of science-based ideas combining with political naivety and failing spectacularly in the real world! <br><br>(Which is not to say it was uninteresting.

If it does not, only pushing him ahead in the few that traditionally lean right (all have their biases one way or the other), then I predict he is sunk and after Clinton gets her bump at her convention he will never recover.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c2825921809525885944 title="comment permalink">7/18/16, 10:31 AM</a><br><br>

From the abstract of that article:<br><br><i> (1) Intentionality in human beings (and animals) is a product of causal features of the brain. I assume this is an empirical fact about the actual causal relations between mental processes and brains. It says simply that certain brain processes are sufficient for intentionality. (2) Instantiating a computer program is never by itself a sufficient condition of intentionality. The main argument of this paper is directed at establishing this claim. The form of the argument is to show how a human agent could instantiate the program and still not have the relevant intentionality. [...] “Could a machine think?” On the argument advanced here only a machine could think, and only very special kinds of machines, namely brains and machines with internal causal powers equivalent to those of brains. </i><br><br>I have read that article multiple times and still have with no idea what an 'internal causal powers equivalent to those of brains' which are 'sufficient for intentionality' actually are. Moreover, he states that he is making an assumption here. (Unlike too many authors, he is forthright that his assumption is an assumption.) This is why I wrote earlier, if we take as given his belief about the consciousness (i.e. that it results from certain 'internal causal powers' in brains) that we may conclude that consciousness is what he thinks it is (i.e. certain 'internal causal powers' in brains). If I reject his initial premise, I won't be persuaded to his viewpoint (but may enjoy his paper nonetheless).<br><br>My response to the Chinese Box thought experiment it that it could not pass a Turing test in the first place. For those unfamiliar with this thought experiment, The Box contains a non-Chinese speaking/reading person receiving inputs in Chinese, using a rule book to return designated Chinese outputs. The question Searle poses is does it make any sense whatsoever to say that the Box understands Chinese? But let me ask another question about the Box first: could the box pass a Turning test? <br>I don’t think it could. For one thing, its response time would be too slow to imitate conversation in a way that is indistinguishable from a person. (Turing himself notes that a digital computer would have to be able to respond in a time frame similar to a human to play to pass.) <br><br>Moreover, Searle gives no indication that the person in the box has any knowledge of conditions exterior to the box. Nor does he indicate how the rule book might accommodate that information. So for instance, If I ask the Chinese Box (in Chinese of course) what the weather is like, and it always replies “sunny” no matter what the weather is actually like, then it is not going to pass a Turing test.<br><br>On the other hand, what if we speed up the processing of the Box? We could allow the human processor in the box to consult her rule book at superhuman speeds so that she can return outputs at the speed of conversation, or replace her entirely with a computer or robot that can do so. Add information about the external world that influences its output. (This is essentially the “Systems”/”Yale” reply that Searle considers.)<br><br>Now ask the question, does this enhanced Chinese Box know how to speak Chinese? I don’t think the answer is so clear unless we are willing to import some further ideas about consciousness. If we import behaviorism (as Turing would) then we would agree that the enhanced Box knows Chinese because it behaves as such. Searle might object (and I’m not clear on this point, Searle hedged when I asked him after a guest lecture he gave several decades ago) because even the enhanced box remains overly mechanistic (or at least more mechanistic then we imagine our thought processes to be). Then again, how mechanistic are our brains? Maybe that really is how language works for us?

A recent national poll had the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson at eleven percent. Six polls in four swing states taken about a week ago gave Johnson between six and nine percent. In five of the six polls, Johnson's share of the vote was larger than the difference between the two front runners.

There have been years when celebrity candidates drew enough votes in the actual election to affect the outcome.

Stein's numbers are too low to make a difference, but suppose half of Johnson's supporters think better of it and decide to vote for a major party candidate.

How do you fit the distance measurement of 168K light years to SN1987a into your framework? In 1987 there was supernova, prior to which we had a distance measurement via various indirect means in typical use by astronomers.<br><br>The dying star sometime before it exploded produced rings much like those on Eta Carinae. Some months after the initial explosion we observed light that had reflected off those rings. This gave a rare opportunity of getting a direct measurement with the use of simple trigonometry of 168K light years.<br><br>Of course like Setterfield you can postulate a faster speed of light in the past and get the light to us much quicker, but then it gets to the ring much quicker also and you have to proportionately move the ring farther out to maintain the measured angular distance, so you really just change how far away it is and not how long it took the light to get here.<br><br>Generously allowing that you can tamper with the speed of light without physics coming unraveled, there's also the spectral signatures of Cobalt decay displaying the expected half lives. Consider that Cobalt 56 has a half life of 77 days, and we expect (and did) see its spectral signature. So, in the stream of photons coming from the supernova, there is a bubble in the pipe 77 light days long with predictable spectral signatures with regard to Cobalt 56. Had light speed been faster when the Cobalt was decaying, the bubble in the pipe with its spectral signature would have been proportionately longer.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c7167385656925801229 title="comment permalink">7/18/16, 5:59 PM</a><br><br>

It always is -- find me a campaign to change anything at all that didn't have to deal with a torrent of disinformation from the people whose interests were affected by the change! Successful movements for change counter that effectively; the climate change movement didn't. <br><br>Dermot, exactly. The politics of the last three decades have been predicated on making sure that working people have no one speaking up for their interests anywhere in the political system. Corbyn's putting that at risk; no wonder they're out for his blood. <br><br>Iuval, interesting. I've also been told that in a lot of university programs, the students don't actually do experiments at all -- they run computer simulations of experiments, thus guaranteeing that they get the right answers (and aren't exposed to the equivocal and stochastic nature of much experimental evidence). That plus the process you've described are certain death. <br><br>Gottfried, it's a source of much amusement to me that every time Trump turns around, somebody is claiming that his campaign is self-destructing; then he goes on to win more votes. I think quite a bit of wishful thinking is on display here. <br><br>Bob, yep. The most ummentionable fact in today's global politics is the accelerating decline of US power. <br><br>Shane, I think turkey is really tasty, especially with stuffing and cranberry sauce. ;-)<br><br>Jason, exactly; Trump as a person is far less important than Trump as a phenomenon -- the fact that he's done so perfect an end run around the entire mechanism of US politics is a huge sign that dramatic change is impending. <br><br>Cortes, good. Rationalists always forget that reason isn't an effective way to motivate human behavior -- even among rationalists. <br><br>Hammer, I think electrical and electronic engineering is a very good choice, as electricity's going to be around for many decades yet, and may be maintained on a small scale in some places straight through the impending dark ages. You might consider getting a ham radio license and doing some homebrewing of radio gear, as a good source of real-world experience in improvised electronics. <br><br>Barrigan, that makes sense. Most of what I've done with mundane astrology so far has involved ingress charts for national capitals and the classical doctrine of the great conjunctions, but the movements of fixed stars through the tropical signs are potentially a useful field of work. As for "planet nine," the imagination and discovery of planets is important, and so is their disappearance or downlisting -- the period when Ceres was a planet was also the great era of Romanticism, for example, and the history of Pluto (hypothesized, discovered, and cast out of the list of planets) corresponds exactly to certain definite changes in popular culture, society and technology; a similar case can be made for nonexistent planets such as Vulcan.

The Civil Rights movement accomplished as much as it did because it got the support of the federal government; if Eisenhower, JFK and LBJ hadn't thrown federal troops and the FBI into the mix, the likely outcome would have been pretty grim. Activists have forgotten that, and forgotten also the very complex maneuvering that was necessary to get and keep that support, so they're doing half the Civil Rights movement paradigm, and then wondering why it doesn't work. <br><br>Ed, how old are your boys? <br><br>Synthase, good point -- most "mad scientists" in the media are actually mad technologists, of course. As for the truly great creations of the human intellect, the list I had in mind is spoken language, writing, formal mathematics, logic, mysticism (understood here as the use of meditative and other methods to awaken the less obvious potentials of human consciousness), and the scientific method. I'd be willing to listen to arguments, but to my mind these are the truly towering achievements, the ones that completely transformed how we relate to ourselves and the universe. One implication of the list is that it's very early days yet for science; we're in the initial burst of giddy enthusiasm, after which we can expect millennia of careful sorting, adjustment, and honing, until its potentials have been fully developed. <br><br>Patricia, I remember that sort of literature class -- a total waste of time even for people like me, who weren't engineering geeks!<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c6060527782980056495 title="comment permalink">7/18/16, 7:03 PM</a><br><br>

The ability to work together in social groups is also crucial to survival, you know. <br><br>LatheChuck, ah, but as I noted in the post, it's not just that a lot of crackpot theories get written by engineers -- it's that crackpot theories written by engineers tend to be both wilder and more obsessively detailed than those by non-engineers. You don't get the sort of airy handwaving that Ignatius Donnelly, for example, used to leap blithely over the difficulties with his Atlantis theory: no, from an engineer, you get pages and pages of delightfully absurd calculations and hypotheses. They really were the best. <br><br>Sgage, nice. Thank you. <br><br>Scotlyn, fair enough. That seems like a reasonable extension of Hagbard's Law -- shall we call it Scotlyn's Corollary? <br><br>Mon Seul Desir, the change to white rice may also be a factor, but it remains the case that peasant cuisine in every Asian country whose cooking I know anything about is not strictly rice-based, but involves a fair amount of vegetables, including some with quite a bit of carotene. One of the reasons this was common is that you can grow enough of those vegetables to make a difference in your diet on little scraps of land too small to be economical as a rice paddy under traditional village conditions. The shift away from village-based agriculture to industrial monoculture turned peasants into employees with no land of their own and thus no place to grow vegetables -- ergo, vitamin A deficiency among many other things. <br><br>Grebulocities, many thanks. <br><br>Shane, no, I think Sanders would happily have gone on to run for the presidency and put in as many social-democrat policies as he could. Exactly what pressures were put on him to make him endorse Clinton is an interesting question. <br><br>Tom, exactly -- they want to apply the precautionary principle to climate but not to GMOs. Why? Follow the money...<br><br>Martin, but I said that crackpot literature by engineers was one of the delights of my misspent childhood! Besides, according to William Stukeley, Stonehenge was built by intelligent elephants, so engineers could at most have provided the operating staff.... ;-)<br><br>Submarine, exactly. We're not guaranteed a domestic insurgency in the short term yet, though we could certainly have one. If the pace of extrajudicial executions by police and violent reprisals against police keeps up, I'd expect to see suicide bombings and roadside IEDs by next year at the latest, and then we're in for it. On the other hand, given some serious restraint on the part of both sides, that doesn't have to happen. <br><br>Nathan, so noted and thank you.

I'm not a great fan of the Donald; at a conservative estimate, there must be tens of thousands of Americans who are better suited to become president than he is; it's just that Hillary Clinton is not one of them. Fortunately, since Maryland will vote for Clinton even if she appears on live television in prime time tearing open the throats of cute three-year-old children with her teeth, I can do the same thing you're doing, and put my vote where it will actually make a difference -- that is, to a third party candidate, to help shake up the "two parties, one set of policies" scam that's running this country into the ground. <br><br>Eric, you've earned tonight's Evilly Glowing Star of No Earthly Color for coming up with the most imaginative interpretation of 666 I think I've ever encountered.

So herewith, just a few points that strike me as most relevant taking account of these comments in the aggregate:<br><br>1) I do not reject the scientific method at all. I see neither creationism nor evolutionism as empirically testable as such. Both constitute metaphysical presuppositions that it requires some measure of faith to accept (and also to reject). <br><br>2) The results of empirical science across the full range of scientific disciplines can each be accommodated to both of these competing metaphysical presuppositions with varying levels and degrees of anomalies, paradoxes, and unsolved problems.<br><br>3) After several years of research, I concluded that the number and degree of anomalousness with the results of empirical science is significantly less on the creationist account than on the evolutionist account. <br><br>4) Most evolutionists are blissfully unaware of the extent to which the attempt to reconcile evolutionary presuppositions with the results of empirical science across the disciplines is in fact fraught with anomalies, apparent contradictions, etc., etc. The Young Earth Creationist writers going back to the early 19th century have rendered a considerable intellectual service by pointing these anomalies out. <br><br>5) In so doing, this intellectual tradition offers a way around the cultural stranglehold that the evolutionary camp has exercised on Western Civilization for 2 centuries for those who want to evaluate the comparative merits of creationism versus evolutionism on their own, rather than have the results of the investigation intellectually predigested for themselves.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c5819668352315939750 title="comment permalink">7/19/16, 4:40 AM</a><br><br>

The light from stars appears to bear evidence of a process of stellar creation for the same reason that a newly created tree or animal would already have growth rings on their bones or trunks despite never having been born/sprouted. Even though he created the cosmos at once, he created it to follow the patterns and forms of the rules he laid down for it, so that it might appear very old except for what had appeared in the scriptures. The slightly more eccentric theory I grew up with was called the Gap Theory and posited that the evidences of an old earth and cosmos were remnants from a prior creation which was destroyed, and that the beginning of Genesis is better read as “the earth became without form and void,” but that particular view was a fringe view even within creation research. The mature creation theory is part of the reason creationists insist on a distinction between “experimental” and “historical” science, since what appear to be long unfolding processes according to the present laws of nature may well be illusions cast from creation having been initiated in order to follow certain natural patterns. It does a good job of preventing the philosophy from becoming easily falsified, but it also seems to me like it could just as easily be used to support the theory that the earth was created last week, and our memories of life before then are implanted… It turns into one of those philosophies like the brain in a vat theory that is fun to play with but difficult to find a practical use for unless you have a strong investment in it being true. And, since there’s nothing in Christian theology that explicitly requires young earth creationism being true, with evolution being officially accepted by most mainline Christian denominations… and there’s only pressure to believe in it if you’re invested in one very particular form of literalist interpretation of scripture (there are biblical literalist ways to argue for theistic evolution and old earth creationism)… it is very difficult to convince anyone who disagrees… and even people who are invested are going to have to devote a lot of time and energy to defending their stance against every new piece of data that comes in independently without stepping back to look at the big picture (at least that was my experience as a YEC when I was younger).<br><br>@JMG: That’s what all you false prophets say.

Individuals were perhaps creative geniuses but had nothing to work with whereas as a society we can all build upon what others give us in infrastructure and culture. Individual identity being less important than the group intelligence as evolution of bees, ant colonies. So our evolution is individually 'regressive', collectively'progressive'.

Mass media perhaps better. Problem is introducing enough genetic variety to maintain intelligence, robustness without destabilizing system. They are trying that now in USA, Europe. Is perhaps better long term to have a very mixed population which eventually is unique like in mexico or brazil. Worst situation is where everyone intermarries and cultural stasis or low intelligence, low disease resistance results. Is Japan better off? Pakistan with 55% cousin marrying?

These days we are constantly pestered to donate money for research to cure various medical problems. I remember only one campaign of this kind in my childhood: the March of Dimes. Its goal was to find a cure for polio. It was highly publicized and people went door to door collecting donations. The purchasing power of a dime was equivalent to more than a dollar today, and dimes had Franklin Roosevelt's head on them.<br><br>Instead of a cure for polio, they found a means of preventing it, which was a great victory for public health. I believe Dr. Jonas Salk donated his patent rights, so won fame but not fortune. Big Pharma wasn't so big in those days, though the time of cranking out poorly tested new drugs to generate profits wasn't far off. The turning point for people's trust in medical advances was probably when they found out about the effects of thalidomide.<br><br>It didn't escape my notice that when the March of Dimes achieved its goal, it did not declare victory and close up shop.

Be wary of claimed anomolies. About 15 years I took on the task of fact checking a small book two preachers that frequented the area wrote. They relied heavily on writers like Morris, Gish, Thompson, Wysong, the usual suspects. I spent several years locating original sources for the claims. Many trips to a University Geology Library, ordering copies of articles in old out of print journals. I didn't make it all the way to the end (I had had enough), but I fact checked a couple dozen of the claimed anomolies and none of them panned out.<br><br>One did stick in my mind though, was an alleged claim by Bert Thompson of wagon tracks at a fossil bed in Texas which the geologist studying the place claimed were made by snakes. The citation for this was an audio tape by Bert Thompson, I purchased the audio tape to check it out, no mention of wagon tracks.<br><br>I was a regular visitor to the usenet group talk.origins at the time and had access to some paleontologists. Finally somebody gave me a name of who may have worked the site. I contacted him and concluded he was the right person after some correspondence. The property owner was indeed convinced the two parallel marks were wagon tracks, and was continually presenting him with plain old rocks and asking what kind of fossil it was. I asked about the snakes, he said that he did not think it was snakes at the time but really didn't know what made the marks. A couple of years later, he saw marks on a beach that he called "essentially the same" that were made by the outgoing tide dragging debris.<br><br>I confronted the preacher sometime later at a family member's house and asked about the tracks and explained that it wasn't on the citation given. He claimed to be live at that particular presentation and yes Bert Thompson did mention the tracks. I think his claim for that is something I can accept. I speculate that someone pointed out to Dr. Thompson that there were Dinosaur tracks all around, but there were no tracks left by a draught animal pulling the wagon, and thus it was removed from audio tape that was sold to the public.<br><br>In the meantime, some skeletons began rattling very loudly in Dr. Thompson's closet and he found it prudent to retire permanently to seclusion. A decade later he's still in seclusion so I can't find out in his own words the reasoning for removing from the audio that was sold.<br><br>Now the confrontation with the preacher. I wish I had handled this confrontation differently, some family were mad at me. The preacher, in his defense did say he will accept correction and as proof of that tabled paluxy as something he willingly gave up after visiting the site. He said he had some new stuff to send up to me, but never did. A year or so after that his home congregation kicked him out due to a problem arising from or related to plain old money, anybody I asked was embarrassed and really didn't want to talk about it. He hasn't been back to my area since that day.<br><br><br>There was some drama with that, but most fact checking is dull. The TalkOrigins website and google group are good resources for fact checking, lots of stuff there for Morris. Also check the primary source on which they base the claim.<br><br>Also stay up to date with creationist stance on various claims, many of the anomolies that were claimed 20 years ago have now been abandoned.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c5703703176871430140 title="comment permalink">7/19/16, 7:20 PM</a><br><br>

If paleontologists starting chiseling fossil kangaroos out of the Middle Devonian basins in Norway starting tomorrow, I don't think there's anyway you can stretch current Evolutionary Theory to account for it. The theory itself may not be falsified, but some filled in blanks in its notional space would be. Creation Theory would have no problem with it.<br><br>Consider if a new unknown species was discovered that looked like a rabbit, is genetically close to a rabbit, yet it laid eggs from which its young hatched. No problem for Creation Theory, but the chaos it would cause for Evolutionary Theory would be unimaginable.<br><br>Okay, consider the punctuated equilibrium you mentioned. Falsifying it wouldn't falsify evolution as its just a filled in blank in its notional space, and filled in blanks in the notional space have been falsified before. Lamarckism was falsified, now we have epigenetics that has a very small overlap with it. Recapitulation was falsified, but embryology remains. Punctuated Equilibrium at some future date will be refined, or replaced with something that overlaps with it.<br><br>If you falsify some small filled in blank in Evolutionary Theory, you're just removing a blemish and ultimately end up improving it; essentially giving it a shave and a haircut. If you want to take a real bite out it, go for a major organ like Common Descent.<br><br>To go after Common Descent, you really the Nested Hierarchy and the various means it can be recovered.

I have many questions that will probably never be answered. Unless human understanding of the nature of consciousness progresses, at least with respect to understanding how the world is experienced by differently-brained current humans and by other intelligent species, we probably will be unable even to imagine most of the possible answers. <br><br>For example:<br>Did newborn Cro-Magnon infants have bigger heads than human babies today? If so, how did the mothers manage to bear them? Was the mortality rate from childbirth higher? If the infants had the same size heads as now, to grow to full size their childhood development must have been different from modern children, perhaps in duration, in personality development, and who knows what else.<br>Brain tissue is one of the most metabolically expensive kinds of tissue to maintain. What was the Cro-Magnon diet?<br>If they had 150 ccm more brain than us, but smaller frontal lobes, what were those extra neurons doing? I suppose we can make some wild guesses by comparison with what little we know about the brains of other intelligent mammals. The only guess I have any confidence in is that they probably had a much keener sense of smell. That's what a large part of a dog's brain is devoted to. Maybe Cro-Magnons had an innate sense of direction, better memories. Maybe they were more intuitive or telepathic.<br><br>I read a science fiction short story called House of Bones about a band of homo sapiens in a recent ice age when mammoths flourished and Neanderthals were still around. The setup was the usual stranded time-traveler, but the story centered on the culture and social interactions of the people. They had an oral epic about themselves, they were confident and pleased with life. It was a small band and one of their practices was that each of them had a name for each of the rest of them, and all the names were different, so if there were say fifteen people in the group, each of them had fifteen names and each person called you by the name he or she had given you. This seemed plausible to me. If your group's material culture can be mastered by the age of fifteen and basic survival needs don't take all your waking hours to procure, there is plenty of time to develop complicated non-material culture.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c889045971985520575 title="comment permalink">7/19/16, 9:56 PM</a><br><br>

Her proposal is that a complex cell is a self-perpetuating community comprising different types of bacterial and archebacterial members. She was only able to gain acceptance from her "peers" for the bacterial origins of organelles such as mitichondria and plastids, which retain their own DNA, but until she died she was fleshing out a bigger more comprehensive picture including several other symbiotic events occurring to make up the LECA, the last eukaryotic common ancestor.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c8521157652779049308 title="comment permalink">7/20/16, 12:24 AM</a><br><br>

A good book tallying up the anomalies that have arisen in the biological sciences in-depth is Duane Gish's "Creation Scientists Confront Their Critics." It's somewhat older, from the early 90s, and so does not take into account the more recent controversies in the Intelligent Design arena. Nevertheless, the anomalies Gish identifies are fundamental, and haves have by no means gone away in the interim.<br><br>And the Morris book that I mentioned several times represents a comprehensive attempt to identify the main anomalies in evolutionary thinking to be found across as many scientific disciplines as possible. The chapters on thermodynamics and the origin of life are particularly well done, in my opinion.<br><br>There are tons of other books and articles as well, dealing in depth with all of the various scientific disciplines, but this is not the time or place to develop a comprehensive annotated biography. Suffice it to say that an abundance of resources can be found easily using internet search tools for those with the inclination to do so. That's how I myself did it, after all.<br><br>Lastly regarding the Milton book, this was dismissed by one commenter as being based on an inadequate understanding of the sciences in question. But this was merely asserted, not argued or supported in any way, which means the assertion carries no weight in the discussion. <br><br>So I encourage any one who has an interest in the matter to read the book for themselves, and try to identify its alleged scientific inadequacies with as much specificity as possible.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c4384795488575018978 title="comment permalink">7/20/16, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

Punctuated equilibrium is basically just the law of succession in ecology applied to the fossil record. The basic idea is that most of the time, earth’s biosphere acts as a climax community, and it takes special circumstances to open up a proliferation of open niches that allow evolution to take place (either through niche formation, or through a catastrophe). One well documented example is the period of adaptive radiation that took place during the Paleocene epoch, the extinction of the dinosaurs wiped out most of the planet’s terrestrial K-selected species and what was left were mostly pioneer species and r selected generalists. Usually the process of selection is handled through migration, but if there are no k-selected species to settle a niche, either because there are none left, or because the niche has not yet been occupied, the process of evolution has to take over. In the case of the K-T extinction event, then, generalists such as mammals and small feathered dromeosaurs responded to intra-species competition by branching out into non-competing roles to differentiate their niches, which then created behavioral isolation on once unified populations, as well as selective pressure for specialization within each separate population. After about ten million years, with the beginning of the Eocene, all of the modern orders of mammals and birds we’re familiar with were around, and the earth had recovered once more to the point of having a mature biosphere, from there it took another 30 million years or so to reach the climax communities of the early Neogene, from which point earth’s biodiversity remained fairly stable until quaternary extinction event (which started with the last glacial period before humans came onto the scene and is still going on.)<br><br>Re Intelligent Design: My main issue there is that Intelligent Design, much like Creationism expands the definition of evolution to include things that are in no way a part of the theory of evolution. Evolutionary biology doesn’t concern itself with the origin of life, it concerns itself with the mechanism by which populations change over time (which is a far less controversial topic). There aren’t a whole lot of gaps in the step by step process of radiation from a common ancestor… rather the gaps into which intelligent design may still have some room to probe is the transition from the first proto-cells to the first living cells. Protocells are pretty easy to create under naturally occurring conditions, they even sometimes have primitive RNA chains inside… The problem is finding the transition from those protocells to fully functioning cells with ribosomes and complex enzymes (there are theories, but last I checked not much in the way of evidence). If there was an intelligent designer, that’s the level at which it would operate, and it certainly fits into the realm of reasonable hypothesis (though, it’s certainly not a scientific hypothesis, since the scientific method isn’t going to be able to detect a non-material cause… it’ll show up as an anomaly.) Even if we filled in that particular gap, there'd still be room for an intelligent designer. But once you’ve got a cell capable of DNA replication, evolution becomes something organisms do through well documented processes. I personally think that most of the arguments I’ve encountered in Intelligent Design (complexity, etc.) are best explained by the concept of emergence (but then, I tend to view gods themselves as emergent properties of a complex cosmos), and I think emergence has profound spiritual implications, but that’s a topic for the other blog.<br><br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c3460741309968198928 title="comment permalink">7/20/16, 10:16 AM</a><br><br>

Not a single one of his major ideas or arguments is based on anything approaching an actual understanding of the science at hand. He does not comprehend the theories and data he attacks at even a high-school barely-passing level; or if he does, then he deliberately misrepresents them for a non-scientific audience (which is even worse).<br><br>Before you can seriously critique the fundamentals of any field, scientific or otherwise, you need to first UNDERSTAND them as they are understood by those who work in the field. Milton failed at this utterly."<br><br>I find this distressing because it is the same criticism that I have seen over and over again for years - those who critique Darwinism and find it wanting always go into very great and fascinating detail. The answer comes back that this person does not even have a high school level understanding, they are utterly confused about all aspects of the theory or are possibly even dishonest. And yet when I read these books and sometimes read the arguments back and forth, such as about the flagellum, it is almost always the case that the one criticizing Darwinism who I find much more credible and seem to be on a higher level of consideration. So I just wonder if you have actually read Milton's book? Or where did you come up with the idea that he understands nothing? And if it is so difficult to understand that even a person with a higher IQ than average is hopelessly unable to, why even teach it at all? Why teach it in high school? Why even teach it in college? People apparently cannot understand it.<br><br>John Roth,<br><br>Certainly I have never seen even a beginning of an argument regarding the very hard problem of irreducibly complex biological systems.

Of course, I was reading that and making my own conclusions... in no special order:<br>A) Most of the negative attributes Schwartz assigns to Trump (such as lack of principles, lying freely, nepotism and some sociopathy) seem to be just as true of Clinton. Exceptions are Trump's short attention span, &amp; Trump craving publicity &amp; admiration vs. Clinton hating publicity while craving power.<br>B) In terms of Trump being a risk to nuclear war, so far Clinton scares me much more on that front. Trump typically talks tough but negotiates to something more reasonable, while Clinton's lack of ability or desire to compromise has actually fomented chaos all across the world (in Syria, Libya, and Ukraine), and may be setting the stage for WW3. Putin has been trying to warn the West for years: http://russia-insider.com/en/politics/putin-loses-it-journalists-i-dont-know-how-get-through-you-people/ri15456<br>C) I'm sure Schwartz did interview for the article at least partly to get publicity, as Trump alleges. There are just too many instantly quotable and controversial "soundbites" in it for me to think that that article is an entirely intellectually honest warning from his heart. I've now added both "The Art of the Deal" and his subsequent book "What Really Matters" to my reading list, so I guess it worked.<br>D) He did somewhat lower my expectations of Trump, but not enough to make me think that Trump is preferable to Clinton (and it doesn't matter anyway, because as a Canadian, I'm not voting).<br><br>@Kevin Warner<br>Guilty as charged! Granny Weatherwax is my favourite of Pratchett's characters, and I've remembered that concept (of evil starting by treating people as things) ever since I first read it.<br><br>@Steve in Colorado<br>My philosophy on truth is basically:<br>1) no model can ever be fully accurate, because in order to be fully accurate, it would have to account for everything in the universe, which would make it as infinitely complex as the universe itself (it is impossible to "wall off" a section of the universe and describe just that with your model, because everything in the universe is linked in one way or another)<br>2) since all models are therefore approximations, it is even possible for two models to be contradictory in their implications and yet both be "true" (once I realized this, I began to understand some of the cryptic passages I'd come across from Buddhist sources)<br>3) practically speaking, models that are more wrong BUT faster and less resource-intensive to put in practice are very often preferable, because as humans we have neither infinite time nor infinite resources. This is especially so in smaller, poorer population centres.<br>4) one shouldn't worry too much about whether the mechanisms that any one model gives to explain itself are ACTUALLY TRUE (see point "1"). Just worry about whether it explains what you need it to well enough and that it is easy to use. Newton's "invisible gravitational forces" were considered to be the equivalent of New Age kookery in his day - no less strange than seeing the forests as being full of nature spirits. Whatever works for the task at hand is the right thing to use. Many quantum physicists have given up on explanations entirely, "so long as the math seems to work". Likewise, in my daily life, I often notice that A leads to B but am not sure exactly why - nor is it usually necessary to figure it out (although it does make it frustrating when trying to explain my reasons to other people).<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c469534440204879310 title="comment permalink">7/20/16, 12:43 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not sure how much liver subsistence farmers have access to, but I can imagine chicken, goat, and cow liver would be available to some and it would only take eating it maybe once a week in combo with veggies to get enough. Retinol is a more useable form of vitamin A because it does not have to be converted from plant form. It's why pregnant women are told to avoid liver because it's thought that too much vitamin a can cause birth defects (as it turns out this is mostly false and the studies done had lots of problems, one being the use of synthetic vitamin A in tests, not retinol, so at 20 weeks pregnant I do consume raw liver a few times a week without worry).<br><br>Anyways, thank you JMG for all you do.

You can do as you like of course, but I'm a little concerned with this type of scriptural interpretation because I think it is too brittle. Prove one element not to be historical true and the whole edifice crumbles. Efforts to avoid this then leads to some rather desperate reasoning. <br><br>Stories in scripture need not all be understood as literal historical truth. One example will suffice. As a Christian you likely believe Jesus is the Son of God, the Word of God, and the Lamb of God. At some point, if you were forced to say what these three descriptions mean, metaphor would sneak in. It would be hard to maintain Jesus was/is literally a lamb, a word, or perhaps even a son. Something can be true (in terms of values) but not historical fact. And then again there are some things in the scriptures of the world that are perhaps neither. Such elements are then at least useful to provoke thought and encourage listening to one's heart.<br><br>A given scriptural story may be metaphorical, didactic, historical, historical fiction, folklore, epic, fable, parable, poetry, myth, prose, polemic, analogy, etc. ... perhaps more than one of these at any one time. Allowing non literal scriptural interpretation, often more than one at a time, has a long history in both Jewish and Christian thought. Its only as Christianity drifted westward into less literate (and so less sophisticated) societies that things got dumbed down. Allowing multiple (and not necessarily literal) interpretations allows a much greater depth and resilience to one's faith.

Two comments actually. The first is that you wrote a clear, concise and logical set of statements about a big question. <br><br>My second point follows up on a question about Judaism that was asked earlier in the week. Your philosophy resembles how a lot of Jews who actively participate in Judaism as a religion think of Judaism. By "active participation" I mean any of the following: celebrating any Jewish holidays; observing Jewish rites of passage such as b'rit milah, Bar/Bat Mitzvah and marriage; belonging to a synagogue; giving consideration to Jewish values that are ultimately derived from the Torah as guides to behavior. <br><br>As a strictly monotheist religion since the return from the Babylonian Exile, Judaism has had severe problems with theodicy. The doctrine of the Chosen People, central to claims for the divine authority of the Law, embodies a host of faith-based assertions which are unconvincing to any modern person who has had a liberal education. Nevertheless, scientists and engineers, people who are atheists or lean that way or just don't think about it very much, and people who haven't had personal experiences of antisemitism give their children Jewish educations and in some cases become cantors or rabbis or religious educators--because some of it seems to be true, and it works pretty well for the task at hand, which is living as a decent person and supporting decent values and behavior in society at large. I gather that this outlook is fairly common among adherents of mainline Protestant denominations too. It is something that people who like their belief systems cut and dried don't seem to get.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c2108950408673612568 title="comment permalink">7/20/16, 4:09 PM</a><br><br>

They were anatomically modern humans. The variety of human with bigger brains was Neanderthals. There's a lot of obsolete information out there; ancient DNA research is clarifying the relationships wonderfully.<br><br>@heather<br><br>Yeah, generally short adjectives and adverbs take the -er and -est suffixes, longer ones take more and most, or less and least. Of course there are exceptions. This is <i>English</i> we’re talking about.<br><br>@Scotlyn<br><br>Time is long. Most people don’t get how long; there’s lots of room in there for things we have absolutely no inkling of to have happened as support for what we see now.<br><br>The mitochondria story has never made sense to me, for one simple reason. Most of the genes that are needed to support mitochondria are in the cell nucleus; only some of those seem to be clearly bacterial in origin. Where did the rest come from? One answer has turned up recently: an archaea which has a primitive version of organelles and the supporting mechanisms. That makes more sense - the more of the supporting structure that’s there already, the less strange the story that says an archaeon swallowed a bacterium and then they settled their differences.<br><br>@onething<br><br>Maybe this bit of my personal history will help clarify things. Some time ago I ran across a book titled “The Aquatic Ape,” where the author explained a lot of the differences between humans and great apes by analogy with the whales and dolphins, and proposed that our ancestors had spent a period of time in the sea so those adaptations could occur. With what I knew then, she was quite convincing.<br><br>It took me learning a great deal about paleoanthropology and the actual evidence, both fossil and anatomical, to see the gaping holes in her logic. This didn’t happen by reading a book or a blog post or two. It took a couple of years of poking at this and that until I finally came to a conclusion.<br><br>When someone says: “you don’t understand the science,” the subtext is “you don’t seem willing to learn, and I have no interest in arguing with you.” People can always find “anomalies” in anything. If you want, you can generate enough “anomalies” to tax the patience of a saint. I tend to call this “argument by tsunami,” and all it does is make me want to write off the arguer as someone who’s more interested in winning, fair means or foul, rather than engaging in a joint effort to find the truth.<br><br>“Irreducible complexity” is not a hard problem. It’s an example of “petite principo” or assuming the conclusion, known in philosophy and law as “begging the question.” Pointing at something and saying “that’s irreducibly complex,” isn’t convincing without a solid, experimentally verifiable explanation of exactly <i>why</i> it’s irreducibly complex.<br><br>@Esn<br><br>On models. I recently came across the distinction between “functional” models and “mechanistic” models. The latter use real pieces with known characteristics and known interactions. Are they simplifications? Of course. Functional models, on the other hand, simply invent parts that act the way the modeler thinks they ought to act.<br><br>This may make a bit more sense.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c2707662560268146113 title="comment permalink">7/20/16, 5:12 PM</a><br><br>

I'll explain my own view of intelligent design, even though the timing is such that few will likely read it. Perhaps just as well, because this view seems to please neither scientists nor skeptics nor Creationists. I think the results of evolution look like intelligent designs because biological evolution exhibits, or embodies, a form of intelligence.<br><br>There are systems in the world that can both generate and preserve persistent complex patterns, a type of behavior only recently recognized as possible. These systems include the functioning of brains, certain iterative processes arising in pure mathematics, and the behavior of computing machines when programmed in certain ways. The other, and foremost in some ways, example is biological evolution.<br><br>Even after these processes were known to exist, their creative power was not recognized at first. For instance, well after the process of evolution was roughly understood, some philosophers still claimed that there must be some occult force ("élan vital") separate from evolution itself driving evolution toward more complex forms. Analogously, a great majority of people still believe that there must be some supernatural phenomenon separate from the human brain that makes us conscious.<br><br>What I find particularly interesting is that all of those systems also have deep similarities in how they work internally. They are all composed of a large number of interconnected units with their own states, and in all cases the units integrate multiple inputs to change their states in a manner exhibiting sharp changes at a threshold. The logic gates in a computer resolve two or more inputs into a single 1 or 0 output. Brains consist of neurons interconnected via axons and dendrites, each with their own states, integrating the inputs of excitatory and inhibitory synapses against a threshold to fire or not fire moment by moment. (In number theory, the threshold behavior is a bit more abstract, but it's always implicitly present in operations that generate complex patterns. For example, various operations such as addition can combine multiple integers into a single result, but that result is either prime or not, an all-or-nothing threshold of sorts.)<br><br>There's a sharp all-or-nothing threshold at the heart of evolution as well. An organism's genome, after very complex interaction with the environment and other organisms, either contributes directly to the genomes of offspring or it does not. That process, going on simultaneously among trillions of genomes (each of them vastly complex themselves) throughout the earth's biosphere, has unimaginably vast computational power.<br><br>Computational power alone doesn't imply intelligence, although as far as we know it's a prerequisite for intelligence. But when you see computational power put into effect to generate novel forms that effectively solve complex problems (chiefly, in this case, the ever-changing problem of ongoing survival in the environment), why not call it intelligent? Unless, like Turing, you withhold that designation until it talks to you in your own language.<br><br>I can't say whether or not that intelligence experiences, understands, wills, plans, or feels, but it's likely that it remembers (the collective genome is a—I keep using this word—vast memory store), and obvious that it creates.<br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c8903069643477509539 title="comment permalink">7/20/16, 7:24 PM</a><br><br>

What you are doing will provide you valuable experience in dealing with a community of people with diverse views. I agree with your arguments and would add Hillary has shown us her playbook already: war is just great, thank you! It's been the same song from our former Goldwater Girl for the past two decades. I wonder if she even recognizes that other major countries have their lines drawn, Turkey, for example, and what happened when America trampled on it. <br><br>Being a lady, too, has its disadvantages. Politics is a shark-infested pond, and if anyone shows weakness, they get eaten alive, so it would be harder for her as a woman to step back from the kamikaze course she has embarked on. (I watched a Japanese TV drama/documentary last year on a woman who ruled China a century or so ago, with a truly terrifying reputation, and she said, "Oh God, this is not a position for a woman!" for this very reason.) Thus I and a lot of other people, Vladimir Putin included, fear that a new Clinton presidency could lead to a nuclear war. This is why just about everyone who's paying attention to eastern Europe seems to like Trump. There are people in America saying America could win such a war.<br><br>Does anyone really want to see if we can?

These can be very complex, but the complexity is not the kind we find in the natural world. It is ultimately always tractable. Find the right abstractions, and the puzzle box opens before you. The feeling of competence, control and delight in discovering a clever twist that solves a difficult problem is what makes being a computer programmer sometimes enjoyable. But as anyone who’s worked with tech people knows, this intellectual background can also lead to arrogance. People who excel at software design become convinced that they have a unique ability to understand any kind of system at all, from first principles, without prior training, thanks to their superior powers of analysis. Success in the artificially constructed world of software design promotes a dangerous confidence.</i><br><br><a href=scientific-education-as-cause-of.html#c7515110086914507152 title="comment permalink">7/21/16, 9:40 AM</a><br><br>
