This is the nineteenth installment* of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator apologizes for an almost-quarrel, spends an evening on the town, and gets a sudden insight into the nature of the Lakeland Republic’s achievement from a seemingly unlikely source...</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br>
*(The actual nineteenth; the last one was misnumbered.)<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I felt a little worse for wear the next morning, but not too bad, and so when the alarm on the wind-up clock next to the bed went off at eight-thirty I mumbled something unprintable and got up. It was Sunday, of course, and I planned to go to the Atheist Assembly again, so I got to work making myself presentable. My electric razor did its usual halfhearted job on my stubble, and I shook my head and wondered what men used in the Lakeland Republic to keep their chins smooth when they didn’t let the barber take care of it. Probably some antique technology that works better than ours, I thought sourly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To say I was in a rotten mood was a bit of an understatement, but it was my own doing. I’d decided on the cab ride back from the Harbor Club that I needed to call Melanie Berger sometime the next day and apologize. That’s not something I enjoy at all, and I also knew perfectly well that it might be wasted effort, but there it was. Partly, the professional in me wasn’t willing to lose a useful contact in the Lakeland government just because the two of us had both been too tired to be tactful; partly I felt<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>embarrassed that I’d handled the whole thing so clumsily, and partly there was the chemistry I’d sensed between the two of us. There may have been more than that, too, but that was enough. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So I’d decided to call her early in the afternoon, after I got back from Assembly and had lunch. I was brooding over that while I shaved and showered and got dressed, and I was still brooding over it at nine-fifteen as I got my tie settled. Just then the phone rang, and wouldn’t you know it, it was none other than Melanie Berger. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Peter? I hope I’m not calling too early.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not a bit,” I said. “I was just getting ready to go to Assembly. What’s up?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She paused for a moment, in exactly the way I would have, and said, “I wanted to apologize for the way things went Friday night.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I was going to call you later today and say the same thing,” I told her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A moment of silence passed, and then we both started talking at the same time; we both stopped, and then she laughed, and so did I.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Okay,” I said, still laughing. “I’ll gladly accept your apology if you’ll accept mine. Deal?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Deal,” said Melanie. “The thing is, I’d like to make it up to you. Are you free this evening?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sure.” That sounded promising.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“What do you have in mind?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You mentioned that you’d wanted to see the Toledo Opera production of <i>Parsifal</i>. Jaya and Ramaraj Patel have season tickets, and I heard from them last night—they both came down with the same flu you got, and they’re not going anywhere tonight—so I thought I’d find out if I could interest you in a night at the opera.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’d be delighted,” I said, “on one condition.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Oh?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That you let me take you out to dinner first.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You’re on,” she said. We got the details sorted out and said goodbye, and I got out of the room and down to the street just in time to catch the streetcar to the Capitol Atheist Assembly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The meeting was pleasant but not particularly memorable, though Sam Capoferro was up to his usual standard on the piano, playing Handel and Bach with understated elegance, and everyone I met greeted me as though I was already an old friend. The reading was a rousing bit of Bertrand Russell, and the talk was about telling the difference between reason and the habits of thought that people confuse with reason, which was edgier than anything I’d heard in the Philadelphia Assembly for a good long time. Afterwards we sat around in the social hall over coffee and cookies, and talked. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The tensions between Texas and the Confederacy got a good share of the talk, and I listened closely when Senator Chenkin sketched out the situation to a couple of friends who hadn’t been following it closely. “Both countries would go broke without the income from their petroleum industries,” she said, “and they’ve both had production declines for the last half dozen years, so neither side is in any position to back down. This could get really bad.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“How bad?” one of her friends asked her. She didn’t answer, just shook her head, but I could see the answer in her eyes, and it wasn’t anything I wanted to think about.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So I filed that away and caught the streetcar back to the hotel not long thereafter. Once I was there I talked to the concierge about what you wear to an opera in the Lakeland Republic—I’d wondered whether they’d gone back to opera capes and top hats, and was relieved to find out that ordinary evening wear would do—and then went out to see if the barber I’d visited my first day in Toledo had Sunday hours. Fortunately he did, and he was just finishing up a shave and trim on another customer when I got there. When it was my turn, he greeted me effusively and said, “You got a special evening planned, I bet,” and laughed when I asked him how he’d guessed. “Of course you do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Any guy comes in here midway through a weekend day for a shave and trim, dollars’ll get you doughnuts that’s what’s on the schedule. Don’t you worry, I’ll get your face smoother than a baby’s butt.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He did, too. I left there looking ready for an evening out. A pleasant lunch in the hotel caf<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>é</span>, a talk with the concierge about restaurants, and a couple of leisurely hours reading the Sunday paper and getting caught up on the news: that filled the rest of the time before I caught a cab over to Melanie Berger’s, picked her up, and headed for a top-end restaurant not quite two blocks from the Toledo opera house. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We had a great time. The food was really good and the wine was better, and both of us had the common sense to keep the conversation well away from progress or anything related to it. Of course we talked about politics—get two people who work in any line of business together, even for a social evening, and they’re going to talk shop—but that wasn’t the only subject of conversation by a long shot. One of the others was the performance we were about to take in. The Toledo Opera had a homegrown bass, a young guy named Michael Bickerstaff, who would be singing the part of Gurnemanz.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He’d done a stellar job the year before in his first major role as Sarastro in <i>The Magic Flute</i>, but of course Wagner’s much harder on singers than Mozart ever dreamed of being. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“They say he’s really good,” Melanie said. “Good enough that a couple of European opera companies are interested in him, and some people here are talking about what kind of a Wotan he’d make.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That impressed me. “Are they planning on doing the Ring cycle here?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Jaya tells me there’s been some tentative discussions with the Minneapolis Opera about a joint production,” she said. “They’ve got some really solid singers—tonight’s Kundry is one of theirs.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Dinner wound down pleasantly, and in due time we headed for the opera house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like most of Toledo, it was new construction but old-fashioned design, with a spacious lobby and comfortable seats. Ours were about halfway toward the left wall on the first balcony. We got settled, and of course then had to stand up a couple of times while latecomers made their apologies and edged past to their own seats. Our conversation wound up, the lights went down, the conductor got up on his podium and the first bars of the Prelude sounded in the dim light. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When the curtains slid open, I admit I braced myself. In Wagner’s operas, there’s really only room for one monumental ego, and it’s his, but you get directors who don’t get that and try to make a production original by pulling some visual stunt or other. I’ve seen Wagnerian operas where all the singers were in Old West outfits, or superhero costumes, or bulbous yellow things that made them look like a flock of rubber duckies—I never did find out what those were supposed to be about. Apparently the Toledo Opera had managed to escape that bad habit. The set was abstract to the point of starkness, with fabric veils and shafts of light providing most of the decor; you could tell the designer had taken a close and thoughtful look at Bayreuth productions from the middle of the last century. The costumes looked more or less the way you’d expect a bunch of Grail Knights to look, which was a pleasant surprise. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then Gurnemanz got up from under the abstract tree where he’d supposedly been sleeping, and broke into his first lines—<i>He, ho, Waldh</i><i><span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>ü</span>ter ihr!</i>—and I knew right away that we were in for a treat. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Most of the singers were, in the strict sense of the word, second-rate: one notch below first-rate, which is still good enough to enjoy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The soprano who sang Kundry, Maria Vargas Ruz, was better than that; she didn’t have the absolute purity of tone you need for the most demanding soprano roles, but the role she was singing actually goes better with a little roughness in the voice. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then there was Michael Bickerstaff. He wasn’t just first-rate, he was world-class, a big barrel-chested young man with one of the best bass voices I’d heard in years. The role of Gurnemanz, the old Grail Knight, is the backbone of <i>Parsifal</i>; a good Gurnemanz can make a mediocre production enjoyable, while an unimpressive one drags like a lead weight on a performance that might otherwise be worth hearing. Bickerstaff was stunningly good; he more or less picked up the show and carried it on his shoulders, and I enjoyed the result tremendously. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first act flowed past, and the second; Parsifal vanquished the self-castrated sorcerer Klingsor and recovered the Holy Spear; the third act got well under way, and Parsifal, Gurnemanz, and Kundry were on stage, surrounded by a tolerably good suggestion of a field of flowers. The passage that’s called <i>der Karfreitagszauber</i>, the Good Friday Enchantment, started up, Bickerstaff sang <i>Du siehst, das ist nicht so</i>— “You see it is not so”—and that’s when it hit me. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You know how sometimes you can brood over some problem for hours and get nowhere with it, and then when you go do something else for a while and you’re not thinking about it at all, the answer basically downloads itself into your brain? That’s what happened. I’d spent most of the day thinking of just about anything but the paradox Melanie Berger had dropped on me two nights before, and right then I realized that it wasn’t a paradox at all. I managed to drag my attention back to the performance before Bickerstaff was more than a few words further on, and kept the realization I’d just had at arm’s length for the rest of the evening, but it wasn’t going anywhere and I knew it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here’s what I figured out. As you might expect, it begins with opera. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
These days, nobody listens to twentieth-century opera. That’s not accidental, either—it’s either painfully derivative or it’s impossible to sit through. Once I went to see a revival of one of Benjamin Britten’s pieces, I forget which one, and what I mostly remember was the audience gamely trying to pretend that they were appreciating something that was about as enjoyable as listening to a chorus of dental drills. The standard joke in opera circles these days is that opera companies put on twentieth century works when they’re tired of the inconvenience of performing in front of an audience. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of my Philadelphia friends, who’s a much more serious opera buff than I’ll ever be, explains it like this. Any art form has a certain amount of notional space to it, and each work done in that space fills up part of it. Before you’ve filled up the space, innovation works more often than not, but after the space is full, innovation just generates noise. That’s why the history of every art gets sorted out into a period of exploration, when you succeed by trying new things, and a period of performance, when you succeed by doing old things very, very well. If you keep on trying to innovate when the notional space is full, the results are either going to be derivative or unbearable, and either way they’re not going to be any good, because the good options have already been taken. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You know that an art is getting close to the edges of its notional space when innovation involves a lot of risk. Wagner was right up against the edges of opera’s notional space, which is why his late operas are so exhilarating—you can watch him tiptoeing right up to the edge of noise and balancing there—but they don’t have the easy grace of operas written a couple of generations before his time. You see the same thing in jazz, starting in the second half of the twentieth century: people like Thelonious Monk and Dave Brubeck were self-consciously testing the boundaries, figuring out just how far they could go without falling over the edge into noise. Another generation or two, and you get the kind of jazz that nobody bothers to play any more, because by and large it’s just pretentious doodling.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The thing is, it’s not just true of art. Nobody’s pushing brand new alphabets any more, because that notional space got filled in a long time ago. Nobody’s inventing new can openers or bathtubs, and nearly all of what passes for innovation these days in cars, say, is just gimmickry aimed at getting the clueless to shell out money. I knew all that, but it never occurred to me that technological progress followed the same trajectory:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>it had its period of exploration and then crossed over into its period of performance, but nobody noticed, and so everyone just kept on buying into the latest innovations, even though most of those had fewer benefits and worse downsides than the things they replaced. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d missed that completely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>I’d been wandering around the Lakeland Republic, noticing that the way they did things had better outcomes, lower costs, and fewer downsides than the way people do things everywhere else, and I still didn’t get it. It was as though I’d been listening to an opera by Mozart or Verdi and thinking that the poor people in the audience must be feeling horribly deprived because they weren’t getting Benjamin Britten. <i>Du siehst</i>, sang Gurnemanz, <i>das ist nicht so</i>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Writing it all out like that, it sounds all clear and straightforward. It wasn’t. There was the first sudden realization while Bickerstaff was singing, and then other details—many more than I’ve written out—came dropping into my mind over the next couple of hours. All the while I was mostly paying attention to other things, such as a really solid performance of an opera I love, and the attractive woman I was seeing it with, and certain other things I’ll mention in a moment, and the things I’ve written were tumbling around in the back of my head. It wasn’t until I was in the cab headed back to my hotel the next morning that I finally sat back and let the whole thing come together into a coherent argument. Long before that happened, though, I’d stumbled straight through the door into a different world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
But again, there was an opera to take in. After the final minutes of the music, when it always feels to me as though the opera house has shaken off gravity and gone soaring into the sky; after the applause—we were all on our feet, and when Michael Bickerstaff bowed I’m surprised the roar didn’t cause structural damage to the building; after the house lights came up at last, and people started filing out, Melanie said, “Season tickets get us into the reception, and there’s someone there I’d like you to meet.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So we filed out and went down a side corridor; Melanie showed our passes to an usher out in front of an unmarked double door, and in we went. The room on the other side was big and airy, with a mural of scenes from famous operas on one wall, and a bank of tables along the other with champagne and finger food. It wasn’t too crowded yet, and I gathered that the person Melanie wanted me to meet hadn’t arrvied, so we got a couple of glasses and sipped bubbly for a few minutes while more people filed in. Finally, when the room was getting good and packed, Melanie led me through the crowd. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Janice,” she said, “this is Peter Carr, from Philadelphia—one of Ellen Montrose’s people.” With an impish smile: “And a limited partner of yours. Peter, Janice Mikkelson.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mikkelson was maybe sixty, with short straight hair the color of steel wool and a pantsuit that looked plain at first glance but probably cost as much as any of the fancy dresses in the room. She gave me an assessing look as we shook hands, and I said, “To the extent of one share of Mikkelson LLC.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She laughed. “Not exactly a vote of confidence, but I’m pleased to meet you anyway.” I got introduced to her wife Sharon, a gorgeous Asian woman maybe fifteen years her junior, and we stood chatting for a while about the performance. Mikkelson turned to me, then, and said, “Any chance you have time in your schedule to talk? I’m interested in the possibility of doing business in the Atlantic Republic.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I can do that,” I said. “Also, if you don’t mind, I’d be interested in getting your perspective on things here in Lakeland.” She nodded, we both checked our notebooks, and scheduled something for Tuesday afternoon. “Come up to my place,” Mikkelson said. “Some drinks, some conversation, some business—I think it’ll be productive.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We chatted a little more, and then moved on in the usual way. Not much later Melanie and I were on our way down the long ramp to the lobby and then out to the street, where cabs lined up waiting for easy fares. We took one to her place, a brick row house a dozen blocks from the Capitol, and I walked her to her door. I had a pretty good idea by then of how the evening was going to end, and so it wasn’t any kind of surprise when she gave me the kind of raised-eyebrow smile that means exactly one thing. I went to pay the cab fare, came back to her, took her hand and followed her inside. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

In other fiction-related news, the anthology of deindustrial-SF stories set in the future outlined in my novel <i>Star’s Reach</i> is finally, after an unconscionable delay, coming together. I’d like to ask everyone who submitted a story to that project to visit the <a href=http://merigaproject.blogspot.com/ >Meriga Project</a> website—I’ve got a new post up and need some data from contributors. Many thanks!</div>

It's nice to know that the transformative power of Wilhelm Richard Wagner survives even the collapse of industrial society. <br><br>A story: I love and model much of my professional life on Wagner's Die Meistersinger Von Nürnberg, the opera that is the first one played when the Germans open a new opera house these days. It was written as an overtly nationalistic paen to the Germany that Bismarck was then uniting. The interesting thing is how well my students, from five continents, reacted to it when I held my last class at the Metropolitan Opera.

If we're going to try to analogize what's described in this chapter to computers, I'd say we're well into the age of pointless innovation at this point, with people dreaming up new and ridiculous ways to use the things that aren't all that useful. Most "innovations" on the internet these days just seem to make it harder to get the information across or use the tool you're looking for, and most of the physical innovations (internet of things, apple watch) might get used briefly by a handful of people still excited about them but tossed aside. Meanwhile, I've noticed hints of people starting to lock down the core, useful functions of what computers and the internet can provide and figuring out how to do so in the most simple and refined fashion.

Using opera, or any classical music, as a metaphor for the false roads of the 20th century really rang true. My local institution of higher learning, Brown University, is in the process of installing the sculpture <a href=http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20160703/giant-bear-sculpture-at-brown-university-has-its-friends-foes rel=nofollow>Untitled (Lamp/Bear)</a>. A more succinct comment on the decline of the West could hardly be imagined. Once Brown put up a statues of Marcus Aurelius and Julius Caesar, to remind the students that they were at Brown to learn to run the American Empire. What a giant blue teddy bear cloven by a desk lamp means is beyond my understanding, except that the sculptor has a subversive approach to art. So did the <i>Salon des Refuse′s</i>, but that was over 150 years ago.<br> <br>But ... I recently had the pleasure of seeing Hamilton on Broadway. My immediate response was that Miranda has recreated opera for the new century. The entire work is sung, it's not a series of set piece songs like most musicals. It begins with an overture introducing the main characters. Each main character gets a solo, some rapping, some more traditional R&amp;B. The hero dies at the end, and it finishes with the female lead lamenting his death, and promising to keep him alive by telling his story. If opera can be reborn in the city of dead art, there's hope for the rest of our civilization.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c3847934278853875588 title="comment permalink">7/6/16, 7:17 PM</a><br><br>

But I would suggest that your description of operatic art as having a "notational space"--or finite limit--corresponds to your own disdain for limits in technological progress. IMO human limits of retrievable energy is a fact, absent some possible but improbable innovation. On the other hand, every age finds their own form of artistic expansion, their Zeitgeist, and when that form is displayed, it's usually perceived as "noise". But that "noise" is often absorbed in time into the culture.

Latex condoms are an early 20th century invention. Both of them are well within the industrial capacity of a society that can build locomotives. You're right, of course, about IUDs, and vasectomies were introduced in the early 20th century -- William Butler Yeats went to Switzerland to get one after he and his wife had their two children. So there are plenty of options. <br><br>Sgage, heh heh heh. Yes, I had music very much in mind, though there are plenty of other examples. <br><br>Justin, I'm very fond of the versions of both conducted by Knappertsbusch, Solti, and Karajan, which are available on CD as well as the internet. Live performance is always a gamble, and Carr's comments about really stupid costuming are inspired by my own highly mixed experience with the Seattle Opera. I haven't given a lot of thought to China -- it doesn't come into the story. <br><br>Atilio, hmm indeed!<br><br>W.B., I don't have much contact with computer technology in general, fortunately, so I'm probably not the person to ask -- but it wouldn't surprise me at all if we're already well past peak computer, and getting deep into noise. <br><br>Peter, I don't know what it is about universities and art -- when I first went to college in 1980, at a mostly forgettable state university in Washington State, the campus was overrun with pretentious slabs of rusting metal that were supposed to be art. There were no teddy bears, though there was a statue that appeared to show a boy having carnal relations with a cougar. The teddy bear would have fit right in. As for <i>Hamilton</i>, one of the ways you can push the boundaries of an art form is by fusing it with another. Rock opera did that, but it turned out to be a very narrow niche; I expect rap opera will yield some brilliant works, but whether it opens up on a larger space is an interesting question. <br><br>Angus, have you noticed that each new field that's been discovered within the overarching field of Western science and technology has cost much, much more to explore than the ones before it? Huge advances in physics were made in the 19th century with lab equipment that would be considered inadequate for a middle school today. By comparison, the latest advances in particle physics depend on multibillion-dollar particle accelerators. That's a reflection of the process I was discussing. Your "new fields" are ultimately nothing more than new applications of the same overall approach (that of Western science), and so they run up against the same law of diminishing returns. <br><br>Patricia, exactly! The pipe organ has a pretty broad notional space, as instruments go, but composers have been industriously filling it up for centuries, and there isn't much you can do with it that either (a) has been done before or (b) is noise.<br><br>GawainGregor, you're most welcome. <br><br>Tye, yes, that's the conventional wisdom these days. Obviously I disagree. As for the noise being absorbed into the culture, not generally, no -- far more often, it's abandoned and left to rot, or survives only among little echo-chamber circles of cognoscenti. How many of the loudly proclaimed musical and artistic movements of the first half of the twentieth century, for example, are even remembered today?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c6794971982897929388 title="comment permalink">7/6/16, 8:59 PM</a><br><br>

Jensen II</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt><i>Any art form has a certain amount of notional space to it, and each work done in that space fills up part of it. Before you’ve filled up the space, innovation works more often than not, but after the space is full, innovation just generates noise. That’s why the history of every art gets sorted out into a period of exploration, when you succeed by trying new things, and a period of performance, when you succeed by doing old things very, very well.</i><br><br>This reminds of a theory I once cooked up about how genres (of music, literature, etc.) develop. There's an initial break with a different genre - like how rock and roll developed out of blues - which is usually the result of a series of small experimental changes reaching a kind of critical mass. I notice now that most the works with those experimental changes are often as not forgotten - they belong equally to the "noise" section of the old genre and the innovation section of the new. The main exceptions are when the old genre is itself still new: many of Led Zeppelin's songs can be appreciated as innovators in the late era of rock and as part of the process that lead to heavy metal defining itself as a distinct genre.<br><br>The critical mass brings with it a new set of criteria for what counts as "good": people stop judging the new genre by the old genre's standards. At first, the criteria are vague, allowing for a lot of experimentation, but it starts to clear up as the experiments succeed or fail. However, clarity brings limits: many works that might have been succeeded had they been offered in the earlier days of the genre no longer have a chance once there is a firm sense of what the genre is and isn't about. The performance phase, in your terminology, slowly sets in until there is another break and a new genre is formed.<br><br>One area where you can see this in action is in fantasy literature: pretty much all fantasy after Tolkien is different because of the tremendous success that Tolkien brought to the field. For the next several decades, fantasy set in either a non-pseudo-medieval culture or a world without elves and dwarves and wizards and dragons was pretty much unthinkable. There are some notable exceptions, such as Robert Jordan's <i>The Wheel of Time</i>, which don't have elves or dwarves, but those usually have only humans with maybe one other, minor, race - and they're always pseudo-medieval. It really wasn't until modern fantasy grew out of, I think, a fusion fantasy and modern horror (the latter of which has left a huge stamp on the genre) that there has really been an exploration of anything else.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c3158225421056617835 title="comment permalink">7/6/16, 9:02 PM</a><br><br>

While I agree that particle physics has become expensive and baroque, I don't think that is a reflection of all-science. I think there are other forces at play (our fetishism of technology is one -- and it plays out in the way science is funded). I guess this discussion is about the deeper truth of whether there is an inherent diminishing return to the scientific project. I'm saying that we can't tell based-on the last 50 years -- we need to go back before the last big breakthrough, because science goes in cycles: breakthrough, consolidation, dimishing-returns, breakthrough, consolidation, dimishing-returns, etc. I think we're about due for the next breakthrough -- though it could easily be a century away, or perhaps never happen at all! (in which case, yes, you are right ;-)<br><br>Hi Tye,<br><br>Regarding artistic noise, I think a big part is the selection that occurs over time. Most art is forgotten over the long term, because most art is crap. But for recent art, the crap hasn't been filtered out yet -- probably in part because of the charisma of the artists. When we look back at art from centuries ago, only the excellent stuff remains.

One thing I have considered is what if Beethoven never composed. Of course the exact works he composed would not have been written, but I also suspect that classical would have still filled up. In such a case would the Moonlight Sonada, if developed by Clint, in accounting, on his off hours, be any less beautiful? That question is loaded to the point of being a bad question to answer; but I don't think Clint's work would mean the same thing. Classical would have developed on some divergent tract. Part of the meaning and beauty of a work, I realize at this moment, is dependent on the tradition it is a part of. Much like the meaning of a book is dependent on the language it was composed in. Yet the tradition, I think not of an open space that can be filled, instead I think of a building mass that becomes overweight. In our era with the vast productivity of music made possible by our huge population and ample free time, music traditions have been able to stay fresh by fragmenting. Bluegrass started to get over burdened, but then it fractured into other lines, clearly descended from bluegrass, but fresh with room for experimentation because only a small fragment of the bluegrass tradition from before was carried into them.<br><br>Applying this backward to the case concerning technology I think we can find the same thing. I doubt the Atlantic republic exists in a world where there is a shortage of logical space for technical (in the broad sense) variation or innovation. Instead I think that the tradition has become over weight. It has been unwilling to shed parts of its technological suite which by existing over determine the meaning and utility of other technologies. Their hypoponic farms obstruct the space for more development of the uses for old bailing twine; which I mention as the most promising area for innovation in my region. <br><br>Retrotopia was selectivly retro, they sheaded most of the tradition back to a solid foundation, holding tight on some obviously good techniques, and forbidding a few especially disasterious ones. <br><br>Taking a fragment of a dying tradition to seed a new tradition.<br><br>Interestingly this is also nature's solution to senescence that Peter and Melanie are enjoying the fruits of.

I know you didn't intend it, but your post felt like it was aimed directly at me, as I'm a hobbyist composer and pianist but also because I asked previously about the role of art in the Lakeland Republic.<br><br>I both agree and (slightly) disagree with the idea of notional space in art. On one hand there is so much music being created nowadays, and recording technology has meant that much of it is being preserved - in response musicians are purposefully making 'noise' music, and mining more and more obscure traditional musics from around the world to try to fill the hunger for something new. <br><br>As a musician myself, I can't see how I could possibly add anything new, it does often feel like there's just nowhere to go, especially if you try to make something new without the aid of electronic sound-making technology. So the notional space idea, which is something I've seen discussed elsewhere with great unease on the part of musicians, is relevant to me in a practical way. <br><br>And from the perspective of the audience, there is so much music available that I wonder if it devalues the medium as a whole, people are so used to vast music libraries available on demand, that people perhaps care less about it, and are less willing to give newer music a patient and open listen.<br><br>On the other hand, musicians have found ways to proceed that aren't derivative, nor ugly. Debussy and Satie both rejected what they saw as Wagner's pompousness, and turned back to medieval harmony and polyphony (which was out of style at the time) as a source for their music - and the result was neither derivative nor shallow. Both composers have created music which non-specialist audiences do enjoy, and both didn't have to rely on new technology to do so.<br><br>Although maybe it's telling that since that time, composers who have successfully made such paradigm shifts are rare.<br><br>Although music/song as a form that cultures use to remember things (such as in ancient Greek practice) is less relevant today because of printing technology, I sometimes wonder if there's something to be explored musically there in light of the long decline, but I have no concrete thoughts yet on how to pursue this.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c6695353938600159254 title="comment permalink">7/6/16, 9:38 PM</a><br><br>

In video games, for example, retro-style games - games made deliberately to be like the sort you'd have played in the 90's or earlier - are pretty hot right now, and the big name games are getting increasingly derivative: when the latest round of video game consoles launched a couple of years ago, one of the laments from the community was that nearly all the major games for them were sequels. We're also well into the era of hypercriticism, where game reviews are filled with negativity grasping at every possible straw to avoid noticing that the era of innovation is just flat over.<br><br>A similar thing is happening in movies. Sequels, remakes, and reboots are all over the place, with everybody bemoaning the trend. Hollywood being what it is, these are mostly awful - and I've so far refused to see several of them - but I'm reminded of the passage in C.S. Lewis's <i>The Discarded Image</i> about how strange our obsession with innovation would have looked to medieval poets.<br><br>Now, one recent Hollywood sequel I love is <i>Tron: Legacy</i>, but I'm in a minority there, and the reason provides a good example of what I'm saying. Like its predecessor, the new <i>Tron</i> movie is not at its heart some gee-whiz superscience story about how awesome technology is. It's an allegory that employees gee-whize superscience to set the scene. The first is a Cold War allegory (with tyrranical thugs who deny the existnece of Users standing in for the godless commies; they're even colored red!), while the sequel is essentially the Gnostic myth of Sophia played out in digital space.

Every time I turned on the ABC (the serious channel here in Oz) some researcher was showing off his/her new cancer drug or some such derived from some obscure local bush. What got me but was that they would mention the next painful step to bringing it to market, then remark that, of course, way back late “Last Century” that step took four years, but now less than a year is required.<br><br>And this seemed to apply everywhere. For example, if you wanted to check tens of thousands of samples for some desired effects or properties, what would once have taken a lifetime can now be done in a sunny Sunday afternoon using microarray or some other new technology.<br><br>It looked like something very, very big was happening, not yet at the level of consumer products, but at the level of a vast increase of the processing power and decrease in cost of the tools science uses.<br><br>Now about the same thing happened around a century ago, just on a much smaller scale. I write of course of the vast change in the West between the worlds of about 1880 and 1916. By about 1916 the foundation of the Twentieth Century was firmly in place, even the wars that would fill that century were obvious to those alert enough to see.<br><br>People who ponder (future) civilizations have a name for this – Event Horizon. Strangely, though, most have their eyes so firmly focused forward that they missed the beautiful example that occurred around the beginning of the Twentieth Century and have likewise missed the current one, probably the biggest and most complex one that humans will experience.<br><br>(Warning: Grossly simplified explanation.)<br><br>An Event Horizon, by the way, is not a Singularity or a Transcendence (whatever they are). Rather, it probably can best be imagined as two, usually fairly close dates in history, generally with some fairly big and important changes happening between them, such that a person at the first date would be quite unable to rationally predict anything much about the world of the second date.<br><br>There are so many new technologies, tools and their products coming out this time I’m not going to waste time and space trying to assemble lists with two exceptions<br><br>1. CRISPR (third generation gene editing) or rather the even better techniques that will follow show every sign of making possible, even easy, the old science fiction fantasies of house trees, battery and solar cell trees, civilizations based more on extreme genetically engineered organisms than machines and much else. Even my old daydreams of living star ships crewed by biological beings distantly derived from humans who thrive in high vacuum and hard radiation (hi-vacs) look possible within a few centuries.<br><br>2. The astonishing burst of fairly simple, mostly big phama free, treatments that show promise of reducing ageing and also, surprisingly, heart disease, cancer and just about everything else ageing related. The present holy grail is of course NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) related chemicals which, at least in the lab, behave more like a medieval alchemist’s dream of the elixir of life than anything we ever expected to encounter in real life.<br><br>Actually, it’s going to be sort of funny if it turns out that just when we realize that we, in principle, actually know how to do the Singularity/Transcendence thing, become immortal, roam the stars, all that sort of stuff, we also discover that we’ve burned off so much of the Earth’s resources that we no longer have the energy and other resources to make that final big leap to godhead. Yep! So we all have to go back to being monkeys, oh, with some technology, but monkeys all the same. <br><br>If that is what our children’s children’s children’s children’s children’s children’s (add lots more “children’s”) are left to think about, it’s pretty awesome and not in a good way.<br><br><br>Stephen Heyer<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c4748925372612015208 title="comment permalink">7/6/16, 10:19 PM</a><br><br>

Your example of fantasy fiction is very apropos, and also close to my heart; an identical trajectory can be traced for science fiction, which didn't become obsessive about space travel until well into the history of the genre, but has been circling endlessly around that overworked trope like a defunct satellite ever since. <br><br>Submarine, that's basically my experience as well. Read Spengler for the grand overview, read Toynbee for the fantastically documented details...<br><br>Angus, theories are generally inexpensive to construct, and relativity was no exception. It's testing them, and then applying them, that costs. It cost much more to test and then apply relativity than it did to test and then apply Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, or any other theory of that era, and this and other examples bear out my suggestion that technological progress as a whole is approaching its point of negative returns, if it hasn't already passed that unwelcome marker. If there's another breakthrough, and it's as much more expensive to test and put to work as relativity was in comparison to electromagnetism, it's quite possible that the applications will be economically out of reach forever. <br><br>Ray, yes, but it's also that technological innovations no longer provide enough additional value to make up for their additional cost. The Atlantic Republic is still trying to bring in innovative new technology, and as Carr says, those innovations provide less benefit, cost more, and have worse downsides than the things they replace. That's how technology crosses the limits of its notional space -- it's not that there aren't options, it's that the new options don't provide enough benefit to be worth doing. <br><br>Wendy, there will indeed be a book -- I've already got a publisher lined up for <i>Retrotopia</i>. As for the Seattle property market, yep: on a scale of insanity, it's up there with gibbering ax murderers who are convinced they're being persecuted by their own toes.<br><br>Steve, that's a great example! <br><br>Jbucks, good. Debussy and Satie, though, are among the exceptions; how many other 20th century art-music composers can you name that anybody but professional musicologists can sit through without pain? There were some, agreed; most of them borrowed Debussy's trick of taking older musical traditions and using them in modern compositions -- I'm thinking here especially of Vaughan Williams, who wrote some impressively ugly stuff before he shook himself out of it and settled down to very listenable pieces such as "Norfolk Rhapsody" and "Tallis Fantasia." But that's a good example of people filling in the gaps in the notional space of Western art music. <br><br>James, I don't do computer games, but I'd noticed just how many movies these days are rehashes of rehashes of rehashes of things that were already old in the 1960s, but with new special effects! I'm waiting for things to get <i>really</i> retro -- say, feeding all Humphrey Bogart's film appearances into a computer, coming up with a comprehensive database of the guy's movements and speech patterns, and using it to CGI an endless number of new Bogie films -- starting, perhaps, with <a href=http://flyingmoose.org/tolksarc/movie.htm rel=nofollow>a 1944 Warner Bros. version of Tolkien's <i>The Lord of the Rings</i></a>...<br><br>Stephen, I'm actually not the person to ask about opera and ballet. My tastes in opera are very narrow -- specifically, I love German opera and am not too fond of most of the rest -- and I'm the equivalent of tone-deaf when it comes to any kind of dance; probably as a side effect of Asperger's syndrome, ballet et al. are, to me, pointless jumping and spinning. (I'm not happy about that, but there it is.) I can certainly suggest some good deindustrial SF to read, though... ;-)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c8005302249977090461 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 12:35 AM</a><br><br>

The older I get, the more clearly I see that any one human personality is good for maybe three quarters of a century before it gets unbearably dull to see the universe in just that one way and no other; the Druid concept of reincarnation, in which individuality endures but a new personality coalesces around it with each life, seems much preferable -- and if that doesn't work out, why, I'm not frantic enough about my own continuity to bother being afraid of death. <br><br>Lewis, thank you. Most writers don't spend pages going on about the biological processes of swallowing food or defecating, and it's always seemed to me that, barring some good reason to go into more detail, sex might as well get the same treatment. <br><br>Stephen, and yet plenty of people in the 19th century predicted many of the details of life in the 20th century, and got them right. Automobiles driving down roads with yellow dashed lines down the center? The benefits of regular air travel, along with the horrors of aerial bombardment? The coming of an age of terrible wars driven by ideology, in which every scrap of consideration for humanity would be chucked aside? (Nietzsche was one of many who got that last one down cold.) Even the pharmaceutical technologies you've mentioned are things that science fiction writers among others have speculated about for much of a century, so there's no event horizon involved, just a certain amount of speculative laziness. Myself, I'd agree with your final proposal -- that we've burnt through the resources that might, in theory, have allowed a handful of humans to go outside the solar system and maybe survive, and so we're going to have to settle down and be human beings (not "monkeys") rather than shoddy imitations of gods -- and thank heavens for that.

Music getting a little stale? Just invent some new ensembles! New instruments! New tunings! New PLACES for music to sound (buildings, activities, social groups)! I don't think we've gotten even close to exhausting the possibilities! <br><br>And besides, as we're moving onto new territory, a lot of the old territory gradually gets forgotten, as do all discoveries, scientific or artistic. Human minds do not have infinite storage, after all! Human knowledge is being lost all the time, even though we've succeeded at slowing the process through our invention of writing and our exponentially expanding human population (more minds to hold knowledge). <br><br>Has anyone perchance read Graham Jackson's "The Spiritual Basis of Musical Harmony"? Kind of from an anthroposophist perspective, but very well-researched. It is rather astonishing how so many revolutions and discoveries in musical thought (and many of them were genuine discoveries; music may be thought of as the science of number in time, as geometry is the science of number in space) were accompanied by a forgetting of previous truths which were once widely known. I found it both amusing and exasperating to read about misunderstandings by the likes of Aristoxenus and Rameau which influenced and confused hundreds of years of European musical history (in many cases, to this day)...<br><br>I suspect that as an art or science becomes more and more complex and difficult to learn, sometimes the fundamental truths that made the whole structure work in the first place simply get pushed out of the mind for lack of space - they get forgotten. Sometimes, the old principles are replaced with good new ones. Other times...<br><br>In 20th century avant garde music, composers like Schoenberg and his disciples seemed to think that musical taste was all a matter of habit, that there were no physical laws behind any of it, and that they could teach their listeners to enjoy anything at all (this view was still widespread among professors of composition and ethnomusicology when I studied in university recently). But had any of them ever thought to check if their cacophonic harmonies and pitches LOOKED good when viewed as visual geometry on an eidophone, harmonograph or chladni plate? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sThS9OfnM1s<br><br>I doubt it... because the European musical world had widely adopted 12-note equal temperament to move freely through all the keys - and had largely forgotten that this system was actually an imperfect compromise based on actual physical laws. (music theory books had stopped teaching about harmonic, arithmetic and geometric means, divorcing music theory from physical reality).<br><br>Perhaps because of this, I notice that older musical buildings often sound more impressive than newer concert halls. Nowadays, we know much more about electronic amplification, but have forgotten much about acoustic geometry. So many interesting discoveries are being made from thousands of years ago... http://phys.org/wire-news/164386603/ancient-man-used-super-acoustics-to-alter-consciousness-and-spe.html<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c602868507853440609 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 4:31 AM</a><br><br>

Was man made for science or science made for man?<br><br>Miguel de Unamuno, Tragic Sense of Life in Men and in Peoples<br><br>This quotation reflects quite accurately the main theme of the present pages. Read it carefully, twice or thrice, think about it for some minutes, and then begin to read the following pages as a musical piece whose leitmotiv is Unamuno’s assertion. Just a few minutes, or even seconds, may be enough for the reader to realize the most important message that I want to develop, and its connection with the book of title The Twilight of the Scientific Age (López Corredoira 2013). The idea is simple: our era of science is declining because our society is becoming saturated with knowledge which does not offer people any sense of their lives. Nevertheless, in spite of the simplicity of this idea, its meaning can be articulated in a much richer way than through one sentence, as in the case of a music which develops variations on a folk melody."<br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c6218940825697969176 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 4:45 AM</a><br><br>

Ask any physicist about the Higgs bosun. They found it exactly where they expected, and it told them absolutely nothing that they didn’t know. The breakthrough, if there is one, is going to come from some place that’s been rigorously excluded from current discussion.<br><br>The place that’s exciting today is biology. That’s where physics was in the early 20th century after the discovery of radioactivity.<br><br>@Steve Pearson<br><br>I’d say that’s a problem with the stores system. Chip and Pin has been used in Europe for a decade or more, and is far more difficult to hack. Not impossible, just harder. The rollout here in the US has had a lot of problems, mostly due to greed-fueled incompetence on the part of the credit industry.<br><br>@Stephen Heyer<br><br>I agree that CRISPR is a game-changer in some ways, but it’s more on the order of taking a large book, noticing that somehow several words have been misspelled, and having a far easier way of fixing them. It has nothing about how to revise that book in any meaningful way, such as adding a subplot, so the revisions make sense.<br><br>In the 80-year historical cycle, there are two periods of ten to fifteen years where a lot of things change in ways that most people would not have predicted. The last such change period was what we usually call “the 60s.” The next one is upon us. It’s a two-phase cycle, where the first phase challenges the then-current orthodoxy and opens up a lot of variations, while the second phase builds a new orthodoxy, and woe to anyone who challenges it.<br><br>If the cycle works out the way it has in the past, gender lines will be more firmly drawn than they are now. Think “the 50s.” They just aren’t going to be drawn in the same place. If you aren’t blinded by liberal orthodoxy, you can see the storm clouds gathering for the idea that gender is entirely a “social construct.”<br><br>@JMG<br><br>I absolutely agree with your comment about reincarnation. As far as I can tell, The Tao is an experience junkie. The absolutely last thing it wants is to repeat the same old experiences ad infinitum.<br><br>@Ruben<br><br>It would be interesting.<br><br>@NJGuy73<br><br>Yeah, I had a chuckle about that one as well. The point is that new alphabets aren’t going to get much traction these days. If you want an alphabet for a previously unwritten language, you’ll take a modified version of one of the locally prestige languages. The last “new alphabet” (actually a syllabary) that’s in active use here in the US is Cherokee, and that’s a couple of hundred years old. When Sequoia invented it, he’d seen English, Greek and some others, but couldn’t read them, so he just made up the signs. Everything else that’s in common use, like Cyrillic, is way older.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c3521122487106599713 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 6:20 AM</a><br><br>

Ravel's "Le Tombeau de Couperin" and Shostakovich's "24 Preludes and Fugues" are good examples. That old/new combo manages to stretch one's ears without undue pain. Admittedly, some listeners have not been too fond of the Ravel "Forlane" that I play, but I love those "beautiful dissonances" (Ravel's own term, I believe).<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c5841030753388501180 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 6:45 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you for demonstrating the patience I never seem to have.<br><br>It struck me after reading this, the second time to my wife this morning, that at least some aspects of permaculture (which I've notionally been practicing for 8 years now) fit this model. In fact one of the most embarrassing bits of my 6 years of blogging - which I've just closed out - was my shameless and clueless promotion of one avant gardening technology. <br><br>My most popular post of all time was about growing potatoes in straw in a wire tomato cage, adding straw as the potatoes grow upward, and then just dumping out the cage at the end of the growing season to collect a huge pile of spuds. In my real-life experience it doesn't work all that well, and why would it? Potatoes need soil more than anything else.<br><br>The consistent love for this article year after year irritated me. Why was this my most popular post?? By my estimation I had several that were MUCH better, and way more interesting. And maybe the answer is, because we're talking about staple food production here, and because what I was talking about was easier than doing a soil test, cheaper than buying amendments, and a lot less work than cultivating the soil to a depth sufficient for potato production. <br><br>But it's really just noise, outside the notional space of potato production. We've known how to grow potatoes, organically and productively, for a long time, but that's boring, and old-fashioned. Surely the superior technologies of today have rendered such dowdy (and dirty) processes obsolete?<br><br>And my answer, after a decade of organic gardening, is no, they haven't. By following my advice you've just wasted another potato season. Dig the soil, include the appropriate amendments, hill them up, keep them watered, and don't let them sit in wet soil at the end of the growing season. That's how you grow potatoes.<br><br>So off I go to dig up a few more rows, now that the rain has stopped.

The danger with embracing Down Home Funk as a lifestyle is that of toxic nostalgia: if you embrace 19th century technology as a solution to technological problems, you might be tempted to shoehorn 19th century politics into solving modern political problems, same with religion, social norms, etc. (maybe this is only a problem for me, as I can be a bit of a nostalgic type). For me, Down Home Funk is less of a lifestyle and more a "thought-style" which recognizes that certain technologies were already sufficiently mature in previous eras, that is, their notional space was already full. The notional space of "non-stick pan" is fully occupied by a well-seasoned and lightly greased cast iron pan, Teflon need not apply. The notional space of "tolerable daily shave" is fully occupied by the double-edge safety razor, cake of soap, and badger brush, so I don't 5-blade cartridges and cans of high-pressure blue goop.<br><br>Regarding peak computing, I would agree that we're already there, as far as mass-market computing is concerned. My ten-year-old MacBook Pro can do streaming HD video, Facebook, and email just fine. My seventeen-year-old PowerMac G3 can do it all with a great deal of tweaking and some concessions on video quality. My twenty-year-old PowerMac 5400/120 could only do email.

That means it can be explored for enjoyment rather than duty. I would say it is advisable to begin with the Famous Names, which usually are famous for good reason, and from among those pick what you yourself find enjoyable. Me, I can't abide Wagner, whose music to me sounds like bad movie muzac--John Williams on steroids--. For large scale works I much prefer Berloiz, especially Les Troyens, which had to wait for the mid-20thC for performance. (The great Jessye Norman, at the height of her vocal powers, made her Met debut as Cassandra in Les Troyens, with the sublime Tatiana Troyanos as Dido, one of my all time favorite recordings.) The point being that there is no longer a "canon" which one MUST have read or seen and you can choose what you like. While you are exploring among The Greats, you will come across lesser figures whose work might appeal to you, if not to others. For example, after reading, and rereading, Jane Austin, I began to look into other lady novelists of the period. I decided I liked Anne Bronte, but not the other two Brontes, and Elizabeth Gaskell. I do think that contemporary criticism is best avoided--my opinion and I am sticking to it. Among the sins of mid 20thC criticism I count the lionizing of a 5th rate novelist/soft core pornographer, Hemmingway, who could neither create memorable characters nor tell a good story, and the unfair acclaim accorded to a mediocre and pretentious composer, Aaron Copeland. Unfair, because there was at least one almost forgotten composer of greatness active at the same time, William Grant Still.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c6365994499914418052 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 7:42 AM</a><br><br>

There are accounts of famous works of art in the classical world which were held as the acme of beauty, and which disappeared following the collapse of the western Roman Empire, and only a few of which were dug up in the Renaissance. I will agree that the vast majority of work produced at any time is crap, however.<br><br>I think the reason art survives is more that people love it and care for it, and then retrospectively it is decided that the art is good.

It's testing them, and then applying them, that costs. It cost much more to test and then apply relativity than it did to test and then apply Maxwell's electromagnetic theory /.../, and this and other examples bear out my suggestion that technological progress as a whole is approaching its point of negative returns, if it hasn't already passed that unwelcome marker.</i> <br><br>While by no means dissenting wholesale from your position, I do have to put on record some degree of qualified dissent. I partly dissent from you on your "test", while having no objections to your "apply" or to your critique of "technological" progress-claims. <br><br>(1.1) Perihelion-of-Mercury aside, the standard early test of General Relativity was the perturbation of light in a strong gravitational field. The test was low-budget, being first performed by a team involving Eddington right after World War I: you photograph the star fields around the Sun at total eclipse, noting particularly the stars close on your photographic plate to the solar-lunar disk; you then measure the positions of those stars, looking for a displacement in their positions (a deformation in their overall pattern) relative to their positions when the Sun is far from them on the celestial sphere. (It is like looking for a constellation pattern, as printed on paper, deformed through an expanding or shrinking of the paper in the star-atlas page.) You face a budget of only some thousands of dollars for camera, photographic plates, plate-measuring equipment (microscope, etc??), and travel to the eclipse site. <br><br>(1.2) I gather from a hasty glance at Wikipedia on Pound-Rebka that in 1959 something called the "Pound-Rebka Experiment" ushered in the era of precision testing of General Relativity. But what did this involve? We read of a pair of radioactive iron sources in a campus building already possessing a convenient multi-story tower, a Mylar bag, loudspeakers, monitoring of phase differences in oscillations (so electronics). Surely this, too, could be done for a few thousand dollars, or at worst for a few tens of thousands. <br><br>(2) A similar situation arises with a key tenet in quantics (which you do not discuss, but should be looked at alongside General Relativity), wave-particle duality. One of the key experiments is to reproduce Young's Double Slit setup, but with a weak light source, illuminating a photographic plate over a period of weeks or months - the source being so weak that only one photon passes through the slits at any one time. (Upon being developed, the plate shows wave-diffraction fringes, which cannot be explained if photons have a purely particle nature.) This got done at Cambridge Uni around 1910 or 1920, and can surely be done not for at most mere thousands of dollars (more likely, mere hundreds, or mere tens). <br><br>(3) Maxwell I discuss at length in the earlier parts of my multipart "Is Science Doomed?" essay at <a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a>. To summarize my discussion here: the theory does not very easily fit the schema of "Erect theory, deduce consequence, make tests." With one key exception, the theory summed up things already known by Maxwell's time, and so was not tested in Maxwell's day in any sense deeper than the (already known) advance in perihelion of Mercury "tested" General Relativity when Einstein published his theory in 1916. The key exception - that the line integral, around closed loop, of magnetic field is sensitive to time rate of change in electric flux through capping surface - indeed requires testing, but is hard to test, and did not get tested until the 1920s or thereabouts. Had the test not been made, Maxwell would on mathematical grounds have all the same commanded acceptance. <br><br><br><br>Tom<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c2435831112819994152 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 9:14 AM</a><br><br>

Further up in the comments there was some discussion of rock opera, and the recent award winning Hamilton. Another composer who seems particularly relevant to Carr’s interests is Gershwin, who found a way to revitalize Classical music, which had long since passed into the “performance” phase, by drawing on the emerging Jazz styles. And Gershwin wound up having a wide influence on most of the more lasting musical innovations of the first half of the 20th century.<br><br>So, how then, can the process of creativity be kept alive when the culture itself is beginning to fossilize? Ralph Waldo Emmerson once expressed his own observations on the transition from exploration to performance, when he said “our age is retrospective. It builds the sepulchres of the fathers. It writes biographies, histories, and criticism. The foregoing generations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their eyes. Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe? Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of insight and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us, and not the history of theirs? Embosomed for a season in nature, whose floods of life stream around and through us, and invite us by the powers they supply, to action proportioned to nature, why should we grope among the dry bones of the past, or put the living generation into masquerade out of its faded wardrobe? The sun shines to-day also. There is more wool and flax in the fields. There are new lands, new men, new thoughts. Let us demand our own works and laws and worship.” And I do think that he was right on the nose by expressing that humans have a need for stories that relate to the lives they are presently living…<br><br>It seems that one of the things that happens as civilizations begin to ossify in their latter worlds is that art forms, stories, and technologies cease to become adaptable and pliant, while the people rush off in search of something that still has life in it. So the need for creativity and innovation is, in part a need for a living culture, and yet, as you pointed out, once the notional space of an art form is filled up, further work along those lines becomes derivative and unbearable. How, then, does one find a path forward in the latter end of a civilization’s cycle into realms of culture that still haven’t been used up, and how can innovation take place without tipping over into noise?<br><br>A few possible thoughts on where those open spaces may be: one is that the notional space of an art form, religion, technology, language, etcetera does seem to refill over time, once it can be revisited by a different culture with a different mind… you see people taking older, long-neglected art forms, reviving them, and then twisting them off in a different direction that the cultures that originally developed them might not have thought of. The current revolutions in polytheist religion are in part doing that, by taking ancient myths and religious forms, and breathing new life into them with the toolkit of modern occult philosophy. The Pre-Raphaelites of the 19th century also did something similar, by going back to a place where art took one turn and then taking an older art form into a completely new direction, producing some of that era’s great art. The concept of Steampunk, if it could be transitioned from an art form into a technological movement is a similar approach. And of course, that’s in large part what Retrotopia is all about.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c1870744423950630246 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 9:21 AM</a><br><br>

It’s the folk themselves who feed into the growth of new civilizations when a civilization dies, and it’s the folk who provide the most vital places of growth even when the civilization has fossilized. And it’s the tension between the high culture and the folk culture that feeds into many of the civilization toppling social crises we’ve been discussing lately.<br><br>The last question, then is how one can navigate both the culture that has used up its notional space and fossilized, and the spaces where there may be room to maintain a living and growing culture. <br><br>I think the answer to that question may come from occult philosophy, as expressed in this quote from Dion fortune:<br><br>"No student will ever make any progress in spiritual development who flits from system to system […]. Each of these systems has its value, but that value can only be realised if the system is carried out in its entirety. […] After this has been achieved we may, not without advantage, experiment with the methods that have been developed upon other Paths, and build up an eclectic technique and philosophy therefrom; but the student who sets out to be an eclectic before he has made himself an expert will never be anything more than a dabbler"<br><br>In other words… part of the reason that we’re tipping over into noise and derivation at this point, is that we’re pursuing innovation for innovation’s sake, rather than mastering established art forms and building slowly on it from there. And so, by mastering the basic underlying theories and techniques of 20th century physics and engineering, and building on them, the people of the Lakeland Republic are able to produce the Maser, whereas by flitting shallowly over the latest incarnations of the latest technology, the people of the Atlantic are able to produce a new V-pad that works slightly less effectively than the last one. I believe I remember (I can’t find it now, so it may have shown up in the comments, rather than in the text of the story itself), that Lakeland had a well known composer who had written either an opera or a musical about a battle in the second Civil War, so they’ve still got composition happening, but it avoids becoming derivative because it is based on a mastery of the musical traditions that it’s drawing on and isn’t just trying to put a lazy spin on something that’s only half-mastered… like the people of the Atlantic Republic who know how to make a variety of eclectic Martini spinoffs, but never bothered to master the technique of a basic martini first before adding innovation to the design.<br><br>And so, it seems that the key difference is where the roots are… a living, vital culture, has its roots firmly in living and vital forms and their mastery. That means, either mastering spaces that are still growing and then expanding on them, or mastering older forms and then taking them in different directions. Whereas a culture that is finding itself firmly in the realm of diminishing returns and found that every wave of innovation makes things worse rather than better has its roots completely in the present and destroys them with every new wave… Their roots go back no further than the last wave of change. Which means the further you get from the basics, the less mastery of the basics you have. Which whether it’s technology, music, martinis, or magic is like attempting to write a completely new song without ever having learned how to practice scales and chord progressions, it imposes tighter limits than would otherwise be necessary. <br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c2188022803118249137 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 9:21 AM</a><br><br>

So they build something they want to build. Which is usually something they want to use or that would interest or impress their peers.<br><br>It's like the mechanic who likes to go racing at the track - he's not going to build a car that has cupholders and climate control and a suspension that has a comfortable ride with predictable oversteer that sacrifices handling for safety. Or even an engine that will have reliability at the cost of performance. If it breaks, he'll just hoist it out and rebuild it, no sweat. Everyone does that right?<br><br>Maybe you can take his blueprints and pay some engineers to modify them and build a nice boring commuter car (also see: Shuttleworth and Ubuntu) but even there you'll see the um, "racing and enthusiast" heritage in the basic design. The A/C might not work all the time or it might need some repair work to get it running. The suspension might have quirks in it in certain untested cases.

IOW sensitivity to real artistic values is taken into account, meaning universal timeless storyline. Dickens works regardless of time or place due to its human element, which is detailed and realistic. Some authors come over as political tracts and don't survive the test of time. I don't know when victorian romance turned into soft porn. Lady chatterly's lover perhaps. The whole technological idea surrounding history is inevitable in such a story due to the speed of change. Vague references in Dickens to how much London had changed from an old man in his lifetime were sufficient in 1850. <br><br>In Hard Times or Great Expectations, love or greed and power with accurate character sketches sufficiently motivate plot. For me culture and technology, historical surroundings are incidental to inner life which never changes. Most people want to see a good story and if the ideology does not get in the way then fine. <br><br>Opera singing sounds wonderful but I only saw one once on Arte here recently. It was very convincing melodrama, very moving. I guess Mozart. Turkish place, german girl kidnapped by sultan, her boyfriend tries to get her back. If well played, acting is good. I just saw gere in officer and a gentleman and my wife googled his story, ten years of theater before cinema. The results are good. Comic acting can also be good as in timing oo two and a half men, the nanny, etc. In a history of rome pre caesar in 7 volumes , 19th century historian goes into some detail on theater, comedies, dramas. Very interesting. <br><br>Eternal linear life as a single personality is impossible. Eternal life is only conceivable in a life form with endlessly available energy to recycle, repair from within body system. This would entail freeing up of fixed personality boundaries, which is just energetic form of expression. Multiple personality disorder shows that one can be left handed, chage eye color or sexual orientation, whatever almost randomly.

Under this infection, some may be liable to think that physics is a matter of discovering more and more elementary particles (since this is what the mass media glamourize), or that small observatories are obsolete (the University of Toronto helped propagate this one in an ill-conceived press release from 2007 - its ill-conceived closure of the David Dunlap Observatory I chronicled in my postings this past spring at <a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a>). <br><br>Let us imagine for a moment what Angus's rightly deplored "fetishization of technology" would mean if applied to that branch of science which is mathematics: <i>Oh the horror. Mathematics is dying. Mathematics research requires supercomputers, as we see from the glamourization in the media of mathematical Chaos Theory, and these are bound to become rarer less and less available to our hard-pressed researchers as our culture declines...</i> <br><br>It may be true that some branches of physics - particle physics? - are reaching, or will soon reach, a point of diminishing returns, as I suppose also mathematical Chaos Theory some day must. It does not follow from this that physics as a whole will reach a point of diminishing returns, and a fortiori it does not follow from this that science as a whole will reach a point of diminishing returns. That may be so, and it may be not so: I am here making only a point in logic, namely that it does not, from the admitted foreseeable bottlenecks in big-budget science such as particle physics or supercomputing, logically follow. <br><br><br>Tom <br><br>(in Richmond Hill, just north of Toronto in Canada)<br><br>Toomas(dot)Karmo(at)gmail(dot)com<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c552606991564894602 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 9:47 AM</a><br><br>

It was followed by the very forgetable Windows Millenium and then taken out of its misery by its masters in favor of a sibling lineage that still had some innovation potential: 32-bit servers.<br><br>In the 1990s, Microsoft's server OS was Windows NT. In the wake of the 21st Century, this lineage was split in two: Windows 2000 and Windows XP. The former and its heirs - Win2K3, Win2K8, Win2K12, ... - continued to be marketed as "server OSes". On the other hand, the venerable Windows XP is, IMHO, The_Classic_OS(TM) for low end x86 server technology. What happened is that low end servers got so cheap that it was possible to sell those to regular customers.<br><br>If WinXP marks the classic era, I tend to see Windows 7 as the beginning of the Barroque. It was Microsoft's first 64bit OS, and indeed it can handle both x86 and x64 arquitectures. The thing is, while 32 bit computers had a native, elegant way to handle everything, 64 bit computers are too big. I have never worked for Microsoft, but if my Linux knowledge carries more or less Ok (and I think it does), the internal structures of many modern OS features have gotten too big to be handled. <br><br>Take Virtual Memory, by example. VM is (one of) the feature(s) that allows each program in your computer think it's got the whole machine for itself. It translates the addresses of where the program thinks each peace of data is stored, to the actual location within the real memory (or, in many cases, at secondary storage). 32-bit machines have a table to match a program's memory pages to real actual pages. For 64-bit machines, such table would be huge (making it both unstorable and unsearchable within reasonable amounts of space and time respectively). So, 64-bit machine's implementation of VM has to resort to an arrangement of tables of tables to figure out where the actual table that has the actual page might be found.<br><br>That itself is still workable, and the same trick could be extended to handle 128-bit computers if all the other limits that are pilling on top of modern architectures would be handled (though I do not expect that to happen within the next 10-15 years - meaning never at all). But this is only one feature, and there are dozens, if not hundreds, of similar examples. All this make me think that Windows 7 is already trying to squeeze itself in the remaining space in "computer architecture noosphere". <br><br>Finally, Win7's successors are clearly not trying to innovate anymore. They just do what Win7 already does perfectly OK, but every new feature does corral user's options and prevent them to do what they want to do, instead forcing them to do stuff that mostly benefits the new master's of that technology. As Synthase commented before, Richard Stallman was right all allong.<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c1012957113847537577 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 9:55 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not sure it fits perfectly with endeavors to understand the physical world, except in the sense that we use (limited, imperfect) theoretical descriptions, or because we have to use ever more complex technology to explore the limits of those theories.<br><br>GMG, as you noted, theories are indeed cheap. But testing them, at least initially, need not be. Take for example the revolution that followed Darwin's revelations about speciation. The evidence is all around us, plain to see, it just required putting it in the correct theoretical context to pull the meaning from it. <br><br>A similar (maybe even more profound!) revolution may be under way as we speak, in understanding the transition from inanimate material to living organisms, pioneered by Jeremy England https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e91D5UAz-f4. Once again, this is at it's root paper and pencil work, plus simple observation and reevaluation of existing data, (notwithstanding England's choice to begin with computer modeling!)<br><br>The difference here may be between a fixed (arbitrary?) notional space occupied by the creations of our limited human imagination, and the infinite landscape of the real world.

I do share the feeling towards Win10. At home we keep an old-ish Win7 laptop (bought new in 2007), and my wife &amp; myself have pledged this will be the last Windows system we will ever own. I expect to run this until the hardware breaks appart, but if we ever get a forced upgrade, I will wipe the damned hard drive thrice and installed a Linux version from 2013, which I keep around explicitly for that purpose.<br><br>On the other hand, I do not share your enthusiasm for Linux. It is an ok OS and everything, but it is too chaotic and too idiosyncratic to be mantained by any non-expert. The community has also dranked deeply from the Kool-aid fountain of Progress, so it is extremely hard to install modern versions on old hardware (even those distros that promote themselves as being "light-weight" or "vintage friendly"). I did run the experiment a couple of years back, and I found Linux'es claims to fall short on my expectations. I documented the results in my now defunct blog "El Alma del Hacker Verde" (in Spanish).<br><br>Now a days, I feel some really good vibes from the BSD community, specially Open-BSD (for the privacy conscious). However, this is even more of a time investment, though the whole development and integration process is centralized, so you do not have to deal with so much of the Linux chaos.

In this case, as with so many, there seems to have been no legitimate reason for this particular shooting. This looks like an act of murder, pure and simple. I am a working class white and a paleoconservative and words cannot begin to express how disgusted I am with these repeated instances of police brutality and excessive use of force against the black community.<br><br>Solomon, who is an African American conservative and a military veteran who served in Iraq, <a href=http://snafu-solomon.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-shooting-in-minneapolis-looks.html rel=nofollow>is livid over this one</a>, as well as the FBI's blatant placing of <a href=http://snafu-solomon.blogspot.com/2016/07/comey-is-testifying-to-save-reputation.html rel=nofollow> partisan politics over justice</a> in the Hillary Clinton case. Or as Solomon puts in the Hillary email case <br><br><i>The FBI did an outstanding job in laying out the case against Hillary and then s**t their pants when it came time to do the hard thing...to man up and charge the female.</i><br><br>There are a growing number of Americans, black and white, right wing and left wing, who are fed up with the system. The level of anger, frustration and desperation just keeps growing. Meanwhile the system seems to be hell-bent on delegitimizing itself and I think its only a matter of time before something breaks and we see a major crackup like we saw in France in 1789, America in 1861 and Russia in 1917.<br><br>Solomon concludes one of his recent blog posts by writing <br><br><i>In 2016, we're no longer surprised. The system has been broken a long time. Past time to tear it all down.</i><br><br>There are an awful lot of Americans, of all races and political persuasions, who feel that way. The growing lawlessness of the establishment, whether we are talking about the routine extrajudicial executions of African Americans by the police or politicians and celebrities like the Clintons (who I have been referring to recently as the "Clinton Crime Family") who get away with criminal acts that the rest of us would go to prison for, is one of the things that is discrediting the system and driving us towards Caesarism, just like Spengler predicted.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c134039909931398560 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 11:31 AM</a><br><br>

They don't get invented so much as they grow out of the cultivation and needs of a culture. They fall under a similar category to folk art, folkways, and the more organic elements of religion in that they emerge collectively rather than from the innovations of an individual, and the notional space for innovation by individuals is very small. (Thus, for instance, many of our modern "old world" vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, brussels sprouts, and kale, emerged after the fall of Rome and are descendants of common Roman garden mustard. The analogy for our civilization would be a civilization using an array of exotic looking vegetables bred from the dandelions, clover, and thistles of today). Overbreeding on an individual level on a shorter time scale leads to things like the more extreme examples of over-breeding today... (dog breeds like the pug and the English bulldog... crops that can only propagate through constant hybridization... etc.) Languages and alphabets evolve at a much slower pace, and to fill a societal need... both Ogham and the Runes seem to have emerged in the 2nd century among barbarians outside of Rome, seeing the use for a form of written communication, and flourished through the middle ages. The Russian alphabet emerged in the 9th century or so. The Arabic alphabet emerged in the 4th and 5th century as classical civilization tipped over into the Dark ages... and while some, like the Ogham were new innovations, others sprung out of older alphabets (such as the fusion of Latin and Greek letters in the Cyrillic alphabet)... And so, I fully expect that a thousand years from now in some parts of the world, new alphabets will most certainly be emerging among future literate cultures. And I'm sure that there will be some 3rd or 4th millenium versions of Chaucer or Dante who comes about to canonize the vernaculars of their time. But the common factor of all of those languages, crops, alphabets, and religions... is that they emerged collectively out of some sort of vernacular (which is why even languages invented by master linguists such as Tolkien are filled with the sorts of holes that are inevitable without existing native speakers). One of the things that leads to a cultural form entering into a finite notional space seems to be the act of separating it from the vernacular, those art forms and technologies that are completely alienated from the vernacular run through their resources very quickly, while those things rooted in the vernacular will be much more resilient and adaptable. This is also part of the reason empires attempting to destroy a culture attempt to suppress the vernacular language itself (as the English did to the Irish and Welsh, colonial Americans did to indiginous languages, or modern Americans to southern dialects, inner city slang, and Spanish). Because without the vernacular, there's no pool from which the roots of culture can drink.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c1872318096075597072 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 12:28 PM</a><br><br>

That concerns me: I'm inclined to think if nearly all other cultures lack a feature we have, or have one we lack, there's a reason. In this case it's obvious (to me, anyway): change for the sake of change tends to make things worse.

I hate the site and would abandon it if only that were possible for me at this point in my life. However, currently many people I know plan exclusively with it.

I'm increasingly feeling that's a price worth paying to get it out of my life, but currently the price is too much for me. There are many times I feel like I should have been born a few decades earlier....<br><br>Erza,<br><br>I currently study this sort of thing, and will give the best answer possible: it really depends. Give it a few thousand years and most alphabets evolve to the point where they warrant being called something else. However, having any form of printing technology seems to slow this process, so I think it depends on whether the printing press survives. Additionally, writing systems are sometimes revived, or reformed to look older (upper case Latin letters are an example of that very process).<br><br>It will also depend on which language you're talking about. It's likely that letter forms will evolve differently in different areas, and at different rates, giving rise to a wide range of descendants, possibly many still called a “Latin alphabet” or whatever that works out to in the local language, some looking similar to today, others looking very different, maybe even unrecognizably so.<br><br>All this is assuming that writing survives the coming dark ages, which is not a guarantee.

And even then I don't think they are better than natural materials for most things. Sure, glass mustard jars break if you drop them, but it's a whole lot easier to get the last dab of mustard out of them than it is the weirdly-shaped abominations of chemical-element stew that pass for a mustard container in the condiment aisle (and that's if you're not making your own mustard out of whole mustard seeds and vinegar and spooning it into reused jars).

Even a somewhat out-of-date paper map will get you where you want to go if you apply some logical thinking to it, but an up-to-date GPS can still get you off track. In 2012 my husband and I used a paper map to get us to a church where a wedding was being held. Along the way, the state highway we were using went under construction, sending us on a detour. The detour was advertised in road signs, not as well as it could have been but good enough to get us onto it and keep us on it as long as necessary. Because we were using the paper map, I (the navigator) was paying careful attention to road signs for up-to-date info. We got to the church just when we wanted, early enough to find good parking, wind down from the stress of driving, and talk with friends before the ceremony. A close friend of mine, on the other hand, slipped in just as the ceremony started.

As one modulated into keys further away from the home key, the sound became more discordant. This discordance was thus part of the inner tension and drama of the piece when it was played. With equal temperament tuning, this is lost, all keys are equally out of tune.<br>In those days, any good performer would know how to tune his instrument in many different temperaments to suite the key of the music. Also, because the all-wood harpsichord goes out of tune easily with changes in humidity and temperature, most people who owned one needed to know how to tune it.<br>Pianos, with their metal frame, are much more stable AND are way more difficult to tune; so equal temperament tuning, which for Bach was only one of many possible tunings, became the norm when the piano eclipsed the harpsichord in the 1780’s. <br>Maybe this is another case of “simpler ain’t necessarily better“?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c3248030886701050106 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 4:32 PM</a><br><br>

But after a while it gets pretty old, being told you're just borrowing from another culture, so the heavy metal guys got involved in learning about their "roots", the classical music of Europe. I remember endless discussions about the various "modes" (for instance, a major scale is the Ionian mode) and the guitar magazines were full of terms like Dorian and Mixolydian etc. <br><br>Indeed, a devoted listener to heavy metal would find Bach delightful.

Jensen II--I don't think the possibilities of computer games as an art form are anywhere near being exhausted. The business of computer gaming has problems that remind me of rock and roll in the early 1960s after the golden age of early electric guitar music and doo wop and before the Beatles and others began experimenting with subject matter and arrangements. As I see it, the main problems in this period were that AM radio playing Top Forty hits (skewed by payola) in three minute 45 RPM singles was all the audience got a chance to hear. Most of what you could do with that in Fifties styles had been done. Several things happened in the mid-Sixties to end the stagnation: college age audiences started listening to free form FM stations that allowed DJs to play whatever they liked; the LP format allowed more flexibility in song length; bands that wrote their own music instead of having songs chosen by A&amp;R men started getting record contracts because they showed they could get an audience. Between 1965 and 1968 good, original music was coming out every week and brilliant, innovative albums almost monthly. In part that was because the barriers between creative people and their potential audiences were low.<br><br>Right now three kinds of arty computer games are being cranked out. Graphics-intensive first person shooters created by young men for other young men. Multiplayer games that require a large investment in time, equipment and fast Internet connections. Single player casual adventure games that are marketed mostly to women and which are extremely formulaic. I don't know anything about the multiplayer games, but the other two kinds are reworking the same tropes over and over.<br><br>I think at least part of the problem is the difficulty the potential audiences have in finding anything different and being able to check it out. There's little or no game criticism that isn't either marketing or aimed at people who are already fanatical gamers. If something as innovative as Myst is being made today (and I'm sure there is), how are people going to find out about it? Computer gaming as an art form has been held back by the lack of a distribution channel equivalent to college FM radio in the 1960s. <br><br>I found out about the original desktop version of A Dark Room by accident. It's as simple as can be but I found it exceedingly immersive because the player can make choices based on incomplete information, just like in real life, and the choices affect the game play, though not the final outcome. I looked for other games in which how I interacted with other characters and what risks I was willing to take would have affected events, and my hand wasn't continually held by an intrusive hint system. I couldn't find them. I couldn't find a forum where I could express what I liked about the game and what I would like to see developed in future games of that type. Same is true with an entirely different game, The Tiny Bang Story, which is of the hidden object/puzzle genre but has virtues lacking in most other games of that genre.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c5679588554350496458 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 7:53 PM</a><br><br>

I have rayon shirts more than twenty years old. The fabric hasn't frayed, the colors are fast, and with proper laundering, they don't wrinkle. Unlike the immortal Twinkie, holding up well over time is a good feature in clothing. My rayon clothing is comfortable to wear in moderate temperatures. Rayon drapes well. It resists stains. Nothing beats wool for warmth but rayon has most of the virtues of cotton, linen and silk, and is sturdier and cheaper than any of them. <br><br>The raw material of rayon, wood pulp, is readily available. I don't really know how it's processed, so can't comment on source intensity or pollution, but since the stuff wears like iron that would be a partial offset. Cotton is a thirsty crop and requires prime agricultural land. There's a recent historical study called the Empire of Cotton about the dark side of the cotton economy, and slavery in the United States is only one part of it.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c2108563409332088986 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 8:19 PM</a><br><br>

I am deeply indebted to your work and insights. In my Kunstlerian "post suburbia moment", your writings were a candle in a deep cave.<br><br>This this post you connected some interesting dots regarding the life cycle of any system be it organic, artistic or cultural. The examples you cite, music and tangentially architecture resonate particularly with me; not the least because I am a practicing architect. As such we are trained with the subliminal motivations towards progress. I have often doubted the validity of the desperate, continual and vapid search for the new. As such I have developed a keen interest in Classical Architecture and have learned much. All of your comments about limits being the source of beauty are quite well made. <br><br>Still, my guess is that a strict reversion to past forms of Architecture will not occur. Designing a building in Meriga will differ from designing a building in Renaissance Italy for a number of reasons. One that immediately strikes me is the difference in the resources available for construction. The fundamental techtonics implicit in an industrial salvage world are fundamentally different from the remnants that Francesco Borromini had to contend with. My guess is that Merigan builders will be quite inventively trying to capture the "grandeur" of our age within the limits of their age. Fear not, this will likely not produce another Seattle Public Library but rather something more in the vein of Frank Lloyd Wright or Alvar Aalto. This wedding of humanism with industrial bricolage will be to Modernism what Romanesque Architecture was to Pantheon, the point on the cycle where stability and sophistication begin to reemerge. This will be new. This will be unique. This will emerge as an authentic response to an age and not as a tedious, narrow "interpretation" of a dead cultural form. <br><br>Curious to know if this triggers any insights for you.<br><br>Thank you again, the candle grows brighter with each posting and book!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c308375641903367121 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 9:58 PM</a><br><br>

Such pre-existing structures might be assembled into something we would recognize as living, in a process analogous to the way in which simple life forms are now believed to have been incorporated as organelles in complicated 'modern' organisms. <br><br>This is extraordinary because it may offer a solution to the origin of life problem without invoking luck, panspermia or divine intervention. The origin problem is the greatest challenge in the study of life processes, and understanding it would be among the greatest human intellectual achievements.<br><br>England is not "just staying". He is developing a rigorous theoretical framework that allows testable predictions, based on simple experiments, or even just revealuation of existing data. Although England doesn't like to use the word entropy, the fact is that his theoretical work is a development of the second law of thermodynamics (which is as close to a universal natural law as it gets), so it's underpinnings are as robust as anything in science. <br><br>The coming together of the fields of thermodynamics and evolution is profound.<br><br>England also has an interesting take on language that fits well with much discussed in this blog.

I figured it was just tone-deafness or the equivalent on my part. <br><br>YCS, classical Indian music is a great example of an art form that's made a successful transition to the period of performance. Nobody writes new ragas, but there's plenty of room for brilliant creativity in how well they're played!<br><br>Jo, excellent! That's exactly it -- a lot of older technologies do at least as good a job with fewer costs and downsides, and so going retro results in improved outcomes across the board. <br><br>Esn, it's the arrangements of traditional hymns in new forms, and similar variations on existing themes, that are the wave of the future. Folk music shows the process in its mature form -- there's a coherent body of traditional tunes, to which occasionally things get added, and musicians strive to play them as well as possible with a personal interpretation just a bit different from anyone else's. <br><br>David, thanks for the pointer -- clearly I need to find the time to read López Corredoira, not least because Unamuno and Ortega y Gasset are very much to my taste. <br><br>Cherokee, I was glad to see the Australian election end in such chaos -- anything that shakes the certainties of the neoliberal consensus is a good thing. I wonder, if nobody ever comes up with enough of a majority to install a government, do you get to do without one until the next election? That might be popular. ;-) As for the Fourth of July, it was rained out here -- we had a downpour. I'll take that as an omen for this year's election. <br><br>Donalfagan, once you start talking about WANs and Ubuntus, you might as well be conversing in Tocharian B, you know. ;-)<br><br>Revere, opera in the Atlantic Republic is a rich person's affectation, supported by constant fundraising campaigns. I wouldn't say that it's thriving, but they put on three operas a year. In the Lakeland Republic, it's somewhat more successful, not least because the nose-in-the-air attitude was discarded out of necessity, and the Toledo Opera got its start (and its initial popularity) doing light opera -- these days there's a separate organization, Light Opera Lakeland (the acronym is deliberate), that puts on touring productions ranging from <i>The Magic Flute</i> to Gilbert and Sullivan. Most of the post-US republics have one opera company -- the Missouri Republic is a little unusual in having two, one in Minneapolis and one in Omaha -- so they can draw on fairly widespread geographical regions. <br><br>As for Metastasian opera seria -- no, my background in opera generally is fairly spotty, and I hadn't heard of that until you mentioned it. (My exposure to Wagner comes entirely from growing up in Seattle as a Tolkien-crazed fantasy buff, and attending my first Ring cycle at the age of fifteen.) I'll check it out as circumstances permit. <br><br>Ezra, as far as I know I didn't get it. Blogger eats comments sometimes. The issue with changing the alphabet is that the cost of redoing all written communication, all keyboards, all published books, all road signs, etc., etc., etc., far outweighs the benefits of having a slightly more intuitive alphabet. <br><br>John, well, I certainly don't claim to speak for the Tao! That's simply my personal preference. <br><br>Aron, of course it is. The arrival of the period of performance isn't the end of creativity -- it just involves a different kind of creativity. <br><br>Mark, I won't argue that there are some twentieth century art music composers that are listenable -- though I notice that no two of my readers seem to agree on who they are! I'm tolerably fond of early Satie, myself. <br><br>Trippticket, peak permaculture is an interesting concept -- I wonder how well a discussion of that would go over in permaculture circles... ;-)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c5108795629708370552 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 10:29 PM</a><br><br>

No doubt people will do their level best to ignore that and insist anyway that I'm trying to drag them back to a caricature of the Evil Past, but I've done what I can. <br><br>Mark, I remember the death of rock, too, though I somehow managed to miss the term "plod rock"! Funny. The future of rock and roll is already with us, though: tribute bands. There's one that plays here in Cumberland fairly often that does classic Doobie Brothers as well as, and occasionally better than, the originals -- and you can bet people are out there dancing to it. <br><br>Over the Hill, a remarkably cogent answer! <br><br>FiftyNiner, thank you. Yes, Carr's finally getting it. <br><br>Donald, nah, it's Janice Mikkelson, whom we'll be seeing in rather more detail in a bit. Are there new operas being made? Now, or in 2065? <br><br>Sgage, that's too funny. I hope you still have at least one of the cards. <br><br>JB, I won't argue. They're digging away...<br><br>Unknown Joel, I won't argue, but then I tend to steer clear of theological arguments over the various versions of Windows! ;-)<br><br>RPC, remember that Carr is speaking as of 2065, not as of 2015. Yes, I know some 20th century opera is still being performed; I'm hypothesizing that there will have been a reaction against it by 2065, and that the better pieces will be rediscovered and revived sometime in the early 22nd century. <br><br>Toomas, fair enough. I'll concede, in part, on testing, if you'll grant that doing much of anything technological with General Relativity is much more expensive than doing anything technological with Maxwell's electromagnetic theories!<br><br>Eric, it seems to me that you may be stuck in the modern belief that the period of innovation is good and the period of performance is bad. I'd like to suggest a more nuanced approach. Instead of frantically hunting around for some new place to innovate, why not instead take the time to absorb and appreciate the territory that's already been marked out, by performing for a while? Constantly innovating is like constantly eating: if you never take the time to digest, you're not going to get much benefit from the activity. Performance demands just as much talent, genius, and creativity as innovation, even though it's applied in different ways. <br><br>Ien, I could have written at least as much about 20th century art, much of which could be replaced with dried hamster vomit on canvas without anyone noticing the difference. That is to say, I agree wholeheartedly. What's more, my wife Sara has a degree in art history, and feels the same way...<br><br>Owen, I wonder if some Linux mechanic could take pity on us poor drudges who have to suffer through the excretions of Microsoft et al., and get excited about the prospect of coming up with a simple, sturdy, reliable, needs-no-tinkering Linux release that runs OpenOffice, a good freeware internet browser, and a few other commonly used programs, and that's all. Probably 75% of all computer users just need that, and a lot of them would leap to ot in a heartbeat if only it were available!<br><br>Ed, that was <i>The Abduction from the Seraglio</i>, and yes, like anything by Mozart, it's a romp.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c6498360224605897744 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 10:57 PM</a><br><br>

The guy was <i>The Emperor's New Clothes</i> rewritten: "Here is a wonderful musical score," he said, handing out a blank sheet of paper, "which only those of superior taste and discernment can enjoy..."<br><br>Toomas, but it's equally invalid to assume, from that argument, that science can't run up against the law of diminishing returns. There is, after all, no prima facie reason why there must be a limitless number of things that can be understood using the particular set of human activities we call science. Logically speaking, both possibilities have to be held in abeyance pending the arrival of new data. When it comes to technology, though, I think a very strong case can be made that the point of negative returns arrived some time ago -- but if I understand you correctly, you're not disputing that.<br><br>Raymond, fascinating. None of this surprises me in the least. <br><br>Vesta, I know it contradicts the conventional wisdom of our time to suggest that science also functions in a limited notional space. Darwin was one of the great pioneers of one part of that space -- he was the Newton of biology, and like Newton, took a protoscience that was mere description and categorization and turned it into something capable of making valid predictions. (For example, he predicted that the Earth was much older than physical theory in his time allowed, and he turned out to be dead right.) England is filling in one of the big blanks; while I find his work fascinating, it builds on a foundation established by Ilya Prigogine, and ultimately back to Carnot and the basic concepts of thermodynamics. If he's right, and I think he is, he's solved one of the few really large outstanding problems in evolutionary theory, how life evolves out of nonliving matter. <br><br>How many more big problems -- as big as that one, or the ones that Darwin tackled -- are left for evolutionary biologists to take on? Not that many; there are plenty of midsized problems, and a vast number of little ones -- what's the connection between the therapsids and the earliest reptiles, etc.-- but those are little blanks to be filled up in the notional space into which Darwin first ventured. What's more, there aren't an infinite number of questions as big as the one Darwin tackled -- "where do species come from?" -- and many of those already have answers. Off in the distance, we can see the point at which only little questions remain. What then? <br><br>Ed-M, Dmitry's hobby has been shared by plenty of other people over the last few centuries -- as I noted, J.R.R Tolkien was one of them. They fall in the "derivative" category mentioned earlier.<br><br>Lynnet, that's very much a matter of personal taste. A few of those I'd consider listenable; others -- ugh. You'll notice, though, that only a very few of them get any degree of enthusiasm from outside the narrow circle of the cognoscenti...<br><br>Danil, when we're getting into anonymous informants making unprovable claims on dubious websites, I roll my eyes -- and remember, I'm no fan of Clinton. <br><br>Daelach, fascinating. The thought of Vivaldi played as metal is intriguing enough that I may just give it a listen. <br><br>Submarine, and now we have snipers gunning down police officers from a rooftop in Dallas. I wonder if anybody is going to argue with me the next time I point out that the United States is very, very close to civil war...<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c2836026815998812066 title="comment permalink">7/7/16, 11:20 PM</a><br><br>

Berber isn't really that well suited either to the Latin or the Arabic alphabet, so an old alphabet was picked up, lightly reworked, and put to use. Other new alphabets that have actually found a place in common use came out of the same sort of process. <br><br>Greg, yes, I think you could say there's a certain aesthetic space between opera and Power Noise! I'm glad you enjoy the latter. As for Quigley, I need to get to him one of these days, but haven't managed it yet. <br><br>Denis, nah, I save geomancy for other uses. What I use instead is history. If you file off the serial numbers, the process by which every technology gets introduced, loaded with complexity to the breaking point, and then gradually either gets abandoned or stumbles back to a level of complexity that makes sense, is the same. Watch the way that naval vessels in the age of sail went for topheavy complexity to the point of oops-we-sank-the-Vasa, and then backed off from it, eventually settling on a range of standard designs that would still be in use today if steam engines and the manufacture of plate steel in huge quantities hadn't rendered them obsolete, and you're in the same story. Know your narratives and you'll rarely be surprised...<br><br>Rube, fascinating. It seems like a very obvious idea to me!<br><br>Eric, of course, but that's equivalent to the folk process -- the way, for example, that familiar folk songs mutate to fit changing conceptions of music: the shift from Mixolydian to Ionian (major scale) modes in American folk music, for example. No doubt once the steam engine has existed for millennia, steam engines will have adaepted into forms that would seem very odd to James Watt, while still using the same principles. <br><br>Unknown, wasn't it Glass' opera <i>Akhenaten</i> in which one entire scene consisted of someone reading all Akhenaten's formal titles as pharaoh of Egypt out loud against a background of boring electronic sounds? The emperor's new score...<br><br>Adrian, delighted to hear that Chicago's doing the Ring! I'm not sure if that survived the Second Civil War, but we'll hope so. <br><br>W.B., so your entire life has been lived on the downslope of the computer age. There's an essay in there somewhere...<br><br>Hereward, excellent. I was wondering if any of my readers caught that. <br><br>Clark, doesn't surprise me at all. I only got one copy of your comment, btw, so you apparently did it right. ;-)<br><br>Cherokee, we'll hope that it's measles. Most of the alternatives are worse. <br><br>SLClaire, a paper map's a very, very useful technology. I used an old auto atlas to plan out Trey sunna Gwen's journey across Meriga in <i>Star's Reach</i>, and I'm currently using the same one to send Owen Merrill on a road trip to an isolated town in western New York for the third book in the <i>Weird of Hali</i> series, and in every case it's quicker to use and gets me more information faster than a map program would. <br><br>Nuku, true enough. Game theory has it that you can only maximize one variable at a time, so if you insist on maximizing originality, sooner or later you have to let go of beauty. <br><br>Kfish, many thanks for the link! <br><br>Justin, it would have been perfectly possible for a medieval European or Chinese alchemist to build a radio transmitter and receiver -- they simply didn't happen to have the necessary knowledge.

Still, I think my point stands -- and can be confirmed by watching how many people show up to a concert of 20th century music compared to how many show up to a concert of 18th or 19th century music...<br><br>Kevin, excellent! Yes, exactly -- "progress" is simply a label for the technologies that happened to win out, for whatever reason. One of the other aspects of the technology bush is that some of those "lower" branches are still quite vital and can put out leaves and blossoms with the best of the "upper" ones.<br><br>Michael, by 2065 there are no pristine ecosystems -- or more precisely, it's been recognized that there never were any. "Invasive species" have existed since the beginning of life on the planet. By 2065 global warming has upended the old climate belts, migration patterns and ranges for many living things have changed drastically, and the world is reorganizing ecologically, just as it has done every other time the climate has changed sharply (which it last did around 9600 BCE and has done at irregular intervals all through time). That Eurasian collared dove may be the ancestor of a whole family of future bird species in North America, because that's the way life on earth works. <br><br>Francis, of course -- just as the architecture of ancient Rome inspired American political architecture without the latter being a copy of the former. I kind of hope that Wright isn't the model that Lakeland architecture takes, because he was exactly the kind of impractical architect who's too busy chasing a vision to make roofs that don't leak. Thus I think you'd find, if you could stroll around Toledo in Carr's footsteps, that a lot of the buildings that went up after the Second Civil War were inspired by 19th century American brick vernacular architecture, but very few of them copied it exactly; and the Capitol, while it looks from the outside very much like a standard 19th century US state capitol building, has various carefully thought out changes to the structure, layout, and infrastructure, since it was designed to work with early- to mid-20th century technology. <br><br>Thanks for the reassurance regarding the <a href=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/2009-0604-19-SeattleCentralLibrary.jpg rel=nofollow>Seattle Public Library</a>, btw.

How does the Lakeland Republic deal with invasive species/actively maintain the integrity of its ecosystems?"<br><br>"Invasive species" are largely a product of human disturbance on an industrial scale. For example, down here in the Deep South, kudzu runs rampant over forests edged by compromised soil/disturbance. We see it as a problem to be solved, but Nature just sees nitrogen-fixer, soil stabilizer, biomass builder, in short, all of the things needed to FIX the damage caused by humans in that area.<br><br>Where you are, purple loosestrife might make a more familiar example, choking out waterways with its never-ending expansion. But field trials indicate that if you remove the excess nitrogen and phosphorous - nutrient overflow from industrial agriculture - from those same waterways, the loosestrife will actually disappear fairly quickly. It's just cleaning up after us.<br><br>I treat dandelions in the garden the same way: if you let them do their job they will improve themselves right out of the system. What are tough, deep, recalcitrant roots this season will be shriveled and anemic a couple years later. They are only a problem if you pull them before they've finished their job.<br><br>Obviously the species in question don't need to be exotic to be considered invasive. When we moved to the farm we're at now we brought a relatively large influx of poultry with us, and therefore an energy spike to the system from all the feed and manure. We were overrun with flies for a few weeks as a result. But then a group of bald-faced hornets moved in, who are fly-eating specialists. The farm owner wanted to nuke them, no reason they should live he said, but I patiently explained WHY they were there and how they were helping, and the evidence since then has been convincing enough that a fairly large paper hornet nest is still functioning happily not too far away from the living space. And guess what? Nobody has gotten stung. Not once. He and I have actually followed individual hornets around and watched them work. It's pretty impressive!<br><br>First thing they do when they catch a fly is chew its wings off, making it a "walk" instead. Walks are a lot easier to handle than flies! Hornets are beautiful.<br><br>Not humans, but <i>fossil fuel-powered humans</i> are probably the only genuinely invasive species on the whole planet. Steady state native/exotic recombinant ecologies will probably be fairly common in the deindustrial future, I'm pretty sure, just as they've been part of our world, to one degree or another, since we started impacting the ecosystems around us. The lack of abundant energy to throw at so-called invasives in the Lakeland Republic will probably midwife this steady state into existence a lot sooner than our tinkering ever will.<br><br>Purple loosestrife isn't a problem; it's a solution.

I practically howled with delight when I started reading this evening and realized you were going to talk about Parsifal which IMHO comes as close to the climax work of the Western musical tradition as anything out there -- and you even juxtaposed it with the Magic Flute (which Ingmar Bergman does in his film of the Magic Flute).<br><br>But then I ran into the first genuinely stupid remarks I have read on your blog -- the jibes at Britten -- to pick Britten of all composers as representative of 20th century music; a composer who was effectively spat on by the academic musical establishment. (Luigi Nono, I think, actually refused to shake his hand).<br><br>Peter Grimes is arguably the only opera written since 1945 to have achieved real box-office Mozart/Verdi type success. I simply can't believe you have ever heard it, otherwise you wouldn't write such silly things. The evocation of the sea in the orchestral interludes is equalled only by Wagner in the Flying Dutchman and Debussy in La Mer. The dramatic tightness of the first act -- it is one ever-intensifying arc and it bears comparison with similarly tight dramatic arcs as act 1 of Walkure or Act 3 of Otello. And it works in the opera house -- I have sat admit spellbound crowds at Covent Garden.<br><br>Ditto Turn of the Screw -- yes, a chamber opera -- but dramatically and musically so powerful. (Attended a nearly sold out performance at ENO some years ago.) Admittedly, Britten didn't always reach these heights -- Midsummer Night's Dream is always going to appeal to fairly small groups as will the the three church operas inspired by the Noh. <br><br>But turn from the operas to some of Britten's other achievements -- the two orchestral song cycles (Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings and the Nocturne for Tenor and Seven Obligato Instruments) are masterpieces on a par with similar works by Berlioz and Mahler. Prince of Pagodas can take its place next to the great Stravinsky Ballades. The War Requiem is one of the greatest and most moving meditations on the folly of war ever done -- and Britten demonstrated at the opening of the Tuba Mirum that he could outdo Verdi at this own game. The Ceremony of Carols is done worldwide by hundreds of choruses at Christmas time -- only the Messiah is a more reliably popular seasonal piece of classical music. Not to mention Variations and and Fugue on a Theme by Purcell -- incredibly popular orchestral show piece (used most recently by Wes Anderson in his film Moonrise Kingdom as a unifying piece of music); Noye's Fludde -- demonstrating that modern composers can write pieces that kids will love to perform and are still great pieces of music if only they'll make the effort and not be snoots...<br><br>GRRRRR<br><br>Tag Murphy<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c8259888760795272801 title="comment permalink">7/8/16, 3:17 AM</a><br><br>

Some good points, too. You've, um, been doing this a while.<br><br>@JMG: <br>I'm not necessarily suggesting the concept of peak permaculture so much in regards to its philosophy as I am some of its stock practices. Philosophically, I think permaculture has a lot to offer the modern industrialist: stack functions, value the marginal, enhance whole system connections, and so forth. Good stuff.<br><br>But there is definitely a doctrine of fringe practices associated with permaculture that seem dubious to me after several years of experimentation. Heavy mulches are great. Sometimes. And in some climates or situations. Where in live in lower Appalachia mulch is a mobile element in my gardens/orchards. When it's dry I lay it down. When it's wet I pull it back. In spring I prefer to have dark soil absorbing solar heat and in summer I prefer to have light-colored mulches reflecting as much of the sun's intensity as possible.<br><br>Of course the permaculture literature is quick to point out that it is in fact site-, climate-, and culturally-specific, and that there are no effective blanket solutions. How that very wise view got parlayed into "always build water and energy capturing swales, mulch heavily, and companion plant" is really the issue. I like companion planting, and have derived real benefits from it, but sometimes it just gets in the way. My newest garden plot (about 1800 s.f.) is an amalgamation of best practices arrived at over years of experimentation in this climate, and it is definitely friendlier to its human element than it is to, say, plant polycultures.<br><br>Which is all to say yes, experiment, refine, and embrace ecological wisdom, but don't be afraid to do things in proven ways.

I'd like to suggest a more nuanced approach. Instead of frantically hunting around for some new place to innovate, why not instead take the time to absorb and appreciate the territory that's already been marked out, by performing for a while? Constantly innovating is like constantly eating: if you never take the time to digest, you're not going to get much benefit from the activity. Performance demands just as much talent, genius, and creativity as innovation, even though it's applied in different ways.”<br><br>It may be that I’m getting stuck on a different interpretation of what performance is versus exploration… It seems like there’s a situation here where there are some art forms that are easier to “perform” in, than others. If you’re an actor, singer, or engineer, performing within the territory that’s already been marked out is an easy thing to do. But what if you’re a writer, poet, or painter? The act of copying out a piece written by someone else isn’t quite the same art form as writing something of your own. Though there’s definitely an art and skill to calligraphy, bookbinding, etcetera, putting together an illuminated manuscript of the Lord of the Rings isn’t quite the same art form as sitting down and composing a fantasy novel. Memorizing poetry by rote and performing it isn’t exactly the same thing as being a poet, it’s being an orator. And most painters I know don’t sit there copying out famous paintings line by line and stroke by stroke, they’re usually making their living by creating portraits of clients, painting landscapes that they encounter, and painting scenes out of their own imagination, (given my circle of friends, usually images of deities or scenes from mythology). Straight through its decline and fall, Rome still produced Latin poets and writers all the way up to the 7th century (and that’s just among those that have survived, which mostly consists of hagiographies and hymns, with a very few pagan writers such as Rutilius… but since Rome was still Rome when it Christianized, late Roman texts like the City of God can still count among its literary achievements). And there were still poets writing in Greek and Latin by the time the first poetic pieces of the emerging seed cultures that grew out of its collapse were being composed in Old English, Irish, Norse and Arabic. Even civilizations like Ancient Egypt that went through long periods of stability have plenty of hymns, love poems, discourses, dialogues, laments, and narratives all through their history. I can’t find a single point in world history where literature just stops being composed and gives way to rote performance of things that have already been written (and when there isn’t a corpus of surviving literature from a culture or time period, all that means is that it was an oral culture that didn’t write anything down but still composed, or that they wrote on perishable materials in wet landscapes that aren’t good at preserving things).<br><br>Is the mistake I’m making assuming that all new literature or all composition counts as exploration and innovation, and performance is exclusively copying? Does composing a new piece within the rules of an established form count as a form of performance, so that a painter painting a landscape in a classical style, or a poet following very particular rules of composition is actually a performer rather than an innovator? Is it that some art forms are harder to exhaust than others? Or is there a point at which the literary potential of a culture runs out, and the best answer is to trade in writers and poets for publishers and printers? If it’s the later, and you’re a writer, or a poet, or a painter or composer isn’t it only natural to try to seek out the niches where writing, painting, and composing are still acceptable things to do?<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c5248157453693240689 title="comment permalink">7/8/16, 6:50 AM</a><br><br>

The herbalist that has informed me the most is Matthew Wood. In his two volumes of Earthwise Herbal he looks at almost all of the major and much of the minor Western materia medica quoting from Galen, Moses Maimonides, Culpepper etc, all the way down to contemporaries. Of course the contemporary master herbalist contribute many specific indications, but they are <i>ultra</i> specific, and sometimes become so etheric that they dance with noise. Earthwise Herbal is a great compilation as much as an original work. I really dig Matthew Woods homeopathic approach, but it is the compilation aspect that has kept me coming back for more.<br><br>So while I use herbs with myself and others in ways that are at times a little bit creative, I almost always find myself quoting others and saying "this tends to work well in my practice," than "I discovered this on my own." There are a few exceptions, but I have no doubt that these indications were discovered before, I just hadn't read of them. Even with the dozen uses I've discovered independantly for various herbs they all fit into the logic of the plant and are very minor discoveries (i.e thyme for emotional hiccouping, which simply is a practical application of Matthew Wood's assertions that it is a parasympathetic relaxant). With herbs this is nice since Hippocrates in his little piece on "the craft so long to learn" mentions that "experimentation is dangerous." <br><br>the shift from creativity to presarverance is also nice: instead of coming up with new things the focus shifts then to reproducing the "best of" compilation with as much fidelity and resolution as possible, perhaps occaisonally stumbling upon something a little bit of something new. you mentioned before in a comment to me maybe a year and a half ago that there are many benefits to being in a culture past its creative part and this seems like one. Working with the "greatest hits" of a culture means that most of the "filler" has been forgotten. Sure people don't have the same sort of creativity in terms of laying claim to some area of culture, but I don't mind personally. I give simples and make herbal mixes and they are way more effective than if I hadn't spent many hours memorizing the words of the Masters, and using them in the real world not to mention growing and extracting them is deeply satisfying to my creative impulse.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c2609789860192115145 title="comment permalink">7/8/16, 6:59 AM</a><br><br>

While I'm not sure the outside is as bad as Seattle Central Library, the inside of the library was the worst library I've ever seen. I walked in, and there's a television with news blaring continuously right in the center of the library, along with chairs to sit and watch it, near the adult book section. You can't browse for adult books without hearing the television! I thought however bad libraries have gotten, none have yet become like airports with television, but I guess I was wrong. Then there is a media section almost as large at the book section, with some animated movie blaring continuously. Plus the library is noisily alive. In the back of the library is a small, overcrowded quiet reading room for those persons who actually want to concentrate on reading a book. Much of the Teen Space is like a Video Game Arcade. And the Children's Room is atrocious. With a partnership with a National Science Foundation it has become half library, half museum, with lots of touch screen "interactive" places amidst the books. You can even use digital microscopes and attend a digital story time. The director there told me they wanted to focus on STEM and promote active learning and instead of passive text-based learning, hence all the "innovation." Ugh.

But somehow this is not the climax yet; we're still meeting important new characters. Which could mean something's about to go boom back home in the AR. Yeah, I know, "heh heh heh." :)<br><br>One complaint: no one else seems to have minded, but from a pure drama point of view, I thought Carr's and Berger's quick reconciliation was a little disappointing. Of course, it would have been more disappointing if they never spoke to one another again or never got back to pursuing a relationship. And I'm not a big fan of pointless romantic complications where the characters keep missing each other's phone calls or whatever. But in this case the emotional aspect of their disagreement was an interesting facet of the central premise, and it felt like it kind of got cut short or put aside for convenience, at a point where Carr hadn't really figured anything out yet.<br><br>Regarding art and notional spaces: what happens to novelists during a period of performance? Are they out of luck, or are there types of writing (formulaic genre fiction, perhaps) that are better categorized as performance than as innovation in the first place? If the latter, it seems we've been in a period of performance for novels-in-general for quite a while.<br><br>One could ask the same question regarding, for instance, composers and playwrights, but in those cases there's an ongoing artistic role for a large contingent of performers even in the absence of new works. Even the copying of paintings has been considered a worthy artistic pursuit in some eras. But it would take a very dark age indeed for copying novels to be considered so.* There's live storytelling, of course, but that's its own art form, and not really related to fiction writing the way opera singing, staging, directing, etc. is related to opera composing.

The first is Microsoft’w attempt to unify five (!) distinct operating system code bases, including the X-Box 1 game console and the almost invisible Windows Phone. Windows 8 was the first attempt, Windows 8.1 (which was actually Windows 9 suffering from embarrassment) was an attempt to fix most of the problems caused by Windows 8.

In the “article I’ve seen recently” camp is one talking about Raytheon (I think that’s the company) who makes chips for the military. Those chips use a different technology and have a 30-year guaranteed lifetime. You won’t see those in consumer products.<br><br>The “increasing computing power” thing is mostly in the super-computer realm. It’s also in specialty chips.

But I’m not sure this very valid point fully accounts for the abomination that the avant-garde academies have given us.<br><br> My observation is that while the CIA was funding avant-garde music and art, its punishing qualities were an intentional part of the package. It was intimidation and belligerance as art: Art as war by other means. (Ford Foundation and other front-organizations were giving grant money to the grad students and university professors of arts and music that proposed the ugliest and most offensive work—I know because I was applying for grant money and observing who got funded.) There really was nothing in the theoretical rationales for most avant-garde styles that required it to be ugly and unbearable. But ugly and unbearable were getting funded.<br> My point is that the artists of the western world post-WWII did not run out of good ideas or notional space, but a lot of them who declined to punish their audiences got no money, and could not make anything.<br><br> In fact, there is a record label that has done very good business for the past 45 years, recording avant-garde jazz that definitely builds on the music theory that was forced on composers in the mid-twentieth century. But it is very good listening, if you have enough familiarity with tradition that your ear is thirsty for new sounds. It is not brutal, punishing or continuously dissonant. It is by now a huge body of music that is absolutely characteristic of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. It has the ambition of classical music, while drawing on elements of popular music and non-European traditions. <br><br>But this music, like classical music, does not function well as advertising, and my theory is that this incompatibility with ads is the reason most folks don’t hear it. <br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c7396441214473065685 title="comment permalink">7/8/16, 11:53 AM</a><br><br>

A jazz group volunteered to do a Memorial Day concert honoring those who died in Vietnam. This was before attitudes changed and there were protests against the war. At first it was planned as respectful in a traditional way, but it evolved into a modern art spectacle.<br><br>I had a set of long, metal strings screwed to a plank that could be manipulated to form ghostly sounds from eerie and back to unworldly via electronic gimmickry. I joined up. Someone added taped recordings of radio messages calling for artillery, air support and medical evacuation. Battle sound effects were added for authenticity and to heightened the reality of the war in which those that we were to honor had died.<br><br>This was to be a one-off performance and included a chorus of voices behind the group of experienced jazz musicians at center stage. It morphed into an artistic free-for-all. Someone wrote music. Another compiled soldier's letters home and poems to reflect in spoken words, what was going on over there. None of the county officials giving us access to the facilities were hip to this turn.<br><br>At that time jazz was in its peak and it was possible for ordinary people to grasp the visceral impact of community performance art. Participants practiced separately and the chorus learned their lines. I made up a series of sounds that could satisfy the request for “eerie electronic music, not prerecorded.”<br><br>What happened was strange and shocking to those ordinary mourners who came to hear an official County ceremony honoring the recently fallen. No Sousa marching bands were booked, billed or announced. There was no honor guard or flag to salute. There were no uniforms. After setting up and filling the stage with a motley crew of University hangers oners, there was an official welcoming and some concerned stares. It started with introductory comments, nothing approaching future protests and I think a short prayer. We began with several standard sounding jazz tunes and short pauses breaking each into separate glimpses of the old reality. It was a memory of an old time radio broadcast that suddenly started to break up with static. I supplied the static.<br><br>Then the fun began. We plunged out of the music of familiar old jazz into the sudden sound effects of gunfire and helicopters, assaulting the senses, all taped in actual battles. In all this cacophony, the chorus entered in an angelic harmony, but revealed out of tune demons in their midst. The jazz band broke in with more modern jazz sounds; disharmony and blasts of atonal chaos filled the space. The elements; jazz band, chorus, spoken word, battle sound effects and my wire device's moaning wails, warred with each other and acted as waves of energy crashing down on the shocked audience. It was not rehearsed and never repeated.<br><br>None of these aural experiences were in the everyday lives of the mourning parents and loved ones of the deceased. It crashed into them with an unworldly fury invoking the chaos of jungle warfare, where their loved ones had recently died.<br><br>Poignant words were spoken and poems read, barely audible above the clashing sounds. The taped radio messages grew dire. Med-Evac was requested from somewhere in the past, but it seemed immediate. A veteran nurse stepped up to speak of compassion for dying soldiers in her poem. The noise and music died down. Drums beat in muffled paces. Their sacrifice was acknowledged in verse by survivors. The trumpeter blew Taps. It transitioned into a stirring jazz tune offering musical redemption. The whole thing lasted less than an hour.<br><br>The newspaper report was short and terse. There were the traditional parades and picnics in stiff competition. The present day custom ignoring of Memorial Day by barbecuing was not in full practice then. It grew quiet in the hall. We all wept.<br><br>The immediate and spontaneous fits the time and cannot be recreated.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c3088400796357403083 title="comment permalink">7/8/16, 1:19 PM</a><br><br>

So who was that guy in the 50's who generated some biological precursor molecules in a lab? I think that this is similarly not going to contribute much of significance. His ideas about the dissipation of energy and how it might contribute to some complexity as well as his noticing that things go forward and are locked in and don't slip back, and even his discussion of the way that things do not always have to go toward increased entropy - all well and good. <br><br>When I read about what is actually going on in biological systems, things like this are so vague and inadequate that it just doesn't hold out the kind of hope they like to grab at, it seems to me, a bit desperately.<br><br>"The key point is that England has hypothesized a mechanism by which NON-biological (but still natural) selection may produce, reproduce and concentrate complicated structures with various key features we associate with life. Such pre-existing structures might be assembled into something we would recognize as living, in a process analogous to the way in which simple life forms are now believed to have been incorporated as organelles in complicated 'modern' organisms."<br><br>I note the words "may" and "might." I don't see how this very nebulous process compares to the possibility that already living cells may have incorporated other living cells. He is (as usual - this type of point gets made over and over) showing how nonliving things can sometimes organize into very elegant, interesting and sort of complex arrangements. But note that above I used the word non-repetitive. Life and its processes are no more repetitive than the thoughts and ideas and writings of JMG. <br><br>"This is extraordinary because it may offer a solution to the origin of life problem without invoking luck, panspermia or divine intervention. The origin problem is the greatest challenge in the study of life processes, and understanding it would be among the greatest human intellectual achievements."<br><br>Well, after having spent quite some time reading quite a few books that discuss the way life works, it is my opinion that he isn't even at the starting gate. Perhaps he has noted a natural physical law that does by no means generate code, but that is part of the process. But what I find interesting in your reply above is that you have made the a priori assumption that we don't want divine intervention.<br><br>For a convinced atheist, that is of course the only way to think. But I find myself in the odd position of being more than adequately convinced that Darwinian mechanisms cannot adequately account for the arisal of even radically new life forms from prior bacterial life, and at the same time having a very different idea of what divine intervention in life might entail. Since I do believe that logical evidence shows consciousness and not matter is the true substrate of the universe, it does not actually compute to think that life can arise on its own, because there is no such thing, all things being connected, and consciousness, which is life, pre-existing. And, if there is a divine mind, divine source of existence, that divinity cannot have somehow had nothing to do with the arisal of life. That is so even if one posits a god without personal awareness. <br><br>part 1<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c5524067225375346176 title="comment permalink">7/8/16, 1:41 PM</a><br><br>

The question of thermodynamics is central to life everything. Although I have posited an opposite force, which I call the organizational force. Slightly tongue in cheek. I'll have to think on that one. Because the organizational force is probably something like will, which is life, and is opposite to nonlife in that it has NO desire. Living things disrupt entropy and instead build. So entropy is how matter behaves and organization is how consciousness behaves.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c1308319462398496668 title="comment permalink">7/8/16, 1:41 PM</a><br><br>

We've had a minority government before here although you may not be aware of that, and by all accounts it worked quite well, although the Prime Minister at the time was a female and known for her high level of intelligence and ability to co-operate and communicate. The funny side of that story is that the opposition of the time who now hold the highest number of seats but not quite enough to govern in their own right, set about establishing a meme that the minority government of that time was an abhorrent and unworkable beast when in fact they passed a great deal of legislation. And they stuck to that meme like glue ever since. And now, as often occurs, they now have to face up to meme and get a dose of their own medicine. There really have been calls for another election so as to achieve a more desirable result, without actually discussing who sets the bar for what is a desirable result. They must think the population are rather stupid. I was at the coal face and I saw some serious anger in the population and no way would I pursue that strategy of a re-election as my gut feeling is that they will get thumped. The other funny story that I was trying to get my head around were the many artistic displays by the public of phallic symbolism - there were certainly more than a few examples of that as well as some amusing commentary which kept us entertained!<br><br>Anyway, rather than blaming their own policies for the recent election failure, they are fixated on the oppositions campaign. It is mildly surreal to see adults not coming to grips with the simple fact that they themselves are responsible for their own situation and that perhaps the ground has shifted beneath them. I did actually expect to find adults and an adult response to their election outcome.<br><br>No doubt that you are correct in that assertion. My gut feeling is that this is a slow turning point of increasing medical dramas. There really are hard upper limits on the size of the human population whether we acknowledge them or not. I used to wonder about that, but once I understood that nature will step in when necessary then it really became rather obvious that we can wish all we want, but the reality will be somewhat different.<br><br>Oh, by the way, I'm really not enjoying the Grimm brothers collected fairy tales from the final 1857 edition. The constant hammering on of Christian symbolism, adherence and submission to the patriarchy and the state, the skewed gender role models presented. I mean the whole thing just annoys me no end. They even introduced a pre Christian concept of the Tree of Life and then subverted that (as others have too) to a Christian concept. Well done them. Their sheer dogged determination to pursue an agenda where they saw themselves as the intellectual superiors who would be better off running the show is just gobsmacking. I realise people love these fairy tales and they hold onto them dearly, but really to my mind the Grimm brothers really subverted them to their own ends and my gut feeling is that this sort of thing has been going on for a very long time.<br><br>Incidentally, as a fascinating thought experiment, many years ago I read an interesting statistic - and I cannot for the life of me remember where - that at that time 90% of articles in the newspaper were supplied to the newspapers by companies, governments and other entities as fill for dissemination into the public sphere, how much worse can it be nowadays since the incredible reduction of paid journalists employed by those same newspapers? No doubt this has a bearing on the recent pundits - they are paid after all.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c527039129228186114 title="comment permalink">7/8/16, 5:18 PM</a><br><br>

One is made of rayon and is yellowing slightly (the background color is off white). One is cotton, and the other is silk. All three are still in good shape and I still wear them for special occasions. So in my experience at least, silk and cotton clothes last as long and look as good after the same length of time as rayon.<br><br>Re your point about processing of rayon versus cotton, I did a quick Internet check to confirm that the process for producing rayon from wood fibers is pretty similar to that for producing paper from wood fibers. If you have ever been unfortunate enough to have been near a paper mill - I have driven past them - you will have noticed a sulfurous stink emanating from them. There's a reason for that. Here's a link to a diagram of the process for the production of rayon:<br><br>http://www.engr.utk.edu/mse/Textiles/Rayon%20fibers.htm<br><br>The top process uses CS2, carbon disulfide. Nasty poisonous stuff, takes a lot of energy to make it, and is why the process stinks of sulfur. Lots of toxic byproducts to get into the environment and wreak havoc, not to mention the energy used. The other two diagrammed processes don't use CS2, but they still use plenty of energy and lead to byproducts. The bottom one uses cotton rather than wood fiber as the starting point, so not only do you have the problems with growing cotton that you noted, but more problems and more energy use and more waste from converting it to rayon. <br><br>Industrial tree growing (the monoculture tree plantations that I drive through on the way to visit my mother in FL), the source of the wood fiber for rayon and for paper, is not much better on the land than cotton agriculture. After one has grown a few cycles of trees on the land, the soil is depleted. It takes a lot longer than cotton ag to deplete the soil, but deplete it it does.<br><br>As you noted, industrial cotton agriculture depletes soil rapidly. But cotton doesn't have to be grown that way. Some (expensive, of course) organic cotton cloth and clothing can be found. Also while processing cotton into cloth requires energy and produces some waste, it's primarily a mechanical rather than a chemical process, so it is less hard on the environment than is the processing of wood fiber or cotton into rayon.<br><br>Given the nastiness of the process of converting wood pulp to rayon, or the redundancy and resultant waste of converting usable cotton to rayon, plus the industrial-ag tree plantations from which the wood fiber comes, even conventional cotton is no more damaging to the environment to produce than is rayon, and probably less. Organic cotton is less damaging. But then we both know that the least damaging option is to continue to wear the skirts we already have rather than buy new ones. So our best option is to keep ourselves in good enough shape that we can wear our skirts for 20, 30, 40, or more years and to care properly for the skirts during that time.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c4046569247025484983 title="comment permalink">7/8/16, 7:06 PM</a><br><br>

Kudzu, lovely kudzu, got introduced to the South because in Japan it is prolific plant that provides both food and medicine, plus it has the most lovely flowers! Under traditional Japanese agriculture (and search "Satoyama" for more on that), it wasn't an issue. It was a healthy component of the semi-wild areas near cultivated fields. But now, with elderly farmers abandoning their fields, it is a green Godzilla. If it starts invading from the borders, it is a real pain to try to get out. My husband truly fears it. Wild boars to the rescue! They root around and dig up all those tough but tasty roots, and you are lucky they are also invading the South. Good healthy meat, too, unless you've had a nuclear meltdown.<br><br>Japanese hops are another story. I take time to expunge them wherever they rear their heads because they are massive, wiry and allergenic. They were regarded as a nasty weed 1000 years ago, long before ugly public works needed to be covered up. But they do excel at the latter. I read that they were imported to America as an "ornamental." What on Earth were they thinking? They do provide an anti-fungal, but I have not found it to be very effective.<br><br>Dandelions are just plain wonderful. I don't begrudge them any space they decide is theirs. I pull the leaves and use them in green drinks. Once in a while, I go dig up all the roots for coffee/liver tonic.<br><br>But the Asian giant hornets (see: http://www.wired.com/2016/02/absurd-creature-of-the-week-the-huge-bee-decapitating-that-hornet-cant-survive-group-hugs/ )--there is a good chance they will prove to be my undoing some day, but we all have to die. A particularly aggressive variety has started invading Kyushu from the mainland. Their favorite food is honeybees, and their second seems to be blueberries, which they devastate even before they can ripen. They do redeem themselves somewhat by pollinating the raspberries in place of the missing honeybees. Asian giant hornets, like eagles, do not stoop to flies.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c893022357671008135 title="comment permalink">7/8/16, 8:38 PM</a><br><br>

I do think very much that the “notional space” of, say, styles of poetry in the English language has been effectively filled, to the point that most modern poetry is noise (probably most things after Ezra Pound, who was exploring the edges of that notional space from a standpoint of deep familiarity with the poetic canon). There really are limits to how one can use the sounds and rhythms of a given language to produce beautiful utterances; as has been mentioned elsewhere among the comments, eventually , in the pursuit of innovation, beauty is sacrificed. And then what is the point?<br><br>That said, I do think (obviously, considering what I do) that there is value in revisiting old forms to see what might be done with them. Professor Tolkien thought the same way concerning poetry, and his were the first examples I saw of Modern English put into Germanic Alliterative Verse.<br><br>Content is another matter. Anyone can write a new sonnet, filling an old form with new meaning. In his book on Indo-European comparative poetics (“How to Kill a Dragon”), Calvert Watkins wrote about the poets who composed the hymns of the Rg Veda about three-and-a-half millenia ago, that they were continually striving to innovate – but in terms of content rather than of form. That is to say that the forms of Vedic verse were set, but that the field was open in terms of finding new ways to express truth (which from their viewpoint was ineffable, and therefore an inexhaustible subject matter). That is the point of view I hold, as well.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c8633312410915453032 title="comment permalink">7/9/16, 6:17 AM</a><br><br>

I can always count on you to make sense of things in the most objective manner of any writer I've found.<br><br>As far as computer technology running out of notional space, that seems true for consumer electronics, but there's lots more to computing than smartphones and connected appliances. There's lots of innovation going on in Data Analytics (my specialty), it's quite frightening, actually, but that's another story.<br><br>I've been working in software development for 25 years. There is so much bloat and what we call "technical debt" that is weighing down our systems it makes me want to cry. Technical debt is when you are forced to deliver systems with poor solutions due to schedule and other resource constraints. You know you are making a bad decision you will have to pay for later. Engineers hate it and don't do it by choice. One of the main attractions of this field is the possibility of creating elegant, efficient software. The reality is actually very depressing. I am constantly pressured to rush through incomplete, hacked solutions to meet deadline pressures that I have no control over. Things get slower, more expensive, and more complicated with every passing day.<br><br>We have a solution to this that we call "refactoring". As you master a particular system, it is very obvious where the bloat is, and what should be rewritten to be clean, elegant, efficient, reusable, etc… That can work very well, when its "allowed" by engineering management. Unfortunately, it usually takes a system meltdown or the departure of key frustrated engineers to get the green light for this effort. <br><br>I hate the way we build modern software. I have often penned angry rants about our processes and management that I would like to publish, but I don't for fear of burning my bridges. A girl has got to eat. The day I finally cut my ties from this industry I will publish my essays with a bridge-burning inferno of an introduction, and hope it goes viral.<br><br>As for music - I have a degree in classical piano performance, so I have a pretty deep technical knowledge of western music history. I love all kinds of music, and I strongly dislike musical snobbery. There's lots of music I don't get, but I never assume its not worthwhile.

The notional subspace of male vocal harmonies, cheerful and/or meditative melodies, was filled then (with help from the Beatles), and left little room for further innovation. But new performance still sounds fine to my aging ears.

I prefer to think that it was a whimsically noble tweak of jazz over-interpretation, rather than a mean-spirited fraud that led naive young musicians into a dead end.

Lyric in particular offers great performative scope without demanding more than trifling formal innovation. I also think there may be some room left for formal novelty where what we think of as "fiction" and "non-fiction" meet-- e.g. Tolkien, Jung, and Graves stick out as pioneers, but are different enough in how they accomplished it to suggest that more methods might be found.<br><br>In theatre, I've seen a couple of successful productions following a 1997 innovation by Martin Crimp (Attempts On Her Life) in which lines are written but no characters prescribed. Interestingly, this is performative in its drift, because in effect it shifts a burden of authorship onto the director, who must decide what sense and shape to give the scenes. While there is of course a risk of using this form for empty postmodern ends, I see it as maybe offering a way of adapting oral epic forms for audiences who are not necessarily "a people." The playwright can conjure iconic scenarios on a theme without really binding how they are presented or weighted. So perhaps there are some formal innovations left to achieve whose purpose will be to shift literary creativity into performance!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c678775209532769073 title="comment permalink">7/9/16, 5:02 PM</a><br><br>

It's just that it tells me it isn't really that close to wrapping anything up. But it's honest. Also, it is true I am not a person with the background to deeply understand the 2nd law in the chemical sense and he did say a couple of things around the 20 minute mark that were over my head. So if he's got anything good, I'd need to have someone break it down a bit.<br><br>I'm wondering about these nonbiological selection processes – how real are they. I should think we'd have already seen a lot of it.<br><br>My wants are to know the truth. Because I find both Darwinism and basic western religious creationism both too simplistic, and yet it seems that living creatures and even their smallest parts are so unbelievably complex and also have a few other types of issues, the information that brings them about is functionally dissimilar to anything nonbiological processes do. It is hard to imagine a way they can have come about without a deliberate act of will on the part of a mind. But there is a kind of materialist fetish that has overtaken the research in this area. <br><br>So I try to imagine how it might be done. Some people posit a kind of endogenous intelligence, and Jeremy Narby wonders if the DNA molecule might be a kind of immortal, god-like being that is evolving itself by trial and error but with a lot of knowledge and smarts. <br><br>What I was taking issue with in my first comment is an attitude that believers can be tolerated so long as their conclusions are no different than that of a scientific materialist, and the endeavor to have a universe in which, if there happens to be a god, looks no different than one in which there isn't. Which doesn't compute. <br><br>It might be, if England really is onto something, that he has figured out a bit of the tools that are used. The way in which the physical world is a perfect substrate for the development of life is an area of interest for me. Good book about that is Nature's Destiny.<br><br>Consciousness as the substrate is an idea that I have worked into my worldview slowly as it requires a reordering of one's thinking. Bernardo Kastrup is the best to explain it. He's got a book, badly titled, Why Materialism Is Baloney and he also has a website called Metaphysical Speculations. He is not religious, is sciency, and is open to the idea of individual consciousness surviving death but is not sure how it would work, yet he is spiritual. He uses irrefutable logic to make his case. Consciousness is his area of interest.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c1126420656969150315 title="comment permalink">7/9/16, 7:16 PM</a><br><br>

I find him a fairly fascinating character, and his wikipedia article is here:<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_van_Meegeren<br><br>But basically, van Meegeren was an interwar Dutch painter who greatly admired the paintings of the old Dutch Masters and taught himself to paint in the same style. The Dutch art scene of the time, however, panned his work as derivative and he never got anywhere-until he took to labeling his paintings as the work of <i>actual</i> Dutch Masters like Vermeer and selling them as such, at which point he made millions and became one of the 20th century's most prolific art forgers. He was only caught because he sold his forgeries to the Nazis-and then had to prove, after the war, that he'd in fact forged them in order to escape a potential death penalty for collaboration.<br><br>Thing is, however, when you look at van Meegeren's work (an example of it is in the wiki article I linked above), and then look at, say, Jackson Pollack (or anything else the mainstream 20thC art world insisted on creating)-which one comes off as more beautiful? Which is more pleasing to look at? Which one would you rather have hanging in your living room? To me, there isn't even a contest.<br><br>The reason I find Meegeren so fascinating is that he represents a different-and to me, much better-road the 20th century art world could have taken-namely, encouraging people to study older forms of art, learn the techniques by which they were created, and use them to add genuine beauty to the world. As an example of what I'm talking about, take Eastern Orthodox iconography. Iconography is pretty much the antithesis of modern art-it uses a bunch of set visual motifs and patterns, tries to make its meaning as obvious as possible, and is done using a very strict set of techniques designed to make all Icons look stylistically the same across geography, artist, and time. And, when its put into practice today, you get this:<br>http://www.orthodoxartsjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/George-Kordis-HolyTrinity-SC-1.jpg<br>http://www.hoodconstruction.com/images/portfolio/religious/holy-trinity-greek-orthodox/holy-trinity-greek-orthodox-3.png<br>Put both those links into your browser everybody-its probably the most beautiful thing you'll see today. And that was painted in 2012. (At a church in South Carolina I used to go to.)<br>My point-if the art world had focused on simply studying what's beautiful and making more of it, rather than relentlessly trying to find the next new thing, 20th century art would have been much more beautiful than it actually is.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c3695853493358799850 title="comment permalink">7/9/16, 7:42 PM</a><br><br>

I'd simply point out that there's as much disinformation these days opposing the existing order of things as there is supporting it.<br><br>Vesta, au contraire, once you've settled that the same process shapes inanimate as well as animate matter, you've filled in a vast amount of notional space, and you can then fill in much more by taking what's known about each side of the animate/inanimate boundary and applying it to the other. Consider the vast amount of notional space that went away forever when Newton demonstrated that the same force that makes apples fall from trees keeps the Moon in its orbit! Of course any such discovery raises new questions, but if it's a synthesis of any significance, it will settle many more questions than it raises.<br><br>We already know a lot about thermodynamics; we also know a lot about biological evolution; if we fuse the two into a single overarching theory, and that theory works, we take a huge jump closer to the point at which the only meaningful questions that can be asked within the overall paradigm of modern science are questions of detail. Now of course that paradigm will eventually be set aside -- but remember that the last change in grand paradigms was the transition between the logical method pioneered by the Greeks and the scientific method, and the next one will thus in all probability go to something that isn't science in any sense of the word we would recognize at all.<br><br>Team10tim, I'll take your word for it. I've never listened to anything by Wu Tang Clan -- not my style.<br><br>Tag, yes, I figured I'd hear from the Britten fans. I'd like to point out, though, that if you want to convince people to value your aesthetic opinions, the kind of saliva-spattered tirade you've exhibited here really isn't helpful. In fact, it's made me even less interested in giving Britten a second try. <br><br>Tripp, oh, granted. Permaculture is at least two different things -- a set of abstract principles on the one hand, and a specific modern subculture with its own practices and customs on the other. The latter is what I expect, in due time, to reach its peak and begin its normal decline.<br><br>Migrantworker, that's a very good point.<br><br>Donald, I doubt new operas are being written in 2065; there's been a steady decline in the number written per year for the last century or so. As for movies, my guess is that India is the center of the world movie industry in 2065, though there are brash new studios in Johannesburg that are beginning to give Mumbai a run for its money.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c1201957608027027117 title="comment permalink">7/9/16, 11:11 PM</a><br><br>

Writing a sonnet isn't innovation, it's performance; the content may be different from other sonnets, but it'll be expressed in the same form, using the same toolkit of poetic devices, just as each performance of <i>Parsifal</i> uses the same score and libretto but weaves into those the director's vision and the singers' interpretations of the characters and music. I'd suggest similarly that genre fiction, for example, is performative rather than innovative. If you're writing, say, a Western, or a "cozy" mystery, or an epic-fantasy novel, you're working within a fairly well established form, and the art consists of how you assemble and deploy the familiar motifs. <br><br>You can also take an existing genre and deliberately invert some of its formal rules; that's what I'm dong in <i>The Weird of Hali</i> novel, but that's just as much a response to those rules as obeying them. In each of the stories just noted, for example, I'm taking certain conventions of the genre of Lovecraftian horror and deliberately inverting them, but to do that I have to understand them and know how they work, and my inversion of them has to be exact -- thus, for example, shoggoths have to find us uncanny, in exactly the same way that Lovecraft's characters find shoggoths uncanny. So what I'm doing is also a performance, though it's an eccentric one -- rather like the famous production of <i>Othello</i> that had an all-black cast except for Othello, who was played by a white actor. <br><br>Violet, exactly! Herbalism is very much a performative activity, and no less a creative one for that. The existing body of knowledge concerning herbalism gives you the framework within which you improvise in response to the patient's needs -- very much like a jazz musician improvising within an existing set of musical forms.<br><br>Bruno, even used, they're too pricey for me. <br><br>Nrgmiserncaz, it seemed like an obvious thing to put in! Barbers started out as professional shavers -- the word "barber," after all, derives from the Latin <i>barba</i>, "beard" -- and only later got into hairstyling...<br><br>Beneath, oh bright gods. And I didn't think libraries could get any worse...I'm going to have to move my post on the need to reestablish private lending libraries well up the stack. <br><br>Myriad, oh, granted -- if this was a romance novel, or if the romance was more than just an incident in a utopian narrative, I would have had them on the outs for a while, making tentative approaches to reconciliation and then backing away again, or something like that, to build the romantic and sexual tension to the screaming point before finally letting them go through that door. This story's mostly about the ideas, though, and I used the argument and reconciliation as the hinge around which Carr's realization could pivot. Different genres call for different plots! With regard to literature, as I noted in my comment to Eric above, genre fiction is certainly performative rather than innovative, and at this point, so is the novel as a form -- its possibilities have been explored, and now it's a question of how to use the familiar form and toolkit in an interesting and personal way. <br><br>Jbucks, yes, I heard the same sort of thing in college from art students. That's one way to avoid having to come to terms with the fact that what you're doing has stopped being of interest to anyone else, and for good reason. <br><br>Lewis, cooking ought to be performative. If someone's doing innovative cooking, I excuse myself as quickly as possible and go someplace where I can get a decent burger and a beer.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c2748817914676485546 title="comment permalink">7/9/16, 11:30 PM</a><br><br>

It's derivative from the existing alphabetic tradition -- that is to say, it's an alphabet rather than an abjad, a syllabary, a system of ideographs, or some entirely new way to represent language on paper -- and amounts to just one more way to try to do the same thing people have been doing since Phoenician times. <br><br>Spanish Fly, oh man.

To the medieval Europeans, almost all new literature was conscious and deliberate performance, rather than innovation, and in fact they considered well-performed performance highly preferable to some bit of inferior innovation. What they were trying to emulate, to perform, generally, was Classical literature, which was considered to be the peak of innovative achievement. They just did it in the modes of Northern Europe (at least, everywhere north of France), which themselves had long been set in established traditions that saw small variation but excellent performance within the defined limits. And of course the go to example of this is Sir Orfeo, which is just Orpheus and Eurydice in courtly love/fairy story drag, and the only thing that changes even a little bit is a tacked eucatastrophic ending in the traditional European fairy story mode.<br><br>Sometimes the deliberate performance of older, well-rounded modes (the filling of notional space can create roundness and depth, not necessarily dullness and death) can lead to the spark of entirely new (or mostly new) genres: What Tolkien was doing in most of his literature was merely exploring academic hypotheses about his primary subject matter—Northern European tribes and languages—that he'd never have gotten published in the academia of his day. He was investing artistically in the heads of his subjects, even adopting their art forms, in order to empathetically learn from and about them. And yet from that endeavour was born—not entirely out of whole cloth, but mostly—the modern high fantasy genre, the subsequent innovators and then performers of which, even those that dislike Tolkien profoundly, have had to contend with the space he established. Other instances of performance, or revived performance of long-sleeping modes, have not constitently opened up new spaces for experimentation, but as JMG pointed out above, that's not necessarily a bad thing: performance done well has its own beauty and value, and 'derivative' to a medieval poet would probably be taken as a compliment!

By which i mean, anything that is really really good actually becomes bad, and conversely really really bad becomes good. That concept probably has another name, but my friends call it that and i never managed to trace where they took it from. But the thing is -- it's not exactly the same thing, and i wonder if you could help pointing out the difference.<br><br>In your example, Wagner's operas (and you'll have to forgive me a total ignorance about the subject) would be on the verge of being so good that they become bad, which then happens to the post-wagnerians, but wouldn't Mozart also be on the extremes of good-ness? The point being, it is hard to imagine that if Mozart had created some 200 more operas he would necessarily become Wagner-like.<br><br>Changing subject completely, i have started playing a computer game called "Dwarf Fortress" and surprisingly a computer game illustrated the difficulties of "progress". On other similar games, you have something called "research", which is just a button that you press, and then wait for a while, and then magically appears new stuff for you to do. Like, you research "metallurgy" and then your soldiers magically become plate-armor wearers. In Dwarf Fortress, you can pretty much from the start create a "Metal Workshop" just as much as you can create a "Wood Workshop", but while in the latter you can chop trees and build things, in the former you have to also create a "Wood Furnace" for coal and a "Smelter" to turn minerals into metal, and those by their turn require other stuff, so it is actually harder to understand the whole chain of events than to just simply build everything out of wood. And by the way, the "Metal Industry" (that's what it's called in the game) also consumes *more* wood for the same amount of stuff for you need to make coal. I made a "Metal Workshop" and it sat there, unused but for a few times i managed to buy metal bars from merchants. Even though i had understood the concept (what's the precise name? systemic fragility? overlong manufacturing chain?) from reading your blog, playing this computer game caused a deep impression. Isn't it ironic?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c8352535680872297782 title="comment permalink">7/10/16, 9:15 AM</a><br><br>

But I think the "science" part of that is the framework. Most of the innovative artists, until recently (as with the Impressionists) were classically trained. And, used that as a spring board to ... innovate. Sometimes, because they weren't very good at the classical methods. :-). <br><br>Jackson Pollock, the Abstract Expressionist, was trained, mentored, by Thomas Hart Benton. Almost a father figure to Pollock. Benton was innovative, but did figural art. Later dismissed as "Oakie Baroque." How's that for class mud slinging? According to reports, Pollock was never very good at draftsmanship. <br><br>Another thing that came to mind was what a friend told me, who had gotten his fine arts degree. A professor had told him that "Just because you spend a lot of time on a project, doesn't mean it's good." An "A" for effort isn't necessarily a good thing. <br><br>But now to the really important stuff. Burgers. Every tried replacing the tomato with a couple of slices of pickled beets? According to my mate, Cherokee, that's the way they're often served in Australia. Next time your in a place with a good salad bar (a good one will have pickled beets), you might try having them hold the tomato, and slip in a few pickled beets, instead. Truly wonderful.

They do say that a problem shared is a problem halved, but it may also be a problem doubled too! ;-)! I borrowed the observation of "adults" from the story of the Big Short, because I really did expect the politicians down here to get on with the job at hand and accept the result that the population had dished up to them. The stories that lot tell themselves and the public are just strange and don’t accord with the observed reality.<br><br>Things seem to have quietened down recently for me here and so last night I was able to sit and watch an hour long debate entitled "The War on Young People" which was run by the youth news program I regularly listen too called Hack which is on the government nationwide youth radio broadcaster Triple J. I recommend the show highly. As part of the live debate, they spliced in amusing - but also quite disturbing - sketches by a local comedian which discussed some of the issues. A couple of the short sketches can be found on YouTube here (warning there may be some potty mouth): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26rCwh5EF-I&amp;list=PLsPVOdZ3LN6dOmzdfsyfxpErIONKGsGrb" rel=nofollow>Hack Live: The War on Young People - Newsflash </a>.<br><br>I do realise that you don't appreciate visual media, and the link is intended for other readers who may be interested.<br><br>Anyway, as I watched the debate I received a good general feel for the various motivations of the participants and it would have been surprisingly simple to poke holes in their stories.

I cannot underestimate how concerned I was by that debate. I generally ignore the media and pursue my own agenda, but that debate really troubled me and so I went to bed with a troubled mind.<br><br>I usually sleep very soundly, but this morning I woke in the wee hours as my brain had been processing on the debate. At first I started going over all of the different arguments and counter arguments (that were not debated!) and then that proved to be a waste of time. So I tried something different and took a step back and asked my poor sleep deprived brain the simple question: what did it all mean? And then the penny dropped.<br><br>And so I saw the big picture and it was that: the young want a return to normality (i.e. the land of milk and honey); the older generations want to maintain their perquisites and wealth; and the sharks are swimming around blaming the young as a distraction.<br><br>But even more so than that, all of the debaters displayed a lack of resiliency because I had the distinct impression that not one of them had a back-up plan in case something went wrong - and that speaks directly to a lack of resiliency in the population. They were clearly unable to let go of their personal narratives and allow some space for others. No one in the debate even suggested that course of action and there was only the merest reference to the environment which was then quietly ignored as a side issue.<br><br>I left the big time corporate world years ago because it too had fallen for that trap and it that strategy has no longevity in it. It always looks to me like a snake trying to eat its tail and you know how that story is going to end. It is catabolism in action. And it appears to me that things are far worse now on that front than they were almost a decade ago.<br><br>The thing is that in pursuing all of these individual personal narratives, there is no coherent vision which sets boundaries and limitations around the collective populations as well as an individual’s expectations and actions. But I doubt very much that people want that outcome either. It is very strange to observe for me because I have accepted and live within limits because the cost of doing otherwise appears to me to be pretty large and I see plenty of that.<br><br>Have you written about this issue recently, because it does seem that that decline has moved apace in recent times? I do understand that decline is not a linear function, but we do seem to have dropped a notch recently - well to my mind anyway.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c8091642084442756673 title="comment permalink">7/10/16, 9:18 PM</a><br><br>

I had been thinking in terms of performance being rote copying of something someone else wrote (such as, say… putting on a centuries old opera and performing it which was the example provided in the story), and exploration as the act of composition itself. So, basically, when Bob Dylan wrote “Blowin’ in the Wind” in the trad folk style, he was actually performing within the parameters of the style he was trained in, despite writing an enduring and innovative composition in the process. Meanwhile, when he plugged in his guitar on July 25, 1965 to the boos of the trad folk crowd attending, he was innovating by creating the genre of folk rock (which was why the crowds loved his compositions, but were scandalized by his change in style, because by plugging in he was pushing up against the edges of the notional space of his genre and opening up into something completely new), the folk rock genre then proceeded to open up a wide niche of its own, while other attempts to innovate on Folk style since then have been much more hit or miss, meeting up against diminishing returns. An example of an attempt to push the boundaries of folk music to their absolute limits would be the work of the Imagined Village, which brings in folk legends like Martin Carthy, and attempts to bring in elements of pop music, hip hop, electronica, and other styles. Their music produces some amazing work, and the talent is undeniable, but it mostly succeeds when it sticks closer to convention, and tends to fall apart the more avante-garde it attempts to be, becoming something that is an acquired taste mostly only enjoyable to the connoisseur. Folk metal has opened up a very small niche for itself, but there’s an extremely narrow range it can follow without crossing over into territory that is only going to sound appealing to dedicated fans of the genre. One slightly broader area that’s opened up within the folk genre is the “neofolk” movement, which is considered experimental, and basically came out of an anti-modernist current within the punk movement that began turning away from the industrial style of punk in favor of a more unplugged, acoustic approach to music (largely as a part of a revolt against industrialism), eventually fusing with the folk scene. Though some of the bands still draw in musical elements of the punk movement, and there are some groups who are part of the movement who are deliberately and often disastrously avant-garde, the heart of the movement and the thing that has kept it growing are the elements that stick to traditional folk styles and draw their uniqueness from common themes: the decline and fall of civilization, the triumph of nature, and the return of the old gods are the most common themes, though there are nihilistic currents as well. Technically, despite its older roots, much of the current pagan folk genre (bands like Omnia, Telling the Bees, In Gowan Ring, etcetera) are also considered to be nested within the neo-folk movement as well. So while that genre, being a growing movement definitely has some people still trying to push in experimental and avante-garde directions (with mixed results and diminishing returns), it seems that movement as a whole is an example of expanding a space by applying the established conventions of a style to different conceptual notions and ask questions and express yearnings and frustrations unique to the time they’re living in (using Folk to deal with the experience of living in a world in decline in much the way that the folk revival of the 1960s used traditional motifs to deal with the turbulence of that era). That shows the complexity of the relation between performance and exploration, since someone can perform within the parameters of a style and still use it to ask new questions and express new thoughts.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c5821469950259875994 title="comment permalink">7/11/16, 8:43 AM</a><br><br>

Originating from an accidental release in the Bahamas in 1974, they expanded to Florida and, over the past 20 years, have very quickly covered most of the U.S. I first saw one here in Oregon in 2005, and for at least the past 5 years they have been an everyday sight in agricultural lands of the Willamette Valley. <br>I don’t think this species is a very close analogue for the Passenger Pigeon, which congregated in huge nomadic flocks and relied on mast crops of acorns, chestnut, and beech in the eastern deciduous forests. It is, worryingly, more similar to the Mourning Dove, which is smaller but similarly a generalized seed-eater of farmland and open woodland. As Eurasian Collared-Doves have expanded, I have been watching for competition-mediated declines in Mourning Dove populations. So far, I have not seen them – for whatever reason, in my experience both species are coexisting in good numbers, and I haven’t seen that broader surveys show any notable decline in Mourning Doves when the Eurasians arrive. So, so far so good. I am still a bit concerned, but have decided not to regard these new residents with annoyance. Admittedly, this may be just as much for my own peace of mind, as there is, approximately, nothing that I can do about them.<br>This unfolding ecological event does tie in to broader considerations about invasive species. My starting assumption is that our native wildlife are of intrinsic value for our personal and national heritage, and that protecting them (in this place, maintaining our descendants’ opportunity to experience Osprey, Hermit Warbler, Cedar Waxwing, and the many others, as I have) is indeed a true responsibility. Invasive species can be a real risk, and how we think about them is an important element of that challenge. Also, these risks are different for every species and setting. Many introduced species just blink out within a few generations, not being well suited for their new environment. A few thrive (sometimes limited to heavily human-altered sites, sometimes moving out into more native habitat), and of those that do, cases like the Eurasian Collared-Dove that so far more or less coexist with the natives seem to be about the best one can expect. The situation can get much more dire, and particularly so on islands, which tend to have species suites that are both unique and naive to the dangers of introduced predators and competitors. The histories of malaria-bearing mosquitoes in Hawaii, of the brown tree snake on Guam, of rats on almost any island you care to name, make it clear that invasive species are capable of inducing massive disasters for native wildlife.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c3324156842127796624 title="comment permalink">7/11/16, 2:04 PM</a><br><br>

Looking forward, I do expect some introduced species are going to be with us for good, and eventually will grow to be considered part of a “new normal”. I also expect species to move in from the south on their own hook, as global warming creates new climate patterns and reshuffles the biophysical parameters of our region and every other place on earth. For sure, things are going to change... and at some point our concept of what a native species is will change too. Which doesn’t mean that we should give up on being able to do any good. It puts me in mind of something I heard Chris Maser say 30 years ago, on the topic of long-term conservation of old-growth forest: roughly, “People in the future will make their own decisions about these forests; there is no way that we today can make their decisions for them. All that we can do is to make our own decisions; and the effects of our decisions can leave options open for those people, or they can take them away. And when they look back at us they will thank us for every option that we were able to leave them.” That conversation has been rattling in my mind for a long time.<br>So, for example, I am quite willing to see rats exterminated on an island to allow the restoration of a seabird colony. At the same time, even the most invasive critter is, at core, one of our fellow sojourners on the planet. Sometimes they may need to be killed, but they are not really an enemy and do not need to be hated. At times I hear domestic pigeons called “sky-rats” (and now Eurasian Collared-Doves are the new “sky-rat latte”); this touch of wit does, I admit, rub me the wrong way. As another example, trapping out House Sparrows to aid native cavity-nesting birds may be well and good, in a small local way; yet, I have also heard their deaths reported with a palpable gloating that seems to me counter-productive as a model for relationship with other living things. (Though how easy it is to lose perspective in practice.)<br>Grant<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c2180776681134174295 title="comment permalink">7/11/16, 2:06 PM</a><br><br>

Rather ironic.<br><br>What I am enjoying is seeing how the basic notion of neofolk spreads to different ethnolinguistic communities and is interpreted differently each time, really in accord with the native musical traditions of the area: the difference between English (e.g. Andrew King), German (e.g. Forseti), Hungarian (e.g. Muzikás) and Russian (e.g. Vedan Kolod) exemplars of the genre is quite distinct, for instance.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c3145198745334525963 title="comment permalink">7/11/16, 2:58 PM</a><br><br>

When you say the "policies hurt us", I have assumed that you are speaking from the perspective of your generation?<br><br>Well, the truth I believe is stranger than you may imagine. From my perspective it looks to me like the many policies being pursued here inflict casual cruelty upon the young (and it may surprise you to learn that my generation is affected as well).<br><br>The policies that you speak of aren't evil, it is just that we live in a society in decline and because there is less stuff to go around, and the population keeps increasing, that some groups of the population are able to use their numbers to pursue policies that either maintain or increase their wealth. That wealth comes at the cost of other people and groups in that society. That is what a society in decline looks like.<br><br>I hear that you are angry. I get that. The thing is that everyone - including yourself - is comfortable with your anger. That is why the young get blamed, because it makes them angry, and everyone is comfortable and familiar with that story. The system is setup very well to deal with your anger - it is a useful thing for you to understand that.<br><br>&gt; All I really want is for people to be honest about the fact our life is harder than if we'd been born say ten years ago, or twenty.<br><br>Yes, I totally agree with you. It is harder for you. You may be surprised to know that simple benefits that my grandparents fought hard for - like sick leave pay - are being slowly given and taken away. I don't have sick leave pay. I hear you.<br><br>At your age, I had the system stick it to me in the recession "that we had to have" down here and I had to scramble just to keep a roof over my head and food on the table. I too got very deeply angry and then had to spend a couple of decades working out how to reduce my reliance on a system that was rigged against me. That involves personal costs and I don't get to enjoy many of the benefits of this society that other people take for granted. It costs me to do something different, but there is also serious freedom to be gained in pursuing something different.<br><br>And here I am speaking to you and you alone. Your final statement: "And to try to pursue policies that don't make things even worse for us". Blind Freddy knows that if policies are currently being pursued that are not in your best interests, then why the frack would you expect that situation to suddenly change in the future? I expect it to get worse. What are you doing personally to change that situation? Just being angry is not enough to change anything.<br><br>I am happy to continue this discussion.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c7677559141587865834 title="comment permalink">7/11/16, 4:30 PM</a><br><br>

Both the conventional and hovering versions were flown, among a succession of Typhoons and F-16s, with Mirage 2000s, Rafale and MiG 29 added to the mix. <br><br>Most spirted display looked like it was going to be the F-22, which did a screaming snap vertical climbout. Unfortunately, that may have broken something, because the weapons bay wasn’t opened - part of the display routine - and the display was terminated after just 90 seconds. <br><br>F-16s and all the rest, plenty of hard manouvering all day long. <br><br>As for the F-35s, oh dear... Very pedestrian - no rolling at all, no rapid climbs or any of that - just straight lines and flying in wide circles at the same height. Maybe flight control software restrictions were rather cramping its style. The USMC F-35B slowed up and hovered awhile – ‘it hung in the sky, in much the same way that bricks don't’ - such is the power of large amounts of jet fuel combined with modern microprocessing, once the bugs are ironed out.

(It has an alternative title, published for a different market - "Street Smarts, Adventures on the Road and in the Markets.") I figured just about any arrogant Wall Street superstar modern economics type, who gets aroused at the mere mention of John Maynard Keynes, would turn my stomach.<br><br>The book immediately drew me in. I thought, well, this isn't going to end up counting for the homework because I'm enjoying it too much! And for the most part I did. I enjoyed it. I recommend reading it actually. It's full of the kind of down-and-dirty global street research performed over a very interesting and unusual lifetime, that I can appreciate. <br><br>He shares plenty of our views here at the ADR, too, albeit from a different angle. A memorable passage was when Mr. Rogers (who now lives in Singapore) opined that flying back home into JFK was like flying into a 3rd world country. You take a 3rd world cab from there to a 3rd world 5-star hotel. The West is dying, he claims. The US is dying, so is the EU, and for a lot of the reasons we talk about around here. <br><br>He even claims that global petroleum production is sliding 6% annually, and this was 2012 when he was claiming it.<br><br>BUT, the thing I wouldn't have picked up on even 5 years ago was the mythos of Progress. Jim Rogers' opinion is steeped in true belief in Progress. Nowhere in those 250 pages of largely astute analysis - full of cyclical trends, repeated imperial rise and fall, the need to let the markets wash out the incompetent instead of propping up failure - nowhere was there even the slightest hint that the weight of energy descent might overrule the laws of supply and demand. In fact there is a whole chapter called "No One Has Ever Repealed the Laws of Supply and Demand." <br><br>He claims that Asia, and China particularly, will own the 21st century, and he believes it enough that he moved his family to Singapore (at least that's the reason he cops to) and had his two girls cared for by Mandarin nannies. He repeatedly quotes Adam Smith, Keynes, Bacon (Sir Frances not Kevin), all the usual suspects. He speaks respectfully of the IMF and the World Bank, and ridicules the idea that leaving the EU would improve a member nation's plight.<br><br>By the end I've had all the Progress I can handle, and my overall trust in his views has suffered somewhat as a result, but I didn't hate it. I didn't loathe his perspective. Just kind of felt bad that such a smart guy could be so hamstrung by his faith.<br><br>On a brighter note, however, Rogers claims that the dominance of finance is over, dead already and just waiting to be buried, and that the future (in his view the next 30 years anyway) will belong to people who grow and make things. Farmers, in his view, are very much in their ascendancy once again.<br><br>Who knows, maybe we'll get a farmer for president again, instead of litigation attorneys and banking flaks, before it comes completely unglued.

The laws would have been long since modified if living systems did not obey them as put forth. <br><br>One thing you must also remember about the laws of thermodynamics is that they are based on the average behavior of huge numbers of molecules/particles/etc. The individual particles follow the laws of quantum dynamics, which are very different, probabilistic, non-deterministic. Also you must remember the enormity of numbers involved. The number of molecules in a global ocean is vast. The time scales involved are vast. Even if something that would be required to initiate life is incomprehensibly unlikely, multiply this incomprehensibly small probability by the incomprehensibly large number of molecules on earth and by the incomprehensibly large number of quantumn instants in 100 million years, and just about anything will eventually happen, no matter how unlikely. And a single unlikely molecular event does not break any of the laws of thermodynamics, even if it then ultimately has vast macroscopic consequences.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c6840796559262603911 title="comment permalink">7/12/16, 11:21 AM</a><br><br>

It made me think of a science fiction book form a few years ago I thought was interesting. Incandescence by Greg Egan who is someone I think usually tries to do interesting things in the genre. I am not certain if the reaction I had to it was what he'd intended but I found it to be quite a sad book, it's written in two parts, one is about a scientist in a super advanced society (I think they are human) who essentially has nothing to do and feels remorse for the age of great discovery that has long gone. The other part of the book is about a primitive alien society that is going through it's own age of great discovery - figuring out gravity and other properties of physics in their unique environment. I think it was widely disliked but I found it quite interesting at the time that he seemed to be suggesting that the singularitarian project was essentially pointless and also going out of his way to invent a situation that could explore the thrills of new innovation - there was something quite sad about this to me. As I say, my take on it might be not what he intended, his books are often quite dense, technical and difficult for me, but it was the impression I came away with.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c155352689894074846 title="comment permalink">7/12/16, 1:56 PM</a><br><br>

That does mean that people will lose perks we had, however pretending that's not the case is what annoys me. I'd be far more okay with that if people didn't go around blaming the people losing the benefits for it. And I also understand the system is set up to handle our anger well, and being angry is not productive. As much as possible I'm trying to keep a cool head, but it's hard sometimes when people claim if only I tried harder then I'd have enough, or say that I want everything now when I say that saving for a house is going to be difficult (I'm already planning that my only expenses until I get a house will be rent, food, transport, and utilities while I save for one).<br><br>And for me personally, I'm getting actively involved in politics here. I've sent a few letters to my MP, senators, and the Prime Minister, I've tried to speak to them, let them know my thoughts and opinions; I'm involved in programs to provide a variety of services to youth, and I'm also trying to figure out what else to do.

Though we attribute consciousness to ourselves when we "select" in accordance with our preferences, natural selection does not imply consciousness. For example, if two species of plants share a patch of soil, and one is more drought-tolerant than the other, they will grow together until a drought comes. Then the presence of the drought "selects" the more drought-tolerant species. No one consciously tends the garden to remove the un-selected species, but it is still removed. Similarly, you can see in a flowing stream how some larger sediments (coarser sand) are "selected" to be deposited in the faster flow, and smaller sediments (fine sand, silt, clay) are selected by a slower flow or still water. The separation just happens. And so, with more or less stable chemical compounds, which can be selected by the environmental conditions to persist, or disperse.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-you-see-it-is-not-so.html#c5177975862856397334 title="comment permalink">7/13/16, 5:09 PM</a><br><br>

Facts, I told her, are things you can verify mathematically, chemically or physically; truths, I told her, are beliefs, values and attitudes that you can’t scientifically prove and don’t need to. Everyone’s entitled to believe their own truths, but they have to back up their facts. (Of course, I can think of many ways to complicate such a simple model, but let’s leave that to some other time.)<br><br>I agree that people confuse the two these days. National Geographic magazine, for example, ran a cover story last year on “anti-science” beliefs, with a list of common examples on the cover -- “Climate change does not exist,” “The Moon landing was fake,” and “Vaccinations can lead to autism.” Fair enough; climate change is fairly well-established, and links between vaccinations and autism seem to have been disproven.<br><br>To my dismay, though, they also included the line, “Genetically Modified Food is evil” – a disingenuous addition, as “evil” is a moral judgement. Genetic experimenters can splice insect genes into a berry or grow a human ear on a mouse for amusement; only we can decide whether they should. If a group of scientists proves their product is not toxic, that’s a fact; whether it’s morally righteous is up to us.<br><br>Similarly, I saw a recent magazine article that began with a list of things “you shouldn’t be allowed to believe anymore,” beginning with “that vaccines cause autism,” and “that gay people shouldn’t get married.” Whatever your opinions of calling gay relationships “marriage,” I was astonished that people would confuse that question with a scientific test result.

The Saudis (and Qataris) will be the only losers. They will probably be left out in the cold and hung to dry. No one really wants to or needs to appease them any longer.
