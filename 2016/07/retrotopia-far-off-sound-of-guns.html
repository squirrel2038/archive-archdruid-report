<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the twentieth installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator is forced to rethink his ideas about progress even further, as the Lakeland Republic and the other nations of post-US North America are confronted by a sudden crisis with all too familiar roots...</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A phone rang in the darkness. For a moment I had no idea where I was, but then the bed shifted, footsteps whispered across the floor, and Melanie’s voice said, “Hello.” I blinked, and tried to guess what time it was. It felt as though we hadn’t been sleeping for long. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Okay,” she said then, in a completely different tone. I finished waking up in a hurry. You don’t hear someone speak like that unless something’s gone very, very wrong. “Okay,” she said again. “I’ll be in as soon as I can. ‘Bye.” The handset clicked into its cradle, and Melanie said, “Peter?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“What’s up?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Trouble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Texas and the Confederacy are at war.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I sat up and said something unprintable. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Pretty much,” she agreed, and turned on a light. She was as naked as I was, of course, but the look on her face wasn’t particularly alluring. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Any details?” I asked.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Just a few. Texan ships attacked three Confederate drilling platforms around one o’clock; no word on damage yet. The Confederate navy came out, and there’s fighting going on in the Gulf right now.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s bad.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“There’s worse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Confederate Army’s crossed into Texas territory between Shreveport and Texarkana. Our people down there think there’s division-strength units involved.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave her a blank stare for a long moment. “Okay,” I said, getting out of bed. “You’re going in right away, of course.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yes. Not the way I’d have chosen to end a really pleasant evening.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I took her in my arms and kissed her. “No argument there,” I said when the kiss was done. “Give me a call when you get some free time.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ll do that,” she said, with a smile. “If you can stand it, stay close to your phone. I may be able to arrange something for you.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I promised I would, and then she headed for the shower, and I pulled my clothes on, called a cab, and let myself out. She was right, it was a hell of a way to end a really pleasant evening, but if you’re in politics you get used to that kind of thing. I knew that, and so did Melanie; if things worked out, we’d find some time to spend together before I took the train back to Philadelphia, and one way or another—</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I stopped the thought in its tracks. Later, I told myself. Later, when a couple of really hard decisions are over and done with. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The sky was still pitch black when I left the apartment building, stood on the curb waiting for the cab. The clop-clop of horse’s hooves announced its arrival a couple of blocks in advance. Moments later I was inside, watching the city of Toledo in its sleep. Here and there a light shone in a window, or a lone figure hurried down the street. It seemed hard to believe that not much more than a thousand miles away, robot tanks, assault drones, and long files of young men with guns were streaming through the pine woods of northeast Texas. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The cab got me to the hotel promptly enough, and I paid the cabby, said good morning to the tired-eyed desk clerk, and headed up to my room. I didn’t really expect to get more sleep, but decided to give it a try, and blinked awake four hours later with the pale gray light of morning coming in through the window. The clock said quarter past eight; I hurried through a shower, got myself shaved and dressed, weighed the odds that Melanie might call if I took the time to run to Kaufer’s News to get the morning <i>Blade</i>, and decided to call the concierge instead. Not five minutes later a bellhop knocked on the door with a copy. “We got a stack of ‘em down at the desk,” he told me. “Half the guests are gonna want one as soon as they wake up.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I thanked him and gave him a good-sized tip, and he grinned and made off. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The paper didn’t have much more information on the current state of affairs than I’d gotten from Melanie, but the reporters had done their background research; the inside of the front section had big articles sketching out the history of the quarrel, running through both sides’ military assets, quoting a couple of experts from Toledo University on the potential outcomes of the war, that sort of thing. Tucked away toward the end was a terse little article about two moresatellites being taken out by debris.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was maybe halfway through that last article when the phone rang. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Peter? It’s Melanie. Can you get to the Capitol by nine-thirty?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sure,” I said. “What’s up?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“There’s a courtesy briefing for the North American diplomatic community—the ambassadors will be meeting with Meeker; this is for attach<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>é</span>s and staff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve arranged to get you in as a special envoy from Ellen Montrose’s staff.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No kidding. Thank you, Melanie.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sure thing.” She gave me the details, we said our goodbyes and away I went. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The city was wide awake as I walked the four blocks to the Capitol. Newspapers and conversations in low voices were everywhere. The streetcars, horsedrawn cabs, and occasional cars still rolled down the streets; lamps shone in windows, contending with the gray winter light; nothing visible had changed since the morning before, and everything had. I remembered stories some of my older relatives used to tell about the first days of the Second Civil War—carefully sanitized stories coming over the mass media, wild rumors carried by blogs and private emails, and everywhere the sense that something had changed or shifted or broken once and for all, and the world would never be quite the same afterwards. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Somehow, the morning around me felt like that. I told myself not to be silly; there had been other wars since Partition—the three-way scramble between Texas, the Confederacy, and the Missouri Republic in ‘37, the Confederate-Brazilian invasion of the Lakeland Republic in ‘49, and the ongoing civil war in California—but this felt different. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Extra!” shouted a paperboy on the sidewalk in front of the Capitol, where people were streaming by. “Richmond’s declared war.” He was selling copies nearly as fast as he could hand them out, but I managed to get one before his canvas bag was empty. I wasn’t the only purchaser to turn toward the Capitol’s big front entrance, either. We filed in the doors, and then some of us turned right toward the Senate end of the building, went down the first big staircase we found, and ended up in front of a big door flanked by two guards in uniform and a man in a wool suit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>I recognized him after a moment: Stuart Macallan, the Lakeland Republic’s assistant secretary of state for North American affairs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Mr. Carr,” he said, shaking my hand. “Good to see you again.Yes, you’ve been cleared—favor to the incoming administration in Philadelphia.” He winked, and I laughed and went on to the coatroom, where I shed hat and coat before going further. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The room inside was a big comfortable space with a podium up front and rows of tables and chairs facing it, the kind of place where important press conferences and public hearings get held. All the usual impedimenta of a high-end briefing were there—pitchers of ice water on each table, and so on—and something I hadn’t expected:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>a notebook and pen in front of each place. Of course I understood the moment I saw them: lacking veepads, how else were the attendees going to take notes? Even so, that reminded me how many details of life in the Lakeland Republic I still hadn’t seen. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I sat down and opened the paper. The Confederate Congress had voted to declare war, as the boy said; the Texan legislature was expected to return the favor shortly. In the meantime, the naval battle in the Gulf was ongoing, with people along the coast reporting distant explosions and smoke plumes visible on the horizon. Nobody was sure yet what was happening on the land front; the entire region from Shreveport and Texarkana west to the suburbs of Dallas was closed to journalists, and the entire highway system was off limits to anybody but government and military, but long lines of army-green trucks were streaming east across Texas toward the war zone, and a reporter who’d gotten as far north as Henderson before being turned back by military police reported that he could hear artillery rolling in the northern distance like summer thunder.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Someone sat down at the chair next to mine, and I did the polite thing and turned to greet him. “Hank Barker,” he said as we shook hands, “with the Missouri Republic delegation.” I introduced myself, and he brightened. “You’re Ellen Montrose’s envoy here, aren’t you?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once this is over, if you’ve got a minute to talk, that’d be real welcome.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sure,” I said. It wasn’t until then that I noticed that he was dressed the way I was, in typical Lakeland business wear. Most of the other people filing into the room wore bioplastic, though we weren’t the only ones in wool. “Got tired of bioplastic, I see,” I commented. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He nodded. “Yep. You see this sort of thing more and more often these days, out our way. ‘Course a lot of the wool and leather Lakeland uses comes from our side of the Mississippi, so it stands to reason.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I glanced at him, wondered whether any other Lakeland Republic customs had found a foothold across the Mississippi. The Missouri Republic’s big, reaching from the river to the crest of the Rockies and from what used to be Kansas and the northwestern two-thirds of Missouri to the border of West Canada, but a lot of it’s desert these days; it’s pretty much landlocked—its only ports are river towns on the Mississippi and Duluth on Lake Superior—and if they were paying off World Bank loans and coping with the same economic pressures we were in the Atlantic Republic, they’d have to be in a world of hurt. Before I could figure out how to ask the question that was on my mind, though, the last of the attendees had taken their seats and a familiar figure rolled his wheelchair across the low stage to one side of the podium. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’d like to thank you all for coming,” Tom Pappas said. “We’re still waiting for more details from the war zone—” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Like everyone else,” said a voice with a French accent close to the front of the room. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m not arguing,” Pappas said, with a broad grin. “But we’ve got a basic idea what’s going on, and we can also fill you in on our government’s response.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
An aide, a young woman in Lakeland army uniform, came up onto the stage, went to the back wall and pulled on a cord. Down came a big, brightly colored map of the eastern half of the Republic of Texas and parts of the Confederacy adjacent to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Pappas thanked her, took a long pointer from behind the podium, and wheeled over to the map. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The three drilling platforms the Texans attacked last night are here.” The pointer tapped a patch of blue water in the Gulf. “Those are the ones Bullard claimed were using horizontal drilling to poach Texan oil. Based on what information we’ve gotten at this point, all three platforms were destroyed. The Confederates counterattacked less than an hour later, and both sides suffered significant losses—they’ve both got decent antiship missiles, and you know how that goes.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A murmur spread through the room. “The thing is, the Confederates didn’t just fire on the Texan ships,” Pappas went on. “They used long range missiles to target Texan offshore oil assets. We’re not sure how many were targeted and how badly they were hit, but it doesn’t look good.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Right now there’s still fighting going on, and both sides are bringing in naval assets from outside the area. Texas has a short term advantage there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Confederates have a lot of their ships on the Atlantic coast, and it’s going to take a while to get them around the south Florida shoals and bring them into action, but once those arrive, the Texan navy’s going to be in deep—trouble.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That got a laugh. “Okay,” he said, and moved the pointer up to tap on the area between Shreveport and Texarkana. “That’s a sideshow. Here’s the show that matters. As far as we can tell, the Confederacy’s thrown three divisions into the ground assault:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>one armored division, two infantry. More are being brought up as fast as the transport grid will carry them. The Texans are throwing everything they’ve got on hand into the fighting. It’s anyone’s guess whether they can get enough of their army into play before the Confederates reach Dallas; I’m guessing they will. Meanwhile Texan drones and land based missiles have been hitting military targets as far as the Mississippi, and the Confederacy’s doing the same thing—we’ve had reports of missile strikes as far west as Waco.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And this is where it gets ugly. Both sides have allies overseas. The Confederates have already asked Brazil to intervene; no word from Brasilia yet, but given their track record in the past, it’s probably a safe bet that they’ll get Brazilian munitions and advisers, and maybe more. Texas has a mutual-aid pact with China, and after the business in Peru two years ago, the Chinese have got to be itching for an opportunity to take Brazil down a peg or two; a proxy war would be one way to do that. So we could be facing a long and ugly war.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s the military situation. Stuart, you want to fill them in on our response?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Stuart Macallan climbed up onto the stage. “Sure. Point number one is that we’re staying out of it. We’ve declared ourselves neutral, and President Meeker is working with the other North American governments right now to draft a joint declaration of neutrality and an appeal to the combatants to accept an immediate ceasefire and settle this at the negotiating table, using the mechanisms set up in the Treaty of Richmond. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Point number two is that we’ve ordered a defensive mobilization all along the southern border, just in case. Those of you who know anything about our military know that this isn’t a threat to anybody, unless they decide to invade. If you’re not familiar with our system, Colonel Pappas here can fill you in on the details after we finish.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Point number three is that we’re going to look for every possible way to expedite trade agreements with the other North American republics. Half our exports go via the Mississippi, and I know some of our neighbors are in the same boat—so to speak. We’re prepared to help the other North American republics keep their economies intact, to the extent that we can, and we’d welcome any help you can give us along the same lines. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Finally, there’s the petroleum situation. For all practical purposes, the Gulf oil fields, onshore and offshore, have just dropped off the face of the Earth, and they’re going to stay that way until this whole business gets resolved. That’s a big enough fraction of world oil production to send markets into a tizzy. It won’t particularly affect us, as you know,. but it’s going to be a problem for pretty much everyone else in North America. We’re going to look at agreements with each of your countries to try to cushion the economic hit, but whatever you’re paying for fuel these days—our best estimate is that it’s going to double, maybe triple, maybe more, if you can get it. The way so much oil production is locked up in long term contracts, some of you probably won’t be able to get it at all.”</div>
<br>
Hank Barker, sitting next to me, shook his head. Under his breath: “We are so screwed.” <br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
****************</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Back here in 2016, I'm delighted to announce the impending publication of David Fleming's astonishing book <i>Lean Logic</i>, an encyclopedic guide to the principles and practice of life in a deindustrializing world. Fleming was a central figure in the British sustainability movement for decades, and played an important role in the founding of the UK Green Party, the Transition Town Movement, and the New Economics Foundation; he spent some thirty years assembling <i>Lean Logic</i> as a comprehensive book on the ways of thinking and acting we're going to need to get through the mess ahead. (I'm quite sure it's still in print in the Lakeland Republic in 2065!) The hardback edition is now available for preorder <a href=http://www.chelseagreen.com/lean-logic>here</a>. </div>

I mean the other day, I believe a giant new radio telescope discovered an additional 13,000 galaxies in a far corner of the universe that was previously thought of as being rather unoccupied. That discovery seems astounding to me and the universe seems far bigger and far stranger than my poor brain can even begin to comprehend.<br><br>And therein lies the crux of your particular problem. Any one God that can do exactly what you are proposing, is one bad dude. The inherent level of complexity built into your belief system is horrendous. And it occurred to me as I sat in the bath that any God that was that meticulous and detailed would inevitably not let even smallest of matters pass unnoticed. It would be like dealing with the ultimate control freak and I have no doubt that you enjoy a relationship with an entity that makes such claims. <br><br>So the question I have for you is: Do you personally believe that you may have done something - no matter how small - to creation at some point in your life that may have seriously annoyed your God? My gut feeling on that matter that given the state of the world and decline of the environment due to human actions - and the simple fact that you are even commenting here on the Internet which is done at the expense of other members of your God's creation - that the answer to that question is: Dude, you may very well have annoyed your God and I doubt very much that words - no matter how pious - would be of the equal weight as your actions. I'd be nervous if I were you, because exact justice is not a pleasant experience. Just sayin...<br><br>I much prefer to think of Gods as having flaws, as that would explain a thing or two.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c6299936427928694473 title="comment permalink">7/20/16, 10:11 PM</a><br><br>

I have just caught up on your last two posts, it looks like we are going to see the real strength Lakeland's 'Collapse Early' approach :)<br><br>I also wanted to comment on your previous post. As a Brit her in the UK, I found the referendum fascinating. Thanks to my wife's excellent education of a poor engineer to understand people, I was able to see that through all the doom mongering, what choice the referendum was actually offering the unheard and ignored classes.<br><br>After ignoring, ridiculing and demonising the working classes for years, the liberal elite went to them and said this:<br> You have a choice between a brighter, sunny world where our lives to get better (but yours' probably won't - sotto voce) versus a dark and stormy world where everyone's lives gets worse.<br><br>No surprise that said classes immediately said "screw you then, you can join us in the dark"!<br><br>Following that decision, and after the immediate knee jerk reactions of the press and liberal punditry, it was pleasing to see that discussion of the vote actually began to highlight this as an issue. To the extent that Teresa May (the new conservative party leader) has already made bringing improvement to everyone a cornerstone of her leadership. Though, it remains to see how far she'll actually go.<br><br>When I then turn to the recent events in the US, its clear that a very large, humble and inclusive effort needs to be made to defuse the current situation. The sad part is that neither of your candidates seem to be capable of, or willing to make it.

For example, my street is being repaved to make the bus routes a bit smoother. The city has now made curbs and sidewalk cost be paid by the individual homeowner. Once installed, the homeowner is billed for the install cost and also if they need to visit later for repairs. If I want to maintain my 1950's style road, I can pay around $6000 to have curbing redone when they repave my section of the road this summer. Due to some sudden very expensive car repairs, I have opted to not buy the curbing but I will continue to maintain the side walks. If they make paving fall on the home owner, I may just go back to the stone age. That is, tar and stone with no curbing.<br><br>The same week, A bunch of model T car enthusiasts came through the city. I talked with the owners on car cost, specifically the maintenance they go through. I was thinking I probably still can't afford the time and expense to maintain a classic car such as that. Ironically, the following week, my car developed a compression problem that will require extensive repairs or possibly a whole engine replacement. However, if I had a model T....<br><br>I'll heat with wood. I'll even maintain my own PV for electric power. When it comes to city water and sewer, I draw the line.

And this observation could lead in a number of directions, but at some point, wouldn't imitation be the sincerest form of flattery? <br><br>That is to say, despite cultural myths to the contrary, once that divergence between myth and lived experience became too great to ignore for too many, seems to me that (as perhaps alluded to by Hank, our new Missouri friend) some of the surrounding countries would begin to come around to the way the Lakelanders do things.

Moreover, most have never seen a war and with little idea of what such a thing might be like outside of images from glowing rectangles. <br><br>I’m not dismissing the many conflicts that US soldiers have been sent to, of course – Iraq, Vietnam and so on – just that they were smaller, localised, far away, unpopular and too easily ignored. The last time the entire nation – home front and all -- took part in a war was World War II, and we have seen no battles on our home soil since the days of the telegraph. <br><br>People on this side of the Atlantic seem to have fewer romantic fantasies about violence; British and Continentals saw unprecedented horrors right at home, and even neutral Ireland saw a revolution, civil war and 30-year terrorism campaign within living memory. Such unpleasant memories seemed to stamp out Europeans’ more 19th-century martial impulses, at least for now. <br><br>In my native USA, by contrast, people grow up surrounded by depictions of violence; our fiction tends to revolve around rebels taking down an orderly state through violence, whether Star Wars or Hunger Games, Ayn Rand or Left Behind. Increasingly people live not in the physical world of gardens and neighbours, bus stops and sidewalks, but in a world of video games, television and other such images of romanticised combat, while their non-fictional world of social media and “news” stokes a slowly growing sense of anger and imminent danger. Lashing out violently, for many people I know, is no longer a fear – it is a fantasy. <br><br>When I lived back in the USA, I knew a few elderly hippies who boasted of their glory days in the 1960s, when they play-acted at revolution and pointed guns at police officers, and couldn’t understand why I was repelled by their “war stories.” Back then they were unusual; today, however, many Americans – from many political and culture-war factions -- engage in the same kind of live-action role-playing, carrying heavy weapons in public or threatening each other with violence from a redoubt of safety. <br><br>The interesting thing is that it all seems so unnecessary; as I wrote in my piece on Ferguson, Americans remain quite wealthy compared to most of the world, and there’s no external reason why we should fall apart, except that we feel we must. Many people are struggling, of course, but most still have a standard of living far better than most eras, or most countries in this era. Most people have toys that their grandparents would consider magical, live in homes larger than the Biblical Temple of Solomon, and enjoy relative safety and long life. People perceive themselves, however, as being in imminent danger and deeply impoverished – and the more people believe those things, the more they will be true. <br><br>I mentioned in my comment last week that my daughter and I play “Fact vs. Truth” as a game, where facts are provable or tangible realities, and truths are the beliefs, values and perceptions that shape how we interpret facts. With that in mind, my own country is in a strange situation: prosperous in fact, increasingly desperate in truth. <br><br><br><a href=#c7058453355853089247 title="comment permalink">7/21/16, 6:42 AM</a><br><br>

Even with all of our technology, resources, and political stability, it continued to dump oil into the Gulf for about 3 months. I can only imagine what it would be like if any one of those features were impaired. In the case of war, tech and resources would likely be diverted, but a bit of sabotage would certainly wipe out any productive efforts. <br>Having toxic sludge ruining the entire southern coast of America would be quite detrimental to the US. I doubt the countries to the south would do stand idly by. Best case scenario is that they'd want reparations from the north, worst case, they'd want to exterminate them.

I was hoping that Melanie would turn out to have set up the standard diplomatic trap: lure the wretched Carr into bed with a friendly nod, as the cameras and tape recorders roll behind the curtains; later, Carr becomes, as I think they say in the trade, "burned". Now it looks as they are having a bona fide love affair. <br><br>The nice thing about Eastern Europe is that if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it is probably something other than a duck - and, for extra fun, as a final twist of the east-of-the-Elbe knife, it sometimes actually is a duck. But in North America, I guess, if the thing look, walks, and quacks like a duck, it is a duck, and that's all. And now, to make things more depressing, instead of diplomatic intricacies we get a war. Like I say, dang and fooey! :-) :-) :-) <br><br>(2) Well, can we still perhaps hope for Carr's staying on in Lakeland? I remember from childhood, in the depths of the Cold War, a comic strip in the newspaper, called "B.C.", illustrating the lives of cavepersons. In one strip is shown a grumpy cavewoman reading from a Neanderthal Dick-and-Jane primer. "See Jane," reads the fur-clad cavewoman, gripping the stone tablets. "See Jane run." "Run, Jane, run." "Run fast, Jane." "Jane has defected." <br><br>(3) It might be good to push a little, to get max value out of the exchanges in recent days between Nestorian and Bill Pulliam. Nestorian cited an author called Milton, and Bill Pulliam ("7/19/16, 3:24 PM") responded, <i>I'm afraid if Milton is the best you have to offer, you don't have anything to offer. Not a single one of his major ideas or arguments is based on anything approaching an actual understanding of the science at hand. He does not comprehend the theories and data he attacks at even a high-school barely-passing level; or if he does, then he deliberately misrepresents them for a non-scientific audience (which is even worse).</i> With Nestorian being a bit upset at this, and with many of us being out of our depth here (not having ourselves until just now heard of Milton), I ask: would it be possible for Bill Pulliam to cite some one putative high-school-level misrepresentation in Milton, and to have Nestorian thereupon attempt (whether successfully or otherwise) Milton's rehab? <br><br>This reminds me of a technique that some eminent mathematician used with people who sent him proofs of something sticky, I think in the mathematician's case of something actually known to be false - perhaps purported proofs of the known-to-be-false proposition that with straightedge and compass, working on a plane, one can construct a square of area equal to the area enclosed by any arbitrary given circle. The eminent prof was patient, and confined himself with focusing on one point, sending out a letter in the following approx style to each of his correspondents: "Thank you for your purported proof that the circle can be squared. The first error occurs on line 17, where you assert...." <br><br>The prof's method was to be concrete and definite, focusing on just one thing. <br> <br><br><br>Hastily,<br><br><br>Tom <br><br>Toomas(dot)Karmo(at)gmail(dot)com<br><br>in the Toronto suburb of Richmond Hill <br><br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a> <br><br><br>PS: Although I don't read much fiction, I do want to note a very fine treatment in le Carre of what Melanie could have done to the wretched Carr, rather late in the plot of <i>Smiley's People</i>. (In the BBC dramatization on YouTube - a piece of work as fine as the novel itself - this is in the final episode.) "Gregoriev", in Berne, is shown a nice set of photos, culminating in a little piece of his recent ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay. Eventually (Grigoriev thinks a little slowly and thoroughly, perhaps like Carr) the penny in his brain drops: "But you are...SPIES.

This story just blasted into warp-drive! Cannot wait for the next installment; and of course, like some other readers, cannot help the brain spinning on similar or parallel real-life possibilities as well. Feeling very anxious.<br><br>We've moved back to the US, under not-so-great circumstances; so I've been lurking/reading, but have not had the presence of mind to comment or join in discussion. Feeling a bit like an oddball 1st world economic refugee. I was lucky to find a job my 2nd day in town at the local grocery store, pay is decent, has health insurance and the people are really nice. A good start.<br><br>Now there is a massive fire raging west of town and of our home, and the winds blow consistently from the west. As the firefighters are saying they could be battling it all the way into Sept., there is a distinct possibility we may have to evacuate at some point. The air is hazy and thick with smoke. I'm looking around my home, mentally prioritizing what to grab and take with me if or when we have to evacuate. (Insurance papers, baby books, wedding album?)<br><br>Also feeling rather depressed and anxious about the absolute clown show of the RNC convention, (I'm not even a Republican.) Amidst the hilarity of their gaffes and blundering is the blatant and utter rot of our very political process, and as has been said and acknowledged here so many times; evidence of the death of our very civilization. It's a flaming silly side show, not taken seriously by anyone anymore, even the 'leaders' putting the show on. There feels a real sadness underneath the silliness of it all.<br><br>In that sense, it feels almost comforting to settle into Retrotopia's/Lakeland's conference room where actual adults and leaders make plans for a crisis. Fictional narrative is indeed a powerful tool. :)<br><br>At any rate, Thank You for your essays and this story. I hope you won't leave the internet for awhile yet. I'm not really feeling settled enough to order a mail order-magazine; and I do equally love the comments section!

The naked eye reveals at this season, from even a glaring suburban sky, the evening "Summer Triangle", comprising Altair, Vega, and Deneb. Let us focus on the second of these three. They look similar to the naked eye. However, a quick glance at Wikipedia reveals that their distances are thought to be dissimilar - about 25 light years in the case of Vega, and something on the order of 1500 light years in the case of Deneb, if I remember the numbers accurately (and surely I do). In this season (late at night?) or in the evening of the coming cooler season, binoculars (even of poor quality, used even in a bad, overlit, suburban site) will additionally reveal the globular cluster M13 in Hercules and the spiral galaxy M31 in Andromeda. A quick glance at Wikipedia will, I am sure, reveal that their distances are thought to be some tens of thousands of light years in the case of M13, and a couple of million light years in the case of M31. <br><br>My question for Nestorian now, regarding the Young Earth, is the following: for how long does he does he believe the light from these four respective objects (Vega, Deneb, M13, M31) to have respectively been travelling? <br><br>Does he, perhaps, accept the prevailing scientific orthodoxy for Vega - an orthodoxy on which photons left Vega for our retinas back in the days of Boris Yeltsin - while questioning it for, say, M13? If he has a nonstandard distance estimate for, say, M13, what is the estimate, and on what observational grounds does he base it, and on what observational grounds does he reject the currently accepted grounds for estimating distances (parallax, correlations of intrinsic luminosity with spectral type, periods-of-pulsation in Cepheid variables)? <br><br>Some short comment from Nestorian on what might be expected from the European Space Agency Gaia mission, which will be pushing parallax distance estimates out to hitherto-impossible distances, might additionally be helpful. (What if Gaia, or some successor mission, gets a direct parallax determination of distances for distant objects, more than, say, ten thousand light years out? Would such parallaxes count as a refutation of the contention that the cosmos is young?) <br><br><br><br>Hastily,<br>hoping nobody is going to be very upset with this, <br>(trying to adopt here the tone of some hypothetical good, cheerful, undogmatic university), <br><br><br>Tom <br><br><br>PS: Speaking of cheerful institutions: thanks to the JMG ADR commenter, however it was, who a couple of days ago drew attention to one actual institution, the Pontifical Academy website at <a href=http://www.casinapioiv.va rel=nofollow>http://www.casinapioiv.va</a>. This somewhat reinforces the line of discussion that I attempted in my own blog, namely <a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a> in the first week of July, in Part E of "Is Science Doomed?", under the section heading "5. Practicalities of Triage: Research in a Catholic Setting".<br><br>- Now I have to tear myself away from "Social Media" and Carr and the seductive Melanie, and Bill Pulliam and Nestorian, and get some work done, here in the Canadian corner of the Estonian diaspora - in my imaginary institution, the grubby and cheerless "Nikolai Ivanovitsh Lobatshevski nimeline sotsalitsliku matemaatika instituut" (the "Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky Institute of Socialist Mathematics"). <br><br>Melanie, how COULD you?

To the point that I'm almost wondering if there's a point at which, the final eruption of a civil war, or a partition of the US, or a declared conflict with a major world power would be met not with the shock, sorrow, and outrage we're currently responding with, but just a weary shrug, or possibly even a sense of tired acceptance or reluctant relief. I was talking to someone the other day who wryly joked that if we were reading a history book, we'd be at the "events leading to" paragraph right before you turn the page to find maps with flags and arrows on them... It feels to me like the way things are going, if a Texas secession or a Twilight's Last Gleaming scenario happened this year, the public reaction wouldn't be so much one of shock, as one of "figures something like this would happen in 2016," and if the lasting impacts of 9/11 and the 2008 crash are any indicator, the onslaught of 2016 is going to leave the sort of residue that by the next impact (say... a Twilight's Last Gleaming or Second Civil War scenario in 2024), there just isn't going to be the wherewithal to be shocked or surprised anymore, instead people would be feeling the exact emotion a patient who has been fighting a long, exhausting losing battle with a terminal illness for decades feels when the doctor finally tells them they're being transferred to hospice care... Sure... it changes everything, but at least rest is in sight. You pointed out in a comment, I think it was last week... that people right now are feeling backed against a wall... which is part of why people are getting so prickly about political issues (even with people they usually agree with), and you've compared a lot of the morale of the country right now to the morale of the police to the morale of soldiers during the latter years of the Vietnam War... But I think that sense of fatigue and shell-shock is much broader than that right now... with every police shooting, with every terrorist attack, with every instant that the 2016 electoral campaign reminds Americans everywhere that something has broken... I've been watching the public sentiment slowly shift from marching, protesting, and holding vigils to crouching in the corner like wounded animals and lashing out at anyone who comes too close to touching tender subjects. Perhaps that sense of political fatigue is just a forerunner to political violence, lately the protests are going on for a shorter and shorter time before the shooting or brick throwing starts… and perhaps there comes a point amidst the rising tension where the animal simplicity of a world in chaos is the only way to get away from the exhaustion… So I can definitely see things turning towards the sort of violence Carr has heard about from the old-timers, but it’s already hard to imagine things feeling much more broken than they already are… in another 8 years of this, I’m having a hard time imaging feeling anything more than hollow numbness at much of anything that could happen. But, then… I’m sure Americans living in the days of Emma Goldman, the Union Square Bombings, the McKinley Assassination, the rise of the second KKK, the Atlanta and Bellingham riots, and so on felt the exact same way in the years leading up to 1914… <br><br><br><a href=#c4344216855064994997 title="comment permalink">7/21/16, 1:12 PM</a><br><br>

(Brian Kaller writes here over timestamp "7/21/16, 6:42 AM", and additionally is the author of the blog at <a href=http://restoringmayberry.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://restoringmayberry.blogspot.com</a>.) Violence has seldom solved things in politics. JMG's introducing it to this narrative (along with introducing his note of sex) now lowers the tone of the narrative, at least a little. <br><br>Like Brian Kaller, I know both sides of the Atlantic. Like him, I get the feeling that on the western side the realities of political violence are not fully grasped. Countries that have been through hostile occupation are marked, to the extent that children and grandchildren feel it, even if born in peacetime. Perhaps the necessary sense of reality fades after three of four generations. It is, however, robust enough after one or two. <br><br>I do not know now to make this point as well as Brian Kaller, but still I will try to make it, with an example from my experience. I once met a youngish person right here in Ontario, who told me her Dad had been in one of the famous Nazi death camps, and had received the standard numerical tattoo. I could see from her face or hear from her tone - nothing obvious, no tears, no grimace, and since I am autistic I am not even all that good at reading faces and voices - that she was likely to be telling the truth. Suffering shows up in some way which is not easily faked. <br><br>I could of course go on, for instance adding my cousin's playing Refugees with her doll, in peacetime 1950s Canada: but this suffices. <br><br>I would like also to repeat a point which I have made before on the JMG ADR blog. In the late, unlamented, USSR, people had every imaginable disadvantage - poverty everywhere outside the Nomenclatura, on a scale unimaginable on even the meanest streets and dirt roads of America (Estonia, 1990: Uncle Rein telling me that not even with political connections could one now get a pair of tin snips); a male population used to shooting, through mandatory military service, in among other places Afghanistan; mass media that glorified the military, with depictions of the 1941-1945 "Great Patriotic War" and suchlike, in a way that rivalled or exceeded Hollywood. <br><br>When push came to shove, in 1991 August, the Red Bedsheet was lowered peacefully and rapidly. <br><br>We do well to remind ourselves that it was America that produced <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> and the Apollo moon landings. A nation of such talent is capable of reorganizing itself peacefully (I would hope, into a congeries of smaller nation-states, as the USSR did). My prediction is accordingly the same as Bill Pulliam's - yes, lots of USA civil disorder impending; but no, no civil war. <br><br><br>Hastily,<br><br><br>Tom (Catholic in Estonian diaspora, just north of Toronto) <br><br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a> <br><br>PS: Bill Pulliam is right to say that we have been through the current miseries before. Many of us here will remember radio accounts of the 1967 Detroit rioting, the political conventions of 1968, the MLK and RFK assassinations, and the "Weathermen".<br><br><a href=#c4787831634681972284 title="comment permalink">7/21/16, 2:00 PM</a><br><br>

You cannot object to evil as posing a problem for an alternative belief system if you yourself reject the concept of evil as such.</i><br><br>...well, yes, you can. You just have to be careful to phrase it so that you're pointing out an inconsistency in the alternative belief system and not making a positive case for anything else. Essentially, you're demanding your opponent play by their own rules, even if you don't accept them.<br><br>Of course, that can be dirty pool, as in that classic quote from Muad'Dib: "When I am weaker than you, I ask you for freedom because that is according to your principles; when I am stronger than you, I take away your freedom because that is according to my principles." But it's not logically invalid.<br><br>(Sorry. My last comment has apparently got me in a mood to nitpick logical fallacies. I actually don't think the argument from evil is a very persuasive argument in any of its forms, because it assumes a level of knowledge about morality and the universe that humans just don't have. Its complement on the Christian side is probably Pascal's Wager, which totally breaks down if you don't limit the possibilities to "God will save you if-and-only-if I believe in Christianity" and "no religion at all"—try throwing in "God is a big fat liar and will roast you no matter what" and "a different religion that is fulfilling in this world and the next" into the mix and see what happens.)<br><br><a href=#c8459928998312222864 title="comment permalink">7/21/16, 2:21 PM</a><br><br>

I am predicting a very smiler but different trajectory in the near future ( despite the fact your version is already playing out.) In history one thing that is somewhat unique this time is extent to which the peasants ( and especially the young) are indebted. As the money printing begins to fail and the economy rolls over the defaults on student loans, mortgages, subprime auto loans and credit cards will accelerate. Though the banks and collections agencies may be ruthless and persistent, the sharp end of the spear in this dirty business is the law firms ( usually local) who file suits in mass that allow court judgements to take place . Without these judgement foreclosures, garnishments etc. can't occur. Compared to the police these assembly lawyers are soft targets and even less well liked by those in the falling working class ( and other hopelessly indebted folk). Now that the glass wall preventing violence against authority figures has been broken beatings and killings will sweep the ranks of the legal end of the collections industry. This will stonewall the debt industry for a short time until they figure out how to eliminate such legal niceties as judgements and employee the sheriffs, army or private goon squads to collect debt. This of course will radicalize most of the poor, working class, and fallen middle class and the insurgency will be off to the races. If the elites were not senile they would be trying to take care of this now.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c7159659675030714169 title="comment permalink">7/21/16, 2:48 PM</a><br><br>

I supply my own infrastructure for both of those and water tanks cost about $0.10/litre, without any additional pumps, ongoing energy, valves and pipes. Have a think about how much water you use in any one day and that expenditure to clean up the Catskills is very cheap - and a total bargain for you in the process.<br><br>Have you read about the unfolding (sorry for the bad pun) issue on handywipes being disposed of in your sewers? Wow! There is a problem in unintended consequences. How we treat our sewage as a society is a real lost opportunity. My lot goes into enriching the soil via a worm farm. It is a good system.<br><br>Hi Nestorian,<br><br>I certainly don't dismiss evil at all. The thing I don't understand about evil is that if the trinity were all so powerful and in control, how come they keep that satan dude kicking around causing mayhem? Are they bored or scared of perfection or something like that? I've always sort of felt that satan is used in that belief system as something to point at and say: well things could be much worse! or, oh yeah, that guy is to blame for all the stuff going wrong, it is not our fault!

(It's pretty clear that at least one of them must be getting desperate, the Confederacy if Texas's accusation of horizontal drilling is true, and Texas if it's not, but that both are seems just as likely.) Not that it would resolve anything even if they figure that out, once the <a href=http://www.mediate.com/articles/noll1.cfm rel=nofollow>dollar auction</a> character of such wars takes hold.<br><br>I also wonder if Macallan had in mind to end the sentence "...the Gulf oil fields, onshore and offshore, have just dropped off the face of the Earth, and they’re going to stay that way until this whole business gets resolved" at the word "way," but felt he had to add the additional verbiage to maintain credibility with the foreign audience, or perhaps to protect intelligence sources. The EROEI of this war will likely turn out to be very low indeed, even for the "winning" side if there is one.

The imaginary bioplastic clothing in the story is meant to be the be-all and end-all of modern "progress" -- drastically worse than its predecessors in every significant way, but oh so modern and up to date! <br><br>Tom, thank you. Yes, poking fun at America's current excuse for journalism is one of the pleasures of this story. <br><br>Gavin, I think also the laboring classes are so used to being lied to by their soi-disant betters that when the pundits insisted that Brexit would cause economic misery to everyone, a lot of people rolled their eyes and said, "Pull the other one, it's got bells on." As for the US, though, no argument there -- we're stumbling into a very harsh time. <br><br>Brian, trust me, I get that. It's been unnerving to watch the classic opening moves of domestic insurgency play out step by step in my own country...<br><br>Twilight, thank you. I based it partly on events I've witnessed, partly on accounts of the beginning of the First World War. <br><br>William, exactly. You're settling for Tier 3, or roughly 1890-style infrastructure -- roads suitable to horsedrawn vehicles, on your own for electricity, but water and sewer available within city limits. A Model T will do very well in such a setting, so long as you can keep it fueled. <br><br>Sgage, it's a very troubling one. The US is rapidly moving down a familiar and ugly trajectory. <br><br>Chris, I don't think anybody in Black Lives Matter intends to launch an insurgency, but these events can pick up a momentum of their own, and the rising spiral of repression and rebellion can be very hard to stop once it gets under way. I don't think we've reached the point of no return yet, but it's closer than I like to think about.<br><br>Scotlyn, thank you. I'll try to make next week's post interesting anyway... ;-)<br><br>Brigyn, focusing on the positive things you can do is a very sensible strategy just now, and you're right -- it'll be just as sensible for people in the various North American republics affected by the Texas-Confederate War of 2065. As for the essay style, it just happened that way -- it's probably not accidental that I like that approach to nonfiction writing. I hope you enjoy <i>Inside a Magical Lodge</i>!<br><br>Daniel, thank you! I modeled that aspect of Owen's character on vets I've known, which probably helped with the verisimilitude. I have yet to meet anybody who's served in the military and seen combat who ended up going full hoohah; those I've met are by and large capable and tough, but very well aware of the downside of taking dumb risks in a dangerous situation.<br><br>(A reminder to all -- there are still some copies of the limited signed edition of <i>The Weird of Hali: Innsmouth</i> available for sale.

Stay tuned...<br><br>Brian, I know. That's why I've written several posts trying to point out to people that <a href=../../2015/08/the-last-refuge-of-incompetent.html rel=nofollow>those who babble about how we ought to have revolution or civil war</a> have their heads in a biologically improbable location. I wonder how many of them realize that, if they get their way, they're going to be the ones explaining to their kids why mommy isn't coming home ever again because a truck bomb splattered her across ten feet of wall, or the like. I think a domestic insurgency is a hideously bad idea, which makes it all the more ghastly to watch the authorities and their adversaries stumbling blindly ahead toward that bloodsoaked goal. <br><br>DarkOptimism, thank you! I was delighted to be asked to read the galleys and contribute a blurb; it's one of the very few things in recent years I'd place on the same shelf as William Catton's <i>Overshoot</i> or EF Schumacher's <i>Small Is Beautiful</i>. <br><br>Chris, yep. That's the way history happens, you know -- it's never just one crisis at a time. <br><br>Anton, good. There won't be anything like as much oil as in the case of Deepwater Horizon -- this is 2065, remember, so oil companies are tapping into little pockets of hydrocarbon sludge, not big formations -- but it's going to be an issue. <br><br>Matthew, glad to hear that. I picked it out on a topo map of the region as a good place for an army to march; it's good to know that someone on the ground agrees. <br><br>Mary, if you're not scared you're not paying attention...<br><br>Toomas, good heavens, that gimmick's been done to death in spy thrillers. The fact that you can quote an example from a TV show is reason enough for me not to include it -- and since this is a utopian fiction, not a spy thriller, it would have been completely out of place. (Nor is the honey trap necessarily that useful in 2065, given that people are posting pictures of their genitalia to the internet in 2016.) As for the rest, stay tuned!<br><br>Unknown, thank you!<br><br>John, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Caryn, welcome back! Not to worry; I'll remain on the internet as long as there's enough of a publicly accessible internet to make it worth doing. <br><br>Toomas, good heavens, did you have a crush on Melanie or something? She hasn't even been born yet, you know... ;-)<br><br>Wendy, so would I! <br><br>Eric, if you think you can get it past the various watchdogs, by all means. It'll be available in book form by the end of the year, and hopefully well before then, if that helps at all. <br><br>Varun, I don't read political thrillers. The ones I read back in my more omnivorous days bored me -- they put way too much time into military technogimmickry or chest-thumping heroics, and missed the thing I enjoy, which is the texture of actual history as it happens. The main source for my thrillers is a lot of reading of history, with a focus on accounts of what it was actually like to be there at the time. <br><br>As for writing more political thrillers, the problem is that I have to make a living from my writing, and sales of my one book-length thriller, <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i>, have been very modest so far -- respectable enough that the publisher's bringing out more of my books, but still modest enough that I can't put a lot of time into that genre.

We discussed two weeks ago the difference between innovation and performance; most genres of fiction these days are pure performance, with a fixed set of characters, plot elements, situations, gimmicks, and outcomes, nearly as tightly scripted as a Bach concerto. The role of creativity is purely a matter of how neatly you can assemble a story out of those fixed elements so that the reader gets the emotional payoff he or she expects. <br><br>Think of police procedural mysteries, "cozy" detective stories, Western novels, bodice-ripper historical romances, feminist science fiction, heroic fantasy, interplanetary-war space opera, and so on -- they have their formal rules, which you do not break if you want to appeal to the audience. Almost all bestsellers these days are books that either follow the rules with perfect elegance, ring a few small and unthreatening changes on them, or do a mashup of two sets of rules -- the Harry Potter novels, with their mashup of generic fantasy and the generic English school novel, make a great example of this latter. <br><br>The thing is, there's nothing wrong with this, any more than there's something wrong with enjoying Bach concertos, or even devoting your creative energies to the elegant playing of Bach concertos. Performance is also art, and readers have every right to want a predictable tale with familiar elements and an emotional effect that can be anticipated and savored in advance all the way through the story. The sort of highbrow snottiness that insists that only innovation is <i>real</i> art deserves no more respect than any other prejudice. I enjoy reading performance fiction in certain genres; my problem is that I find writing such fiction agonizingly dull. <br><br>My first novel, <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2015/11/new-release-fires-of-shalsha.html rel=nofollow>The Fires of Shalsha</a>, was to some extent a performance: specifically, a classic '70s SF novel of the kind I still prefer to current fashions in the genre -- though even there it messed with some of the rules. My second and third novels, <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2014/04/new-release-stars-reach-by-john-michael.html rel=nofollow>Star's Reach</a> and <a href=us.karnacbooks.com/product/twilights-last-gleaming/34386/ rel=nofollow>Twilight's Last Gleaming</a>, wadded up the rules and jumpshotted them into the wastebasket: <i>Star's Reach</i> is a science fiction story about how we're not going to the stars and what that means, <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> is a Tom Clancyesque military-political thriller in which the US loses. In those genres, <b>You. Do. Not. Do. That.</b><br><br>For that matter, the series now under way -- yes, <a href=http://www.miskatonicbooks.com/THE-WEIRD-OF-HALI-INNSMOUTH-by-John-Michael-Greer-Signed-Limited-Edition-Hardcover.html rel=nofollow>The Weird of Hali</a> is a series, with volume 2 in the hands of the publisher, volume 3 complete in rough draft, and volume 4 in partial draft -- is just as unwilling to settle for performance. I've taken the rules of Lovecraftian horror fiction and stood them on their heads, with results that delight me but will probably irritate the stuffing out of those who like a predictable read. This time I'm deliberately playing with the genre conventions; one of these days, probably after the series is finished, I plan on writing an essay on weird fiction, in which I talk about how it works from the perspective of someone who's spent many hours at the keyboard systematically undercutting it to make a very different sort of story. <br><br>I could definitely see writing another thriller someday, but that'll depend at least as much on financial issues as literary ones -- and if I do, it'll be just as annoying to those who like a nice standard heroic US-overcomes-evil-enemies story as <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> was.<br><br><a href=#c8595857211474550646 title="comment permalink">7/22/16, 12:53 AM</a><br><br>

As for maps, I'll need to find someone who can do a good clear black and white map of post-US North America; I've made a few changes since the early days of the project, when one of my readers (I'm embarrassed to say I've forgotten which one) did a very nice map in color. <br><br>Pygmycory, hard to say, but things are moving in that direction. <br><br>Clay, flintlocks and swords? Hardly; both sides have allies with large munitions industries. But you're right that high-tech weaponry is going to become less and less relevant as the war goes on. We won't see much of that, but some of it will be anticipated.<br><br>William, it'll become like Retrotopia if you and the other people there decide to make it like Retrotopia. Why not give it a try? <br><br>Patrick, I don't see it as bleak at all. Human beings are a very mixed bag. We do stupid things and smart ones, cruel things and merciful ones, ugly things and things of stunning beauty. That's simply the way things are, and the fact that two nations in my fictional 2065 are getting into yet another war over resources doesn't change the fact that another nation has made constructive choices that keep it out of such conflicts, and provide space for opera, jazz music, streetcars, and love affairs.

The Republic of New England and the Maritimes consists of the New England states from Massachusetts north, and the Maritime provinces that are now part of Canada. Quebec is Quebec. East Canada is Ontario, Manitoba, and points north. The Lakeland Republic is Ohio, West Virginia except for the western panhandle, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The Confederate States of America is the old Confederacy of 1861 minus Texas, and plus the southeastern quarter or so of Missouri. The Missouri Republic is the rest of Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Dakotas, along with all of Wyoming and Montana east of the Continental Divide and the northeastern third or so of Colorado. The Republic of Texas is Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and part of southern Colorado. The Republic of Deseret is Utah, Idaho minus the panhandle, and the portions of Colorado and Wyoming west of the continental divide. Arizona and Nevada are abandoned territory, uninhabitable due to climate change. The Republic of California is California, and the Cascade Republic is Washington, Oregon, the Idaho panhandle, and the portion of Montana west of the continental divide. Oh, and there's the Kingdom of Hawai'i and the Republic of Alaska, if you want to include them. Sea level has gone up about six feet; New Orleans, Galveston, and the Florida Keys no longer exist, and the southern end of Florida has been heavily eroded by rising seas and massive hurricanes, so it's not the same shape as it is today. Got it? <br><br>Patricia, I'm certainly not cheering things on. This could end so badly...<br><br>Eric, and that's also a common reaction. You might read accounts of the runup to the First World War in Russia, or the runup to the Second in Britain. <br><br>Clay, young people sufficiently well off to run up student loan debt are not usually the ones who set off the kind of spiral of violence we're seeing. It might happen, but what I see instead is basically what happened in Iraq: society breaking apart as one ethnic group begins to turn to insurgent violence in response to abuses on the part of authority, and other ethnic groups arm themselves and turn to violence in response to the insurgency. Here, if things go worst-case, I'd expect to see white-plus-asian, Hispanic, and black as the major lines of division, with armed militias and growing geographical separation, until (a) the country falls apart into failed-state conditions or Yugoslavia-style partition, or (b) a competent tyrant manages to reimpose order by main force. <br><br>One Gun, I never watched that, so will have to take your word for it. <br><br>Justin, I don't think anyone in Black Lives Matter intends to start an insurgency. What concerns me is that things may spiral out of their control. <br><br>Pantagruel7, I've yet to read a thriller as convincing or as interesting as actual history. Glad you enjoy the result!<br><br>Shane, that's a possibility, but unlikely at this stage. When the police start going rogue the government usually is on its last legs. <br><br>Mike, I've already got artists working on graphic adaptations of <i>Star's Reach</i> and my blog post "The Next Ten Billion Years." I could see a Retrotopia graphics novel, though. <br><br>Justin, nope. I don't trust my judgment of people well enough to do that. <br><br>Diner, I don't know -- I approved it, but Google must have eaten it. (That happens to about one comment every other week.) In answer to your misplaced comment, though, I gather you haven't read the rest of the story, as those points are covered at length in earlier episodes. <br><br>Justin, they are indeed.<br><br><a href=#c1819250752588563575 title="comment permalink">7/22/16, 1:45 AM</a><br><br>

The problem here is to extend out the time-frame of the effects of the use of violence to solve a problem to see if it really did. For a few examples of how it can come unstuck-<br> The US invades Iraq to steal its oil and hijack its economy for its own looting purposes. Result? Some three thousand dead Americans alone along with six trillion dollars in committed costs later, Iraq is in terminal civil war and ISIS was born of the resulting chaos.<br> The West has Gaddafi murdered after he gives up his nuclear program and smashes the Libyan state to grab its resources, especially its gold and oil.

Libya is now a viper's nest of militias and jihadists and no power will ever give its nuclear program up ever, ever again.<br> I never thought about it in such terms but I guess that when you try to solve a problem, you have to take a holistic approach to make sure that you do not have more problems from your solution than is solved by your initial 'solution'.<br> As for your Roman examples of the Gracchi brothers and Sulla's murders, I am afraid that there are no free passes here either. I happen to know enough of Roman history myself to know that the deaths and chaos involved in these three episodes seeded the end of the Roman Republic and convinced the Roman people into forgetting their political institutions and putting their faith in Emperors instead when times turned bad.<br><br> For those interested, I found that there are examples of Lean Logic at http://dark-mountain.net/blog/lean-logic/ and it sounds quite fascinating and worth reading.<br><br><a href=#c4071716102483121731 title="comment permalink">7/22/16, 2:57 AM</a><br><br>

Time to start making real shoes! Tool up a few factories, and come up with instructions for home made footwear: tire tread sandals, rope soled espadrilles, and various wood-soled clogs.<br><br>4) Get radios available, for when the meta-net goes down.

Ask the Romans. The Senate sure 'solved' both of the Gracchus brothers, and Sulla sure solved a few things in politics as well, to cite only a couple of well known incidents out of hundreds (thousands?).</i><br><br><i>Of course much depends on how you choose to define 'solved' and 'things.'</i><br><br>By 'solved', I mean 'promoted justice' and 'promoted public welfare'. When in turn asked to define 'justice', (a) I point to the work of human-rights jurists (an example of such work here in Canada is the Charter of Rights and Freedoms), and (b) I elucidate the concept of justice by citing historical examples of its opposite - Nazi death camps (termed by the Reich authorities "The Final Solution"), the Jim Crow laws, the Victorian sweatshops, Tsar Nikolai's "Bloody Sunday", and the Inquisition, to take five. When asked to define 'public welfare', I cite security against being bludgeoned or shot or robbed; security against starvation; security against emotional abuse by authority figures, notably employers, teachers, priests, and police; security against overwork and underpay; duly easy access to medical care; duly easy access to a diversity of journalistic opinion; and security of one's personal communications and personal archives against government inspection. <br><br>Lacking a properly specialized knowledge of Roman history (though I have spent much time on Latin), I have had to my shame to consult Wikipedia for Sulla and the Gracchi. But these consultations leave me puzzled on what you find here to praise. <br><br>(A) Sulla - this much I think I did kinda-sorta know before glancing at Wikipedia - acted unconstitutionally, ruled for a while as what in technical Roman juris-speak was a <i>dictator</i>, and paved the way for Pompey's and Caesar's subsequent destruction of the Republic. (Cicero quotes Pompey as saying, "If Sulla did it [sc seized power], why can't I?") The number of nobles killed in Sulla's proscriptions is pegged by Wikipedia as 1,500, with the further suggestion that the total death toll was several times higher. <br><br>(B) The Gracchi were land reformers, supportive of the agrarian poor. Tiberius Gracchus was clubbed to death, with 300 supporters. Gaius Gracchus committed suicide to avoid dying at the hands of a mob. <br><br>What is your assessment of Sulla's proscriptions? What is your assessment of the deaths of the two Gracchi? Are you saying that these things were in some sense commendable - that, perhaps, in the words of V.I.Lenin, the making of an omelet presupposes the smashing of eggs? <br><br>Or do you, perhaps, feel with me that once 'solved' is defined in the way I have just tried to define it, historical examples of political violence achieving 'solutions' become rare? <br><br>Tom <br><br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a><br><br><a href=#c9146551405121686227 title="comment permalink">7/22/16, 7:29 AM</a><br><br>

Instead, I am grieved that a person who is in other respects ethical should accept the sexual invitation of a foreigner - to make things worse, a man of political power, from a dangerous jurisdiction - whom she scarcely knows. Although this kind of thing must be common in the lower grades of fiction and on television, I do not know how common it can be in real life. Perhaps the truth is that it does happen nowadays, at any rate among (a) the desperately poor (if your life is miserable, you might well turn to some cocktail of political violence, drugs, alcohol, and casual sex, in an effort to self-medicate) and (b) our morally spoiled Rulers. Concerning the latter, I do venture the remark that you and I, being both of us poor and far from the centres of power, are in a position to make shrewd guesses, and yet not in a position to know much. Anyway, what Melanie did is wrong, and cheapens her, and the man she eventually marries (unless it be the dim Carr himself) will come to resent it. <br><br>A further, subsidiary, consideration, which however must not be allowed to overshadow the principal consideration, is that she has compromised the security of the Lakeland Republic, even should Carr manage to defect. Carr was admittedly from an operational perspective wrong to walk into a room liable to be bugged. But on the other side of the operational coin, Melanie is for her part now a potential target for blackmail, on the part both of Carr and of whatever Atlantic Republic case officers may come to know - or even come to guess - of her weakness for powerful men. <br><br>Is Melanie going to make a clean confession to her superiors of her security compromise? This is the one properly public-spirited course of action now open to her. Unless her superiors are conniving, they will thereupon have to eject her from sensitive government service, as failing in security vetting. <br><br>Political violence (which gwizard43 and I are discussing today, here at ADR) is not the only thing liable to end badly. So is promiscuous sex. I don't want to dogmatize, but I do wonder if the current American friendliness toward firearms and promiscuity - or, again, the tendency, in many countries, in many historical eras, for soldiers to rape when not killing - are linked. <br><br><br><br>Tom <br><br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a><br><br><a href=#c8123549305837386239 title="comment permalink">7/22/16, 9:14 AM</a><br><br>

Your writing isn't similar to any of the authors I've read, the style focuses more on a web of characters all responding to an event outside of their control. Totally unlike the stoic ubermensch who decide the fate of the world that are popular in the genre. Retrotopia is especially interesting because the characters are so far away from the drama, they're kinda hanging out and living life while the rest of the world rattles itself apart. Yet somehow you manage to retain the tension like the whole country is in the middle of the action, and you maintain the tension with newspaper coverage and political briefings. <br><br>I enjoy your stories a lot more because you don't rely on gimmickry, which I've noticed bleeding into every genre over the last decade. Even magic in fantasy is basically gimmickry driven at this point, each story has a different set of rules that end up broken at the end by the main hero as a way to resolve the problem. It gets tedious really fast. <br><br>Well I'm hoping more people will buy Twilights Last Gleaming, which I thought was fantastic, so that we get more political thrillers from you. <br><br>Regards,<br><br>Varun<br><br>P.S. I'm not entirely sure we'll see an ethnic insurgency, the protesters are finally starting to adapt.

To use the Civil War example: looking at history of civil wars, the American Civil War was actually pretty clean as far as Civil Wars go, based on the number that wind up leading to authoritarian regimes, periods of sustained domestic terrorism and insurgency, or both that can last for 50 years or more... There could easily be a version of 2065 in which, instead of partition, a shaky peace, and a sudden outbreak of conflict in between two southern powers decades later (as Carr is observing right now), the second civil war that kicked off in the 2020s is still ongoing, and has dissolved into the same sort of ongoing background violence as the Israel-Palestine conflict...

I do appreciate the thoughtful and gentlemanly response!<br><br>Let me try to clarify my position.<br><br>I should state for the record that I'm not a fan of violence, and I'm not advocating for it, and I certainly would not make my own blanket pro-violence statement, so let's avoid any binary thinking critiques. <br><br>I accept and appreciate your definition of solved, but in this case, I would point out that politics itself has too seldom 'solved' 'things'. After all, more often than not, politics itself has been used to undermine the public welfare and to promote injustice. <br><br>Next, I'm hardly 'praising' the violence that was such a frequent visitor in Roman politics. My point was simply that violence solved what the Roman Senate perceived to be its problem with the Gracchi - I can assure you that the Senate would have tried to make the case (in fact they argued so at the time, before breaking up the furniture and using the pieces to club Tiberius and his followers to death) that in murdering the brothers it was 'promoting the public welfare and justice' both. Their definitions for 'public welfare' and 'justice' clearly would differ from yours and mine, but then, to dismiss this is to assert that your cultural context is superior to theirs. By their lights, they saw the Gracchi as threatening the stability of the Republic - and in fact in some ways they were exactly right! <br><br>Point being: these are far more slippery concepts to wrangle - (e.g. who is the 'public' in 'public welfare'?) - than your simple statement implies.<br><br>What about Iran? The US helps to topple a democratically elected leader and puts the puppet Shah in place, complete with secret police, torture, etc. The Islamists violently overthrow the regime. Did that promote justice? Public welfare? We could probably argue all day long about this complicated situation and many others (South Africa springs to mind), but that's the point: real life is far more complicated that simple bromides make it out to be. <br><br>In my view these simple bromides too often serve as thought-stoppers. <br><br>Or let's consider the declaration of independence - which speaks of a destructive government, and a "right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government" - it says nothing about doing this non-violently, and by their own actions, the signers made it clear they thought violence in pursuit of independence was a valid response. <br><br>Would you say that establishing the new nation of America did not 'promote justice and public welfare' - at the time? Or was this one of the 'seldom' times violence was legit?<br><br>There are innumerable examples we could debate.<br><br>My point in all of this is simply to try to point out that sweeping, blanket statements like "Violence has seldom solved things in politics" are so vastly oversimplified and vague as to be susceptible to any, or no meaning at all. <br><br>And I'm arguing that to begin with a thought stopper like 'violence seldom solves things' is - IMHO - a refusal to embrace the complexity of our condition.<br><br>I'd strongly suggest those who had a knee jerk response to my comment pick up a copy of Pacifism as Pathology to study. It offers a considerably more nuanced view of this topic.<br><br><a href=#c7480063282421380052 title="comment permalink">7/22/16, 5:50 PM</a><br><br>

I know some Kentuckians (waves to Shane) are incensed by the suggestion, but just as in 1861, there are Kentuckians on both sides of that dispute, and it so happened in my future history that at the Louisville convention of 2030, more of the delegates voted to join Lakeland than voted to join the Confederacy. The Confederate invasion in 2049 was meant to reverse that decision, and failed; those people who wanted to become part of the Confederacy who hadn't moved south at Partition went with the retreating Confederate armies. Them's the breaks. <br><br>Shane, I'll get around to reading the transcript one of these days. <br><br>Sylvia, yes, and there's quite a bit more they can do -- but we'll get to that...<br><br>Patricia, I'll post something here as soon as they're available. <br><br>Mr. Geronimo, a lot of people thought the same thing about the USA in the 1920s and 1930s, and you saw what followed. In my future history, Brazil went through a couple of ghastly decades in the 2020s and 2030s, a lot of clueless people didn't survive, and then the lessons were learned. <br><br>Shane, PowerPoint was quietly buried, as people noticed how many bad decisions had been facilitated by it. Get rid of the pictures on the screen and people pay more attention to what's being said, and whether it's stupid or not!<br><br>Donalfagan, I suppose that's one way to think of it! <br><br>Shane, you're quite correct. Ed-M, the Atlantic Republic is the present-day states of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland, with the eastern (not western) panhandle of West Virginia; Washington DC is technically Atlantic territory but it's basically a ruin inhabited by squatters. West Canada is BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory; Nunavut, I should have said, is an independent nation, having united with Kalaallit Nunaat (aka Greenland) in 2042. There's also the Free City of Chicago, which is an independent (and gaudily corrupt) nation, and consists of Cook County. I think that's it!<br><br>Hammer, when I lived in the Seattle area, Vietnamese gangs were some of the toughest in town, and the Koreans and Samoans down in White Center used to rumble on a regular basis. That is to say, I beg to differ. As for ten per cent of people making the change, that ten per cent has to begin with one. Why not be that one? <br><br>Toomas, I hate to break it to you, but sex between people who hardly know each other is tolerably common these days. Peter and Melanie have been in fairly close contact for ten days, and that's more than enough time to inspire a casual fling in many social circles today -- especially when both parties are nonreligious. There's another reason for the relationship, though, and it's the same reason I've portrayed same-sex couples in the story. One of the automatic thoughtstopping reactions that comes up whenever anyone suggests going back to older technology is the insistence that this means going back to older social mores -- do you remember the people who popped up in the comments, when I talked about a return to Victorian technology, who insisted that this required going back to child labor and the like? The presence of relatively casual sexual mores in Retrotopia is intended to stop that reaction in its tracks. Melanie Berger dresses like a woman from 1940 and lives in a town with roughly 1940s technology, but that doesn't mean that she shares the same social habits as people did in the 1940s. Au contraire, she's a woman of 2065, with the social habits of her own period, which are not that different from the social habits of upper middle class, nonreligious people in most of the US today.<br><br><a href=#c5925169832721002867 title="comment permalink">7/23/16, 12:20 AM</a><br><br>

About ten years ago I did a great deal of reading on the runup to the Second World War, focusing on the kind of day-by-day accounts spiced with plenty of contemporary quotes and interviews with people who were there, but I couldn't name you titles. <br><br>Ed-M, got it in one. There was a bad hurricane during the Second Civil War, when there was no money available for anything, and another three years after Partition, when the Confederacy was still struggling with the postwar economic mess. By the time things stabilized, the levees were full of holes, most of the city had flooded repeatedly, and the ongoing breakup of the Greenland ice sheet meant that everyone knew the Big Easy was done enough to stick a fork in.

I wasn't expecting the African-American community to move so quickly along the usual route to insurgency; my working guess was that the insurgency would break out first among poor rural Southerners irrespective of color, driven by economic issues. To the extent that Black Lives Matter succeeds in defining the problem with extrajudicial executions by police as purely a matter of race, and violence breaks out along that particular fault line, the interracial relations I see around me could all too easily go the way of marriages between Bosnians, Croatians, and Serbs.

In a very real sense, it's the fifth Ring opera, in which the unresolved issues left over from Gotterdammerung find their resolution. I'm actually basing this in large part on an obscure essay by Wagner -- have you by any chance read <i>Die Wibelungen: Weltgeschichte aus der Saga</i>? He wrote it in 1848, while the basic concepts of the Ring were first bubbling in his imagination, and it equates the Grail and the Rhinegold. (It's also very likely one of the sources Evola used for <i>Revolt Against the Modern World</i>, and gets into the Guelph-Ghibelline conflict in a rather more subtle way than Evola ever did.) More on this, as I said earlier, if I ever decide to chase off most of my readers! <br><br>Daniel, the Second Civil War was a very difficult time for Hawai'i, as the tourist trade and exports to the mainland stopped completely, and a great many people left in the ensuing economic depression. When the islands voted for independence in 2030, the plan of reestablishing the former constitutional monarchy was the one option that garnered enough votes in the constitutional convention to get by, and the native Hawai'ians selected one of several descendants of the old royal house to be crowned king, taking the name of Kamehameha VI. King William V of England and Crown Prince Hisahito of Japan were among the dignitaries present at the coronation. From the perspective of 2065, the decision to reestablish the monarchy seems to have been sound; Hawai'ian politics have been lively but peaceful, and the kingdom has maintained a studied neutrality in the various conflicts around the Pacific rim -- a decision that has attracted quite a bit of investment money to the islands. <br><br>MawKernewek, thank you! A couple of corrections: Connecticut and Rhode Island are historically part of New England and should go with the Republic of New England and the Maritimes; and the Northwest and Yukon Territories are part of West Canada, not East Canada. The division of Missouri and West Virginia in your old map are correct. As for the division of Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado, if you look up the continental divide, that's the line to follow for the first two; for Colorado, the Republic of Deseret ends at the continental divide, and the Missouri-Texas boundary goes more or less in a straight line from the southeastern corner of Colorado to the point where the continental divide crosses Colorado's northern border. <br><br>Cathy, thank you! <br><br>LatheChuck, sounds like a plan. <br><br>Temporaryreality, exactly.

Apologies, I've now descended into the land of silliness...<br><br>Of course, the silliness was absolutely necessary because I read the newspaper this morning - the paper copy, mind you- and I stumbled across this article: <a href=http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/all-eyes-on-inflation-next-week-but-not-everything-is-as-it-seems-20160722-gqbg8o.html rel=nofollow>All eyes on inflation next week, but not everything is as it seems...</a> I thought to myself that this sounds interesting, I wonder if they’ll discuss asset price rises as an inflationary effect?<br><br>I did hear you once talking on a podcast about a book called the Principles of Cosmic Order and I’m sure you felt much the same as I did this morning. I hope you don’t mind that I was totally laughing hard when I heard that story.<br><br>So, to save you a bit of trouble reading the article, my favourite quote was this: "Housing price pressures were also weak, rising just 0.3 per cent." Honestly, I almost spat coffee all over the newspaper in sheer outrage. I mean how is that even possible when <a href=http://www.domain.com.au/news/melbourne-median-house-price-grows-12-per-cent-over-march-quarter-domain-group-20160421-go9m0e/ rel=nofollow>Melbourne median house price grows 1.2 per cent over March quarter</a> and note that the article refers to the statistic that annual price growth was 12%!!!! I believe Sydney was 19% for the same annual period. What is wrong with these people?<br><br>The people that come up with those annual inflation numbers clearly appear to be giving more weighting to the price change for a litre of milk or a loaf of bread than the incredible ever escalating house price down here. The interesting thing is that I believe that we have now exceeded the household income to price ratio of Los Angeles which was at 11 (!) just before the US house price crash in 2008.<br><br>Enough! I must reach for a chamomile tea to settle my now shattered nerves...<br><br>Hi teajanotim,<br><br>It looks as though we will have to wait. It is not fair is it? I have provided some alternative suggested endings which perhaps JMG will consider in his narrative: Maybe Mr Carr will become a POW in the Lakeland republic? The authorities may also attempt to institutionalise him after he expresses a profound desire for a career as an astronaut? How about Mr Carr, chucks it all in for a future career as a navigator on a ship travelling up and down the Mississippi River! OK, let’s get serious here. Mr Carr retrains as a fitter and turner and goes to work for the local tram company.;-)! <br><br>Hi Nestorian,<br><br>I believe that you are now referring to the placebo effect, and that may well work in some situations, of that I have no doubt - although I wouldn't employ that technique in a very nasty illness.

One hypothesis is that the speed of light has slowed over time; Australian creationist Barry Satterfield has assembled some historical attempts to measure the speed of light going back several hundred years that seem - crudely, to be sure - to indicate a possible trend of exponential decay over time.<br><br>Another attempt to deal with the problem is physicist Russell Humphrey's "white hole" cosmology, which uses the concept of event horizons to try to explain how the present laws governing the speed of light may not have applied during the period of the creation (and yes, that period did supposedly last 6 24-hour periods).<br><br>A further creationist angle on the question relates to the fact that the assignment of distances to celestial objects more than a couple hundred light years away is not based on the direct measurement of the parallax. Rather, these assignments involve inference chains that include certain empirically unverifiable assumptions. In general, the further away an object supposedly is, the more its claimed distance is subject to unverifiable assumptions - i.e., it might actually be a lot closer than we think.<br><br>To be sure, all of this involves fitting the scientific data to a pre-conceived framework of belief. But if you think that orthodox Big Bang theory doesn't do the same thing to an equal or greater degree with regard to a different pre-conceived framework of belief, then you are misinformed. <br><br>In point of fact, Big Bang Theory must introduce - on an entirely speculative basis - massive changes in basic laws of physics occurring infinitesimal fractions of a second after the primordial expansion. To me, that is nothing more than the introduction of a completely unaccountable Deus ex Machina to preserve a pre-conceived and institutionally sanctioned theory.<br><br>Another example of the way that Big Bang Theory introduces unaccountable ad hoc changes to try to preserve some semblance of internal coherence (while giving away that it lacks such coherence through the need for introducing the ad hoc change in the first place) is its postulation of the existence of Dark Matter to account for how the quantities of certain physical measurements is to be reconciled with the known laws of physics. <br><br>As has been pointed out elsewhere on this thread, physicists have been unable to empirically verify the existence of such Dark Matter. Why, then, should creationists be required to believe in the existence of such Dark Matter in order to validate their credentials as rational human beings? Such a demand merely asks them to substitute one leap of faith into something unproven for another. <br><br>Either way, moreover - whether your leap of faith involves creation, or whether it involves Dark Matter along with certain unaccountable changes in basic laws of physics occurring in primordial moments - the logical justification of your belief system inevitably involves an element of circularity. There is a way in which both creationists and Big Bang Theorists alike incorporate something unprovable into their interpretation of empirical data, such that the interpretation of the data somehow supposedly helps to validate belief in the unprovable.<br><br><a href=#c8662871380189574824 title="comment permalink">7/23/16, 5:17 AM</a><br><br>

If you're not interested in writing a novel set during the Texan-Confederate War of 2065, subcontract it out!

I wonder how much longer Texas can remain viable republic? Eastern Oklahoma and Texas should still get enough spring storms blowing in from the Gulf to keep agriculture viable, but climate change rendering everything west of I-35 uninhabitable should a last straw for the Republic. I can also say that if things go well for the Confederates, or as climate change takes it's toll, the Republic of Texas would have a rebellion in eastern Oklahoma on their hands. We don't like the western half of the state that much, and really don't like Texas!<br><br>On another note, I was very skeptical of your prediction that the Donald would win the white house.

In the Bible, such events are called evil. But there is also the other use of the word, to depict an evilly evil being of terrible, malicious intent doing something horrible to someone.<br><br>And, it's the latter which moral relativists don't recognize a way to judge as being evil.<br><br>Those disturbed by the problem of evil refer to both, but perhaps a bit more to the latter. The Gnostics were mostly concerned with the former, and thus they thought that because suffering is built into the structure of our reality it must have been created by a demigod rather than the real, true God.<br><br>“It's still not a very persuasive argument to me because it's still trying to second-guess an omniscient being. “<br><br>I agree. Or maybe She isn't omniscient. Or maybe there's a plan we don't appreciate. I don't trust the whining of toddlers.<br><br>“I've long thought that anyone who believes in such a being (I'm unconvinced either way) should answer with, "I guess that's just how little our suffering matters in the grand scheme of things." <br><br>Nah. Some people on this blog say they live in an indifferent universe, but I sure don't. We just don't have the big picture here and it gets discouraging for sure. Part of our sentence in this prison is to be left without knowledge of why we are here and with what we are charged – much like the unfortunates of Guantanamo Bay. It's from a place of discouragement that one comes to the conclusion that our suffering doesn't matter. <br><br>I've been reading about cells of single and multicellular organisms. No science fiction writer could ever have made this stuff up. A cell has between 20 and 100 trillion atoms. 5 million to a couple of trillion molecules. The cell if blown up would be much like a small manufacturing city of 5 to 10 miles across filled with busses, manufacturing plants, deliveries and transport of products, etc. Millions of portholes on its surface. A way to crawl itself into place and adhere to like cells. Under duress, cells can turn on mutations, but only in that part of the genome where it might be useful. Cells make many calculations and decisions based on them. One comes away with the impression that a cell is a little life form with a life of its own and yet it also contributes to the being much larger than itself. Cells of my immune system go to war and die in the war. Yet it makes sense because, after all, if they did not, how would they live their little personal lives? Much like my dependence on the earth's ecosystem. <br><br>I am fascinated by tiny consciousness. Who is running this small city? In what way does my being and my consciousness intermix or overwhelm that of the individual cell? Can I communicate at all to my cells? Through emotional states, definitely. Likewise, I'm sure we are part of something bigger. But the physical level and the spiritual level are different, because, as the Hindus like to say, all material things are temporary and pass away. They are vehicles for a consciousness which is probably rather limitless in its ability to learn.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c2274665503110449718 title="comment permalink">7/23/16, 7:54 AM</a><br><br>

In your response to Chris (Cherokee is not his name, it’s the name of the mountain range where he lives), all I can say is a riff on another famous old saying: “What is unique to Christianity is not good, what is good in Christianity is not unique.” I’m not a Christian because of the theology, which I find laughable.

Although of course monarchism can go horribly wrong, it actually has a pretty good track record, and I'm pretty sure that most of the real failures of monarchism were related to civilizational cycles as described by Spengler and would have happened to a more democratic system anyway.<br><br>Returning to Toomas' point: Even though I am receptive to the notion that casual sex is somewhat accepted in the Lakeland Republic, most organizations have rules about disclosing relationships between members of related or rival organizations. Of course, nobody in most organizations today understands that rule to extend to semi-spontaneous liaisons unless they become lasting relationships.<br><br>I have a couple theories about what the sexual landscape will look like in any reasonably stable part of North America in 2065, and it doesn't involve a lot of promiscuity, at least according to the patterns of promiscuity that are normal now. <br><br>One factor to consider is that entirely antibiotic resistant strains of just about every bacterial STD are floating around in the homosexual community these days, and of course they won't stay there. Unlike HIV, which is difficult to transfer through normal sexual practices other than receiving (unprotected) anal sex and has therefore never really been too much of a problem for heterosexual people, gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis are more easily transferred by heterosexual sex, and of course, might be a life sentence 50 years from now. These diseases will get more nasty as antibiotics go away, because "hope that my host passes me on before I'm noticed" won't be a necessary strategy. Of course, HIV, without modern treatments might actually burn itself out or become something that kills much more slowly than it did in the 80's.<br><br>1/2<br><br><a href=#c5827969819007698887 title="comment permalink">7/23/16, 11:18 AM</a><br><br>

Does the Church take children from women who have children but cannot support them as it has in the past? Are shotgun weddings a thing? Are there welfare programs sufficient to allow a single woman to support herself and an infant or child? All of these systems have been tried at times, although I suspect that resources will be a bit too tight and Lakeland a little too Protestant (whether or not they admit it) for the welfare solution, and a little too atheistic for the church solution, it really leaves few options for a woman who gets herself into that situation (although I do hope that shaming of the associated male behavior is more of a thing in 2065!). Perhaps what will happen is that the new mother and child will simply take on a more domestic role in her extended family due to her need to be around to breastfeed, etc.<br><br>Another question that nags at me quite a bit is whether or not people do actually pair bond more strongly with their first sexual partners more than say, their 14th. Although there's a lot of cultural factors, my Indian (Ganges) friends and colleagues are doing fairly well in their largely arranged marriages, including some who didn't meet their wives or husbands until shortly before the weddings. Compared to my Canadian peers, the levels of drama, divorce etc. is incredibly low. Although divorce statistics should be taken with a grain of salt due to Pareto distribution in the number of times people get divorced in a life time, there's evidence that more sexual partners before marriage correlates with divorce.<br><br>Of course, a lot depends on birth control technology in 2065. Latex condoms might still be available due to the popularity, social importance and simplicity of the technology causing scarce resources to be allocated to it, and liked I talked about last week, copper IUDs could be employed under extremely austere conditions (but they do nothing about the disease issue). I agree that homosexuality will be tolerated, if not understood as an important part of society. History is littered with very successful (closeted) gay men, and it's possible that whatever mental changes cause someone to be homosexual cause other changes which grant them a different perspective, and of course no kids means abundant time and resources for other endeavors.<br><br><a href=#c3713632063254671992 title="comment permalink">7/23/16, 11:18 AM</a><br><br>

La Raza and whatever emerges out of BLM after the Democratic Party loses control of it likely will explicitly exist as institutions to advance the interests of the Hispanic and Black races, which will be in conflict with the interests of everyone who doesn't fit into those categories, namely white people, Asians and everyone else. Something to look at will be the number of white people attending and supporting BLM events - it's running about 50% from what I've seen.<br><br>It's permissible in North America for a nonwhite person to express racist sentiments publicly and expect no consequences, but for a white person it's utterly unacceptable to do so. Regardless of what one thinks of this state of affairs, the real mood of White America is really hard to judge. I agree, however, with Orlov that the European-American psyche responds to threats by standing it's ground, hoisting its colors and force aggressors to take some steps backwards with their tails between their legs, and then it will calm down again.

Dunno.<br><br>2) It seems the uninhabitable area could stand to be a bit larger, taking in portions of Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and even SE Oregon and SW Idaho, based on current desert areas. Also the Great Plains are desert, too; I assume they can still be inhabited.<br><br>3) The indisposed of territory in Canada - perhaps this could be two countries?

The biggest reason being that the ethnic culture and loyalty simply doesn't exist to the extent that it does in those places. However that isn't to say that we won't have ethnic insurgents. The biggest thing I'm noticing about the states is that the number of fissures in this country and how deep each of them run. I'm starting to think that we'll have multiple insurgencies, each fighting for different reasons. From what I'm seeing, it's entirely possible that different parts of the country will have insurgents fighting for different reasons, with some crossover of ideology.

The reason I ask is that some southern states like North Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and, to a lesser extent, Tennessee are very "New South" and overrun w/carpetbaggers to the point that they don't even resemble the South in certain areas. I can't see the carpetbaggers supporting the Confederacy. Do they (the carpetbaggers) stay or go? Also, states like Miss., Ky, Ala., Ark. are much poorer, have experienced much less growth, and, consequently, are much more native with a lot fewer carpetbaggers. How much of KY's decision to go Lakeland is native driven vs. carpetbagger driven?<br>Regarding black police interactions, it's getting to the point that black people would be well advised to shoot first and ask questions later if they want to come out of a police interaction alive. I mean, how can they have any certainty of coming out of a police interaction alive? I really don't mean to be flippant, but it seems to have gotten that bad. Meanwhile, the unspoken problem is the militarization and escalation of the police, which only fringe libertarians like Rand Paul seem willing to address.<br>I know it's your novel, and I know your experiences growing up w/a smoker, but I still fail to see how the current antismoking regime continues after all the wars, etc. I just see that as an extension of our current biophobia, and after all those people have come up close and personal w/their own mortality and lost so many, I just can't see them being that concerned about smoking. On the other hand, I'd imagine that Lakeland's strong corporate responsibility laws make it pretty hard for tobacco companies to misrepresent their products. Somehow, I'm imagining some sort of middle ground.<br><br><a href=#c8199262493641245309 title="comment permalink">7/23/16, 1:47 PM</a><br><br>

Or was this one of the 'seldom' times violence was legit?</i> <br><br>I answer that this was not an instance of legitimate violence. I am writing from Ontario, formerly Upper Canada. Upper Canada, like also parts of New Brunswick and my native Nova Scotia, was settled by embittered political refugees, hounded out of their homes in the former Thirteen Colonies under the derisory label "Tories". Finding themselves now not welcome in the independent USA, they had to settle in some wilderness, somewhere, somehow.<br><br>Although the American War of Independence settled some grievances, notably the matter of unfair taxation, it thus created others. <br><br>Because the United States broke away from the British Crown, it became possible in 1812 for a war to be fought between the USA and the emerging Canadian polity. In this war, both sides suffered, as in any war - the Americans torched the village that was then Toronto; and the British, as I now note with shame, for their part torched the White House; and other bad things happened. <br><br>But the big damage came later. Because the USA was no longer under the Crown, the Abolition of Slavery Act (Westminster, 1833), while ending slavery in the Empire, lacked legal effect in the USA. <br><br>I must not exaggerate the role of the continuing slavery in fomenting the War between the States. President Lincoln explicitly declared to Horace Greeley on 1862-08-22, <i>If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that.</i> Nevertheless, (1) tensions over slavery were a contributing cause, and (2) had Americans been under Queen Vicky in the 1840s, 1850s, and 1860s, Westminster would by imperial self-interest have been moved to stifle a conflict between rival colonial factions.<br><br>The British Crown was not under Queen Vicky a model for good government. The Victorian Irish could attest to that, as could the Victorian British poor. But the correct path to lightening the British yoke on at any rate the western side of the Atlantic is the path successfully initiated by Lord Durham's "Report on the Affairs of British North America" - piecemeal, gradual reform, with devolution of powers to colonial assemblies; an eventual Confederation (1867); eventual concession of autonomy in foreign policy to the confederated Canadian provinces (Statute of Westminster, 1931); finally, patriation of Constitution (Constitution Act, Ottawa 1982). <br><br>Hoping this helps a bit, <br><br>Tom<br><br><a href=#c4042041156895443542 title="comment permalink">7/23/16, 7:33 PM</a><br><br>

Clinton's as predictable as a mechanical wind-up Godzilla doll. As for the bridges, that was because they planned on driving north into Ohio and Indiana in order to break the Lakeland military, before settling in the peace conference for Kentucky. Unfortunately for them, they bogged down hard before they got to the Ohio River. <br><br>Cherokee, you'll certainly learn a good bit about Carr's destiny, and we're not too far off from that, either -- there are between three and five episodes left to round out the story, and then it gets a few weeks of editing and expansion and off it goes to the publisher. As for inflation stats, I'm thinking of the social critic back in the Seventies who talked about how economic indicators were being turned into "economic vindicators"...<br><br>Nestorian, some peak oilers were. I was talking about the cycle of rising prices -&gt; more drilling and innovation -&gt; falling prices -&gt; marginal production becomes uneconomical -&gt; rising prices a good many years back! <br><br>MawKernewek, nice. Is there any way you can generate a black and white map, just showing borders, which would be readable when printed on one page of a book? I'd be happy to credit your work...<br><br>Ben, if somebody wants to write a novel set in my imaginary future, I'm certainly willing to discuss the matter -- there's already somebody working on a novel set in the world of <i>Star's Reach</i>, and an anthology of short stories in that same world that, after many delays, is finally working its way toward print. <br><br>Synthase, there are many different kinds of contraceptives, and there are also plenty of things two people can do in bed together that don't result in pregnancy. Given current American sexual mores, I'd expect the latter to be at least as important as the former in 2065. <br><br>Zach, some social customs will doubtless change when people can no longer post random thoughts on Twitter and get a response in ten minutes. I was speaking, though, of things such as sexual customs -- that was, after all, the context of my comment to Toomas. <br><br>William, you can join the Confederate-symphathizing Kentuckians in filing a protest with the delegates negotiating Partition in 2030, if you like. ;-)<br><br>Justin, it's not often remembered that there were effective, non-antibiotic treatments for syphilis and gonorrhea decades before the antibiotic era. They weren't instant -- a syphilis patient would spend a year or two taking carefully regulated doses of Salvarsan, for example, before his or her system was clear -- but they worked. There was also some very promising research into bacterial phages in the pre-antibiotic era, and that's already being picked up again as antibiotics falter. In the same way, condoms date back to the seventeenth century -- they were made, as high-end ones still are, from sheep intestine -- and in a world on the other side of global warming, rubber trees will be viable in climates where they don't currently grow -- so latex condoms and diaphragms will definitely be options in the world of 2065; it's also quite possible that other options not currently in use will be recovered from the graveyard of abandoned technologies, or freshly invented. And of course, as I noted to Synthase, there are plenty of ways two people can enjoy each other's company in bed that don't cause pregnancy, and the way sexual mores in the US seem to be shifting, I expect that to be at least as significant as contraception in keeping unwanted pregnancies from happening.<br><br><a href=#c7508108247765275259 title="comment permalink">7/23/16, 8:55 PM</a><br><br>

So if a BLM-based insurgency starts (which I hope to God doesn't happen, although it seems to be getting closer and closer), and Trump is president, I can imagine a good many lefty white people siding with it.<br><br>Likewise, I think there's just as much anger against the government from the rightward end of society as there is in the black community-to cite one example, its become a somewhat common custom among Tea Party types to display the American flag upside down. Supposedly this is because an upside down flag indicates danger, which they think our country is in, but I can't help but see it as a big middle finger to a society that they perceive (with some truth) as having rejected them. Also, secession talk-which used to be unheard of pretty much anywhere-has become a lot more visible among the right. Its still a tiny minority, even in the Tea Party scene, but its a whole lot bigger and more visible than it was ten years ago. The only reason we haven't seen more BLM-like rage out of the Right in the past year and a half is because its currently being channeled into the Trump campaign. If Trump looses, and especially if its due to centrist/establishment Republicans voting for Gary Johnson (which I think is the most likely outcome of this election), the Right's rage is going to be a lot more obvious and a lot more scary.<br><br>Also, I have to side with Shane, et al on the Kentucky issue. The whole Appalachia region-which almost all of Kentucky falls into-is very poor and very conservative compared to the rest of the country. Having moved from South Carolina to the Appalachian part of Virginia a few months ago, I can say that my new home is, if anything, more right-wing than my old one. I certainly see at least as many Confederate flags. I've never been to Kentucky, but I have no reason to think its any different. It certainly votes the same way my area of Virginia does. (Not to mention, the one lady from Kentucky I've met had such a Southern accent, I initially thought she was South Carolinian :) )<br><br>And on the global warming note-I spent part of my childhood in said part of Virginia, and I distinctly remember the average July high being in the 80's or so-distinctly cool compared to my other home. But now that I'm back, it seems like its been above 90 every day this month-and a quick check of the whether shows it being above 90 through the rest of the week. I talked to my father (whose lived here for a bit longer than I have) about it, and he said that yes, the summers have gotten warmer and the winters have gotten colder with more snows (maybe 1-2 really severe ones per winter when I lived here 12 years ago, 3-4 now). It might be silly, but I can't help but wonder if this the climate chaos JMG warned us of in some of his earlier posts.<br><br><a href=#c1015956279034260473 title="comment permalink">7/23/16, 8:58 PM</a><br><br>

It's the most important drug which North America has given the world, and has historically been a major export crop. <br><br>American culture tends to veer between Puritanical abstinence and joyless excess, ruining or outlawing many physical pleasures which are best taken in moderation. Moderate consumption of nicotine has benefits. Yet it is hard to be moderate with tobacco, because it is powerfully addictive. It is not impossible. The Native Americans showed one way. They smoked only on special occasions, with ceremony, and sometimes mixed tobacco with other herbs. <br><br>Even without that kind of cultural support, it is possible for some people to enjoy smoking tobacco without getting hooked, if they don't start smoking early in life and are careful about dosage. My parents smoked and I have been asthmatic since childhood, so I stayed away from tobacco until I was in my late twenties. I had a boyfriend who was a smoker and one of our regular recreations was to go to bars, drink, and shoot pool, and in those days people smoked in bars. I started smoking cigarettes to keep him company, and found I liked a brand called Balkan Sobranies which are no longer available. Because of my asthma I took good care never to smoke more than a couple of cigarettes in a day and then to wait until the tobacco cleared out of my system before smoking again. In this way, I always got a rush, and I never got physically habituated or developed a craving. Since the departure of the boyfriend, I smoke about half a dozen cigarettes a year, as a treat on special occasions, and I have stuck to that for about thirty years.<br><br><a href=#c3178357007049562669 title="comment permalink">7/24/16, 12:53 AM</a><br><br>

Only about the Eastern third of the state can rightly be classified as Appalachian, and a slightly larger number of counties, but not the entire state (like WV) is in the ARC (Appalachian Regional Commission) A lot of the counties in the ARC no one would consider Appalachian, though. The Central and Western parts of the state (Lexington, Louisville, Bowling Green, Paducah) are not mountainous, had slave-based hemp and tobacco plantations, had an upper class aristocracy, and, as a legacy of that, to this day have well established rural black communities.<br>Southern influence extends into SE OH, S. Ind., &amp; S. Ill. For example, across the river in Corydon, Ind., west of Lou. you will find 2-3 times as much U of K apparel/gear in the local Walmart as IU gear, same thing for bumper stickers and front vanity plates.

I don't know about men, but for women that seems to be true. Just because modern society wants women to wait to get married (and have kids) in their 30s or even 40s, some 2 million or so years of evolutionary biology isn't going to just go away. Four human females, child bearing years are now from about age 15 to the early 30s without medical intervention. (Apparently historically the onset of menses was at a slightly older age, late teens, but improvements in nutrition and constant exposure to industrial era petrochemicals, psuedo-estrogens and endocrine disruptions have messed with biology a bit). I have long suspected that once you get past the ability to have an intense attachment to a mate in your teen years (as so many do), it never comes back. After that time, it seems there is less ability for physiological pair bonding and you have to mentally make a substitute, if that makes sense. I guess I mean at that point it comes more from your head than from your heart, so to speak, and there's a lot of silly cultural baggage in our heads, especially in this day and age where girls are being taught they don't need a husband or marriage and if they want those, there should wait until they are or are nearly past child bearing age to do it. But that's not what our bodies say - evolution is way behind modern society. Trying to ignore mother nature hasn't done our society any good and has probably caused more problems than it has solved. For at least the last 12000 years of known history, teenagers have been getting married, learning trades, running farms or businesses, performing their civic and religious duties, exploring frontiers and yes, fighting wars. They didn't suddenly get stupid in the modern era and their biological needs didn't change. But modern society has tried to be separate from nature, to conquer nature and make it irrelevant. And look where that has led! Bad outcomes on all fronts.<br><br><a href=#c4704700863274414284 title="comment permalink">7/24/16, 7:54 AM</a><br><br>

The Republicans try and obfuscate by saying liberals destroyed the coal industry, but many are well aware, after years of having their water, air, and garden soil fouled but acid rain and mine runoff that claim is filthy and polluting. It's not that they don't care, it's just that they have been offered no other hope for jobs. The big bosses in the counties keep it that way, because desperate people don't complain.

It seems to me that polygamy is perhaps the real evil, and the two models that work in my mind are the patrilineal monogamous model or the matrilineal model, where children belong to their mother and her male relatives, and the biological father is not considered to have obligations, rights, or even any particular association with the child.

It will be nice when people just roll their eyes and shrug about cannabis.<br><br><a href=#c7193088418601910926 title="comment permalink">7/24/16, 1:08 PM</a><br><br>

Given Clinton's epic mishandling of the Debbie Wasserman Schultz scandal on top of everything else, though, I think that's far and away the most likely turn of events. <br><br>Patricia, it really is shooting fish in a barrel! <br><br>Bob, it simply isn't true that a loss of confidence in money takes a long time to reestablish. Go research 1920s Germany and see how little trouble the German government had stabilizing its currency in the wake of hyperinflation. Here as always, when you see a claim like that, check it against history! <br><br>William, and that was also an issue, of course!<br><br>Ed-M, thank you -- I hope my corrections helped. <br><br>Varun, of course -- and that's also the case in Iraq, where there are many competing Sunni, Shi'a, Kurdish, etc. militias -- not just one of each. That's why I used that specific example. Thus, for example, in a worst-case failed-state US, you'd have a mosty white militia up here in the mountain counties of Maryland and adjacent regions of West Virginia, but it wouldn't get along with the militias in central Maryland or the main part of West Virginia, and let's not even talk about Pennsylvania! Then you'd have an African-American militia in the Baltimore-DC area, which probably would have a tense relationship with the African-American militia that controls most of greater Philly, and so on. <br><br>David, and the real campaign hasn't even begun. Definitely time to break out the popcorn!<br><br>Shane, the role of carpetbaggers varies from state to state. It's entirely possible that they played a significant role in Kentucky's decision to go with Lakeland -- but the close cultural connections you've described between Kentucky and southern parts of Ohio and Illinois will also have encouraged that, you know. As for smoking, cigar smoking has already begun to catch on among young, hip Freemasons -- yes, those do exist! -- so I think it may well be on the way back in. I still don't choose to include it in this work of fiction. <br><br>Whomever, I wonder if they'll look into how much money Russian business interests with close ties to the Kremlin, ah, "donated" to the Clinton Foundation.

There are some things that need to filter into people's consciousness - generally different things for different groups of people. If Trump manages to get people to take a good, hard look at what neo-liberal economics has done to the working class, then he'll have served a useful purpose. There are revelations coming out about Trump that will turn your stomach, at least if you haven't been paying attention to the more substantial part of the liberal press. For example, Trump and his companies have been blackballed by all of the American investment banks.

That's why I'm concerned about an Iraq-style breakdown in public order, in which every group ends up with its own heavily armed militia and the national government is basically beset from all sides. <br><br>Shane, yes, to my mind a lot of what's been happening in the sexual culture of the US over the last few decades has involved our transitioning to a post-Christian culture in which sex simply isn't the overwhelming moral and spiritual issue Christian theology makes it out to be. Once you get that ideology out of the way, sexual play becomes simply a matter of what two or more consenting adults enjoy doing with one another's bodies; the obsessive fixation on genital intercourse gives way to what that old moralist Freud called "polymorphous perversity," in which the entire body functions as an erogenous zone; and the taboo against same-sex relationships goes away in a hurry because, as you say, what gay men and lesbians do in bed can also be done, and is routinely done, by straight couples -- and their response to the taboo is increasingly "what's the big deal?"<br><br>With regard to Kentucky, I've never been there, so will withhold any kind of judgment. <br><br>Nestorian, I'm extremely suspicious of the claims that peak oil hasn't happened, as the definition of what counts as "conventional oil" has been reworked extensively to include things that didn't count as conventional oil before, and of course nobody's factoring in the energy cost of extraction! <br><br>Whomever, that's quite plausible.<br><br><a href=#c5165257436946003177 title="comment permalink">7/24/16, 9:43 PM</a><br><br>

A river, even without bridges, is not a significant obstacle to an army -- never has been, never will be -- and if the bridges are gone, that simply means you have no idea at all where the other side is going to throw a half dozen pontoon bridges across the river in the middle of the night and come surging across. <br><br>MawKernewek, thank you! I'll talk to the publisher and see what he says. <br><br>Nastarana, you'll be pleased to know that there are plenty of people in the Lakeland Republic who agree with you about promiscuity. Do you recall the woman who was taking the candidate's oath in the Capitol when Carr first got there, the one who ended the oath "So help me my Lord and Savior Jesus"? One of the reasons she's there is to make it clear that the Lakeland Republic makes room for a good deal of cultural, religious, and moral diversity, including the conservative Christian sort. As for the cynical view, er, you do recall that this is a utopian narrative, don't you? <br><br>Shane, I need a good recipe for crow.

Most have immigrated during the late 1980's to the late 1990's, which might be the reason they haven't had time to form gang ties.<br><br>My area also has almost no crime and is pretty well-to-do. Almost everybody here except the young people are Hillary Clinton supporters (because I probably am aasuming Clinton supporters are less violent than Trump supporters, then in turn assuming Asians are less violent because most of them support Clinton in this area).<br><br>In contrast, when I visit nearby poor cities like Trenton and some parts of Philadelphia, I see no Asians living there. This might be part of why I assumed Asians are the least violent race.<br><br>So I guess the Asian reaction to the coming crises will be more dependent on region and circumstance.<br><br>But you're right: I wrongly and conveniently assumed all U.S. Asians are much less violent than the other groups.

My point was not that mountaintop removal is good, heavens no, it's a tragedy. My point was that the mountains have had serious, intractable problems throughout the modern era, and that both industrialism and government intervention have exacted a terrible toll on their culture and land. My point was simply that these are not easy problems w/facile solutions, and it may not even be a problem, but a predicament. It's really one of true conservatism, "first, do no harm."--the harms done to Appalachia over the years are numerous and deep.<br>About the South, glad you asked! I'd say our flaws are our biggest assets! We've never been the "shining city on the hill", and we have tried as much as possible to be a big middle finger to that type of utopian idealism!

Pair bonding is one of thousands of the ways that life in its wondrous variety has invented. There are many others.<br><br>Pair bonding *isn't* marriage, marriage is a cultural hedge some human cultures, rooted in time and place, have set against certain non-pair-bonding biological tendencies our species has. If we were obligate pair-bonders, we would never have invented marriage. (Please note, this is not a claim that we can't comfortably pair-bond - lots of us do this, too - even very late in life and when no reproduction is involved).<br><br>Shane/Toomas, I grew up in Latin America, which is indeed very religious in the Catholic tradition, stitched through, perhaps with other influences. I would point out that marriage there was always a middle class institution - that is to say, marriage rates among poor people have always been low. Poorer people never found marriage to be a suitable fit for their circumstances, serial monogamy - with a woman being the mother of the children of several fathers - being much more common. Mothers and children form the central family unit, but this does not equate to the total absence of fathers. Fathers will attach themselves to a mother/child unit for a time, but this is less likely to be permanent, than it is for middle class fathers. Typically poor fathers form the closest bond with their own youngest child, however, step-fatherhood can be close, too, and often persists long after a step-father has left the step-child's household.<br><br>In my observation, people in such circumstances will readily claim that Catholic marriage is a wonderful thing, and how God meant things to be, and may even regularly and contritely confess their deviations from this ideal in order to participate fully in the beloved ritual of Catholic Mass, but they simply do not see it as a realistic prospect for themselves. The forms are observed to everyone's satisfaction so long as the pair currently involved with each other are currently faithful, but a woman is certainly not seen as "cheapened" by already being the mother of another man's child, or all these single mothers would be the mother of only one child. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c1969853164695480900 title="comment permalink">7/25/16, 3:48 AM</a><br><br>

As for coal, JMG has already covered the solution. Coal is mined because there is a demand for electricity. Reducing coal mining involves reducing the demand for coal, which comes from demand for electricity. If everyone, affluent salary class progressive environmentalists included, would cut their demand for electricity in half, then demand for coal would dry up and it would stop being mined.<br><br><a href=#c2813748166199152401 title="comment permalink">7/25/16, 6:39 AM</a><br><br>

Well the first half of that possibility has happened, over the latest leaked email flap among the Dems.

The Christian God I was taught about in Sunday school (this was a middle-of-the-road Methodist church) is both omniscient and omnipotent – and thus he would be perfectly capable of any of the creation myths - artificially aging the 4k year old universe, or creating it 15e9 years ago and waiting patiently while humankind worth saving develops from unicellular creatures, et al. But it occurred to me even when I was a kid that projecting habits of human thought to an omniscient being couldn’t be correct – a human-like psyche who can control the destiny of every mote in the universe must surely get terribly bored, and probably resort to mischief out of sheer ennui. I personally hope that God has a sense of humor, or I’m really in for it. <br><br>Cheers, B<br><br><a href=#c5865949375915972585 title="comment permalink">7/25/16, 8:09 AM</a><br><br>

I am someone who is generally copacetic to the actual messages you're arguing for, and I don't consider this instance to be an exception. But bearing in mind that Retrotopia is a literary attempt at persuasion-- not meant to preach to the choir, but to bring in new members-- I was attempting to read from the point of view of a believer in progress, and unfortunately I didn't find Carr's line of reasoning very convincing. I'd like to suggest you might consider strengthening it a bit when you do the final draft for the book version.<br><br>Here was my problem. Let us accept as valid, for now, the model of ever decreasing notional space in musical genres that Carr brings up. (I feel like Carr may have a different understanding of jazz than I do, but that's a different conversation.) Even assuming most readers take this much as reasonable, it seems rather too much to jump from "particular musical genres" to "all of technology", as Carr seems to do. To me, and I imagine to a hypothetical reader who is not already on the same page as you, this is just too big of a leap. Opera over the hill? Sure. Jazz is dead? Sure, I've heard that one before. But it's not as though Carr is suggesting that *all of music* or *all of art* has run out of its novel notional space. Thus it ends up seeming like a trick of rhetoric to compare relatively confined musical genre to the (seemingly) vast behemoth that is "technology".<br><br>I can think of a way you might get Carr there, still, even without getting into complicated questions of "technology toward what end?" and "progress for whom?" and all the rest of the necessary questions you've been considering on this blog for some time. You do have the following already: <br><br><i>"Nobody’s pushing brand new alphabets any more, because that notional space got filled in a long time ago. Nobody’s inventing new can openers or bathtubs, and nearly all of what passes for innovation these days in cars, say, is just gimmickry aimed at getting the clueless to shell out money."</i><br><br>But then you jump straight into <i>"I knew all that, but it never occurred to me that technological progress followed the same trajectory..."</i><br><br>In the midst of that, were Carr to consider the diminishing returns of various "shinier" technology suites-- metanet, robotic technologies, wonder drug health care, etc-- and try in vain to think of *even one* which is genuinely being innovative (as opposed to vaporware or "just around the corner") and helping more people than it ever used to -- I think then I could be convinced from there to the jump he makes to all of "technological progress".<br><br>Or, of course, you could really speed things up by just handing Carr a copy of "After Progress". ;-)<br><br>Thanks, as always, for the wonderful work you do!<br><br><a href=#c1995164200193608693 title="comment permalink">7/25/16, 9:56 AM</a><br><br>

After the infancy, a woman can do a lot of productive work, but a free male is probably essential. That is why a woman ought to have a committed male if she gets pregnant. If the woman comes home pregnant and the man absconds on her, it falls upon her father and her family to take on the support of the new generation with less than the ideal number of adults to do so.<br><br>I think that in our modern society we are very divorced from the world of nature and our dependence upon it, and the hard work it takes to extract a living from it. That is largely due to oil, and the technology it also produces. The real, hard work of extracting a living from nature is far away and out of sight of an office worker in a town or city.<br><br>Some people down the street.

If what I’m hearing has any validity at all, Trump is in Putin’s pocket for financial reasons. That doesn’t mean he’s wrong about everything, or for that matter very much. Here’s a summary of the evidence: http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2016/07/the_dnc_email_leaks_show_that_russia_is_trying_to_influence_the_u_s_election.html<br><br>What I’m moderately amazed by is that both candidates seem to have an “aura of unlikability” that’s causing otherwise rational people to invent reasons to dislike them. What’s weird is that both of them have a reputation from people that know them that they’re very likable people. Which is the opposite of Ted Cruz - he’s got a reputation of “to know him is to loathe him,” but that doesn’t translate to how people who don’t know him see him. This, from Slate, takes a look at that from Hillary’s perspective: http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/07/the_people_who_hate_hillary_clinton_the_most.html .

An isolationist foreign policy, which realistically will cause a currency collapse and the end of the American Empire is far preferable than trying to maintain the American Empire well past its expiry date.<br><br>As far as privileged assumptions, well, for a lot of Americans, Trump is their last try at ordinary politics, to borrow a phrase from Dear Blogger.<br><br>As for my take on it, well, Trump is going to put the patient on palliative care, and Hilary is going for one last round of radiation (possibly quite literally) and chemo.<br><br>I'm not sure if the DNC leak that shows the Clinton campaign essentially auctioning off political appointments (this is illegal, strangely enough) was what Assange claimed would get her arrested or not, but it's pretty damning and to watch the media circus go full steam ahead with #teamClinton and #literallyHitler is pretty nauseating.<br><br>However, here's one last tidbit.

So much of pop culture revolves around stories of adventures. I'm sure we can all name a dozen examples from the last century off the top of our heads. Even marketing has skewed towards adventure "narratives" in recent years. Professional climbers are in commercials for credit card companies now? The add agencies know these guys live out vans and eat oatmeal mixed with black beans for dinner, right?<br><br>But then again, the hero's journey is pretty universal, myths from traditions all over the world often involve traveling somewhere distant, so I don't think we can lay it all at western cultures feet. Maybe the desire to explore new spaces is part of innate human biology to, at least, some degree. <br><br>To further complicate it, we live in a time when fulfilling that desire is both easier than its ever been <i>and</i> more environmentally costly than its ever been, and its actually more difficult/expensive (in my experience at least) to use less ecologically damaging forms of transit. <br><br>@Shane<br><br>Thanks for your comments! Plenty to chew on there, and I remember you mentioning I'll Take My Stand in several posts over the past several months. I'll see if I can find a copy. <br><br>Your notion of the "New South" is something I hadn't heard of before. Is that explained in I'll Take My Stand or is that your own concoction? I'd like to hear more. When I think of the "Traditional South" all I conjure up is plantations, I guess prejudice is showing how little I know about the region.<br> <br><br>No argument here about why coal is mined. Its just unfortunate that the industry settled on a method that maximizes ecological damage and minimizes employment, taken together that practice is objectionable on all fronts. Guess that progress for ya!<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tony<br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c46154446563025460 title="comment permalink">7/25/16, 8:06 PM</a><br><br>

It's turning into an even bigger circus then the Republican convention.

Meanwhile, you've got Sanders supporters marching in the street shouting "Lock Her Up!" It's starting to look like a replay of the infamous Chicago Democratic convention of 1968.

It's the desperate attempt to get the last dregs of coal. As for "New South", you can look it up, it's a fairly common term. Think Atlanta or Charlotte, for example. New South is whereby the South "modernized" and "progressed"--plantations and farms were paved over &amp; developed into suburbia, wide interstates were built everywhere (Atlanta's traffic ties w/LA regularly now), factories built. I'll Take My Stand was written in the '30s, when the South was first starting to look at industrialization and "catching up", and was written as a warning against industrialization and for agrarianism. The South can roughly be divided among the Yeoman South (aka, "rednecks, hillbillies") small plot, poor farmers who had few or no slaves, and the Plantation South. Some states fall more or less into one category or the other (KY &amp; Tenn are mostly Yeoman South, although there are wealthy plantation regions in both) A rough divide between Yeoman &amp; Plantation South is whether they speak w/a twang (Yeoman) or a drawl (Plantation) LOL<br>It's interesting to think of the US as a Russian client state under Trump, but, as JMG has said, it's probably the course we should have been following all along, like Britain did the US.

Yes, Sanders got booed when he said he's supporting Hillary. That was mostly the California delegation; there are Sanders supporters all over, but most of them are keeping it cool. A media unit can do a heck of a lot of spin just by pointing a directional mic in different directions. And that quieted down later. Michelle Obama captivated the crowd and basically dominated the evening. Sanders gave a heavily expanded version of one of his stump speeches, mentioning Hillary frequently. That went down quite well. The evening ended on a much more thoughtful note. Not unity by any means, but not an open fight, either.<br><br>If you want a more balanced view, read one of the live blogs, not the media. There are a number of them, to taste. I followed 538 in between scenes of a new thriller I was reading, which is simply impossible if you're watching the coverage on the boob toob or the network news. 538 had four or five people on the floor and outside covering the demonstrations - which, by the way, got rained out.<br><br>What tomorrow will bring?<br><br><a href=#c7529151758313253639 title="comment permalink">7/26/16, 5:47 AM</a><br><br>

Gilgamesh might be a good starting point... just to see the way temple prostitutes were revered as important voices in the community, sex was seen as a civilizing force, and homosexual relations were an important and normal aspect of male bonding. Trust me, you'll be shocked... Even in our own time and culture, there are many different forms of family organization emerging out on the fringes that have found that having multiple family members of multiple genders in varying degrees of overlapping relationship with each other is an effective way to balance income earning, child-rearing, and household economy management through distribution across a household, which I've seen providing a sense of security and stability to many lower income families... especially those with marginalized gender identities and sexual orientations. They may or may not represent an emerging family structure that will eventually grow more common, but they've definitely hit upon a strategy that works, and it's a family model that reduces a lot of the worst burdens of declining standards of living in a similar manner to the multi-generational household model. There's really no reason from looking at the broad spectrum of human cultures to assume that the one man one woman 2.5 children nuclear family model is the only option, inherent in human nature, or even the best option for all circumstances and it really does seem like sexual mores are by and large culturally determined. Across human cultures family institutions can look pretty different from the sorts of institutions we're used to think about (look up the Mosuo culture of the Himalayas, for instance), and there are other cultures in which sexual and romantic relationships are a very separate concept from committed and familial relationships. Even in pre-modern Western History, sexual customs weren't actually all that different than they are now, they were just (usually, but definitely not always) wrapped much more tightly in euphemism than they are now.<br><br><a href=#c1366143329923249324 title="comment permalink">7/26/16, 8:20 AM</a><br><br>

I met my current husband when he was 42 and the biggest joke now at our house is "quit reading my mind!" We seem to be very much quantumly entangled. Most of my friends, however, don't seem to be that lucky with their later in life relationships. And even me, it was a way more a conscious decision. I no longer think of love as a warm fuzzy feeling, because let's face it, you just don't feel that way all the time. <br><br>Marriage, on the other hand, is a social contract for mutual support that may not have love as its prime ingredient. There are still plenty of arranged marriages or offers made through a matchmaker where you have barely met the person you marry, even in this day and age. They work most of the time because the marriage is seen in a bigger context as part of the extended family or community obligations. The western idea of romantic love as the only basis for marriage is a relatively recent thing, I believe. It's a cultural construct. But the fact that takes more than one adult (absent welfare) to care for and support children had not changed a bit, even if you can afford to hire that help with cash. Most women cannot. They need an extended support system of some sort. And when there's no artificial baby formula available or regular access to refrigeration etc then caring for babies (and the elderly, for that matter) is going to be a lot more old fashioned than free-ranging feminist.<br><br>Economically, it now takes 3 median adult incomes to pay the average household expenses. In other words, the Western idea that every unmarried woman can have her own home alone with her kids is probably not sustainable. Without either a de facto husband or female roommates to act as part of the social contact, there is little chance the average woman will be able to survive without welfare of a functioning industrial economy.<br><br><a href=#c2081405134134074898 title="comment permalink">7/26/16, 10:20 AM</a><br><br>

That all depends on having a culture with clear gender roles (to be clear I think gender roles are important, I am not arguing about what exactly they should be), and something productive that the average strong young man can do and feel satisfaction at. My first job, as a strong young man, was flipping burgers alongside old women, who could do the task even better than I could because they weren't as interested in flirting with the cute cashiers. This sort of job is in my mind, perverse, because instead of my older coworkers doing something that honors the social credit and experience of their five or six decades and myself doing something that better employed the drive and strength I had when I was 17, we both assembled burgers. The industrial model demands that available work can be done by as much of the population as possible, thereby reducing the value of work and increasing labor mobility. The loss of satisfaction in ones work, is of course, an externality.<br><br>Shane, sure, no doubt we're wired for promiscuity or serial monogamy. However there have also been explicitly monogamous cultures that predated industrialization, but mostly in the more northerly parts. I wonder if there's a correlation?<br><br>I've read that something like 80% of women reproduce, but only 40% of men. Maybe one reason why monogamous cultures have been so successful in the particular conditions that they are suited for is because most men are occupied raising their children and aren't causing trouble. Regarding industrialism, sure, that's a good example - men are motivated to work and not strike because most of them have children to feed. Compare that to cultures where some men multiple wives, and look at the social problems in those cultures.<br><br><a href=#c7964972379699460862 title="comment permalink">7/26/16, 6:45 PM</a><br><br>

Don't worry about it. My experience with Asian communities is very much a left coast thingl; in Seattle, where I grew up, the various Asian ethnicities make up a bigger part of the population than African Americans do -- 14% vs. 8% -- and there are big neighborhoods that are Asian majority, so it's a very different world. <br><br>Fred, I hope so. <br><br>Shane, heh. By all means feel free to cast your vote the other way in 2030! And yes, it takes a while for the changeover from one religious sensibility to another. Five centuries from now there will still be Old Believers for whom salvation as escape from the world of sorrow and sin still makes sense; there'll likely be a lot fewer of them, just as there are a lot fewer now than there were a century ago, but they'll still be around. <br><br>Brian, it's too late to throw Hillary under the bus -- they'll have to wait until the voters do that -- but yeah, it's making for a lively convention. <br><br>Quin, so noted, and I'll consider that. <br><br>David, now surprise me. The Clinton campaign is steaming full speed ahead toward an epic flustered cluck. When Clinton appointed Wasserman-Schultz honorary chair of her campaign and lined up a string of billionaires to give speeches at the convention, my reaction was, "Yes, I know she's clueless, but is she really <i>that</i> clueless?" The answer is apparently yes. <br><br>Kevin, we'll see. I'll certainly consider that. <br><br>Ed-M, many thanks! <br><br>Zach, thanks for clarifying -- I missed that implication. <br><br>Submarine, to my taste, the best history of the Civil War is Bruce Catton's three volume series, <i>The Coming Fury</i>, <i>Terrible Swift Sword</i>, and <i>Never Call Retreat</i>. It's got some degree of Northern bias, but Catton had ample respect for the courage and generalship of the South, and he sketches out the disagreements that drove the war in a nuanced manner; he's also very, very good at communicating the flavor of the time, and what it felt like to live through the runup to the war and then the war itself. <br><br>Jason, it's a source of wry amusement to me to watch media pundits (Hartmann among them) trying to come up with facile reasons to vote for Clinton that don't talk about Clinton's own record and stances, and engage in the most colorful sort of special pleading to do so. This notion that Trump will somehow stand aside and allow his impeachment insurance to run the country -- er, has Hartmann been sound asleep for the last two decades? Trump's got too much ego to do anything of the kind. <br><br>Fred, next time I'm in Philly I'll certainly see if I can visit a Wawa's.

By comparison, I read that poor women today cannot afford to marry the fathers of their children even if they want to. Not because of welfare rules but because the rate of unemployment and underemployment among men of that class is higher than the rate for women (who are more likely to obtain service jobs).

Fewer than that can be efficient but not powerful enough, and more than that presents an unacceptable cost to efficiency. My Baptist father actually uses this argument against me for only having 2 children!<br><br>I'll be 43 on Saturday, and my wife is a year older, so more children will not be forthcoming, but what we have done is combine forces with another family, in this case our family of 4 with a good friend's family of 4 (he's not married at the moment, but the right woman would make it at least 9 total and potentially add plenty to the matrix). In fact, if the 5-15 range took on the presumed standard bell-shaped curve, 9 or 10 members of the "family" seems pretty ideal. A wife for my friend with a useful skill set and a strong/bright child would be just about perfect.<br><br>Our shared property has two ample houses on it, side-by-side, one for each family, in a 5-acre cleared opening, surrounded by 70-ish acres of mesic forest, with several good quality springs forming a nice little creek along the southern property boundary. My role here is turning the 5-acre opening into a productive organic farm to feed both families. We put nearly 150 lbs of chicken in the freezer yesterday, and about 80 lbs of tomatoes are giving me the "wake up and get moving, mister" look from the kitchen as I type, so I think things are moving in a good direction!

They headed for the main media tent, where they’d have maximum media exposure. I’d have been surprised if something hadn’t happened - the stats say that about 10 to 20 % of Sanders supporters are not at all happy; the rest (80 to 90 %) are going to Hillary. Given the number of people at the convention, and the proportion that are Sanders supporters, 200 is around 10% of them. In other words, the really committed activists who are probably going to defect to the Green party anyway.<br><br>Likewise, the Dem convention is pretty open. While I have no idea what the acronym “BLM” (Bureau of Labor Management, perhaps?) stands for, I would expect demonstrations against Ms. Clinton at the Dem convention. She’s pretty roundly disliked in a lot of circles. What I’d be more struck by is if there weren’t any anti-Clinton demonstrations; that might suggest that something was suppressing them, like police in riot gear or something similar.<br><br>(By the way, calling BLM the Bureau of Labor Management was something of a joke - I’m quite well aware that Federal employees shouldn’t be giving overt partisan demonstrations.)<br><br>And while I don’t read the New York Times (I don’t have a subscription, and don’t want one) I do read the Atlantic. And the Guardian. And Slate. And Talking Points Memo. That list ought to give you my political sympathies. I reference 538 because they have a reputation to uphold for looking accurately at what’s actually happening. They mess up on occasion, like everyone else, and they certainly have their biases, but overall I find them a lot more balanced and neutral than most. Their live blog gives me an idea of what’s actually happening. The Guardian’s live blog? Pretty useless from my perspective.<br><br>And that ought to tell you another of my biases. I curate what I read rather ruthlessly to avoid sources that simply seem to be badly unbalanced or are broken records or too badly lost in their own echo chamber. Selective reporting of what furthers the source’s ideology is also right out.<br><br>What’s going to happen? It will probably shock you to know that I think both of them are going to win - and both of them are going to lose. In different parallel realities, of course. That’s part of my background with the Michael Teaching, which includes that concept. I’m much more interested in whether they manage to skate through the coming mess without triggering a civil war or a foreign war.<br><br><a href=#c1792734769687713139 title="comment permalink">7/27/16, 5:11 AM</a><br><br>

I won't take that as far as some people have to suggest that humans are innately monogamous, but there does seem to be at the very minimum in humans a biological link between sexual activity and bond formation. Beyond that, I think the diversity of sexual cultures across history, across the world, and across individuals seem to suggest that humans aren't any particular "way" sexually, the only unifying rule across our species is that sex in humans has a primarily social, rather reproductive function in humans, with those social bonds ranging from the casual to the familial and varying a great deal in intensity and significance depending on culture and personality.<br><br>@Zero: Exactly, there are definitely going to be some interesting shifts in the Western household in coming years...

No cop was dressed in military gear, no crowd control shields and no riot control vehicles. Their police presence is a complete 180 from what we saw at RNC.
