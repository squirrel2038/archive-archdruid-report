As I write these words, much of North America is sweltering under near-tropical heat and humidity. Parts of the Middle East have set all-time high temperatures for the Old World, coming within a few degrees of Death Valley’s global record. The melting of the Greenland ice cap has tripled in recent years, and reports from the arctic coast of Siberia describe vast swathes of tundra bubbling with methane as the permafrost underneath them melts in 80<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"'>°</span>F weather. Far to the south, seawater pours through the streets of Miami Beach whenever a high tide coincides with an onshore wind; the slowing of the Gulf Stream, as the ocean’s deep water circulation slows to a crawl, is causing seawater to pile up off the Atlantic coast of the US, amplifying the effect of sea level rise.<br>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All these things are harbingers of a profoundly troubled future. All of them were predicted, some in extensive detail, in the print and online literature of climate change activism over the last few decades. Not that long ago, huge protest marches and well-funded advocacy organizations demanded changes that would prevent these things<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>from happening, and politicians mouthed slogans about stopping global warming in its tracks. Somehow, though, the marchers went off to do something else with their spare time, the advocacy organizations ended up preaching to a dwindling choir, and the politicians started using other slogans to distract the electorate. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The last gasp of climate change activism, the COP-21 conference in Paris late last year, resulted in a toothless agreement that binds no nation anywhere on earth to cut back on the torrents of greenhouse gases they’re currently pumping into the atmosphere. The only commitments any nation was willing to make amounted to slowing, at some undetermined point in the future, the rate at which the production of greenhouse gas pollutants is <i>increasing</i>. In the real world, meanwhile, enough greenhouse gases have already been dumped into the atmosphere to send the world’s climate reeling; sharp cuts in greenhouse gas output, leading to zero net increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
and methane by 2050 or so, would still not have been enough to stop extensive flooding of coastal cities worldwide and drastic unpredictable changes in the rain belts that support agriculture and keep all seven billion of us alive. The outcome of COP-21 simply means that we’re speeding toward even more severe climatic disasters with the pedal pressed not quite all the way to the floor. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus it’s not inappropriate to ask what happened to all the apparent political momentum the climate change movement had ten or fifteen years ago, and why a movement so apparently well organized, well funded, and backed by so large a scientific consensus failed so completely. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In my experience, at least, if you raise this question among climate change activists, the answer you’ll get is that there was a well-funded campaign that deployed disinformation against them. So? Every movement for social change in human history has been confronted by well-funded vested interests that deployed disinformation against them. Consider the struggle for same-sex marriage, which triumped during the same years that saw climate change activism go down to defeat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The disinformation deployed against same-sex marriage was epic in its scale as well as its raw dishonesty—do you recall the claims that ministers would be forced to perform gay weddings, and that letting same-sex couples marry would cause society to fall apart?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I do—and yet the movement for same-sex marriage brushed that aside and achieved its goal. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Blaming the failure of climate change activism entirely on the opposition, in other words, is a copout. It’s also a way to avoid learning the lessons of failure—and here as elsewhere, those who ignore their history are condemned to repeat it. Other movements for social change faced comparable opposition and overcame it, while climate change activism failed to do so; that’s the difference that needs to be discussed, and it leads inexorably to a consideration of the mistakes that were made by the movement.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The most important mistakes, to my mind, are these: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
First, the climate change movement was largely led and directed by scientists, and as discussed here two weeks ago, <a href=../../2016/07/scientific-education-as-cause-of.html>people with a scientific education suck at politics</a>. Over and over again, the leaders of the climate change movement waved around their credentials and told everyone else what to do, in the fond delusion that that’s an adequate way to bring about political change. Not so; too many people outside the scientific community have watched scientific opinion whirl around like a weathercock on too many issues; too many products labeled safe and effective by qualified scientists have been put on the market, and then turned out to be ineffective and unsafe; too many people simply don’t trust the guys in the white lab coats any more—and some of them have valid reasons for that lack of trust. Thus a movement that based its entire political strategy on the prestige of science was hamstrung from the start. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Second, the climate change movement made the same mistake that the Remain side made in the recent Brexit vote in the UK, and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign seems to be making on this side of the pond: it formulated its campaign in purely negative terms. David Cameron failed because he couldn’t talk about anything except how dreadful it would be if Britain left the EU, and Clinton’s campaign is failing because her supporters can’t talk about anything but the awfulness of Donald Trump. In exactly the same way, the climate change movement spent all its time harping about the global catastrophes that were going to happen if they didn’t get their way, and never really got around to talking about anything else—and so it failed, too. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m not sure why this sort of strategy has become such a broken record in contemporary political life, because it simply doesn’t work. People have heard it so many times, if all you can talk about is how awful this or that or the other thing is, they will roll their eyes and walk away. To win their interest, their enthusiasm, and their votes, you have to offer them something to look forward to. That doesn’t mean you have to promise rainbows and jellybeans; you can promise them blood, toil, tears, and sweat; you can warn them of a long struggle ahead and call them to shared sacrifice, and they’ll eat it up—but there has to be a light at the end of the tunnel, something that doesn’t just amount to the indefinite continuation of a miserably unsatisfactory status quo. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The climate change movement never noticed that, and so people quickly got tired of the big bass drum going “doom, doom, doom,” all the time, and wandered away. It didn’t have to be like that; the climate change movement could have front-and-centered the vision of a grand new era of green industry, with millions of new working-class jobs blossoming as America leapt ahead of the oh-so-twentieth-century fossil-fueled economies of other nations, but it apparently never occurred to anyone to do that. Instead, the climate change movement did a really fine impression of a crowd of officious busybodies trotting out round after round of doleful jeremiads about the awful future that would swallow us up if we didn’t do what they said, and that did about as much good as it usually does.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Third, the climate change movement inflicted a disastrous own goal on itself by insisting that nobody with scientific credentials ever claimed that an ice age was imminent, when anybody over fifty whose memory is intact knows that that’s simply not true. Any of my readers who are minded to debate this point should get and read the following books from the 1970s and 1980s:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?isbn=9780670754250">The Weather Machine</a> by Nigel Calder, <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?isbn=9780226668123">After the Ice</a> by E.C. Pielou, and <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?isbn=9780809443284">Ice Ages</a> by Windsor Chorlton and the editors of Time Life Books. These were very popular in their time, and they’re all available on the used book market for a few bucks each, as the links I’ve just given demonstrate. Nigel Calder was a respected science writer; E.C. Pielou is still the doyenne of Canadian field ecologists, and the third book was part of Time Life Book’s <i>Planet Earth</i> series, each volume of which was supervised by scientific experts in the relevant fields. All three books discuss the coming of a new ice age as the most likely future state of Earth’s climate. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
While you’re at it, you might also pick up a couple of really good science fiction novels, <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?isbn=9780451070036">The Winter of the World</a> by Poul Anderson and <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?isbn=9780441811908">The Time of the Great Freeze</a> by Robert Silverberg. Anderson and Silverberg were major SF authors in the 1960s and 1970s, at a time when success in the genre depended on close attention to scientific fact, and both authors drew on what were then considered credible forecasts of an approaching ice age to ground their stories about the future. If you’re going to insist, along the lines of George Orwell’s <i>1984</i>, that Oceania has never been allied with Eurasia, you’d better make sure that nobody’s in a position to check. If they can, and they discover that you’re lying, your chance to convince them to trust you about anything else has just gone out the window once and for all. That’s how a great many people responded to the climate change movement’s attempt to rewrite history and erase the ice age scare of the 1970s and 1980s. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Every time I’ve brought up this issue among climate change activists, they’ve responded by insisting that I must be a climate change denialist. That’s the fourth factor that’s contributed mightily to the crumpling of the climate change movement: the rise within that movement of a culture of intolerance in which dissent is demonized and asking questions about tactics and strategy is equated with disloyalty. I’m thinking here especially, though not only, of an embarrassing screed by climate change activist Naomi Oreskes, which insisted with a straight face that asking questions about whether renewables can replace fossil fuels is <a href=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/16/new-form-climate-denialism-dont-celebrate-yet-cop-21>“a new form of climate denialism”</a>. As it happens, there are serious practical questions about whether anything—renewable or otherwise—can replace fossil fuels and still allow the inmates of today’s industrial societies to maintain their current lifestyles, but Oreskes doesn’t want to hear it: for her, loyalty to the cause demands blindness to the facts. As a way to alienate potential allies and drive away existing supporters, that attitude’s hard to beat. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Stunning political na<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">ï</span>vet<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">é, a purely negative campaign, a disastrous own goal through a constantly repeated and easily detected falsehood, and an internal culture of intolerance and demonization: those four factors would have been a heavy burden for any movement for social change, and any two of them would most likely have caused the failure of climate change activism all by themselves. There was, however, another factor at work, and to my mind it was the most important of all. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">To understand that fifth factor, it’s useful to return to a distinction I made here two weeks ago between facts, values, and interests. Facts are simply statements of what happened, what’s happening, and what will happen given X set of conditions—the things, in other words, that science is supposed to be about. Whether or not anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are causing the global climate to spin out of control, whether or not books published in the 1970s and 1980s by reputable scientists and science writers predicted a coming ice age, whether or not the project of replacing fossil fuels with renewable resources faces serious difficulties—these are questions of fact. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">Facts by themselves simply state a case. Values determine what we should do about them. Consider the factual statement “unrestricted greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for an ongoing increase in weather-related disasters.” If the rate of weather-related disasters doesn’t concern you, that fact doesn’t require any action from you; it’s when you factor in “weather-related disasters ought to be minimized where possible,” which is a value judgment, that you can go on to “therefore we should cut greenhouse gas emissions.” Not all value judgments are as uncontroversial as the one just named, but we can let that pass for now, because it’s the third element that’s at issue in the present case. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">Beyond facts and values are interests: who benefits and who loses from any given public policy. If, let’s say, we decide that greenhouse gas emissions should be cut, the next step takes us squarely into the realm of interests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Whose pocketbook gets raided to pay for the cuts? Whose lifestyle choices are inconvenienced by them? Whose jobs are eliminated because of them? The climate change movement has by and large treated these as irrelevant details, but they’re nothing of the kind. Politics is always about interests. If you want your facts to be accepted and your values taken seriously, you need to be able to respond to people’s interests—to offer an arrangement whereby everybody gets something they need out of the deal, and no one side has to carry all the costs. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">That, in turn, is exactly what the climate change movement has never gotten around to doing. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">I’d like to suggest a thought experiment here, to show just how the costs and benefits offered by the climate change movement stacked up. Let’s imagine, for a moment, that there’s an industry in today’s industrial nations that churns out colossal amounts of greenhouse gases every single day. It doesn’t produce anything necessary for human life or well-being; it’s simply a convenience, and one that, not that many decades ago, most people in the industrial world did without and never thought they’d need. If it were to be shut down, sure, a certain number of people would lose their jobs, but most of the steps that have been urged by climate change activists would have that effect; other than that, and a certain amount of inconvenience for its current users, the only result would be a sharp decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide and certain other greenhouse gases being dumped into the atmosphere. That being the case, shouldn’t climate change activists get to work right now to shut down that industry, and shouldn’t they start off by boycotting it themselves? </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">The industry in question actually exists. It’s the commercial air travel industry. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">You may have noticed, dear reader, that nobody in the climate change movement has been out there protesting commercial air travel, and precious few of them are even willing to cut back on their flying time, even though commercial air travel a massive contributor to the problems the movement claims to be fighting. I know of two scientists researching climate change who have pointed out that there’s something just a little bit hypocritical about flying all over the world on jetliners to attend conferences discussing how we all have to decrease our carbon footprint! Their colleagues, needless to say, haven’t listened. Neither has the rest of the climate change movement; like Al Gore, who might as well be their poster child, they keep on racking up their frequent flyer miles. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">On the other hand, climate change activists are eager to shut down coal mining. What’s the most significant difference between coal mining and commercial air travel? Coal mining provides wages for the working poor; commercial air travel provides amenities for the affluent. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">The difference isn’t accidental, either. Across the board, the climate change movement has pushed for changes that will penalize people in what I’ve called the wage class, the majority of Americans who depend on an hourly wage for their income. The movement has gone out of its way to avoid pushing for changes that will penalize people in what I’ve called the salary class, the affluent minority of Americans who bring home a monthly salary. That isn’t a minor point. There’s the hard fact that, on average, the more money you make, the bigger your carbon footprint is—but there’s also a political issue, and it goes to the heart of the failure of the climate change movement. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">I’ve had any number of well-meaning climate change activists ask me, in tones of baffled despair, why they can’t get ordinary Americans to take climate change seriously. My answer is not one they want to hear, because I tell them that it’s because well-meaning climate change activists don’t take climate change seriously. If you don’t care enough about the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere to accept some inconveniences to your own lifestyle, how much do you actually care about it? That’s the kind of logic that ordinary Americans use all the time to judge whether someone is serious about a cause or simply grandstanding, and by and large, climate change activism fails that sniff test.
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">Ordinary Americans, furthermore, are all too used to seeing grandiose rhetoric deployed by the affluent to load yet another round of burdens onto ordinary Americans. It’s not the affluent, after all, who have been inconvenienced by the last thirty years of environmental regulations, trade treaties, or what have you. To wage class Americans, anthropogenic climate change is just more of the same, another excuse to take jobs away from the working poor while sedulously avoiding anything that would inconvenience the middle and upper middle classes. The only way climate change activists could have evaded that response from wage class Americans would have been to demonstrate that they were willing to carry some of the costs themselves—and that was exactly what they weren’t willing to do. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">The bitter irony in all this, of course, is that the climate change movement was right about two very important things all along: treating the atmosphere as a gaseous sewer in which to dump wastes from our smokestacks and tailpipes was a really dumb idea, and the blowback from that idiocy is going to cost us—all of us—in blood. Right now all three of the earth’s major ice caps—the Greenland, West Antarctic, and East Antarctic ice sheets—have tipped over into instability; climate belts are lurching drunkenly north and south, putting agriculture at risk in far more places than a crowded, hungry planet can afford; drought-kindled wildfires in the American and Canadian west and in Siberia are burning out of control...and unless something significant changes, it’s just going to keep on getting worse, year after year, decade after decade, until every coastal city on the planet is under water, the western half of North America is as dry as the Sahara, glaciers and snowfall are distant memories, and famine, war, and disease have left the human population of the planet a good deal smaller than it is today. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">That didn’t have to happen. It might still be possible to avoid the worst of it, if enough people who are concerned about climate change stop pretending that their own lifestyles aren’t part of the problem, stop saying “personal change isn’t enough” and pretending that this means personal change isn’t necessary, stop trying to push all the costs of change onto people who’ve taken it in the teeth for decades already, and show the only kind of leadership that actually counts—yes, that’s leadership by example. It would probably help, too, if they stopped leaning so hard on the broken prestige of science, found a positive vision of the future to talk about now and then, backed away from trying to rewrite the recent past, and dropped the habit of demonizing honest disagreement. Still, to my mind, the crucial thing is that the affluent liberals who dominate the climate change movement are going to have to demonstrate that they’re willing to take one for the team. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">Will they? I’d love to be proved wrong, but I doubt it—and in that case we’re in for a very rough road in the centuries ahead. </span></div>

(As usual)<br><br>A couple of points:<br><br>-There are really serious questions about whether it will EVER be possible to construct a radical political coalition around "Environmental" issues. Humans are not wired to self-organize around carbon particles per million. So many apparently smart and well meaning people have devoted so much time and energy to this project, that I tend to suspect it failed because it is a political dead end that leads nowhere.<br><br>-I have been a radical environmentalist since the Reagan era, and in that time I have been exposed to more doomsday theories than I can count. The American environmental movement has produced is a vast literature of impending doomsday going back to the sixties and before. Most of it is extremely embarrassing at this point, but everyone who was skeptical about it at the time was treated to exactly the same moral and intellectual arrogance that is now on display in the "Climate Change" movement.<br><br>-Every previous prediction of immanent doom turned out to be wrong, and now you have a terminal credibility problem even with people (like myself) who are already convinced that consumerist civilization is fundamentally incompatible with the survival of the natural world.<br><br>-The primary strategy for dealing with this credibility problem has been to demonize anyone who doesn't agree with you as a holocaust denier or a retarded cretin.

Nailed it! As usual.<br><br>Wild-fires here in Dubois WY. We are 10 miles from the flames, not yet, but presumably soon to be put on "Set", (then "Ready", then "Go" for evacuation). 950 people already evacuated, unknown number of livestock evacuated, Red Cross shelters set up at the local high school, 11,000 acres lost so far. 750 firefighters, helicopters, 747 jets dropping fire retardant mass coordination on the State level and as of yet, no containment. The air is thick with wood smoke, stinging my eyes and making it a bit hard to breathe.<br><br>It's being called a natural progression or cycle, the rejuvenation of the forests: Dried out timber burning to clear out for new growth - just not on human-pleasing timescales. In fact, We've seen this coming for decades: Winters for the past few decades have not gotten cold enough for long enough to kill the pine beetles, resulting in more and growing swaths of dead trees, not to mention lack of pine nuts, (the grizzly bears' favourite food), so not enough for them to eat, and therefore more grizzlies coming down into towns, ranches and campsites to forage and more grizzly (pun intended) deaths, (to tourists and bears alike.)<br><br>Perhaps this is #6: Fires like this ARE in fact a natural occurance. The forests DO rejuvenate this way, but Climate Change in the form of slightly warmer winters has made the dried dead zone of trees far bigger than it would normally be. One argument from the anti-climate change camp I've heard &amp; read over and over again is that the weather disruptions we are experiencing are just unfortunate examples of nature's cycles. Sunspots, forest rejuvenation, etc. nothing we did and nothing we can do about it. In such exchanges, Climate Change Activists have usually denied these claims at all. From both sides there seems to be a need for it to be one or the other - proving me right / you wrong, or vice versa.

A poetic post-mortem that breaks it down into digestible pieces and puts them all together. Beautifully summarized.<br><br>Timely, too. I won't hijack the forum with a Microsoft rant but shall we just say that after my driving 4 hours round trip yesterday through a dangerous city in dangerously hot temperatures to avail myself of an advertised, free, and for several reasons mandatory service, I realized that a personal web device is no longer worth the trouble. And when I decide a thing ain't fun no more, it stops.<br><br>I don't intend to get offline completely, but will use public computers every couple of days. No smart phone, no laptop, no tablet, nothing. I figure even one less "device" in the world is a good thing, just like one car off the road. But my practical and selfish reason is it's just too hard and taking too much of my time on Earth to keep up with MS's ever-changing software, each version as bad as the last, making it their customers' problem to keep "upgraded", hiring beautiful young people with big friendly smiles and the inability to check the properties of a hard disk to staff their help desks at the mall. They have machines now that recognize a fingerprint as authorization instead of a password, but that same machine will allow a virus that was known of 4 years ago to take over the operating system from online. This is Progress. Or is it a Wealth Pump?<br><br>It's more than frustration and expense, though. I don't know if I can put it into words, but it's become a matter of personal pride in the way in which I conduct my life. I want to stop rewarding people who churn out cheap, flawed, dangerous garbage which, even more than air travel, uses scarce resources for a luxury.<br><br>I've said that before, but this time I feel as if I have some big decisions to make about the direction I go for the next part of my life. I'm scared. It is an addiction. When I thought I'd lose my connection, my sleep patterns got disrupted and it was as if a huge gray boulder were in the room when I woke up, because I had to do battle with MS again today. Then I decided to change my perspective and pretend I'd already been offline for 6 months. What would I be doing right now? I'd be wandering around in my pasture looking for wild animals or anything else interesting, that's what. So, I went and did that - and found myself smiling for the first time that day.<br><br><a href=#c8583555020537295786 title="comment permalink">7/27/16, 4:09 PM</a><br><br>

Instead, we are told, action must come primarily through legislation and regulation. The fact that the costs of said legislation and regulation burden developing countries (and the poor of this country) while not so much as even inconveniencing the affluent of this country is not something a polite person is supposed to notice. "Those people will just have to make do with less so I can maintain my opulent lifestyle." Yeah, I'm sure that attitude will change lots of hearts and minds.<br><br>If I say I believe my house is burning down and I will die if I don't leave the house right now, but then I sit down on the sofa and turn on the TV, apparently settling in for a night of brain-rotting boobtube, do I really believe my house is burning down? Lots of people wonder why "the right" simply does not believe the "consensus of experts" in regards to anthropogenic climate change. This is not too hard to figure out. They don't believe it because so many on "the left" plainly don't believe it either. Certainly Al Gore doesn't. Why should anyone take anything he says seriously?<br><br>Of course I know the messenger's character has nothing to do with the validity of the message, etc. At the same time, it is a natural human reaction to look at someone whose hypocrisy is in full view and say, "well, clearly he doesn't believe a word of that sermon he's preaching, so why should I?"<br><br><a href=#c5354530633749484200 title="comment permalink">7/27/16, 4:11 PM</a><br><br>

I wonder if a spiritual element could have transformed the sacrifice into something more palatable? Successful activism in the recent past, i.e. anti-draft Vietnam protest, civil rights and same-sex marriage, was driven by the possibility of improvement in life-quality for the activists involved, while climate change activists (if honest) needed to argue for something less palatable: suffer discomfort and inconvenience now, or we and future generations will suffer a lot more in the future: a hard sell both to oneself and to the rest of the world. <br><br>Not sure how many movements have succeeded on those terms: maybe Communism sort of fits the bill - the architects were middle class people who seemed willing to embrace suffering and loss of position in order to speed up an inevitable transition to a new society and minimise war and chaos... Are there lessons from that type of movement? I have certainly read people who described Communism in terms of Christianities Holy Trinity - maybe there was a compelling way to latch climate change activism onto such pre-existing paradigms?<br><br><a href=#c7224274370477012397 title="comment permalink">7/27/16, 4:19 PM</a><br><br>

Yesterday I had the opportunity to see an early screening of the film <a href=http://theageofconsequences.com/ rel=nofollow>The Age of Consequences</a> here in Melbourne. I think it was a good film. Probably one of the best in the genre. They cleverly chose to go with the US military angle and focused on increase of global instability with the hope of appealing to a more right of centre audience. <br>The majority of the film consists of striking visuals from around the world with snippets of interviews from mostly retired military leaders. While the film was mostly negative it did end with the obligatory fly-over shot of a field of wind turbines and solar panels. <br>Afterwards the lights went on, people took out their smartphones, checked for any important messages they might have missed and life went on. I found the silence with regard to taking personal action deafening. During the panel discussion one of the panelists implored that we needed to do three things as soon as possible. Firstly we need to stop all greenhouse emissions tomorrow. Secondly, we need to remove excess C02 from the atmosphere (how this was to be achieved was not mentioned but it was stated that natural methods would take too long). Thirdly we need to look at controlling solar reflection which I assume is a code word for geo-engineering.<br>I was wondering how many of the people around me would have been willing to make sacrifices to their own lives in order to try and mitigate the unfolding effects of climate change that was being portrayed on screen. <br>One of the questions from an audience member at the end was how soon he could get a link for the film to send to his Facebook friends, which constitutes the full breadth of activism from most people. <br>I have to agree with you that I would love to be proven wrong but I won’t be holding my breath. <br><br>#############################<br><br>The next meeting of the Green Wizard's Association of Melbourne will be held this Saturday.

You know, when I was young marketing people used to say, don't talk about the oppositions products because that is what the public will hear. That fixation on negative outcomes leads people to consider that the promoted negative outcomes are inevitable. I mean look at Brexit. Oh, it will be so awful leaving the Euro. What do people hear: Leave the Euro.<br><br>I thought that they were smarter than that. It is very basic marketing.<br><br>What do you mean that Oceania has never been allied with Eurasia? Look, I don't want you to be thought of as an alliance denier, but Big Brother said... :-)! Hehe!!!<br><br>The last person I spoke with at Greenpeace, when I pointed out that none of this stuff all around us was sustainable in the long term said to me: I feel sorry for you dude. Well, I was pretty offended to say the least.<br><br>Naomi Oreskes is just wrong. Renewables will supplement the decline in the availability of fossil fuels, but they will never replace them in a like for like comparison as they are different. I've done the experiment and the results are not encouraging. They're good, but not a replacement. Of course, renewables is what our species will end up using in the long term, but it won't look like renewables today. It will be more like renewable energy in the 18th century (wind mills, water mills, wood, charcoal, sunlight collected by plants). Of course, electricity is out of the bag now and simple items and simple generators are exactly that, simple. They'll be around, no doubts about it and it was very nice of our ancestors to dig up and refine all those rare Earth materials. Just sayin...<br><br>It is a very difficult proposition to maintain credibility on the issue of global warming and travel. It is not impossible, but very difficult. People as a general rule aren't stupid and they have a very good radar for detecting hypocrisy. And that whole issue as you rightly pointed out offends peoples sensibilities and sense of entitlement.

I didn't find your essay today dismal at all. In fact, I see the many issues that you have discussed as more of an inevitability rather than a choice thing for humanity. That may get some people pretty angry, but from my perspective, once we started burning coal all those years ago, we were done for. It is like a giant test really. We've got this super duper energy source and can we set hard limits on its use and our relationship to it? Probably not. Life is like that as you are well aware. Because I grew up largely unsupervised, nobody got around to telling me that I was meant to expect limitlessness!!! It is kind of funny but true.<br><br>And the pay back for people throwing their support behind the burn, baby, burn, fossil fuel inferno is quite good (excuse my little 70's disco pun!). Marketers would describe that pay back as the: unique selling proposition. I once heard a young lady candidly saying that what she was looking for in a guy were three things: House; Job; and car. And therein is the pay back and of course that leads to the unstated promise of enjoying a family in security. That is why people get so fearful when they feel that their security is threatened... <br><br>On the other hand, nobody told me that those things were desirable, and I must say that I found working at the top end of town in a corporate gig for many long years to be mind bendingly dull. Life doesn't have to be that way, and I am having more fun now than I ever had before. Is it tough and challenging and impose serious limitations on my choices? And is it risky? Yeah, you bet, but I've seen worse, far worse and I can tell you what dismal actually is and wondering when your head is going to be next on the corporate chopping block is far worse and probably far more inevitable.

I like to shock people by telling them that I loathe driving, not only the action, which is boring, tiring and repetitive, but also the idea of personal transport, which I strongly believe is ecologically immoral. Almost every instance I've been shouted down as a Luddite.<br><br>Another great example: in the consultancy I worked at over the winter break, half our team (high earning executives) flew to Canberra from Melbourne or Sydney for four days a week. All of them are so called 'intellectual' and 'educated' types, yet I heard them boast that 'flying is like taking a train earlier'. Of course, I could've asked them why they didn't just take the train (in the case of Sydney, the airport transit makes the travel time almost the same) or even better, temporarily relocate? If they cared about spending time with their children, how about they worry about their children's future too?<br><br>Of course, there's no direct train between the capital city of Australia (Canberra) and the second largest city (Melbourne). Such us the abject state of infrastructure here, which makes Sydney to Melbourne the second busiest air route in the world.<br><br>If all of us middle-class types want the government to do something about climate change, we should advocate for crippling taxes on driving (at least in cities) and flying, with the money to be put towards public transport, like Singapore does. Of course nobody does that, because the middle-class psyche in the western world is hollow and hypocritical.<br><br>YCS<br><br><a href=#c4469972188753044163 title="comment permalink">7/27/16, 4:43 PM</a><br><br>

It is much more difficult to travel without airplanes, not just because the travel itself is harder, but in many cases the alternative has been discontinued.<br><br>I already refuse to drive and the effect it has on people seems quite extreme. While it does restrict my lifestyle, it also saves me money, is good for the environment and my health, and is my choice. I've looked at the trade offs and decided not driving makes the most sense.

A lot of my sample of average Angelinos will talk about the water restrictions (they are a fact of life now) but no one ever so much as makes a passing mention of the ongoing drought. 90+ degree heatwaves consistently continue to daze and confuse, even though a dozen weeks a year are now heatwaves. Rolling blackouts and brownouts are also a fact of life in the summer, but no one makes the connection between them and air conditioning use.

Nobody has anything to say when it's suggested that this is what global warming looks like in action, as though it never occurred to them that anything would happen here, or -anywhere-, really, in any concrete sense. In a way, I think there hasn't been enough doom and gloom; or at least, the right kind. So far scientists and the activists parroting their talking points have been really good at talking about big picture repercussions, because those are generally safer.

All through human history, most people have mostly been concerned with how they were going to get food and housing, and yet that didn't prevent the building of the medieval cathedrals, or thousands of other situations in which people decided to put something else ahead of their immediate day to day concerns. The fact of the matter is that climate change advocates presented their case in a way that failed to appeal to anyone outside their own ranks. That's not a problem with the issue; it's a problem with the movement. <br><br>Bill, and that's also a reasonable choice. I happen to have enough of a public voice that I can push for something a little more proactive, but different choices go with different situations. <br><br>4threvolutionarywar, when you say "humans are not wired to self-organize around carbon particles per million," you've missed the point. Human beings are wired to self-organize around survival and the betterment of their offspring, and if you present the current environmental situation in terms that convince them that that's what's at issue, you get things like the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act. Again, it's a matter of strategy, not a problem with the issue! <br><br>Leo, thanks for the suggestion -- I'll check it out. <br><br>Caryn, exactly. Does climate change naturally? Of course -- and that makes it all the more stupid for us to pile anthropogenic climate change on top of naturally occurring climate cycles.

Their colleagues treat them as freaks. By the way, you don't have to put a comment through five times; once is usually enough. <br><br>John, no argument there. Once the environment got defined as a Democrat issue -- even though most of the major environmental reforms from the 19th century until 1980 went through under GOP presidents! -- the GOP has reacted reflexively against anything green. That's one of many things that has to change.<br><br>Cacaogecko, I'd be happy just to see them turn down the a/c and take public transit on occasion!<br><br>M Smith, excellent.

The character of the messenger may not have anything to do with the validity of the message, but if you have no independent way of verifying the truth of the message, watching the messenger for signs of dishonesty and grandstanding is generally the best option for figuring out whether to trust the message.<br><br>David, you're welcome. <br><br>Bozack, it's simply not true that "hard work now for a better tomorrow" is a hard sell. When Winston Churchill told Britons he had nothing to offer them but blood, toil, tears, and sweat, they cheered themselves hoarse and threw their energies into the task of survival.

I think you are mistaken that the positive point regarding a new green economy was not made. It was made and it scared the pants off the powerful vested fossil fuel interests. When you have only one positive spin and it flies in the face of the power structure, you are in trouble. To a certain extent all americans are "powerful vested interests" in that none of us was willing to get out of our cars, rebuild our walkable cities etc. There was just too much sunk capital in the suburban project to coin a phrase of JHK. Heck most of us were in debt up to our eyeballs and had 30 year mortgages to pay on a suburban house by the time the scientists ever bothered to even tell us about global warming. I really did not hear much about it until the 1990's. The message also suffered from the apparent morning in america that occurred when Reagan and Thatcher seemingly "fixed" the dire problem of imminent peak oil that Jimmy Carter had introduced us to in the 1970's. We all figured that this was just another false alarm. I think the problem goes much deeper than messaging and examples. I don't think Jesus could have convinced us that climate change was important when we needed to believe it. Now we are starting to believe it but most of us are just too busy trying to keep our bills paid in this economy to worry enough about it. We are sure that if we stop paying our mortgage we will end up in the cold this winter whether the climate is warming or not.<br><br><a href=#c7330784308763775149 title="comment permalink">7/27/16, 7:29 PM</a><br><br>

It's that sort of reaction that has convinced me we have basically nothing to hope for from the supposedly progressive left. <br><br>Cherokee, yes, it is very basic marketing, isn't it? I'm still trying to figure out why that never seems to sink in. <br><br>Jim, stop. Stop right there. What obvious solution aren't you considering? I'll give you a hint: we can USE LESS ENERGY. No law of nature requires us to maintain the absurdly extravagant lifestyles those of us in the developed world have these days...and yet people act as though that's one of those unspeakable words that causes your face to melt off if you utter it. No proposed solution to climate change is serious unless it involves using much less energy, and much less of the products of energy. Period. <br><br>Cherokee continued, I somehow managed to grow up in a middle class suburban family and come to the conclusion that being a middle class suburbanite was, for me, a pretty good equivalent of being fried on a grill in the fifth or sixth circle of Hell. I wouldn't take that kind of lifestyle, or the kind of a career necessary to pay for it, if it was handed to me on a golden platter which I then got to sell for cash. So I'm definitely with you there!<br><br>Shane, once or twice, you have triggered something, but this time I'd already settled on the theme of this week's post when I'd finished the one two weeks ago. You may just be tuning in to my mind or something. ;-)<br><br>YCS, oh, I know. Here in the north central Appalachians, enough people can't afford to drive that I'm not that much of an oddity, but when I lived on the left coast the thought that I didn't own a car or have a driver's license made people either treat me as though I'd sprouted an extra head, or get really offended because my lifestyle choices made theirs look shallow and selfish. <br><br>Jim, many thanks for this -- I'll read it when time permits. <br><br>WB, may I make a suggestion? Don't tell anyone that you've decided not to fly any more. Just don't do it. Come up with an ostensible reason to take the train -- the scenery's so beautiful, it's so nice to be able to get up and stretch your legs, you get lots of work done on the train, blah blah blah. The fact that all of those are true makes the dodge easy to pull off. Doing it that way also makes it a little seductive -- other people, hearing of this, may be tempted to take the train themselves...<br><br>Jon, thank you. <br><br>Sinnycool, that's a copout. All of humanity doesn't have to get behind it -- it would be enough if a large number of us who live in the world's industrial nations were to back the necessary changes using the political machinery that's already there to allow collective decisions to be made. To my mind, all these arguments about why a constructive response to climate change is impossible sound very much like attempts to avoid taking responsibility for the impact of one's own lifestyle on a fragile planet. <br><br>Tidlösa, no, I'm not watching the DNC. (Off-topic note -- back in the day, when the editor of a science fiction magazine wrote "DNC" on the margins of your story before sending it back to you, that meant "does not convince.") If I wanted to watch a clown show I'd go to the circus. <br><br>Jim, and by then it'll be too late to do anything that matters. That being the case, it seems sensible to me to try to change the dialogue while there still might be time, remembering the old rule of strategy that says that any positive action is better than doing nothing at all.<br><br><a href=#c4394791175949316636 title="comment permalink">7/27/16, 7:41 PM</a><br><br>

It really isn't that expensive to buy a book now and then, you know, and that's what allows authors to pay their bills and still spend their time writing. <br><br>Zerowaste, in my experience, when that happens, everyone knows what the score is and is desperately trying not to think about it. California is screwed, blued, and tattooed in a future of climate change, and I think a lot of people are aware of it. <br><br>LatheChuck, nice. That's just it -- Christianity, if you take it at all seriously, has plenty of tools for thinking constructively about our situation; so do other religions -- and so does rationalism. It's just that so many people are committed to not thinking constructively about it!<br><br>Repent, well, I'll hope you're right and enough people are grappling with these things to make a difference. <br><br>Cortes, thanks for the link! <br><br>JacGolf, yep.

If everyone named Angie Palmer will please adopt that attitude, we'll have taken a step in the right direction. <br><br>Anthony, but that wasn't my point. My point is that to the affluent, the coal industry doesn't matter, because eliminating it causes them no inconvenience. The airline industry? They don't care in the least how many jobs it produces -- they want it because it provides them with amenities. <br><br>Leon, yes, I figured I'd get some of this sort of obfuscation. There's ample evidence -- a little of which was cited in my post -- that global climate really is tipping out of balance, and one set of reported observations on one Florida farm (which, let it be noted, I have no way to check) does not outweigh the ongoing collapse of the Greenland ice sheet, say, or the fact that each of the last fourteen months has been the hottest such month ever recorded. <br><br>Bob, well, I'd say give it your best try, then. What I've seen of permaculture so far has been a very mixed bag, but if it works for you, by all means. <br><br>Submarine, I hope nobody flicks a lighter while that demonstration is taking place...<br><br>Christopher, oh, I don't know. I'm rather fond of ice ages, all things considered. <br><br>MC_Farmer, the thing is, that isn't the only possible positive spin, and it doesn't have to be presented in the terms you've described. What I saw was that talk about the green economy was always a sideline, and yelling about the horrors of the future was front and center. I may do a post one of these days talking about all the different ways that a positive spin could be put on the necessary changes -- it won't be one of my shorter posts, either. <br><br>Tabatha, if local food is your issue, get out there and work on it. One thing, though -- if all you have to offer is outrage, people will ignore you, for reasons discussed in my post. How can you make local food, appropriate to your own ecological region, appealing? How can you make people <i>want</i> that? Figure that out, and you'll get somewhere. <br><br>Ian, all you have to do is change the tax codes so that automating a job away is prohibitively expensive for business, while hiring a human being to do something is more cost effective, and the unemployment problem will be solved at once.

I got sucked down that rabbit hole for a short while and then the rabbit hole ejected me unceremoniously into the bright light of day and I had to take a hard clear eyed view of the world around me. One of the things that worries me about such a system like this one is that if you tolerate that being done to other people and join in to that system, then you never quite know when your lucky numbers are going to turn up and that always worries me. I've seen that in action in both small and large groups.

I have been wondering of late whether the powers that be in those campaigns just aren't listening or maybe they believe their own hype. Dunno. It is weird though.<br><br>But then I guess, any other selling strategy means that the Clinton campaign would have to come up with their own unique selling proposition, and that is a complex matter which they are doing their utmost best to avoid. <br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c944156409792045726 title="comment permalink">7/27/16, 8:19 PM</a><br><br>

Considering how important a topic this is, I'm amazed it's taken you over a decade to write about it, but well, here we are. Your observations square pretty nicely with mine. The popularly suggested initiatives to Save the Planet(tm) seem to come in two forms: pour money into renewable energy and then promise to change once renewables become cheaper than fossil fuels, or to put prices on the consumption of fossil fuels (who these prices are paid to and what they buy is a perfectly valid question the right has).<br><br>The problem with a carbon tax is that it doesn't affect people who can pay easily pay it, and because of the degree to which the products that salary class types buy so much of come from outside North America, the massive carbon footprint associated with those activities isn't captured. I don't think the Canadian government is going to have much luck imposing a carbon tax on salmon farms in Chile or electronics manufacturers in China. Carbon taxes, everywhere, really outside the leftist green parts of politics, are implicitly a problem for 'the little people'. I'm sure not a few members of the high chattering classes realize that if they had a way to impose such conditions, they could probably keep the private jets flying and the palaces in the desert cool for another 300 years if they could keep the support system for those activities running. The idea that they will succeed in such an endeavor is of course laughable. On the other hand, just type 'Agenda 21' into Google and you'll see all types of conspiracy theories that suggest that climate change is a ruse designed to cage humanity in soviet-style apartment blocks while leaving most of the planet as a playground for the rich. I doubt any part of that is really true, but on the other hand, the appearance of things suggests it.<br><br>JMG, lets hope that the first person to seriously offer Americans blood, toil, tears and sweat in service of a monumental task picks a good one.<br><br>A lot of the terrorist attacks by Muslims in the last couple weeks have been deflected by stories about how the person in question had extramarital sex (possibly even with other men!), ate pork, drank alcohol, didn't go to the mosque etc. The phenomenon these stories always forget about is that people who have been 'living in sin' for some time and then finally repent are often pretty serious about it afterwards, and throw themselves into their new ideology with incredible zeal. I don't mean to turn this into an anti-Muslim screed, but there's bits in the Quran and some of the Hadiths about how the get-out-of-hell-free-card is to die in battle against the enemy, which is one of the key tools that Islamic state recruiters use. There's some evidence that this is what drove the Nice truck attacker and possibly the Orlando one.<br><br><a href=#c2423207706289122831 title="comment permalink">7/27/16, 8:21 PM</a><br><br>

Always a delight to read your essays. <br><br>Naïveté, a negative campaign, intolerance, and a provably false assertion: all seeming to come from an attitude of superiority. "We are higher status and are your intellectual superiors; bow to our wisdom". So, to me at least, the word/concept "status" seems to have crucial relevance to why climate and environmental activists are often so clueless. <br><br>Buy a Tesla (80-100 kilo dollars), buy carbon offsets, or festoon your roof with solar panels and you demonstrate your high status. Wear old clothes, ride your rust-stained steel bike to work, and forgo owning a TV, smartphone, and car and not only have you diminished your social status significantly, lots of folks will fear you might be the next Unabomber. He did have a <i>really</i> ratty bike! :-)<br><br>A friend of mine likes to say: "Dollars are a pretty good proxy for environmental impact." The climate change movement has behaved as if we can buy our way out of any problems. Looks more like the solution is NOT to buy (much of anything.) And definitely pay attention that what little we buy enriches the working class rather than the effete well-to-do. <br><br>The bourgeoisie is seldom willing to sacrifice their social status under any conditions, especially when there is no threat of imminent destruction.

This week, I feel I must.<br><br>I'll start with what I think you hit right on the head, and that is the issue of interests. You focus on the elites and their air travel (a luxury I have abstained from for many years now) but neglect to point out that the lion's share of people in the first world have a vested interest in the comforts provided by the status quo. Ignoring the Al Gore's of the world for a moment, let's face the fact that most coal miners, diner waitresses, an public accountants want things like air conditioning, refrigerators, and fruit from a different hemisphere. If there is a solution to climate change, it absolutely involves the dissolution of capitalism as a way of relating to one and other, as well as the dismantling of the industrial project that has swept the globe over the last two centuries. <br><br>This also speaks to the lack of a positive outcome you think climate change activists have failed to offer. Perhaps, dear druid, there is no place where honesty and positivity meet, and if they do, it is in the mundane offer of survival. No more lattes. No more Xbox. A lot more time planting potatoes and swatting at mosquitos. Not exactly a sizzling offer.<br><br>As to climate change activists, this is a strange designation. I myself have spent much time, personal treasure, and personal freedom fighting against pipelines and oil infrastructure, and I did so with comrades who demonstrated intelligence, selflessness, and bravery. My friends and I have sat high in trees, dangled beneath bridges, camped inside pipelines, locked ourselves to machinery, and done oh so much more that cannot be written about.

Let me assure you that obfuscation was not what I was trying to achieve though. But being on the front lines like you are some friendly fire is inevitable, I guess. <br><br>I didn't check the links in this post (guilty!) but I did try to check the links in many of your earlier posts (being a reader since 2008 or so) and every time for every link that says polar ice cap is smaller this year there was a link or two that said it's actually bigger. So, that was my actual question in the comment above - how do you know which ones to trust? I mean even after filtering out the usual suspects (Fox News,CNBS, NYT, etc.) there is still enough evidence to support whatever one wants to believe in. For those of us who don't spend the whole day on the Internet, is there an easier way to see which sources are trustworthy? That's what I meant basically when I asked Why do you trust them? Sorry it was not clear.<br> <br>I understand that weather records of a single farm don't matter that much (BTW, if you're ever in these parts you're more than welcome to examine the raw data, as well as to taste our lamb, chicken and homemade beer - Alexandra Lake Farm, http://alexandralake.com/- just let me know a few days in advance) and this is exactly my problem. Last time I was in South Beach, Miami (about 3 years ago) I saw the seawater coming out of the storm drains and just a few days ago I talked to a friend on a fishing trip to the Russian tundra, who said it's been 100F or more for the last 5 days but that's exactly this - an anecdote. Does it reflect a long term trend? I don't know. How do you know? That was my question. <br><br>Anyway, please feel free to delete this comment if that's too much trouble to answer (seriously - I'm constantly amazed at how you find time to deal with all the comments and certainly don't want to add to the workload. Obviously, first I have to go and double check the links in this post.) <br><br>Thanks for all you do!<br><br><a href=#c5763591236886037369 title="comment permalink">7/27/16, 9:33 PM</a><br><br>

If the movement has a simple goal, limited duration and minimal impact on people then it can be successful. If it has none of this it will always fail.<br>Examples in the first category are second world war, same-sex marriage etc.<br>The second category contains most of unsolved problems of today - malnutrition (aka overpopulation), racism, climate change, pollution, democracy etc.<br>All of these require constant vigilance to detect problem, make the change and review the results. They also require almost all the people to change their lives.<br>Your quote from Churchill from the second world war was not what made the Britons fight. The implicit alternative (and the US support) did the trick.<br><br>The global long-term impact of climate change is what caused the "mistakes" in the climate change activism too. Even a politically savvy activist has some trouble putting stopping climate change in a positive light.<br><br>I appreciate your optimism and I think it's part of what makes your blog such a pleasure to read but I don't think climate change activism ever had a chance.<br><br><a href=#c3151032355496052187 title="comment permalink">7/27/16, 10:15 PM</a><br><br>

Its inhabitants are seen as disposable, existing only for human survival and convenience. There is no logical connection of actions and consequences, for instance, if humans cause the whole Earth to die, then they also die. Even the best and the brightest among us fail to see the forest for the felled trees. <br><br>For instance, animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than all forms of transportation (planes, trains, automobiles) combined according to the United Nations http://cowspiracy.com/ yet all of one percent of the Earth's 7.4 billion inhabitants are willing to eschew all animal products. So-called pasture raised meats -- I envision steaks floating about grazing on grass in a field -- are even worse as far as efficiencies go. Factory farms may be horrible but they are efficient. Among that one percent of plant-based people, only a fraction are avoiding flesh, dairy, and bird ova because they give a damn about Gaia. <br><br>Creating a biological child is an act of deliberate ecocide at this point, yet mention that which cannot be named, Voldemort ahem I mean anti-natalism, in a crowd and one can roundly expect shunning at an immediate or future date. <br><br>The human race acts a great deal like a Petri dish full of yeast to which a spoonful of sugar has been introduced. As one of them, I find it concerning there is no new planet to destroy, though the misanthrope in me is glad that our parasitic species will not pass Go and Collect 200 New Planets.

Here in the UK, our Green voting areas are bohemian middle class with huge carbon footprints (London / Brighton / Bristol etc.). While they will have many good reasons for the political leanings, I have often wondered how much relates to guilt about their own lifestyles which they largely fail to address in any meaningful way.<br><br>Secondly, can I thank you for your comments on those in the green movement who fly but I don't think it those comments should be restricted to the Al Gores of the world. For example I can barely contain my anger when druid leaders fly repeatedly while claiming to love the Earth or green political activists regularly fly away for mini holidays every few weeks.<br><br>I have struggled to deliver the narrative of less carbon. Talking with people on doorsteps I find people who are either struggling to pay the rent and buy food or people who drive and fly regularly and would not entertain any suggestion that they might need to do less of it. <br><br>Finally, we have a society that continues to talk about aspiration but where many equate this with a high income and clean job, how do we sell a vision of a society that will need far more people working on the land?

I think you're being unfair to the 'Greens' and the ghastly political culture that exists in the United States, which makes the task of any true opposition incredibly difficult, if not impossible. Your example of gay issues is, I would contend, irrelevant; as it's a niche area compared to challenging the entire structure and direction of US-style 'capitalism', which is in another league.<br><br>I think you almost veer into parody in your characterisation of the failures of the Greens to break through to most Americans. That's too easy and an avoidance of some harsh realities about US politics and economics. Sure the Greens haven't been 'eagle-eyed' about politics or economics, but who is these days? So, given their failings and the nature of US politics, that's hardly surprising.<br><br>Even if the US was a healthy and functioning democracy challenging the economic and social system would still be a colossal task, as it isn't, the failure of the Greens is not just understandable, it's to be expected.<br><br>I think it's unfortunate that you don't refer to the Green Party's leader Dr. Jill Stein and her views. Sure, she's very political and radical, but she basically agrees with you about the incredible challenges we face in relation to the environment and specifically the dangers of 'run-away' climate change, only she puts them into an uncomfortable and harsh political perspective. Basically, and I hope I'm not putting words in her mouth, she sees the US as a corporate/military/media... dictatorship run by the 1% who have both money and power. The entire system functions to protect and promote their interests at the expense of everyone else and the environment. What's needed, she argues, is a political revolution. Now, clearly this is a somewhat 'radical' viewpoint, but to ignore it and pretend that all the Greens are simply naive or stupid, seems a bit unfair.<br><br><a href=#c957024072368231250 title="comment permalink">7/27/16, 11:47 PM</a><br><br>

Besides, think of all the jobs that would be created!<br><br>Cherokee, I think you hit the turkey square on the head with that last shot. The reason the Clinton campaign is spending all its time talking about Donald Trump is that it's kind of hard to talk about Hillary Clinton without dealing with the fact that she's basically George W. Bush in a pantsuit. <br><br>Justin, I had a few other things to write about first!<br><br>Jessi, I'm not at all sure I agree. The costs get dumped on the poor so relentlessly that somebody has to be noticing...<br><br>Bryan, no argument there. That's always the thing that drives Caesarism -- the abusive behavior of entrenched privilege classes mounts up to the point that the rest of the population turns to a charismatic demagogue. <br><br>WB, fair enough; you know your situation, of course, and I don't. Once you have control of your own travel arrangements, yes, it does get simpler. <br><br>Jessi, that depends on what you mean by "worst effects." Certainly there aren't enough accessible fossil fuel reserves on the planet to justify the high-end estimates for climate change that were being bandied around a while back, and the imminent human extinction brigade is <a href=../../2014/01/2030-is-new-2012.html rel=nofollow>simply the latest version of the mentality that gave us 2012</a>. My predictions in <a href=../../2014/07/dark-age-america-climate.html rel=nofollow>an earlier post here</a> are still my best guess.<br><br>Karim, exactly. The challenge is to keep on asking that question, no matter how unpopular it is, until it becomes impossible to avoid. <br><br>Martin, my condemnation was primarily directed at affluent liberals -- not just rich, but middle and upper middle class -- so you're not wrong. I've had a lot of encounters with radicals of the kind that are actually out there engaging in protest, and I have a great deal more respect for them than I do for the folks that can't be bothered to take action -- but I'm sorry to say that the problematic attitudes I discussed in my post, especially the first, second, and fourth of them -- extreme political naivete, a habit of engaging in wholly negative campaigning, and intolerance for honest dissent -- are in my experience extremely common among people involved in the protest end of things. Maybe I've met a nonrepresentative sample, though. <br><br>Leon, thanks for the explanation. I have certain advantages here, as I took quite a few college courses in ecology and botany, as well as experimental design and statistics; I can usually figure out when somebody's shoveling smoke. One basic rule is that I don't rely on the news media at all; I go to publications of research wherever possible. Another is that I compare recent data to data published in print sources decades ago -- that way you know the older numbers haven't been fudged.<br><br>Unknown, maybe not, but the activists could have given it a much better shot than they did. It's actually not that hard to reframe the entire issue in terms of specific goals that can be tackled one at a time, and presented in a positive light -- in a country that's desperately short of jobs, how much opposition would there really be to programs that hired hundreds of thousands of people at a living wage to do some of the stuff that needs doing, for example?

Now that I no longer have that job and its attendant responsibilities, it's really doubtful that I'll fly again. <br><br>Greybeard, the way forward, as I see it, consists of making the idea of a low-carbon future enticing as a whole, so that people will accept (say) a steady job working in farming as their contribution to the better future. I'll talk about that in an upcoming post. <br><br>Michael, I'm not saying that all Greens are naive or stupid, and I'm not sure where you got the idea that I was. I'm saying that the specific movement to prevent global warming made five specific mistakes, which I described in detail, and that the failure of that movement is best understood as the result of those mistakes. Some of those mistakes are shared more generally by the left, but not all. What's more, preventing global warming didn't require "challenging the entire structure and direction of US-style 'capitalism'" -- again, those are your words, not mine. It really does come across as though either you didn't pay attention to what I wrote, or that you're trying to spin it to fit some agenda of your own, and either way I don't think that's helpful. <br><br>Stunned, hmm! Glad to hear that. That said, how much attention did that get in the broader climate change movement?<br><br><a href=#c5342020200345487600 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 12:20 AM</a><br><br>

Enviromentalism but also trade unions and socialism as intended to attention and investment into the local community and considering public goods as part of a shared, communal ownership.<br>This hijacking which in Europe is practiced since a very long time goes like this: there is a problem perceived by commoners.. like for example the owners of companies using scare tactics on employees to lower wages. This lead to workers organizing into trade unions to fight back and regain some bargaining power. Power attracts the elites and soon some of them raises to the top achieving things thanks to the good connections. But shortly after they are in control they start adding to the core goals of the organization others which are romantic impractical or impossible for the working people. Soon these goals are given priority and the organization loses grassroot support ,is driven into the ground and then recognized and kept alive by the elites because it keeps another grassroot movement from coming into existance. So the organization created by the people to free themselves and to gain bargainig power becomes yet another mean to control them.<br>I read recently "Storms of our grandchildren" of james hansen. what stroke me is how big a chunk of the book is devoted to the life of the author and the description of his meeting and talks and mistakes in the higher echelons of usa governments. His climate change policy was about convincing governments to FORCE policy on commoners! Luddites were commoners rebelling against progress imposed by elites. This is something entirely different. It is dying. And that is good.<br>When commoners will have their house submerged for the n-th time or burned or cars washed away in yet another flash flood. When food will become scarce and yet more wars and terrorist scares will be organized by the elites something different will pop up. Suddenly and powerfully. All this crap will be washed away by tired and disillusioned people like communism from ussr.<br><br><a href=#c4397145546123905114 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 12:39 AM</a><br><br>

And guess what? I read the book in two days! Couldn't help put it aside I had to get back to it whenever I had some time. I'm considering purchasing your other books in english and I won't be waiting for a french translation as I used to do. <br><br>I recently discovered that Pr. Dennis Meadows was a great fan of your books as it appears in a text he published on Pr. Ugo Bardi's blog 2 weeks ago. From where I stand, that's a hell of a hat tip :)<br><br>"I read John Michael Greer's books as they come out. They stimulate me to think about that future without abundant oil. I expect that will be evident by 2030."<br><br>Concerning this week's post, I can't help but interpreting it with my own national brains and eyes. The situation regarding Climate Change here in Ecnarf has also worsened since the years Al Gore's movie hit this side of the pond. Grossly, nobody gives a damn. Everything climate related is either dismissed or, when it comes to enacted public policy, seen as another move against working people. For example a recent policy from Paris mayor has banned old cars from entering the city. Nothing has been said about what's still going on around the city with the Boulevard Périphérique (a ring of 4 lanes motorways encircling the inner Paris) still plagued with trafic jams, heavy trucks and diesel personal cars. Half of the country suffered from heavy rains in May, June, still recovering. A recent announcement from the gov't said that industrial cereal farmers will get some tax cuts and the like to compensate for the decrease in crop yield. <br><br>Personally, I tend to adapt my own lifestyle with as much less energy as I can do. I still have to attend to my workplace 20 minutes driving, I take the bus sometimes. I'm planning to take it more often. I totally phased off plane travel one year ago. I still visit friends and relatives all over the country but either I travel by train (a network that still works quite well but could be better and cheaper) or I carpool. I still have to work on my food input to rely less on industrial farming and processed goods, though.<br><br>Having read the Ecotechnic Future (twice), I'm still wondering how different are the US and Europe for the matter of spiraling into descent and whether your advices are tailored for the North American or can be applied to Europeans as well (counting Britons, yes, we still share a common fate). <br><br>Anyway, thank you for giving us these weekly insights and be well.<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c2566633691954696249 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 12:57 AM</a><br><br>

As far as I know, they don't treat Alice Bows-Larkin like one, either. That said, I know of no other Earth scientist who is willing to give up air travel. <br><br>I'd argue that the movement's leaders' stunning failure to "walk the talk" is perhaps more emblematic of the really unprecedented challenge posed by global warming, than as a cause of the movement's failure (though it hasn't helped any). That is, our lives in industrial society are so entwined with fossil fuel that it's difficult even to envision what a new mode of living would look like, let alone to live it. Just look around you: embodied fossil fuel everywhere you look. Of course, we lived without fossil fuel a mere two centuries ago, but the myth of progress blinds us to this.<br><br>Maybe global warming is the greatest collective imagination failure the world has ever seen? The movement could use 5.3 billion pairs of magic sunglasses that allow us to see the fossil fuel embodied in nearly every aspect of our lives (we'll give the poorest 2 billion a pass, as their lives would look pretty much the same with or without the sunglasses). This is what really sets the global warming fight apart from, say, the fight against CFCs. Fossil fuels are everywhere, and there's no easy substitute. <br><br>Venkataraman, thanks for the shout out.<br><br><a href=#c6257173038989405315 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 2:24 AM</a><br><br>

Jorgenson,<br>I sympathise with your mention of the "social costs" of giving up the use of various technologies; I’ve had a few friends make mildly disparaging remarks when I said I didn’t have a smart phone, just a simple old Nokia for text and phone calls. Ditto for not watching television. I’m in my 70’s and frankly I really don’t give a rat’s a--s what most people, including family, think of me. I’m comfortable with who I am, and the only person whose opinion I care about is my wonderful long-term girlfriend. <br><br>Aside from the issue of technology, I’ve had to let go of some friends who are deeply committed to the Myth Of Progress and will not even participate in a reasonable discussion. I found that I just could not be around them in any but the most superficial way, and that it wasn’t worth the energy it took to keep my mouth shut and avoid the inevitable fight. <br><br>I feel the same way about people who have a deeply held belief that women are inferior; there is no way I want to waste my precious time interacting with them as friends or even acquaintances.<br><br>So yes, its sometimes painful to cut loose from people whose beliefs you find abhorrent, but if you make an effort, I’m sure you’ll find a few friends who share your views.

The comparison of the failure of the climate movement with the success of the same-sex marital movement is faulty. In the latter the yes or no vote doesn't affect everyone (a seemingly small minority of persons involved), neither would it cost any of us anything and it is backed by provisions of our constitution. One could argue that climate change comes under the provisions of the clean air act; it does but that requires a finding of fact that is subject to politics and debate.. AND, it affects everyone. The same-sex marriage situation is not similar. Many of us could care less about same-sex marriage since it wouldn't affect our lives or pocketbooks..<br>We, wife and I have been a behind-the-scenes advocates in the environmental movement for at least 50 years. When we could afford it we installed solar hot water and voltaic systems, insulation, geo-thermal heating/cooling, burned home-grown wood in our fireplace, stopped flying, bought a Prius and drove as little as possible. This computer uses XP and we don't have a smartphone or any other such electronic device except TV and stereo. The internet connection is hooked up to batteries fed by solar panels, etc. We're in our mid-80's so we don't spend a lot time learning how to raise our own food.

We burn wood and oil, coal and natural gas, and, in the process, release waste gases, principally CO2, into the air. Consequently, the carbon dioxide content of the Earth’s atmosphere is increasing dramatically. The possibility of a runaway greenhouse effect suggests that we have to be careful: Even a one- or two-degree rise in the global temperature can have catastrophic consequences. In the burning of coal and oil and gasoline, we are also putting sulfuric acid into the atmosphere. Like Venus, our stratosphere even now has a substantial mist of tiny sulfuric acid droplets. Our major cities are polluted with noxious molecules. We do not understand the long-term effects of our course of action. But we have also been perturbing the climate in the opposite sense. For hundreds of thousands of years human beings have been burning and cutting down forests and encouraging domestic animals to graze on and destroy grasslands. Slash-and-burn agriculture, industrial tropical deforestation and overgrazing are rampant today. But forests are darker than grasslands, and grasslands are darker than deserts. As a consequence, the amount of sunlight that is absorbed by the ground has been declining, and by changes in the land use we are lowering the surface temperature of our planet. Might this cooling increase the size of the polar ice cap, which, because it is bright, will reflect still more sunlight from the Earth, further cooling the planet, driving a runaway albedo* effect? Our lovely blue planet, the Earth, is the only home we know. Venus is too hot. Mars is too cold. But the Earth is just right, a heaven for humans. After all, we evolved here. But our congenial climate may be unstable. We are perturbing our poor planet in serious and contradictory ways. Is there any danger of driving the environment of the Earth toward the planetary Hell of Venus or the global ice age of Mars? The simple answer is that nobody knows. The study of the global climate, the comparison of the Earth with other worlds, are subjects in their earliest stages of development. They are fields that are poorly and grudgingly funded. In our ignorance, we continue to push and pull, to pollute the atmosphere and brighten the land, oblivious of the fact that the long-term consequences are largely unknown.” <br><br>― Carl Sagan, Cosmos <br><br><br><br><a href=#c1097045339333339914 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 5:25 AM</a><br><br>

It consists of presenting specific changes as an ultimate solution, without considering the effect of fundamentals on the specifics.<br><br>For example, you have mentioned many times how it would be an obvious thing to do to ditch the machines in favor of human labour once the tax code that favors machines is abolished. This one act would go a long way towards solving a number of environmental issues - but not even the Green party (at least not the British one) proposes it; instead they propose rather small tweaks at the margins of the tax code, which keep its current form essentially intact.<br><br>Another good example is the universal emphasis on creating jobs, understood as opportunities to work for a company or another person in return for a wage/salary. But the British Green party does not propose a similar drive to increase the number of people working for themselves - even though such a form of employment would go a long way towards relocalising industry.<br><br>I'm singling out the Green party because it is ostensibly representing the Green movement within the current power structures, thus giving it access to actual policymaking on a national level. They _could_ change the fundamentals, unlike the mere activists whose ability to change laws is greatly restricted. But they do not even try - while promising results which cannot be achieved without changing the status quo. Sure, these suggestions in paragraphs above have little support right now; but isn't it the job of a political movement to make its proposals accepted? Well, the Greens appear to have chosen an opposite route - start with what is accepted, and then make your proposals based on that. No wonder they have come to be seen as irrelevant; they basically promise an Atlantic Republic in Retrotopia's skin.<br><br>MigrantWorker<br><br><a href=#c7342624084711467159 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 5:31 AM</a><br><br>

I don't disagree at all with your overall point, but there's a few things I'd like to comment on, some of which have already been brought up by a few of the other commentators. <br><br>First, while this doesn't excuse the strategic mistakes of the climate movement at all, wasn't their objective a pretty tall order compared to most other social movements of the time? Like you said in your post on the Paris agreement, constantly emitting greenhouse gases is the foundation of "everything that makes modern industrial societies modern and industrial". Putting a stop to that would entail a major reorganization of society, and would involve nearly everyone from the rich to the very poor. I'd think that would be a very hard sell even with a good strategy. Especially when the consequences of inaction are so vague (on an individual level) and so far in the future.<br><br>I also think the comparison with same-sex marriage is kind of apples to oranges. Introducing same-sex marriage requires no new infrastructure, no energy inputs, and only involves a tiny minority of the population directly (or so I'd argue; the book I chose for your last reading assignment was a vehemently anti-same-sex marriage screed claiming it would invalidate every Christian marriage as well, but I'll get to that after your next education post). Another advantage for the same-sex marriage campaign was that it could easily be slotted into a Religion of Progress framework as the next step for Progress following on from civil rights for African Americans, feminism and so on.<br><br>The point about being able to promise people sweat and toil as long as there's payoff was interesting. Something I find slightly exasperating about the Norwegian Green Party (of which I'm an active member) is the dithering between willingness to be honest about the predicament of industrial society and wanting to keep telling voters everything will be okay and that Western middle-class lifestyles of course are sustainable with a few tweaks. There's a very strong fear of being "negative" and seen as "doomers" among some in the party, I'd say. <br><br>On the other hand, the party does promote a local equivalent of "a vision of a grand new era of green industry, with millions of new working-class jobs", even if it's not always clear where exactly all those jobs are going to come from. On that note, I'd also be very interested to see your full post on that in an American context.<br><br><a href=#c6177122829256186229 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 5:32 AM</a><br><br>

We have a parliamentary democracy here in which 75% of our elected representatives wanted to stay in the EU. The extreme right-wing of the Conservative Party pressured Cameron into holding the Referendum becausw they saw it as a way of overturning the will of our elected sovereign parliament .<br><br>Political elections are normally based on candidates 'laying out their stall' in their pre-election manifesto and we vote for our preferred choice. If, four or five later and we find out that they have failed on their tangible promises (higher/ lower taxes, more/less on health, education, law and order, military et etc) we can throw them out.<br><br>The referendum has been much more like a trial by jury. The 'outers' and 'remainers'(lawyers) made their persuasive arguments and then the British electorate (the jury) made their decision based on what it had heard. Bear in mind that this is not a regular election, but a once-in-a-lifetime choice. No sooner had the result been announced that the winning side were backing away from the promises they had made on slashing immigration, spending more on the National Health Service etc etc. Their campaign was based on lies. To make matters worse, the 'jury' had been grossly misled by the Murdoch media, along with other right-wing outlets such as The Daily Express, The Daily Mail etc into a vote which, very like that exploited by Trump, had hardly anything to do with Europe, but was a protest vote by the millions of the 'left behind' while the 1% prospered. The outcome is very likely to make them very angry indeed at having been cheated.<br><br>I make this comparison between Climate Change and the Brexit referendum because in both cases factually reasoned argument has been completely cast aside. In the face of a hostile media the UK Remain camp and Climate activists face equal defeat, just as Trump poses a serious threat to Clinton. <br><br>Some put it down to a complete failure of education that intelligent, reasoned debate and scientific facts are being cast aside in a wild fit of anger and unreason. I am sure that you will agree that a lot of this involves the abject failure of the American (actually worldwide) consumer dream. It has been a 50 year fraud which has driven into a state of disappointment, despair and debt which threatens the very viability of our natural life-support systems.<br><br>Finally, you end your piece by mentioning 'the centuries ahead'. We don't have centuries and if temperatures continue to rise at the current rate the world as we know it will disappear well before the current century is out.<br><br><a href=#c2972624643075852801 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 5:35 AM</a><br><br>

I like to think I’m ahead of the curve on this one ;-) Mind you, you'd think I'd admitted to being a mass murderer some of the looks I get from friends and family...<br><br>The point Kevin often makes is about how we take people along with us. So, instead of focusing on the people who have a package holiday each Summer, the people who need to cut down on flying are the middle class and business travellers taking 3,4,5 plus flights a year. Any talk of changing their behaviour by changing policy, more taxation or whatever, is rubbished so as not to stoke the ire of the great God of growth. <br><br>Anyway, I think the left should take a leaf out of UKIP’s book and look how they achieved Brexit - When James Goldsmith first started the referendum party in the mid 90's, he was viewed as a loon. Well now 20 years later we're out of the EU and the successor party, UKIP, regularly polls 15-20%. I think we need to realise this is a long game and things like degrowth, localisation, ecological economics may seem left field now but could soon be normal currency and neoliberal globalisation will seem crazy (I hope)!<br><br>The “left” whoever that is anymore need to just bite the bullet, start advocating these things now, as unpopular as they may at first be, then when the proverbial really starts hitting the fan in the coming years, we’ll be ready with an alternative.<br><br><a href=#c7370755787430555641 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 6:14 AM</a><br><br>

Many of my friends have been inspired by my actions in ways that I've found surprising. A quick survey:<br><br>1) after talking about Oswald Spengler non-stop for a year and a half, several of my friends got <i>Decline of the West</i> from the library and read it. They got a lot out of it and weren't people I'd have thought of as 'intellectuals'.<br><br>2) while farming I talked with everyone about how genuinely satisfying the work is. One of my friends, inspired, left his cushier life to work on organic farms, citing my example as a major point of inspiration.<br><br>3) Since getting deep with herbs, using them for all of my health needs, and teaching classes, many friends of mine have started making their own tinctures, and showing a large degree of sophistication in their extraction processes and displaying a grasp of materia medica that I find impressive. One friend quit her job so she could spend more time learning about herbs, foraging and gardening! I gave her personalized, free classes of course.<br><br>I mention all of these examples because they <i>surprised me</i>. I didn't design to have people follow my example, I wasn't advertising. Instead I was just sharing from my own life and doing my routine, sharing it with others. People saw this and appearantly changed on their own accord and in their own unique way. The choices we make and how we talk about them are clearly important. Personal example is even more so, as is availability to help people make the first few steps on the steepest part of the learning curve.<br><br><a href=#c8141252205882617411 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 6:34 AM</a><br><br>

I learned about the idea first as a concept in science fiction and then in the late 80s as a real concern, when I was about 10. From then I started to focus on learning about what I could personally do – which is an ongoing process. I did make real sacrifices, although I think they are as you describe them, simply inconveniences (I’ve never driven a car, I stopped eating meat, and I don’t use airplanes if I can help it - I’ve taken about one trip a decade since then and the first trip was to see family when I was too young to really have any say, and the last was a business trip I couldn’t get out of), still in some cases this has meant tough decisions. I was never comfortable discussing my rationale for doing these things with anyone because I felt that it would be trying to impose my morals on others (although I did post once here about veganism because I thought it was relevant), I just usually say something like “I don’t like flying,” or “I like having being able to read on the train”. People know these things about me but they don’t understand what’s really behind it, and I’ve never tried to be part of a greater movement to change people’s opinion on climate change (I think at best I’ve contributed to the “doom, doom, doom” mantra). Do you know how we should go about trying to help? My concern has always been on trying to do more personally (I think I am still quite wasteful but I am trying to get better always). Am I going about this wrong? I try to be optimistic but I feel now like that amounts to just trying to be positive in the face of an awful and worsening situation.<br><br><a href=#c6374598308032553544 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 6:36 AM</a><br><br>

I can tell you that the industry has seen a considerable flattening of load growth, even some load decline, which for the old-hands is just unheard of. Our utility is smaller, but we do have solid-fuel generation. The good(ish) news is that we co-fire biomass. (We are actually air permitted for 100% biomass, but there are supply-chain, economic, and operational issues that would have to be addressed first.) I've been an advocate for an upstream carbon tax (tax applicable when it comes out of the ground or over the border), which would help levelize the playing field in the wholesale marketplace. I hope to be able to move some more of my ideas along in coming years, particularly if a possible advancement opportunity does indeed materialize.<br><br>On the election, I am still amazed at the incredible blockheadedness I witness in the discussion threads. A few people are starting to speak up about looking into the causes of the working class vote migrating Trumpward, but those voices seem drowned out by those who say those people don't vote for "us" anyway, have always voted against their own economic interests (!) and "we" just need to fire up "our" loyal supporters.

Trump got the "fly-over" country, AK, NV, AZ, NH, that northern ME vote, the southeast including FL, and OH. (Clinton kept PA.) The result? 270-268 Trump.

I recently heard that NASA was trying to delvelop a zero carbon commercial jet liner and thought: wouldn't it be easier to bring back ocean liners? They would take a few days to cross the atlantic ocean, but even a lowly tourist class passenger on the SS United States had more room, better food, and more things to do than a first class passenger on one of today's airplanes, and with a far smaller carbon footprint. If you need to go long distances overland, then lighter than air flight is an option. The test flights of the aeroscraft prototype seem to indicate that they've solved most of the problems (such as not being able to control your own buoyancy without ballast) of the first generation of rigid airships. I suspect that this technology will become quite widespread in the next few decades; a transportation option that can cary large payloads and needs nothing more than flat ground to land on would be very useful when we can't maintain freeways and airports anymore.<br><br><a href=#c5091781190831981853 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 6:48 AM</a><br><br>

The difference is this: Gay marriage is not a threat to Capitalism itself, or the people in control of (and at the top of) that system (large financial institutions). Goldman Sachs doesn't care who is or isn't allowed to get married, but they sure as heck care if the commercial air and auto industries survive. [As a side note, during your build-up, I thought you were referring to the Internet, not the Airlines. Surprise!] Meaningful climate action involves a fairly radical shift in societal behavior, as you have said many times. And while I disagree with you that NO ONE was arguing for a kind of Green New Deal (I do recall reading essays calling for letting the US auto companies fail, and having the US Government hire those workers to build wind turbines and the like), the larger point stands: Americans do not want to make sacrifices, especially if the beneficiaries are strangers. I am reminded of the old Dead Kennedys album, Give Me Convenience, or Give Me Death. 1960s radicals had to choose between Gilligan's Island and Janis Joplin, so getting people fired up and involved was eaiser (the Draft didn't hurt either), but now people have an infinite amount of entertainment at their disposal, and asking them to give even a small portion of that up sounds like a Betrayal of American Freedom, or something.<br><br><a href=#c5925235125062745432 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 7:25 AM</a><br><br>

For lefties such as myself, hoping for the downfall of corporatism, an environmental doomsday scenario has a certain appeal. Many good comments as well, though I have to stop reading them if I want to get to the gardens that are my passion, my sanity, and my contribution. I just wanted to give a shout out to some. Cacaogecko, I am your typical green liberal, and take great pride in my ability to raise and butcher chickens. Caryn in Dubois, I love what you say about two sides being right. Why is it so hard for people to think and/and instead of jumping to either/or? I did a blogpost once that starts more or less "If I could change one thing to make this world a better place, it would be to discourage thinking in binaries". Several people mentioned the cost in social relationships of living without. So true. Right now my electrity use is going through the roof. My husband has been reduced to skin and bones by a neuro degenerative disease. He keeps cranking up heat, even in summer. What am I suposed to do, let him freeze? I have been doing the eat local, with the seasons, for most of my life. I grew up that way in post war Europe and reverted back to it when I became a gardener. Overall, my life is relatively virtuous in green terms. But, oh, how I love my internet! Guilty as charged on that account. As for a positive vision, Bill McKibben offers a nice one at the end of "Eaarth". Simp,e, more local living, more done by hand, but we get to keep the internet to facilitate exactly that. When I despair of tne world I google Permaculture, urban farming, and bio char.

In fact, some people went a good deal further than predicting it would force pastors to marry two men, claiming it would literally cause the end of the world. Back in the days when I still tried to talk to other family members etc. who still adhere to that movement, I was always amazed that they'd dismiss everything I had to say about Peak Oil as "conspiracy theory" and "irrational paranoia," yet somehow the idea that God would destroy the earth soon and send the antichrist down as punishment for homosexuality sounded perfectly logical to them. What amazes me about this is that Peak Oil lacks any supernatural component, being simply the scientific notion that a finite planet cannot contain an infinite amount of oil, and that the current lifestyle we live is dependent upon an enormous input of oil. Yet the conspiracy theory that homosexuality will cause the apocalypse is based in nothing whatsoever but supernatural belief, lacking any scientific basis. But then again, "science" has become something of a dirty word to the people who live outside the circles of academic privilege, so adding in "This is based on science" has actually become a way to convince people like this NOT to listen to anything you have to say (much like for Global Warming.)<br><br><a href=#c3406199241961293007 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 7:57 AM</a><br><br>

Al Gore is truly the poster child, with his massive footprint being totally out of step with his rhetoric.<br><br>However, I think the biggest problem, by far, with making any real gains is the massiveness, the inertia, of the current system. And there are YUUUUGE amounts of money being made from this system. I have been in the business of "collapse now and avoid the rush" for a good 25 years now. Well before climate change became a household word. And it differs from the gay marriage issue in a very important way: allowing gay marriage (or pot smoking, for that matter) doesn't require you to change your lifestyle or consumption one iota. AND, the powers that be probably also smoke pot before gay sex at the same rate as the rest of us : ) <br><br>My focus has been very much along the lines of what you suggest: provide a positive vision and be willing to get by with less myself. It's not hard. Envisioning local food production, barter, and a lower tech existence is pretty easy, and frankly, quite fun and exciting. But convincing other people to change habits has been dumbfoundingly difficult. One simple example, (of which there are many): I was in an off-grid intentional community for 5 years and my girlfriend and I tried to start up a ride share system to town, because so many people were making solo trips 45 mins into town. These were people of mostly low income who were pressed for time as well. You would think it would be an easy sell: save time and money with the relatively small hassle of coordinating. But our effort failed, in an "ecovillage" no less. <br><br>When our whole system is based on fossil fuels, convenience, and the religion of progress, it is difficult for most people to put food on the table, pay rent, and change consumption habits for one's self, much less convince others to do the same. And the real kicker is that it would be much easier if other people were on the same track. It's a question of momentum, a catch 22. <br><br>I think it's going to take some serious crash of the current system to get people on board. My strategy is to be prepared, both psychologically and practically, for when that happens. I'm thinking it won't be long...<br><br><a href=#c4758889187645018232 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 8:03 AM</a><br><br>

I suppose the calculation was that you have to meet people where they are, and better to get people started with the baby steps than freak them out with what is really needed. Or maybe Al Gore never really bought-in to collapsing now, later or ever - he's clearly a smart man who saw the problem; but also a man who seems to like his travel and like his stuff. Either way, as you say, the real need for major, major lifestyle change was never described. <br><br>But we're all conflicted to some degree, or most of us are. Lifestyle change is the key to it. But it's hard. I don't say that as an excuse. I've been reading you for a long time, and been aware of the issues for longer, and I've taken my lifestyle down a significant number of pegs. I feel like I'm part of the solution. But I still find it difficult, if I'm honest, to talk about the issues with "non-believers" without feeling defensive or embarrassed. I just don't have the verbal chops or ego presence. So I tend to do what I do quietly, setting what example I can, without promoting myself. More and more people I know are doing that, which is very positive in terms of tangible results. But it's happening bottom-up and spontaneously, in response to real needs. Not top-down in response to campaigns. <br><br>Maybe people who can take action in their own lives tend to make very poor activists/campaigners, for climate change or anything else? And maybe people who are pulled towards activism are pre-disposed to talk more and act less? It must certainly be hard to walk one's lifestyle away from the system, while still trying to work within the system to lead people away from it. Maybe good activists are just too clubbable by nature, especially those raised in this last generation of third-way spinners? <br><br>I do look forward to hearing more about how it could have been done better, how the picture of lifestyle change could have been better painted and promoted. But it would have taken a certain type of leader to both walk and talk the talk.<br><br><a href=#c2565213387277337560 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 8:16 AM</a><br><br>

This column is no exception, but I do question some of its arguments.<br><br>For the last 5 years I have been the spokesman for an alliance of community groups fighting against shale gas and climate change. It was a long fight, but we have prevailed, at least for a while, as we have an indefinite moratorium on shale gas. In that battle we learned that no one style of argument motivates everyone. <br><br>For the base of the movement the motivation was clearly and overwhelmingly the fear of consequences. Doom and gloom are extremely powerful motivators, particularly if one can link actual current events to predictions made by the movement. Fear and doom are personal and for anyone with empathy, examples of those who have suffered consequences can be powerful motivators that provide the passion any movement needs.<br><br>So I think that fear was the appropriate and necessary tactic to start the climate movement, just as it was in the case of the Clean Water Act - I remember the images of burning rivers and millions of dead fish floating in Lake Erie, etc.<br>Fear and doom are the staples of both US political parties currently, and apparently engender a great deal of passionate support.<br><br>Climate activists have been promoting the positive economic and health benefits of fighting climate change for some time, but those who don't need jobs, for example, aren't passionately motivated by those arguments. They are just another argument on the plus side if you are in a debate. And the folks who need the jobs are often the most resistant to change of any kind - witness the attitude of coal miners in your neck of the woods. This was also the case in our shale gas fight.<br><br>The promotion of positive outcomes works with a segment of the population, but I think it is less widespread or emotional. I believe its impact is small until the problem reaches a crisis point that can't be ignored. Then 'hope' becomes a necessary ingredient.<br><br>Also, I don't believe your examples of the opposition to gay marriage and the Clean Water Act are appropriate ones. The first, despite the amount of disinformation, really affected very few lives personally, beyond those directly involved. The CWA was passed at a time when the environmental movement was being born, and there wasn't yet a sophisticated organized counter-movement against them, because there had been no need for one.<br><br>A better example would be the fight against tobacco. In that fight the 'denier' science had to be called out specifically. And I believe that is what Naomi Oreskes is doing. She is not attacking the legitimate discussion of the issue, but is directing her remarks to those opponents who disingenuously use it as an excuse for doing nothing or as a red-herring. The 'science' does matter to a sizable part of the movement.<br><br>Finally, while I am pessimistic, and agree with your views on the future, I don't think we can say yet that the movement has failed - only that it certainly has not yet succeeded. It continues, not just in the same old ways, but in courtrooms and novel approaches by a growing and coalescing of international interest groups that for many varied reasons are affected by climate change. Too many unknowns to declare victory or defeat - but positive steps are truly coming too slowly.<br><br>Having said all that, we are in total agreement about the failure to lead by example, an issue I struggle with in my own organization - specifically on air travel.<br><br><a href=#c2015762052307545530 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 8:21 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not trying to argue the point of climate change, just as Leon is neither trying to argue. There's no doubt the climate is changing and some awful dreadful extremes are happening. The one point to debate though is whether we can predict what will happen in the future, which you interestingly made strong arguments against trusting in science and scientists in your article but then used the argument in response to Leon that you specialized in ecology in university, and use different data sources than most others, and thus should be more trusted than others in how you come to conclusions. I found this reeking of hypocrisy, and all the more so as it follows an article in which you went at some length to help explain why many cannot trust those with so called scientific background. And further, I do recall when the ebola virus was of some concern in the African continent, you made a post about how it very likely could find its way to the USA and begin a major epidemic in that country, to which Bill Pulliam made a counter argument that it was not yet mutated enough yet to easily spread, which you frankly refused to consider. Now nearly two years later we can see that Ebola had indeed not mutated enough yet to cause a huge epidemic in the US. It could still indeed in the future, but we will have to wait to see. All of this I say, just to say there is no 100% determined conclusion as to what will happen to the world. I will need to consult with other mythologies, but I do believe the Norse Myth of Ragnarok concludes with the world burning for some years which is then followed by some years of never ending winters, a story which was perhaps inspired by more than just a few centuries of human experience...<br><br><a href=#c6424949164448400780 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 9:22 AM</a><br><br>

This well thought out article compelled me to do so. I have been advocating (online) that people cut back on consumption for years, while doing it myself. Over the last 10 years or so my husband and I have cut our consumption of everything in at least half. It was incremental of course, not overnight. I don't think a single thing we have done is a sacrifice. If anything it has increased our quality of life and we don't know why we didn't start sooner. <br><br>The thing is, I don't think most people notice so I'm not convinced 'leading by example' in our case has residual effects. In any case, leading by example was not a motivator for our lifestyle changes. They were purely personal and somewhat selfish (more free time, less stress). <br><br>I have friends and family who preach all the time about climate change and how we must "do something" (usually something drastic and top down) but they would not make even small changes in their lifestyle choices voluntarily. I don't say anything to them because I don't want to be preachy and because I would not have listened as recently as 10 or 11 years ago. I will occasionally 'preach' online even though the result is almost universally contempt and/or obfuscation as outlined in the article. <br><br>For example I have a cousin who is a self-proclaimed environmentalist and climate change warrior … but she drives 35 miles (70 miles r/t) in her mid-size SUV to get her hair cut at a boutique salon. There are numerous hair cutting places including fancy boutique ones within a mile of her home. This occurs every 6 weeks. I have never mentioned how incompatible this is with the bumper stickers on her SUV, which presumably are read many times in the mostly slow traffic to get her hair cut. And for all they know she is on her way to visit a sick aunt or something.<br><br>I also cut my husband's hair at home after watching intently men get haircuts at the local chain haircutting place and a YouTube video. I bought professional haircutting scissors and I've gotten pretty good at it. (First couple of tries I admit were frightful). I suppose we are depriving local haircutting people money but it is money we choose to spend locally on other goods and services. And since our finances are finite, it works out all the same. <br><br>I would not have been receptive to someone suggesting the lifestyle changes we have made. So apart from our own satisfaction and quality of life improvement, I don't think it is making a contribution to changing consumption habits. <br><br>Cutting overall consumption as we have done, if even 50% of people did the same, would cut GDP and jobs, mostly jobs overseas but also middlemen jobs here. I don't have an answer to that. Cutting consumption is necessarily going to cut jobs. Will this even out as people would require less wages/salary if they are consuming less? I don't know. I know that has been the case with us. They would have a lot more free time to pursue other interests but would they view this as a plus?<br><br>For us it was a relatively easy and stress free transition, but I'm not sure it would be for most people. <br>It is subjective in terms of what people think they need/want. However it is objectively true that we don't actually need most of the things we are conditioned to think we do and we are be better off without most of it … my husband and I have proved this to ourselves if no one else. <br><br>I'm also not sure the hypocrisy thing grates on most people.<br><br><a href=#c3797079118412632030 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 9:31 AM</a><br><br>

But climate change is such a tough nut to crack because really addressing it means changing nearly everything about our life in the modern industrial world. Even full knowledge and intellectual buy-in of the reality and consequences of climate change is not enough to make many people change. I have a good friend who left academia in early retirement because of its decline in to uselessness . He is a PHD scientist who fully believes in climate change and its consequences but clings to a future technological fix and in the eventual effectiveness of government to intact this yet unknown technological fix. He also thinks Hillary will somehow step up to the plate and become a great president (a reincarnation of FDR to be exact). <br><br>In another example My wife recently had a discussion with the water system director of a large gulf coast city. He believes in Climate change, and agrees with its affect on water supply and in fact has seen his own municipality go to desalination for a large portion of its water supply. But he firmly believes economic growth, population growth and progress will continue for this particular municipality, emotionally or intellectually ( or politically) not able to put the puzzle together and plan for the real future. I am not sure that with this kind of buy-in to the power of the status quo any amount of "example" on the part of climate change activists would have worked. <br><br>But they ( and we) should still change if only for our own sanity. My wife and I have downsized to a small condo in a district heated building ( shared system with city hall) next to light rail from Suburbia. I no longer drive ,except for using my wife's car to visit my elderly parents who live in retirement homes ( against my wishes) in exurban locals with horrible cycling access. I belong to a small urban csa where most of our food comes from and have been building up my cycling stamina so I can cover the entire urban area ( hills and all) by bike. I have also been moving my work( metal working) away from stuff in the high tech industry towards making things for farming, bikes equipment repair. Not really enough in the long run, but it makes all the difference to at least feel like you are moving in the right direction.<br><br><a href=#c5223499314939236259 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 10:03 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not sure what you mean about my hidden 'agenda.' I'll skip that part as it's irrelevant.<br><br>I don't think you are being fair to the green, or climate change, 'movement.' I don't even think qualified as a 'movement', but perhaps that's just me?<br><br>I think your comparison and examples, of successful 'movements', like gay rights and the clean air act, are interesting, but... fanciful. Perhaps it's a question of scale that separates us? I think climate change, we are, after all, on the cusp of 'runaway' and 'uncontrolled' climate 'disaster.' A veritable planetary emergency; is way off the scale of challenges we face. I'd put it closer to the abolition of slavery in the United States, than something like the clean air act. Which compared to the fundamental and structural changes to the economy which are required, if we are going to deal with the enormous challenge of climate change, is a mere detail.<br><br>Do you really think that Congress passing a few pieces of legislation here and there is enough to change the way we live and save the planet? We can't simply 'tinker' with the system. It has to be 'replaced', or at the very least be 'reformed' root and branch. <br><br>Even if the 'movement' had recognised the five 'mistakes' you point to, would that have made any substantial difference? I doubt it very much. Power is Power and where it is in society. The powerful, who live in a 'vertual Versailles' as I term it, don't give a damn about what people or the 'movement' think or want. The people are, at most a necessary irritation, and at worse, at threat, but they are usually under control and coralled and steered away from Power.<br><br>Dealing with the challenges, (which are multiple and deeply rooted in our system of economics, call that what you will), is going to require a 'revolutionary' shift in power relationships in society.<br><br><a href=#c6511150596526408333 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 10:09 AM</a><br><br>

Many people I know buy in to the media story that Putin is a deranged KGB megalomanic who is only out to pad his bank account, kill journalists and support his oligarch friends. What they don't get is many people are beyond caring about those things. They see Putin as an effective statesman who does what he says, puts the interest of his country first, and seems to be in touch with the reality of the world as it is and not how his banker friends want it to be. This is the reason people don't care when Hillary demonizes trump for his personal failing, because they just want someone who gets things done. A true sign of the senility in the Hillary camp is that the more they beat up and try and tie Trump to Putin, the higher his poll numbers.<br><br><a href=#c7462863973461995230 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 10:20 AM</a><br><br>

Contemporary capitalism isn't the mythical agile beast of economics textbooks; it's rather locked-in to its paradigms. What I've surely learned over the years from your eloquent explanation of catabolic collapse on this blog, is that industrial society's baseline energy needs were set when fossil fuels were cheap, and now with diminishing EROEI we can barely afford to maintain infrastructure, let alone build tens of thousands of new "green" towns to replace suburbia.<br><br>And the physical, literal inertia of the fossil fuel paradigm is appallingly immense. Even if all Americans got over their sunk-cost psychology tomorrow, that huge physical inertia of concrete and metal and houses that are unlivable without air conditioning and automobiles would still be there. And America doesn't have the surplus capital anymore to undertake the work of changing it, does she? She's throwing everything she's got into hanging on hand-to-mouth, as it were.<br><br>At least that's the scene I've been led to see.<br><br>As for personal lifestyles: I don't drive an automobile either, and I certainly can't afford to fly. Does it matter, though? If one doesn't drink one's milkshake, someone else eventually will. Since reading <i>The Limits to Growth</i>, recently I've started wondering whether conserving fossil fuels is even desirable, in practice. Their simulation showed that conservation implemented by political and technical means just makes civilizations's Peak higher, the crash harder, and only a few decades later. In other words, more harm to the biosphere may be done in the long run, the more we supplement with 'green' energy!<br><br>Lastly: no brusqueness or disrespect intended at any point.

I’m on Facebook (shame, I know, but it’s how some of the organizations I volunteer with conduct their business meetings…), and occasionally peek in on some of the people I engaged with in the transition town movement, from my natural history and humanities focused environmental science degree, from work in the forest service, and of course the environmental activist wing of the neopagan community and it’s always some new gimmick (it looks like you’ve already fielded one this week)… a seizure inducing video on solar roadways, super solar conductors, fusion power that’s just around the corner, some new wind turban technology that’s supposed to be designed in an innovated way that will capture more energy than we thought possible… a food forest the size of the Eiffel tower that’s supposed to feed cities the size of Paris, always in the form of sketches and 3D models… i.e. conceptual), using GMOs for carbon sequestration or to adapt to changing biomes is a common theme… and sometimes it’s even something that would almost undeniably generate more problems than it would solve… I really hope all the geo-engineering fantasies that the oh-so-rational holders of our future like to advocate for never get off the launch pad (http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Geo-engineering). At best, it’s mostly the sort of “they’ll think of something” mentality that you have often talked about, and of course, you mentioned it this week, pointing out that anyone who raises an eyebrow at the latest techno-fix is going to be labeled as a denialist.<br><br>What disturbs me though, is that I was around these people and these communities in a day before this mentality emerged… and I remember the days when the discussions were on adapting households to fit a permaculture ethos, learning organic gardening methods, xeriscaping, food not lawns, grid free housing, and on down the line, of course a lot of it was rooted in the ecotopian ideal, and it took me years to shake that loose and begin assessing what somebody who lives alone, rents, and has few friends can do… it wasn’t perfect, but none of that’s even part of the discussion anymore. I remember neo-primitivism being in vogue and gosh-darn it, for all its problems I even miss neo-primitivism, it had a way of taking the prospect of a simple, horticultural society without progress or high technology and making it appealing instead of treating it with dread. None of that’s even discussed anymore, and it sometimes feels like none of that subculture ever even existed. I definitely remember that movement in the first decade of the century and it feels like it’s given up on itself. I’m looking forward to seeing where you take things next, on what can actually be done moving forward. <br><br><br><a href=#c1349972038663482694 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 10:51 AM</a><br><br>

I did it off and on for almost 20 years building up well over 10,000 hours. I have friends who have 25-30,000 hours flight time. Servicing remote villages felt okay, but flying tourists, fishermen, and hunters really bugged me. For myself, my last airliner trip was 17 years ago, and we have not traveled since except for short auto trips to visit relatives.<br><br>I do not argue with people about climate change anymore, especially if they have had a few too many drinks. Instead, I figure another one or two katrina's might do the trick. Last year I simply made a comment to my brother who was extolling the virtues of his bird-watching lifestyle and the superiority of Costa Rica. I told him that his 1 month jaunt to his ecological bird preserve spewed more carbon into the air than our driving would do for the entire year. When my sister gets the winter blues she heads for Hawaii as a cure. Last year they went to Turkey. This year to the south of France. I fire up the woodstove in the shop and build furniture or go for a walk when it quits raining.<br><br>Air travel is simply an outageous waste of resources in the same vein as the cruise ship industry. When some of my friends, workingmen all, feel an all-inclusive to a Carribean luxury resort is a natural entitlement of cutting down trees for a living I think to myself we have a very long way to fall.<br><br><a href=#c9187699260678324616 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 10:57 AM</a><br><br>

But I agree it makes more sense to show how enjoyable LESS can be. For example, people listen more if I talk about why I prefer the exercise and relative quiet of a push mower over the roar of a power mower. <br><br>There is always a balancing act.

It was really the best place in our price range and the rest of the house is well thought out and has many places I could utilize passive solar, but the roof.

What I didn’t find was a nice line chart that gave the proportion of CO2 emissions by sector over time, broken down by automobile, air travel, coal electricity generation, oil and natural gas electricity generation, gas heating and etc. More detail would be useful. Where can I find such a beast? Preferably without a lot of pontificating to go with it.<br><br>The numbers I did find (at Bloomberg about 3 years ago) were that air travel accounts for about 10% of the carbon emissions in the US, while automobile travel accounts for 36%. Ten percent isn’t trivial, but it also isn’t the big ticket item.<br><br>And don’t think that the airlines don’t employ lots of working class people. They do.

Man belongs to the Earth. All things are connected, like the blood that unites us all” (Campbell, 1983). Neo-Darwinists have to reject that Native American perception, and any other non-mechanistic view, because it provokes cognitive dissonance in them. In the world of moneymaking machines, the Earth belongs to humans. In terms of autopoiesis, everything is observed by an observer immersed in the very thing he observes.

My husband and I are both scientists who understand the problems of climate change and resource depletion. We are doers, not activists! We have been working on living sustainably for more than 14 years. We moved into a country home with 2.6 acres and began our work. Over the next ten years we invested in energy efficiency with insulation, new windows and doors, etc. In many cases we recouped our investment within a few years. We installed a wood burning stove in our fireplace and reduced propane usage by 50%. We planted gardens, an orchard, wind breaks and shade trees. We added a deep pantry in the basement, canned fruit and vegetables, built a chicken coop, and started a greenhouse.<br><br>Finally, after 12 years we made our largest investment by adding geothermal (GSHP) and two 5 KWh solar PV systems with backup batteries. I can't tell you what a relief it was that first day running on solar energy. We continued to use wood for back up heat and we spend less than $200 a year in total energy costs for a 4,000 sqft home. I should also mention that over time we replaced all the fixtures and flooring with the most durable materials we could find.<br><br>Last year, unexpectedly, a wonderful earth berm home with 5.5 acres of woods came on the market and after looking at it we decided to buy it. We had thought that someday we might want to build one, and had we known this would come on the market we wouldn't have added geothermal and solar to our other house. Hindsight! We took the plunge, another leap forward in sustainable living! This year we are closing the loop on this home's geothermal system and adding solar PV system. Next year we will add a solarium/greenhouse across the front.<br><br>Unfortunately we are having difficulty finding a buyer for our previous home. Recovering even a fraction of the cost for the geothermal and PV systems is proving difficult. Buyers looking for homes in our price range aren't interested in energy efficiency or renewable energy. I find it shocking that educated, affluent people who can afford a house like ours don’t understand the value of our home compared to the poor quality, inefficient, crappy house currently being built. It would seem that planned obsolescence now applies to homes as well as appliances. <br><br>We live in a city with a population of over 100,000. Our city is home to a prominent big ten university that prides itself on developing cutting edge science, engineering, and technology for a sustainable future. One would think that there would be at least one faculty member willing to invest in a home such as ours! One would think that there would be someone that would jump at the thought of having all the work done for them! Nadda.<br><br>I think it is exactly as you wrote, people with money who can afford to invest in sustainable living don't want the inconvenience. Even people who believe climate change is real, who know it is happening, who fear the threat to their children's future still won't take real actions. <br><br>Real action means real life style changes. It means putting our money (while we still have any) into things that have lasting sustainable value, developing hands on skills like gardening and cooking, herbal medicine, to name a few and hoping we make the right decisions.<br><br>I admire the families that have little extra money yet are doing everything they can to live better on less. Not much to admire in people who see the problem, have the resources to do something, but don’t. Even worse, scientists and engineers whom are paid to teach others about sustainable living.<br><br>Thanks for all you write, you are an inspiration!<br>JKT<br><br><a href=#c6678019086740057979 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 1:09 PM</a><br><br>

Every time I read a climate change activist argue that personal change makes no difference, that only legislative change such as a carbon tax is up to the task, I have to resist an urge to fling whatever I'm reading it on across the room. Makes no difference? You must be joking. My husband and I have done much to reduce our use of fossil fuels, and it has made much positive difference in our lives. We save money (imagine getting an electric bill of $50 or less all three summer months, even using air conditioning [set to 80F] during the worst heat), to begin. We enjoy a lot more of the sounds, sights, and feel of summer, such as birdsong, frog choruses, and insect calling, because we can hear them from inside and going outside to enjoy them at closer range isn't a big shock to our systems. Because I'm well acclimated to outside conditions, I have no difficulty keeping up the garden all summer long, so we enjoy delicious homegrown foods (which saves money on grocery bills, saves trips to markets, and improves the taste of our food and the health of our bodies). While it's true that so far few salary-class folks we know seem to be inclined to join me in all these benefits, they do admit that at least the better-tasting food is worthwhile. Frankly, I wish I could convince them to set a higher temperature for their air conditioning than I have so far. It's not fun to have to wear long sleeves and long pants inside their houses in the summer - and they have it on like that even when it's comfortable (70s to low 80s) outside.<br><br>We stopped flying over 20 years ago. It wasn't just because it's cheaper for two people to drive than to fly, although that was a big part of it (and, sadly, it's still cheaper for two people to drive than to take the bus or the train, something I agree with you on the need to change). It was also because air travel is the least pleasant and most carbon-intensive way to get someplace. I have flown once, one way, since then, in 2012 when my father was dying and my three siblings were already on the scene. I flew because he would have died during the three days it would have taken me to drive 1200 miles by myself, and going by bus or train would have taken as long (I checked). However, knowing I had no time pressures on the way home, I chose to take the train home - a three day ride, on three different trains, from Orlando to St. Louis (and my mom had to drive me two hours to Orlando at that). I enjoyed the train ride greatly. It's not the first train ride I've taken and I don't think it will be the last, but it won't be as often as I'd like until the rail system is improved out this way. Not flying does require some adjustments (like needing to spend more time traveling to see out of town relatives and friends), and I have had to tell folks that they can't expect me to visit them without adequate time for planning, or expect me to attend a destination wedding if it's out of car-driving range. If they don't like it, tough rocks. I'm responsible for my own life and choices.<br><br><a href=#c6229218210370859593 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 1:12 PM</a><br><br>

A 747 burns 5 gallons of gas per mile, so a transatlantic crossing of 3000 miles burns 15,000 gallons of fuel. With 500 people on board, that's 30 gallons per person, or 100 miles per gallon per person.<br><br>Mind you I detest flying for many reasons, and I have crossed the Atlantic via ocean liner twice. That is by far the best way to cross, particularly going east to west. Each day lasts 25 hours, so not only is there no jet-lag, but you get to sleep later every day and not even feel it. And the food and accommodations - splendid! Far better than 8 hours on a jumbo jet.<br><br>Train travel is indeed the most economical, but this country abandoned rail travel long ago as a means of moving people (other than a small piece of the northeast corridor).

There was, in fact, at least one environmental activist who, in my opinion, tried to offer a positive vision for the environmental movement, and also a vision deliberately designed to appeal to the wage class. That was Van Jones, and his 2008 book "The Green Collar Economy," which called for a “Green New Deal” that would create millions of jobs building out an economy based on renewables. I even had high hopes the Obama administration would follow his vision when Jones was appointed “Green Jobs Czar”- but then he got let go because of a Republican political hit on his character. And the Obama administration chose healthcare, not the environment or the economy as its central project. And we saw how well that worked out. Jones never quite got around to the conclusion of "personal example over everything", but he certainly was very articulate in taking the climate change movement to task for its elitism, and its horrible disconnect from the working class. I really wish he would get around to reading TADR. I’m starting to see part of the mentality articulated here come up more and more among my fellow young people, as well as people of color in response not just to the police killings, but the state of our country in general: "the system does not have our backs.

This election process truly disillusioned me once and for all about media bias and the power that the establishment has to promote its own and keep others out. <br>And yet… something I read right here on The Archdruid Report keeps haunting me:<br>“The hardest of all political choices, though, comes when the conflict lies between the bad and the much, much worse—as in the example just sketched out, between a crippled, dysfunctional, failing democratic system riddled with graft and abuses of power, on the one hand, and a shiny new tyranny on the other.”<br>Would Trump bring that tyranny about? In my opinion, that depends on three main things- his own will and beliefs (difficult to say with precision), how willing and able people in government will be to stand up to increasing abuses of federal power (they have already been ineffective at that in the Bush and Obama administrations- up to a point. What lines can they actually draw? Who knows.), and lastly and crucially how far the American people are ready to go. After the national humiliation and impoverishment of the First World War, the German people were ready to follow where Hitler and his cronies were leading. Thankfully, I think we are not there yet. But then- I recall it being mentioned in the comments here that no less a mind than Oswald Spengler made exactly that mistake, thinking Hitler’s positive qualities were worth the racist side, thinking that the extreme oppressive and authoritarian side of him would not end up coming out.

Hmmm. <br> We designed and built by hand a thermal heated and cooled house in a hard climate. All on wages. This should have been S.O.P. since the '70s. <br> Do massive numbers of office workers really need to commute to a central location to work so they can be supervised by some middle manager types trying to justify their position? Just like "a warrior is always aware of his own death" most office workers and middle managers need to know they are only an algorithm away from being unemployed. <br> Recently I have seen articles where elites actually sneer at the "idiot, moron, "muscle workers" in the elsewhere as if the elites IQ is so far above the unwashed masses. No matter what the circumstances the jet set envisions themselves riding the crest of any tsunami while the rest of us are submerged.<br><br><a href=#c6217155247675781245 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 2:23 PM</a><br><br>

Reflecting on my own life, I have just turned 40. I am Dutch, but grew up in Brussels, as my father became an EU-official shortly after my birth. Growing up in an upper-middle class household in a diplomatic environment, with international school, and moving within circles of various nationalities. My parents who were actually hippies when they were in their 20's, with macro-biotic food, human rights activism, environment-friendly ideas, doing things different than their parents. They lost most of that over the years as my dad’s career in the EU advanced. The long hair of my father went, the weedplants at home disappeared and the gypsy-style dresses of my mum finally remained in the closet. Two cars, living in a wealthy suburb, a second house in southern Europe, frequent holidays by plane (let’s say once in two years, though we only went on holiday as a family in a plane for the first time in my life when I was 17, which for me also was the first time flying in my life) and in ideas a bit less hippie and a bit more conservative, though they never totally fitted in with the Brussels international community and never conformed completely to its petit-bourgeois ideals. <br>But I realise now what kind protective bubble I grew up in. I decided to study art-history, which career-wise was not very smart. My life is definitely more modest than my parents. Been struggling from little job to little job after my studies, as career opportunities in this field are small and most work is free-lance. Tried to give an international dimension to my working life, discovered that I did not fit in the country of which I have the passport, so I decided to return to Brussels. My parents are very much on their own, and as my father had to stop working after an accident in his 50’s and they are not networkers, I did not manage to advance my working life in an international direction (though spent the last 4 years with a blind friend in Africa, who worked there as a diplomat). With help of my dad I managed to buy a small appartment in a former brewery converted into lofts, located in that part of Brussels were many of the terrorists of the recent attacks come from. Though I love living there, a variery of people live here in this building. I have no car, have a little job at a call-centre, and use public transport. Can not complain, am happy.<br><br><a href=#c1736416195584926135 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 3:02 PM</a><br><br>

Such moralizing is repugnant to those imbued with the conservative Christian sensibility I am describing - and it is not merely because those of conservative Christian sensibilities are disbelievers in climate change.<br><br>It is also repugnant because those who champion climate-change-oriented moralizing generally tend to be professed moral relativists, and to throw that moral relativism into the faces of those same Christian conservatives when they moralize in absolutistic terms about their own pet issues.<br><br>But at least the conservative Christian moralizers about e.g. same-sex marriage are being intellectually consistent in staking their moralizing on the claimed existence of absolute moral principles. <br><br>Climate change moralizers, on the other hand, generally repudiate any such grounds for assenting to the moralizing of conservative Christians on issues such as same-sex marriage, but then try to have their cake and eat it too by sneaking in their own absolute moral principles through the back door in order to justify their own pet moralizing.<br><br>The same kind of thing also happens a lot with other issues, such as the typical liberal insistence on the moral imperative to be tolerant - when their professed relativism precludes them from enjoining the mandate for tolerance on anyone.<br><br>Rest assured that this form of moral inconsistency is extremely grating for those of conservative Christian religious sensibility (whether Catholic, Protestant, Eastern Orthodox, and even Nestorian), and I think it needs to be added to JMG's list of reasons why the climate change movement has failed.<br><br><a href=#c1789778785032217400 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 3:07 PM</a><br><br>

I read it going "yep! yep! nailed it! Oh year, I hadn't thought like that but..."<br><br>Sadly I think a big part of the problem is that trying to reduce and simplify looks, to a lot of Americans, like being poor. And the US still has this idea that if someone is poor it's because they brought it on themselves/they deserve it. I mean, a remarkably large number of places don't even let you have clothesline in your yard; it's literally illegal/against HOA rules. And the the people who passed/support this don't even bother hiding that this is just classism. Same with cars: only poor people don't have cars, don't y'know? A few years ago GM famously had an ad that basically mocked bicycling. Then there are explicit zoning rules to try and keep out the poor but in practice end up with overly large houses and huge commutes. You have rules against growing veggies in your yard (I mean, a surprisingly large number of places, Victory Gardens are illegal). I remember some years ago reading an article about some random subdivision in Arizona that was enforcing the "yes, you'd better get a lawn" rule. When asked about this in relationship to being, you know, in the desert, the HOA president got indignant and pointed out that they had their own well, so they "have enough water". All of this has been consciously/subconsciously internalized by a lot of people into "lets conserve the earth, but WE CAN'T LOOK POOR"<br><br>This by the way is why, while I don't agree with a lot of Orlov has to write, I 100% agree with him that collapse in the US will be a complete disaster. You go down, you get shoved aside onto the dumpster. Culturally the US can't handle it.<br><br>Personally, I live in NYC, which, yes, we'll be underwater in a few decades, and I'm aware of that (and have backup plans) , but I'll nevertheless defend it in the short term: I don't own a car and (relatively) a lot of others don't either, nor does anyone judge you for it, I bike as often as I can and when I can't I take a 100% electrical transportation system, dense housing is extremely energy efficient (relatively), and it has one of the best Urban water supply systems in the world (oh, and clotheslines and veggie gardens are 100% legal, as are bees and chickens). I'm also in an area that was considered the ghetto not so long ago and I'll take this as a place to collapse over some rich suburb. African American cultural is based on the South, which means that you say "hello" and greet your neighbors, but if you put in the effort to do that, in turn everyone looks out for each other (even me, a white guy with a strange accent) and they've lived through everything. The community garden on my block is doing veggies (and oddly, the people gardening are mostly muslim south-asians, but they happily welcome anyone in and show what they are doing). So at least I have more faith in my neighbors here then in some random upper-income burbclave, and you will notice that the overlap between everyone I've just described and "liberal environmentalists" is basically zero. But I'm also aware that this too will end.<br><br>In other news, just google for "Lake Mead" and get depressed. It appears that the solution to drought and climate change is courts and the US Senate, which clearly can fix it all.<br><br><br><a href=#c8705739940151765110 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 3:26 PM</a><br><br>

They are no more expensive than conventional materials, you can walk on them, the foam is a good insulator, and they are light colored which makes them reflective of the summer sun. <br><br>It is important to have the roof installed by a company that has experience with this particular technology, and you need a couple of dry and warm days to install the foam and give it time to cure. If you Google The Eichler Network, there's a link to a company that installs foam roofs.<br><br><a href=#c5101608220782221997 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 3:41 PM</a><br><br>

At some level they always felt there should be hell to pay for what we've done and what we're doing, and there was no way out but through some sort of punishing hell, all the way to the end, through the mouth and out the anus of Satan himself where we followed Dante's path to the promised land. That, and they made no distinction between the suddenness of a wholesale economic crash a la 1929 and a several generations worth of ever-so-slow but still geometric contraction in our economy. Heck, even a century of barely-positive but less than 1% annual growth might as well be "DOOM, DOOM, DOOM!" in its pessimism.<br><br>In my most-optimistic moods I picture us already almost a generation into such a slow crash. If you ignore the growth in the financial sector and look at the rest we haven't been growing for the greater part of two decades, and even if you don't ignore it but extend the notion of inflation beyond consumer products to financial products (equities, derivatives, bonds, CDO's, etc.) and properly inflation-correct that portion of growth, you see a steady 1-2% annual GDP decline depending on how you judge your numbers, maybe a lot more if you're ShadowStats, pretty consistently since the turn of the century, maybe even earlier depending on how you view the tech bubble of the mid 1990's. Peak oil is behind us, population growth is slowing and in some places (Japan, for example) declining, and as productive GDP per capita falls, energy consumption per capita falls with it. I see it as, perhaps, the whole "conservation by other means," and people are fooled into thinking that the economy is still growing, albeit slowly, and the real recovery that we've been expecting since it all started in 2008 is just around the corner. <br><br>It's kind of like a "virtual prosperity," were I to coin a term, and it's almost as good as real prosperity, maybe even better because it comes with people tightening their belts without realizing they are doing so. Related to this, I sometimes get perhaps a little to helpful about one aspect of Moore's Law that doesn't get as much press, but the floating point operations per Joule of energy expended has also been getting halved every 5-10 years, and virtual reality is starting to come out and the early forays into that seem pretty damn cool. <br><br>Related to this, and your point about the airline industry, the energy it takes to fly a person like me, a privileged salary class employee who can afford it, and my wife from Montreal to Paris on our summer vacation -- that energy is pretty much fixed, and the efficiency of an airplane going a specific distance with a specific payload is probably not that far from ideal. Combine that with what happened in Nice just a couple weeks back, and throw in a very energy-inexpensive virtual reality trip to Paris or to the top of Mount Everest that is stunning and checks off a lot of the boxes of what you want to do on such trips, and take away all the bad stuff like loud crowded streets, crime, long queues that take hours to traverse (can you imagine being alone with the Mona Lisa, up close, with nobody trying to pick your pockets?), and you might just have an effective placebo for travel that can salve the loss of air travel. <br><br>A glass-is-half-full type of mind might even prefer it.<br><br><a href=#c4118680134781290732 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 4:01 PM</a><br><br>

The rationale is that the company‘s operating expenses come from billing each customer a small fixed daily charge plus a larger charge based on their kilo watt use. Since grid-tied solar customers use relatively less grid supplied energy than non-solar customers, but are still dependent on the grid during times of no or low sun, they “aren’t paying their fair share” of the grid maintenance/upgrade costs.<br>This surcharge was challenged in the courts and was deemed legal. Now its expected that ALL local grid owning companies will add the surcharge, making it even less economic to install grid-tied solar PV (the pay-back time was already 6-10 years).<br>This is a good case of the clash of interests on the issue of who pays for the grid: those with solar PV vs those without.<br><br><br><a href=#c6479499346587660750 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 5:03 PM</a><br><br>

A little over a hundred years before our own Revolution, a farmer turned demagogue named Cromwell had taken over the British govt. Presidents can be impeached. Supreme Court Justices can be impeached. Justices have to be confirmed by the Senate. Congress can rewrite laws that the Courts have thrown out. The constitution itself can be amended. Yes, these processes can take a while, and it is a good thing that they do. <br><br>While I have no brief for Mr. Trump, and I am afraid that wife #3 is a deal breaker--irrational, I know, but there it is-- there is enough evidence on the internet in various places to convince me that Mme. Clinton and her handlers, chief among whom is our, New Yorkers', very own Senator from Wall Street, are even now plotting to launch what would undoubtedly become WWIII. A site called Down With Tyranny has been covering the unsavory details about how Mr. Schumer, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, and others have been conspiring, not too strong a word, too pack the Congress with compliant conservadems, like the stuffed blazer who has never won an election, but who was nevertheless elevated to the Senate candidacy in PA. <br><br>There are also two alternative parties worth considering, Green and Libertarian. The Greens have a fantastic, from a leftist perspective, platform but are a bit amateurish. They are still scrambling to get on the ballot in all states, even though anyone with a grain of sense could see last winter that the Democratic establishment was never going to allow Sanders to win. <br><br>The Libertarians have a typical small govt. platform, but are calling for a non-interventionist foreign policy and drawdown of overseas bases, which, IMHO, must happen before other urgent matters can be attended to. They are also on every state ballot, the candidates are former governors with real live governing experience and no obvious scandals, and do have a slight but very real chance to carry enough states to throw the election into the House. <br><br>Clinton will naturally carry NY, but it would be quite embarrassing to her if the Greens were to get 20 or 25% of the vote, and that might be enough to convince members of the NY congressional delegation that rubberstamping whatever the WH asks for would not be good for their careers.<br><br><a href=#c1406150580975792617 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 6:48 PM</a><br><br>

Pielou's book. It's very well done, and quite calming when you see what the North American biosphere went through during the great warm up as the glaciers melted back. What's happening now is not unprecedented. <br><br>Any good temperature plot of the 20th century shows a decline from the late 1930's until about 1980. That is what had people concerned, especially since the Milankovitch cycles clearly say the climate is headed down. (David Archer, the Long Thaw, has a good description of that effect, with a great chart in the second to last chapter. We may have stopped the next ice age in 2000- 3000 years, but there is really big bottom in the cycle about 50,000 years out. We need to save the coal we have left for then.) <br><br>And yes, I've also noticed the hypocrisy of the climate change movement flying all over the world to discuss how to cut back on CO2 emissions. Hello? Skype for business? AT&amp;T Go-to-Meeting? In the evil old heavy industrial chemical business (aka, work) we use both of them to cut down on travel. Why not the environment movement? Are they all extroverts who only function when herded together? <br><br>And the less said about vice-hypocrite Al Gore the better. <br><br>And this one was near and dear to my heart and pocketbook; <br><br>"What’s the most significant difference between coal mining and commercial air travel? Coal mining provides wages for the working poor; commercial air travel provides amenities for the affluent." <br><br>Clinton, Gore, and Babbitt used policy (and flat violation of the law in the case of Babbitt) to shut down as much mining and logging as they could in the intermountain West. Tens of thousands of wages class jobs gone, and not a few salaried jobs went with them, including mine. What was supposed to replace those jobs? Eco-tourism. Minimum wage, seasonal, and benefit free jobs in the tourism industry.

Coal related jobs account for roughly 250,000 people out of 350 million people in the United States. Are those 250,000 people enough to derail the climate activist movement? <br><br>If so, then campaigning against commercial air travel would have caused climate change activism to fail even more spectacularly because more wage class people (by orders of magnitude) would be the direct targets of the proposed change.<br><br>Again I don't disagree with the thrust of the essay. Having prominent, highly visible, climate activist jetting around the world is terrible optics and a disservice to the cause.<br><br>I think that climate change activist set their sites on the biggest global emitter of greenhouse gases which happens to be coal fire power plants. It wasn't a deliberate attempt to disadvantage wage class workers. Setting their sites on a lesser emitter, air travel, would have disadvantaged just as many wage class workers. <br><br>There is no way to not disadvantage wage class workers when we are talking about changing the global economy to something sustainable. Not in the short term anyways.<br><br>So yeah the messaging is a problem, but I don't see how the movement could have addressed this differently. Coal fire powered plants <i>are</i> a problem from a climate perspective, and purposefully shifting the economy (as much as possible ) to alternatives would be an improvement in the short-term.<br><br>I am certainly not arguing that people shouldn't lead by example and reduce their own carbon footprint, and again, the argument JMG laid out is fair, Al Gore's lifestyle results in terrible optics. <br><br>I'm not sure how else you address this massive problem though without tackling coal related emissions.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tony<br><br><br><a href=#c7309131243019373379 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 8:22 PM</a><br><br>

Typical. <br><br>Sébastien, thank you! That's something any author likes to hear. :-) As for the differences between European and American historical trajectories, that's one of the reasons my writing focuses on America -- I don't know the rest of the world well enough to hazard more than the very occasional guess.<br><br>Mikep, of course there are differences between climate change and same sex marriage; so? There are differences between any two issues you care to nane. There are still lessons that can be learnt by comparing the failure of one movement and the success of the other. As for whether it's a problem -- at this point, granted, it's mostly made the transition from being a problem to being a predicament. There are still adaptations and constructive policies that could be pursued, and they aren't, because advocacy for such things has been such a spectacular failure. <br><br>Shane, unfortunately, yeah, it would probably take some such hugely counterproductive form. <br><br>Mr. No, caring is a choice. If you choose not to care, that's not something I or anyone else can do anything about. <br><br>Peter, thank you for commenting! I'm glad to hear your colleagues aren't treating you like Max the Two-Headed Man; it would be a little more encouraging to hear that some of them were starting to follow your example, but that may be a bit much to hope for. The complexity of climate change as an issue simply means that it needs to be broken down into more easily digestible chunks, in the same way -- and for many of the same reasons -- that you'd break down a complicated research project into a series of investigations, each of which brings you closer to the goal. Since any decrease in the rate of greenhouse gas pollution helps spare our descendants some of the misery we're piling up for them, each step along those lines matters, and each can build momentum and pin down opposing forces. In a future post, I'll sketch out in more detail how this could be done. <br><br>Drhooves, that simply points up the failure of activists to make those cause and effect linkages visible in ways that make sense to others. That's a problem that every writer deals with all the time, and it's not an insuperable one -- you just need to know who your audience is, what they know and care about, and how not to insult them -- and of course this latter was one of the big problems with climate change activism. <br><br>Barrabas, panem et circenses indeed. Yech. <br><br>Coops, that's a copout. People can understand anything if it's explained to them in a suitable way. That latter means, among other things, not insulting them and not waving obvious evidence of dishonesty or hypocrisy in front of their faces. <br><br>Gunnar, to my mind it's actually a mistake to insist that there's no hardship. You can sell hardship by making sure that it's shared out equally, with the privileged classes first in line for their shares; by showing people that there's something good to be gained by it; and by presenting a powerful image of the better future that can be achieved by accepting hardship here and now. History shows that that's actually a very easy thing to do -- see every combatant nation in the Second World War for a set of good examples.<br><br><a href=#c7669173134428894269 title="comment permalink">7/28/16, 8:41 PM</a><br><br>

It is obvious to me now, if it wasn't in the past, that the political elites of this faux binary political system of ours is about to go on life support. Clinton has not a clue as to what the future holds for this country! Trump probably doesn't either and the Democrats are going to try to scare the wits out of the country trying to make that point. Trump rises or falls on how well he handles that onslaught. If anyone is equal to the task it is Trump. I just hope that he understands at his core that the old Reagan idea of trickle down economics is to be well and properly buried and that capitalism in any form that Americans understand has to start with creating prosperity at the bottom and letting the money flow back to the top. It may be too late already for such social engineering on the massive scale that would be required. The 1% will have to be led gingerly into financing infrastructure projects that are sorely needed. Admittedly, it is a retro fix that has been tried before.

The surgeon and the infectious disease specialist--who is African--were totally stumped as to why he had the reaction so late in the therapy. (I mention that the doctor is African because I believe that his aggressive stance toward all infections has saved many lives in the area since he came. He has educated the medical community that microbes are not to be trifled with!) To my point, however, he ordered a change to a drug that the compounding pharmacy called and told me the co-pay due from the patient was to be $6000 dollars! Needless to say we are unable to come up with that kind of money so he must settle for a much cheaper and older drug. So much for OBAMACARE!

(There's a lot to learn here about the disconnect between how scientists interact with each other and how they interact with the lay public.) In the same way, there were also SF novels of the same period -- Edgar Pangborn's <i>Davy</i> is an example worth reading -- that took the opposite tack and imagined a future of global warming and sea level rise. Understanding the way climate science was presented to the public in the 1970s and 1980s can't be done using simple black and white categories; it was a complex, nuanced situation that's been hopelessly falsified by all sides in the current debate -- <b>and that didn't have to happen</b>. <br><br>FiftyNiner, I know. I read this morning that Trump is now within three percentage points of Clinton in <i>Oregon</i>, for Dagon's sake. It must be nice to have your putative opponents so hard at work alienating the voting public!<br><br>Unknown Joel, yes, I'd encountered that, and thought highly of it. Thanks for the link!<br><br>Russ, yes, there are differences between the campaigns for same sex marriage and against climate change; so? There are still lessons to be learned from the success of the one and the failure of the other. Look at the differences in strategy and tactics between the two movements and you'll learn a lot. <br><br>Lawfish, yes, as I noted in my comment to Tony above, the subject was still very much a matter of debate among scientists back then, and both sides presented their point of view to the public as an accepted consensus. There's much to learn there about the way that scientists use public exposure as a medium for professional disputes -- as long as you don't try to force the issue into a simplistic black-and-white mold. Did you take a look at any of the books I cited, by the way? <br><br>MigrantWorker, the Green Party, like the Democrats, represents the interests of affluent liberals -- it's just that it appeals to a segment further left than the donkey is willing to go these days. Of course they keep all their proposals within the current terms of discourse, because those latter are set to preserve the interests of the affluent against those of everyone else. <br><br>Kim, of course dealing with climate change was always going to be a tall order. That's why a politically competent movement would have broken it down into a bunch of more readily achievable goals, each of which would cut a significant amount of greenhouse gas production, and each of which would build momentum and reinforce the overall movement. It would have been just as possible to build all this into the Religion of Progress, with energy efficiency and sustainability as the next great leap forward -- that was fairly common talk in the 1970s, though it's been silenced since then.

It's a reflection of the fact that for too many decades now, labels such as "science" and "reason" have been used to justify policies that benefit the affluent at the expense of everyone else. Do that long enough, and when you talk about science and reason, most people will stop listening -- even if the things you support really are backed by science and reason. The rejection of EU membership was a case in point -- the benefits of EU membership mostly accrued to the affluent, while the costs were carried by the working poor, and every attempt by Remain campaigners to evade that point was met by boredom and contempt on the part of the ordinary blokes who voted Leave in such large numbers. Their equivalents are probably going to put Donald Trump in office for the same reason: they know that if Hillary gets elected, all they'll get is the same shaft they've been getting since her husband was president. <br><br>As for centuries ahead, yes, we do. Please do some reading in the paleoclimatology literature about rapid climate change in the prehistoric past. Humanity's already survived one really nasty bout of very fast global warming, at the end of the Younger Dryas period about 11,800 years ago. Now of course modern industrial society won't survive chance on that scale, but it's not going to survive anyway. <br><br>Eric, the best package I've been able to think of so far is the one called Retrotopia... ;-)<br><br>Ian, good. Exactly; if you never ask for what you want you're never going to get it, and being willing to spend some time in the wilderness is an essential step on the path to making things happen. <br><br>Hhawhee, your second comment should have denied that you made the first comment! That's how it's done in Oceania...<br><br>Violet, thank you. In the face of some of the reactions this kind of post inevitably fields, it helps to hear from people who are actually leading by example and thus doing the work that has to be done. <br><br>Johnny, no, you're doing fine. The last thing you want to do is to get in people's faces or try to present yourself as being morally better than your friends -- that'll just make people turn their backs and walk away. Simply lead by example, and talk about it to those people who are open to having such conversations: that's the starting point. <br><br>Nestorian, the peak oil movement also made the catastrophic error of nailing itself to a set of predictions based on a simplistic understanding of the economics of crude oil, and those predictions failed. The fact that some of us tried to correct that in advance did nothing to save the movement as a whole. But yes, there were also some of the other issues involved.<br><br>David, yeah, I hear the same thing all the time. Your map is plausible, though the way the polls are going -- with Clinton getting basically no bounce from the convention -- it's possible that Trump will win by a much larger margin. If her campaign continues to shoot itself through both cheeks the way it's been doing to date, Trump may just win in a landslide.<br><br>Tokyo, good. All of the things you've described are among the massive strategic mistakes that global warming activists made, and kept making, and are still making. None of them are necessary. It's actually not that hard to reimagine the whole subject so that you don't have to market any of those things. I'll be discussing that in an upcoming post; in the meantime, by all means try to work it out for yourself. <br><br>John, indeed it was -- in fact, that's when I learned it.<br><br><a href=#c1149246646940133568 title="comment permalink">7/29/16, 12:12 AM</a><br><br>

An empty seat means the airline made Lee profits and may start to run a particular flight at a loss. Even if another passenger flew, they may have got a discount to convince them to fill the seat at short notice. Eventually when less people fly, airlines have to offer fewer flights and charge more for then to cover costs, which in turn discourages more people from flying.

One of the things to keep in mind, though, is that there are equally YUUUUUUGE profits to be made in a transition to sustainability, and there are also millions of weekly paychecks that could be being handed out to working class people. That's why it's crucially important to drag this whole issue out of the cloud of self-righteous hair-shirt asceticism that so often envelops it, and reimagine it in ways that make people want to pursue the goals it presents.

Most freight shipping companies have “freighter travel” as an option. By law if you have fewer than 12 passengers on a ship, the ship isn’t a “passenger liner” and doesn’t have to have all the bells and whistles. So many cargo ships also have cabins for paying passengers. The cabins are functional, but no fawning waiter, shuffleboard, swimming pools, etc. Take some good books and enjoy being on board a working ship for the 3-4 days of a trans-Atlantic trip. The cost is about the same as air travel if you factor in food and accommodation. The days of wandering “tramp” steamers are gone, so all these cargo ships do tightly scheduled runs. <br>In the 80’s, Canadian Buddhist teacher used to take 8-10 students on extended voyages on (mostly) Russian cargo ships. No distractions, the perfect environment for meditation, etc. After a month or so (having done 6-8 consecutive voyages on the same ship), he’d turn the students loose in a place like New Zealand with the suggestion that they “live the teaching” for a couple of months before getting back on another ship. One of his students ended up establishing a mountain retreat center near where I live.<br><br><a href=#c7404343438345966704 title="comment permalink">7/29/16, 4:49 AM</a><br><br>

They've been monitoring glaciers around the world with time lapse photography, in order to allow them to speak for themselves and bring the subject down out of the abstract realms it tends to inhabit in public discourse. It's pretty hard to deny that something's going on when you sit down and watch a glacier turn into a lake over the course of a decade right before your eyes. Actual emissions reduction is subject to the problems laid out in this week's essay, but part of the problem right now is convincing people that climate change is even happening... It seems to me as though aiming for the partial victory of at least convincing the public that, whether it's a natural planetary cycle, greenhouse gasses, or an act of God, the climate is changing the seas are rising and we've got to do something about it. If the conversation could be couched in those terms, then even in the light of a failure of activism for lowered emissions -something- would be happening. But that's part of the "all or nothing" refusal to allow dissensus within the climate change movement aspect of the failure... Still, even if it's unlikely to gain widespread notice outside of the spheres of those who already care, the EVI is doing good work, and I'd recommend tracking their work to keep track of the present situation and just how far things are progressing.

That is already a result, but still not what prompted you to write it. No doubt the perfect outcome would be if a green organisation were to take your analysis to heart and, with a fully fledged action plan (and hopefully a charismatic leader who also walks the talk) start lobbying government and individuals to bring about real change without making the same old mistakes.

If I thought it would make a damn bit o' difference, I might hit the streets again,but...<br><br>The target audience, the ones who actually could make a difference are the very people who benefit from the status quo.

Depending on where you live, public transit is not an option. And this leads us to Cash for Clunkers, a feel-good program that was a giveaway to the auto companies and finance companies and did little to help the climate.<br><br>Of course, it costs far more in carbon to manufacture a new, fancy, efficient car than to keep the old one running.

Really, the solutions to peak oil/limits to growth are the same as the ones to climate change. Had we stayed on that promising path and not detoured into the neoliberal counterrevolution, we would have necessarily lowered our carbon footprint via conservation, appropriate tech, and fossil fuel replacement. Had we done this when Hubbert first predicted peak oil in the 1950s, fossil fuels would have lasted indefinitely. If fossil fuels were judiciously guarded and used as if they were gold, then the environment would have been more than capable of absorbing the CO2 from their conservative use.<br><br><a href=#c5222776266623220650 title="comment permalink">7/29/16, 9:55 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not sure it was actually mainstream climatologists on the whole promoting the sensationalist books and TV shows about the coming freeze; as usual it's a few loud voices oversimplifying a complex situation that get the press. But there was general evidence that throughout the pleistocene (which we are really still in) the general pattern of the cycles indicated another ice age was "due" in a geological sense. Meaning in the coming millenia, not the comming decades. And there were some tentative indications (now well-confirmed) that the switch from warm to cold conditions could happen very rapidly, in much less than a human lifespan. Combine that with some notable record-breaking cold waves of the 1970s and early 1980s in the eastern US, and indeed the media fury did take off.<br><br>In contrast with this, the potential for greenhouse-gas-induced warming as a result of fossil fuel burning was also well recognized as far back as the mid 20th Century. I remember seeing the Mauna Loa CO2 graph when it only spanned about a dozen years, not over half a century as it does now. And like many, the thought I had was "Hmmm... I wonder which will win?"<br><br>Given the irregularity of the Pleisticene ice/warm cycles, it was pretty irresponsible of anyone to actually claim that they could scientifically "predict" an ice age in the "near future" as conceived of by humans. And there probably will be an ice age within the next tens of 1000s of years or so, after the oceans eventually suck up all the fossil CO2 and the natural pleistocene cycles resume. Geologically that time frame is nothing. But the media and popular book publishers have a tendency to translate "in the next few thousand years" into "in the coming years" and then into "right around the corner." <br><br>Personally I remained agnostic about this warming/cooling trend into the late 1980s. But by the end of that decade, enough things were evident in the climate records to convince me that warming was indeed winning. And of course the last 26 years should not have left any doubt in the mind of any person who has an honest, empirical, scientific approach to data. As I sit here, the all-time record "high-low" termperature for our little hollow, with 14 years of data, has been broken 3 times this summer. Long-term records from nearby stations confirm this is not just an anomaly of only having recent data. This indicates significantly higher humidity than in earlier years, mostly due to elavated sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico. Which is EXACTLY what the climate models were predicting in the late 1980s would be happening by the early decades of this Century, based on greenhouse-gas-induced warming. As for what they predict for the second half of this Century.. let's just say I am getting increasingly glad that I will not have to live through them.<br><br><a href=#c5061360560966442206 title="comment permalink">7/29/16, 10:16 AM</a><br><br>

Don't change. Make sure windows updates are enabled and working (software is hard, complex software is impossible, updates tend to block the known security holes so keep them coming). Remove your antivirus software and just use the free Microsoft Windows Defender (renamed to Security Essentials for Windows 8/10). It works just as well, is faster and free. Use Mozilla Firefox for your browser, install the free extensions ublock and a script blocker. Most ads will be blocked, your computer will be relatively fast.<br><br>If you have Windows XP. Take a deep breath. And then change. It really is a problem on the internet. On a stand alone computer, sure no problem. Connected to a network of insecure IT devices, assuming it even renders web pages correctly (which it won't), it will be slow and tedious. Luckily, as mentioned above, there is a free alternative.<br><br>Linux. In particular, Linux Mint, which all the cool kids are using nowadays (Ubuntu got stuck in a quagmire of group think). Using your favourite search engine, find the Linux Mint homepage and goto downloads. If your computer is less than 5 years old - grab the 64bit Cinnamon version. If older, grab the 32-bit MATE edition. You will need to download an ISO file, which can be 'burned' to a blank DVD.<br><br>Reboot your computer with this DVD in the drive and select the boot from CD option. A new desktop will appear (don't worry, your files are safe). Have a play around, check out Libre Writer and Calc (the free versions of office). You will find they open and save the MS Office formats just fine in almost all cases. Open the browser and check out the web. Unless you use unusual hardware/software, most of you will have all your needs met by this completely free operating system. There is a software package manager which can install all manner of free and open source software. Feel superior in the knowledge you are using an OS preferred by the nerdiest and most tin-foil-hat corners of the internet (yet is still strangely user friendly).<br><br>If, after some experimentation, you think this could be for you, transfer your personal files and photos to a USB drive, then click that big icon called INSTALL MINT.<br><br>Sorry JMG if this is too off-topic, I just can't help myself when I see people proudly announcing their continued use of outdated software. I know outdated is a loaded term on this blog (and I broadly agree with your general viewpoint on 'progress'), but if you use a computer on any network, you are really in a world of pain if it is outdated. Recently I started volunteer work for a small college in a developing nation. As you can imagine, paying Microsoft the correct license fees are way, way down on the list of concerns. Yet, I still have to fix the inevitable viruses, software incompatibilities or just strange issues that result from the mish mash of pirated operating systems in use. Although my testing is still limited to half-a-dozen or so machines, I can confidently assert to any readers that Linux Mint is far superior to windows XP for an internet connected machine on todays internet. <br><br>Disclaimer: My computer uses Windows 10, but it is a tablet hybrid that won't work on Linux Mint (or at least not very well). Anyone out there with a bog standard desktop or laptop should have no problems - and the boot CD lets you try with no permanent change to the hard drive.<br><br><br><a href=#c2392994861232520696 title="comment permalink">7/29/16, 10:19 AM</a><br><br>

It comes down to the interests you pointed out in your 5th fizzle factor.<br><br>Earlier in your post you pointed out that the same kind of disinformation campaign was deployed against same-sex marriage as is being used to undermine action on climate change. But from the point of view of interests, the two issues have some pretty big differences. <br><br>In the case of same-sex marriage, there was strong opposition from some people on religious grounds, but the reaction of most people I know -- including staunch conservatives -- was: "This affects me how? Ummm... it doesn't." So even though many of them weren't thrilled by the prospect, it didn't work directly against their own interests, either. So many of them were willing to adopt a live-and-let-live attitude.<br><br>This is way different than what was being asked of people in order to address the climate change issue. What's being asked of people here is to turn their backs on life as they know it. Or at least is seems that way. Everyone implicitly understands that adopting a smaller carbon footprint, at least in the near to medium turn, is going to impose some pretty hefty costs either in (what they perceive as) reduced standard of living or up-front investment in alternative energy systems. Businesses understand that reliable and steady electricity is vital to their operation and that they will immediately find themselves on the "bleeding edge" if they move to adopt "greener" business practices while their competitors suck down coal-generated juice to their hearts' content.<br><br>And finally, everyone understands that this is a global problem, and without global action, the problem simply won't be solved. This is a classic "tragedy of the commons" scenario. And the global elites are the most invested of anyone in the status-quo. The last 20 years have demonstrated conclusively that they will try to sabotage any actions that work against those interests.<br><br>In short, adopting a smaller carbon footprint does not appear to be in just about anyone's short-term interest. Thus, as you correctly point out, even climate-change activists find it difficult to accept the adjustments needed to make an honest run at a sustainable long-term lifestyle. <br><br>I think the reason that climate-change activists did not put forth a positive program is that it's hard to envision what a world would look like. I mean, other than just harkening back to the 19th century, possibly gussied up with a thin varnish of modest technology. Tough to live like that in the modern world. Just paying your property taxes pretty much requires you to be plugged in to our present economic system. Some people of extraordinary vision and determination can do it, but most can't. That's where we are.<br><br>It costs somewhere in the vicinity of $20,000 to fit a home for solar power -- photovoltaics and hot water. Perhaps more if a northerly home is to be converted to passive solar space heating. Doing a little math, it would appear that diverting about 1/3rd of our war budget to a national program to convert our domestic infrastructure to solar could get the job done in one two-term federal administration. Why doesn't anyone mention this?<br><br>You know the answer. There are powerful and well-funded special interests invested in the US war machine, and other interests that have no interest in seeing their coal mines and power plants idled. Given that, even with such a domestic program, people would still suffer some inconveniences compared to their lives now, I think the chances of mustering up the political will to put such a program in place are near zero, until the choice is forced upon us.<br><br><a href=#c6349483928987050343 title="comment permalink">7/29/16, 3:44 PM</a><br><br>

Several years ago this part of Australia was in the midst of a major drought. In response, the State government came up with a $7 billion Recycling Scheme to 'drought-proof' it. The heart of the scheme would be that plants would take wastewater from major cities and make purified recycled water for supply to homes. The phrase 'toilet to tap' arose at this time and people were heavily against it but the government went ahead nonetheless. There were all the assurances from the experts that the water would be perfectly safe to drink.<br> One major drought-stricken city had a referendum and a majority of its citizens voted No when asked if they’d drink recycled sewage but they were ignored. Legislation was passed, though, that gave blanket immunity to the Government, water service providers &amp; operators in the event of any health damages associated with drinking recycled sewage. Also, it was noticed at the time that government offices were running up an enormous bill with bottled water deliveries.<br> Remember too that sewage can contain substances such as heavy metals, organochlorines (pesticides, pharmaceuticals, etc), viruses, and protozoa which is far, far more concentrated than you would find in any polluted river. The people in Flint, Michigan might have something to add to this topic.<br> And here is where it all fell down. The average person was fully aware that the major consumers of water in this state were not users - not even close - but farmers and the mining industry who were happy to take even the wastewater but the government absolutely refused to consider this option. People would be forced to drink recycled sewerage and that was it. No argument. And they would pay extra for the privilege. The open suspicion at the time was that those that could afford it would simply buy water bottled elsewhere (your wage versus salary class at work again).<br> In the end the billions were spent but the scheme was mothballed upon completion. It never made it to people's taps but instead produced water for local power stations but even that was stopped when it was found that the water produced was corroding equipment. And this water was considered safe for drinking purposes? If the government had built a pipeline to carry wastewater to farming communities it would have had support across the board but the government refused to look at this option and it is this sort of obstinacy and arrogance that makes most people dubious about climate activism.<br><br><a href=#c1981691509942261832 title="comment permalink">7/29/16, 6:20 PM</a><br><br>

This post and some of your comment replies have clarified why I find this particular effort attractive and rewarding. Consistent with what you suggested in your reply to Kim above, we're focused specifically on one incremental measure, the Clean Power Plan, addressing a specific segment of the problem, emissions from electrical power generation. And yes, progress, efficiency, and sustainability are invoked. This seems to have traction, for several reasons:<br><br>- There's a natural mental association between power outages and climate-change-related extreme weather events, including some recent ones in the region. Keeping the power flowing at all is an intuitively clear reason for diversifying and localizing its sources while also underscoring the need to take action to reduce the extreme events the future holds.<br><br>- Perhaps because of the above, the public in the state, of all general demographics, is in favor of reduced carbon emissions from power plants.<br><br>- People are already familiar with saving electricity, and are comfortable with the idea of conservation in that specific context which, unlike traveling less or purchasing fewer consumer goods, doesn't sound like arbitrary major lifestyle sacrifices at this stage.<br><br>- Fossil fuel extraction and fossil fuel power plants, besides carbon emissions, have other local and regional detrimental effects, especially (as usual) in poorer areas.<br><br>- We're advocating employment programs, especially in renewable energy, for displaced extraction workers (who are at risk of losing their livelihoods due to market forces in any case) as a necessary component of the Plan.<br><br>- It's a commons situation, and the effective remedy for the tragedy of the commons is legislation. We're focused on generating consensus (and leveraging the consensus that already exists), such as by petitioning, to lobby for legislative measures at the state and ultimately national level. Rather than trying to talk people one at a time into using less electricity or buying from lower-carbon suppliers.<br><br>In the end, the effect of implementing this or any other effective climate plan is that people will pay something a little closer to the true cost of the electricity they're using, via increased prices to cover the cost of implementing the reductions in the Plan. We don't exactly advertise it that way, but nor is it a secret that greater use of renewables, phasing out and replacing coal generation, promoting conservation, and similar measures will involve price increases.<br><br>It's too little too late to prevent disaster. But preventing worse disaster is still worthwhile.<br><br>I'm sure there's still a lot we could be doing better, though. I look forward to your future how-it-could/should-be-done post.<br><br><a href=#c4861742341672734152 title="comment permalink">7/29/16, 7:04 PM</a><br><br>

This week's post implicitly points to Retrotopia: if the climate change movement (the Peak Oil movement etc.) had worked towards an economy that both included working class people and reduced ecological impact, maybe they would have succeeded in reducing CO2 output.<br>However, years ago you proposed the spell "There is no brighter future". We all know that even if Retrotopia-style economical arrangements were made today all over the world, populations would still inevitably drop a lot, much knowledge and art would still be lost, and climate would still change substantially.<br>I see a conflict between proposing to the population at large a "brighter future" in the form of Retrotopia (trade barriers, corporation reform, decentralisation, taxation of resource use instead of labor, and all the rest) while the ones who are really in the know are perfectly aware that this is not a permanent solution, merely one step on a long descent.

In Germany, the anti-nuclear movement got a huge boost in 1981 from the stationing of NATO nuclear tactic missiles, and again in 1986 from Chernobyl. Not coincidentally, the Green party was elected to the federal parliament for the first time in 1982 (if I remember correctly), and they were very much anti-establishment: the salaries of the representatives were in part passed on to the party, representatives resigned after two years in order to "rotate" their power to other party members, Green party officials were expected to use trains all the time etc. Overall, the electoral share of the Green party has steadily increased over the years, especially after Fukushima. In 1998, they proposed reducing the taxation of labor through increasing the taxation of CO2 production, which would have triplicated the price of gasoline (in Retrotopia spirit). In spite of an uproar, they managed to enact a more modest proposal in this direction after coming to government in the same year. All of this happened even before the decisions to close down all nuclear reactors and build up PV and wind turbines, which are more or less consensus nowadays.<br><br>It seems to me that the environmental movement in Germany, and even in Brazil, where it is weaker, avoided many, if not all of the five mistakes you enumerated in this week's post, which is why a large majority of the population in both countries continues to believe in a human contribution to climate change. They did what you suggested here. And yet, all environmental reforms that have been enacted pale in comparison to what needs to be done.<br><br><a href=#c1061495050785223971 title="comment permalink">7/29/16, 8:41 PM</a><br><br>

I think there are some reasons other than what JMG mentioned in this week's post. Fear might contribute to why I and many other people, who know what the real future will look like, can't bring themselves to change their lifestyles.<br><br>First, there's the fear that losing first-world comforts is worse than it actually is. I've reasoned with myself that a second-world lifestyle isn't so bad, and when I think about it more deeply, I see that eventually the loss of those extra luxuries won't matter much to my happiness. But for some reason, when I consider changing my lifestyle, I think of all the negative aspects rather than the positive aspects.<br><br>Second, there's the fear of doomsday. Whenever I think about living more sustainably, images of war, disease, starvation, and dictatorship immediately pop up, and I focus on fearing and imagining the future rather than thinking about making gradual changes. It's probably because I still haven't broken free of the dual-opposite thinking mode of modern culture. Or maybe it's because I have a scientist/engineer mind, and for reasons discussed 2 weeks ago, I try to make everything uncertain into a certainty.<br><br>Third, there's the fear of missing out. At the end of the day, Americans don't even care about the planet enough to give up their SUV. No real change will happen until the collapse breaks people's mindsets and we can rebuild society. So I've become a defeatist and I think enjoying today's luxuries while they're still here, then blowing my head off if/when it gets so bad that the meaning of life is about subsistence/survival, instead of progress/success/enjoyment, is a sound strategy. Plus I unburden the planet a little!<br><br>The fourth reason is that I and everybody else who knows the damage they're doing to the world, but don't make any changes, are selfish and immoral. I know exactly the harm I am doing to the lower classes, future generations, and the stability of the world. Yet I would rather enrich myself at the expense of everybody else, since the future will be the same even if I don't.<br><br>That's just hard reality. Perhaps I'm thinking too negatively, bordering close to doomer thinking. But for now all I can do is prepare as best as I can, within the boundaries of social conformity and time, while drinking the last few sweet barrels of oil.<br><br><a href=#c5821547343286559623 title="comment permalink">7/29/16, 9:59 PM</a><br><br>

As for your choice of examples, if you want to use the fight against tobacco as a model, I won't argue too loudly; still, don't dismiss the lessons that can be learned by careful study of dissimilar cases. A couple of things the campaign for same sex marriage did were brilliant, and involved deliberate rejection of some of the worst bad habits of the contemporary left. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Glenn, and there you have it. Thank you. <br><br>Fred, unlike you, I've met some activists from left and right alike who do in fact walk their talk. A minority, granted, but they do exist. <br><br>Synthase, yes, and that's also an option, though it's one for which I'd feel enough distaste that I'd want to leave it for somebody else. <br><br>Prizm, you misunderstood what I was saying. The commenter mentioned that he wasn't sure which climate sources to use, and I explained that I wasn't a good person to ask for suggestions as I bring some additional skills to the examination of climate-related news squibs that some others don't have. I'd invite you to show me where I claimed that he should believe what I say just because I have some scraps of a scientific education! Still, if you want to yell "hypocrisy" on the basis of a misunderstanding on your part, by all means...<br><br>Logan, you're approaching the question in a very simplistic manner. All energy isn't equal. If, let's say, we replace half the fossil fuel energy currently used in manufacturing with energy derived from human muscles, that involves providing jobs to one heck of a lot of working class people -- in what way does this prevent them from having food, jobs, and housing? In the same way, moving from fossil fuel agriculture to intensive human-powered agriculture creates jobs and lowers carbon output at the same time. Looking at "energy" as a black box blinds you to that. I will be arguing, in fact, that the optimum energy per capita in terms of providing jobs, food, and housing for human population is considerably lower than what we're using today -- but that will have to wait for a later post. <br><br>Rebecca, clearly hypocrisy doesn't grate on members of the affluent classes; they seem to have a remarkable tolerance for it, in fact. It's the working classes who are becoming incensed at the hypocrisy of the affluent, and that, to my mind, is the prime political fact of the next half century or so. Your cousin the environmental hypocrite may want to think about what happens when the foundations of her comfortable lifestyle go away, because the people who have been carrying the costs while she gets the benefits are no longer interested in sitting down and shutting up...<br><br>Clay, that's why cutting greenhouse gas emissions has to be taken one step at a time -- and that's as true on a political level as it is a personal one. <br><br>David, many thanks! <br><br>MichaelK, if you're going to make a constructive response to climate change wait on the complete transformation of modern society, you're never going to accomplish anything. That's been one of the millstones around the neck of the radical left since the 1960s. I'm not talking about a couple of laws being passed by Congress, and it's frankly disingenuous of you to claim that I am -- I've discussed at great length the scale of the changes that will have to be made. It still seems more useful to me to try to make those happen than to sit on my backside waiting for a revolution to do them for me. <br><br>Clay, I suspect an honest poll would find that more Americans respect Vladimir Putin than either Clinton or Trump!<br><br><a href=#c2426643900839492707 title="comment permalink">7/29/16, 11:54 PM</a><br><br>

Maybe it's just that I hang out with lots of Druids or something, but I still know a lot of people who are into the low-tech green wizardry approach. <br><br>Paulo, exactly. What a tremendous waste.<br><br>M Smith, you might want to see if a current version of OpenOffice will run on an XP. That'll open and work with current Word versions. <br><br>Greg, it's always a balancing act, no question. With regard to your roof, have you considered having a second, peaked roof built over it, with the space between well ventilated and the space below the old roof insulated to a fare-thee-well? That would be the obvious old-fashioned appropriate tech response...<br><br>Shastatodd, do you think they enjoy their lifestyles any more than you enjoy yours? Really? <br><br>Cyclone, you may be right about the sudden quiet among activists. Most of the things that people used to be yelling about are happening right now -- the methane emissions, the ice caps melting, etc., etc. It's got to be uncomfortable for them to reflect on that! <br><br>John, 10% is a very, very good start. That's one of the things that a successful strategy needs to keep in mind: it's not about solving everything with one single solution, it's about applying one fix after another to drive down greenhouse gas emissions notch by notch by notch. As for the time factor, people do amazing things in the hopes of getting into heaven after the Second Coming, which is some indefinite distance into the future, so I question your basic assumption!<br><br>Bob, and that's another point worth discussing.

I'd like to reply to your comment on mine. Historical differences of course exist and abide and their consequences basically pervade the domains of politics, values, interests, how our societies works and, especially, how our respective societes have shaped the geography of their territories. However, in my opinion, the differences between Europe and North America are more geographical than historical when it comes to how our respective future will be shaped. For example, my guess is that Europe has less ressources in arable land than North America just for a matter of size, the rates of the artificial degradation of soil being roughly equal. As an independant research exercise, I'm currently compiling data on the topic for Western Europe and I try to pin-point the different policies enacted in the EU that impact the articifial degradation of soils.

Forget about the future, forget about 'giving up convenience' for a noble cause, or saving trees, whales or humanity. Just think very selfishly about how you could be a happier person.<br><br>Because you are a scientist/engineer type, you can do all this research yourself (also, I am lazy and incompetent at adding links).<br><br>Putting the car away and walking/running/biking everywhere will make you strong, fit, healthy, and crazy high on endorphins.

Farmers' markets are the most cheerful shopping environments I have ever been in, also I bump into everyone I know there. Shopping at the local grocer, deli, butcher and baker with my little trolley on wheels means I connect with people who work with food every day. Cooking, not my thing, but when I drop into the butcher to pick up my local, pasture-fed meat, she tells me exactly how to cook it and what to serve with it. I not only get food, but connections and conversation. Good for mental health. First time in my life that shopping=happy.<br><br>When I decided not to buy more 'stuff' a whole great new world opened up to me. Instead of buying stuff, I beg and borrow from friends and neighbours, which makes them feel comfortable to do that with me.

Later this week my neighbour, a lovely old bloke who loves a chat, is bringing his chainsaw up to cut off some posts for me. So instead of being independent and buying stuff I have increased my feeling of well-being by practising community, which also makes me feel secure, because I know we will be there for each other in hard times.<br><br>The other brilliant thing about buying second-hand or local is the possibility for creativity. You sound like a practical person - I tell you, you will never have more fun than limiting yourself to second-hand materials to complete a project. If you are an engineer you would just love my local tip shop. It is like a giant, challenging puzzle to work out how to make something old into something new. Limits, of any kind, are an enormous spur to creativity.<br><br>(cont..)<br><br><br><br><a href=#c6309450747687972349 title="comment permalink">7/30/16, 2:24 AM</a><br><br>

And you know, I don't see this as a sacrifice. I am planning to continue to dig deep into my island state - climb the mountains, swim the lakes and beaches, camp and walk and hike. I believe that a sense of place and a connection with the land I live on will make me happier than any exotic holiday.<br><br>Lastly, getting rid of the TV - I thought that would be hard, not for me, but for my teenagers. Nope. They have become readers. We walk to the library every week and stock up.

They don't really seem to be. And I don't really think the environmental movement believes in itself. Clearly many environmentalists also think it would be really hard to give up 'stuff' and 'convenience'. But we all know deep down - happiness is about connections with people, about finding what we are good at and doing it well, about being involved in a project larger than ourselves, and even as simple as giving our bodies what they were designed for - good food and lots of exercise.<br><br>'Stuff' and 'convenience' is a terrible lie. Choose one thing, endgame, one thing that will make you truly happy, and give it a go. Yes, the world is full of terrible iniquities, but you aren't going to change a single one of them by being miserable about it. Cast away fear, get out of that car and go for a walk.

No wonder the prols eat Cheetos and Taco Bell when organic "artisanal" is consistently marketed as a high end, wealthy, salary class thing, and class barriers erected. Of the farms I've worked on, only the one in Ontario was not elitist, and she was laid off wage class who used her severance package to buy her farm, and her son drove cross country semi before farming. One of the most interesting aspects of Canada was that there seemed to be less class barriers, I remember being shocked to see grocery cashiers and other wage class members participating in biodynamic and other organic organizations--that would certainly not fly in my part of the US, as we enact strict barriers between wage and salary class, and organics is no exception. Of course, the wage class in Canada doesn't make the poverty wages that they do in the US.<br><br><a href=#c6326191528458649565 title="comment permalink">7/30/16, 2:36 AM</a><br><br>

I had a very enjoyable time as the discussions - just like here in the comment section - vary far and wide over a huge diversity of topics. I urge anyone who has considered attending to come and join the lively and friendly discussion group as I believe they will enjoy it too and find it worthwhile. Greetings to the Ohio tower too! :-)!<br><br>However, I'd like to pose you with a, well it wasn't quite a question that was posed today, it was more of a search, or perhaps even a confusion, honestly I fail to put words to the many thoughts, so please forgive me if my English if is not quite up to the task of expressing the nature of the dilemma posed...<br><br>Now, I personally believe and I stated it today at the meetup that you are too clever to be pinned down to a particular and singular response to the predicaments facing industrial society. My gut feeling is that you prefer a dissensus approach when it comes to practical responses hoping that scatter-gun approach will succeed where perhaps a more rigid and defined response will be a weakness. I agree with you too, if it means anything. You may be very interested to know that I am now producing quite a good grade of rice wine (sake), whilst at the same time learning to reproduce the yeast. Just sayin... You know what I mean.<br><br>The thing is that my path involves unpleasant activities such as moving many cubic metres of manure, much manual labour and also a definitive loss of social status and other perquisites. Mind you, I have had high status in the past and I pointed out today that if something that was so easily lost, what was it worth in the first place? Anyway, my gut feel was that people were looking for some sort of direction, but I'm not really sure on that score to be honest.<br><br>Like you, perhaps, I have no desire to lead on this occasion as I'd prefer if people discovered their own paths, but the payoff for supporting things as they are - despite the finite lifespan of that option - is quite good, even still.<br><br>It was hard to explain that I chose the path that I did because of accumulated experiences and so I drew a line in the sand and said I will go no further. But then that speaks to my sense of the understanding of the beauty and power of limitations, but other people have troubles seeing that as it requires much to be given up in the process. And I feel their pain too, that I cannot help but feel.<br><br>I was sort of hoping that you may have some words for those people?<br><br>I'm sure that Fidel felt like Galadriel as he put dissenters into gulags during the special period... <br><br>"And now at last it comes. You will give me the Ring freely! In place of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I shall not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Dreadful as the Storm and the Lightning! Stronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair!” <br><br>I would feel no different, but still would do the same.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c7937150660999049255 title="comment permalink">7/30/16, 6:19 AM</a><br><br>

This is one of the themes of the 20th century, perhaps destined to make it known in history books as the Epoch of Excess. <br><br>Passenger aviation is of some use, in moving key government, managerial, scientific, or performing-arts personnel around quickly, as in the early 1940s. But the later 20th century took it beyond its optimum, to a point at which it has been encouraging people to make frivolous journeys. (In wartime Britain, the railway stations had good posters, with the words "Is Your Journey Really Necessary?" I do not think we have seen that in the postwar airports.) <br><br>Computing is of use in government and science. The technology attained a kind of maturity in the mid-1990s with the advent of the personal Linux or BSD Unix workstation, running a bare-bones graphic user interface in the "X Window" environment. But since then we have taken a good thing too far, to the point where our social fabric is fraying under the impact of Twitter, Facebook, and porn, as people mistakenly consider computers appropriate for recreation. <br><br>Radio, in its state of maturity in the 1930s, was good (radio universal on ships, and common in police cars in some jurisdictions; transmitters rather readily available to the amateur experimenter; mass broadcasting sufficiently advanced to allow even such things as the BBC "Empire Service"). What came later - most strikingly, mass-market television - was less good. One notes here the insight of the 1930s BBC head, Lord Reith, in accepting a prewar television set into his home only with reluctance, and in predicting that this emerging technology - I think the government, the engineers included, forced it on the 1936 BBC rather against Lord Reith's will - would eventually prove toxic. <br><br>In general, I have been thinking of technologies as resembling plums. There is a point at which they are green and immature. There is a point at which they are past their peak, being overdeveloped and overripe. <br><br>What I now take from your posting of "7/29/16, 11:54 PM" is that the metaphor of an optimum point applies also to per-capita expenditure on energy. Do please in future consider writing an essay or book on this, as your time may permit. <br><br><br>Tom <br><br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a><br><br><br><a href=#c1416356805483744543 title="comment permalink">7/30/16, 9:49 AM</a><br><br>

But the Greens have not recently passed the 5-percent-of-votes threshold for returning a member to the Riigikogu. <br><br>Voting in Canada, I grit my teeth and do vote Green. <br><br>In Estonian elections, at the ballot box here in Toronto, I have hitherto made the (prudent) calculation that moderate-Right Isamaa-Res Publica Alliance (Alliance = Liit; IRL) needs every vote it can get, in the face of threats to national sanity both from the Savisaar left and from the emerging, strident, farther Right. Now I realize that in taking Estonian decisions, I will have to keep Deutschland more in view, even if I do not in the end change this pro-IRL calculation. <br><br>It is said that politics is the art of the possible. However, we do well not to underestimate the limits to what might in one or another country prove possible. <br><br><br>Tom = Toomas<br><br>(in Estonian diaspora, just north of Toronto)<br><br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a><br><br><a href=#c5581449678398024907 title="comment permalink">7/30/16, 10:24 AM</a><br><br>

A lot of people I know who are into such things don't have the resources to buy a house, but can make rent."<br><br>Yes, I have thought about renting but I'm not there are many young people who could afford it or who are will to take care of it. There is no work involved with the solar energy system, it runs itself. But if we can’t find buyers it is one of the options we will explore.<br><br>I would like to hang onto the property and pass it on to one of our sons. We have two sons in college, a freshman studying culinary arts and a junior studying engineering technology, who live at home. My hope was that after college they would find work here, settle in our community and raise a family. Unfortunately, graduation and finding work are several years in the future, and who knows if they will find a job here after college.<br><br>Another issue is that having grown up living this way they aren’t keen on the idea of living this way. It requires a great deal of work! It takes a real commitment, cooperation, and lots of helping hands to make it work. I know of families dedicated to sustainable living, whose children aren't interested in continuing to live like this.<br><br>On the bright side, our sons understand the reasons for doing what we do. They both love to cook and eat fresh food. They sometimes make comments about how nice it is to hear the sound of frogs at night or the wind rustling through the trees (the rewards of a simple life). My younger son works for his university department's Head Chef, who grows fresh food in raised bed gardens on campus. My older son uses new technology but he is interested in learning to make charcoal and blacksmithing. They talk to us about social and environmental issues and I’m so proud that they really do understand the issues.<br><br>We don't always agree on solutions and it can be disconcerting to face their certainty that they are right and we are wrong. It's very true, having a PhD makes it really hard to not to say "Don't argue with me, I'm an expert!" It's not easy letting them have the last word, but someone has to stop arguing and agree to disagree! <br><br>I understand what life is like when you are 18 to 24 and you want to break out of the mold your parents set for you. There are some things our parents taught us that we didn’t appreciate until after we passed 30. Children need to make their own choices about who they want to be as adults. Our sons know how fortunate they are to have had the opportunities and education we are providing them. Their future may not provide them with the same economic opportunities or security we have had, but they have a good foundation to grow upon.<br><br>I know there are difficult and uncertain times ahead, and I wish every young person had the same opportunities we've been able to offer our children. I think that by teaching young people to invest in things of lasting value, to think for themselves, to work with their hands, to value the rewards of hard work and a simple life, we give them the best chance we can to meet the challenges of the future.<br><br>sincerely,<br>Soilmaker<br><br><a href=#c7459123667524382058 title="comment permalink">7/30/16, 11:45 AM</a><br><br>

If it was just that, a matter of "data and evidence", and diligently explaining concepts and numbers and charts and graphs, then maybe I would have a better attitude.<br><br>But it's this towering moral superiority and talking about "settled science" that gets up my nose. My instincts tell me that for such complex phenomena as climate, never mind climate CHANGE, the science could not possibly be anywhere close to being "settled". That's not to say that what there is has no basis. But that's to say that a lot of work still needs to be done. In short, it looks to me like a case of stifling dissent within the scientific community in aid of other agendas be they careerist or political or whatever.<br><br>I really don't like the word "settled". In my humble opinion saying that science is "settled" implies boundaries on investigation and inquiry. Last I checked this isn't Galileo's era and the scientific community isn't the Roman Catholic Church. There needs to be a lot more humility. As you say don't demonize honest disagreement. After all the dissenter might have a point. <br><br>As you say this isn't just a matter of pure academic interest that has no immediate application. And so there are personal and collective interests at stake.<br><br>I can't help remembering how enforced consensus clamped down on archaeological investigation to the point that scientists would ignore physical evidence that contradicted the Clovis First theory. Either shut up and pretend that contrary evidence isn't there or risk your professional standing. Of course, the evidence piled up and then the dam burst. Defying academic unanimity doesn't come without a career "body-count".<br><br>Science isn't just about facts and evidence. I've read about other instances of Clovis First-like behaviour. There's ambition and egos and careers and rivalries and who's hipper and more progressive and all that toxicity. And this climate change issue seems to be unusually toxic. I look at the guys standing tall and lecturing and the chicks looking up adoringly. Makes me laugh. <br><br>Frankly, I'm past being "hip". Too old. Too much posturing. Can't be bothered. Besides, I won't impress any chicks. And I too remember the ice-age scare.<br><br><a href=#c393763166988900696 title="comment permalink">7/30/16, 11:54 AM</a><br><br>

Back then, if they mentioned that scientists say the climate was going to warm, people would have thought, oh nice… no more brutal winters! But if they said, which they DID say, scientists say we’re headed for a new ice age, then they can put a WE’RE DOOMED spin and slant on it and get more eyeballs and ears to read, watch, and listen, which would be better for THEM cause then the advertisers get to shell out more money for ad space and air time.<br><br>I am soooo cynical… ;^)<br><br><a href=#c4975858614359596897 title="comment permalink">7/30/16, 1:05 PM</a><br><br>

But then my metaphor melted with the rest of polar ice! <br><br>We're living in the Anthropocene and advanced industrial societies and burgeoning consumption driven by consumer capitalism with its relentless advertising and the siren song of its media is drawing most of the developing world down the road to ecocide. Consequently we face not only a warming and less hospitable climate, arable land is disappearing due to chemical fertilizes and industrial agriculture. Our waterways and wetlands are imperiled by these same practices. Forests are cleared for expanding populations, for cattle grazing and for palm oil plantations for cosmetics and junk food. The entire ocean food chain is imperiled as the base of the chain, the phytoplankton, face depletion. The coral reefs are disappearing and with them the many species that reside therein. Industrial fishing practices threaten countless species. The sixth extinction event is well underway, the only such cataclysm sparked by a single species -- us.<br><br>This is not a comforting message to convey. As I've written elsewhere, even if we somehow stopped all fossil fuel emissions tomorrow, we'd still face a host a dire environmental threats due to the wanton consumption habits of modern advanced societies. <br><br>Just a few quibbles: The climate change movement stands guilty as charged in most respects. However, the comparison with the gay rights movement is facile. Once most folks learned that their marriage was not imperiled by the nice gay couple next door getting married, things began to change rapidly. It didn't take science to belie the propaganda. A more apt comparison would be with the the tobacco industry and the fight to restrict smoking. We know that the fossil fuel industry is using the tried and true tactics of Big Tobacco to cloud the air, so to speak, with misinformation. Naomi Orestes, if for nothing else, deserves credit for her book "Merchants of Doubt" that exposed the industry funded misinformation campaign.<br><br>I recently gave a talk at the 50th reunion of my college graduation class entitled: "Retiring Green in the Anthropocene" in which I argued that those who grew up as mass consumer culture came into its fullest, most wasteful expression, owe it to our children and grandchildren to mend our ways in the final quarter of our lives. Among the targets of my proposal: air travel. No generation before ours who hit young adulthood as Frank Sinatra was crooning "Come Fly with Me" took it for granted that they could traverse a continent or an ocean in a few hours time. Such habits were the result of a fluke convergence of technology, cheap energy, and affluence. It can't and it won't last. Thanks for underscoring that fact.<br><br>In that talk and others I give, I pick on another major industry we could do without -- the sugary soft drink industry. Each day thousands of diesel spewing trucks hit the road to carry sugar laden soft drinks from factory to distribution centers, then to retail outlets. Countless gallons of water are used to produce products with no redeeming value -- they contribute only to the epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay. Want a suggestion for step one in changing your lifestyle? Get rid of that Coke, Pepsi, or Dr. Pepper and enjoy a cool glass of water.<br><br>Peace<br><br><br><br><a href=#c1654209909790027978 title="comment permalink">7/30/16, 4:03 PM</a><br><br>

In the former, there was little or no person expense or inconvenience for people to accept it (with the possible exception of the few who took it as a moral outrage that they could not live with). And it came with some significant financial incentives from the community involved. <br><br>Climate change, on the other hand, could offer only negatives at least in the short term. Regardless of class, everyone would have their life style moved down a notch or two. As usual, the wealthy would suffer less, but everyone would feel the pain.<br><br>I think this reality explains a lot of the history of the climate change movement. Just like when the link between tobacco and cancer was first publicized, there are those who denied it (with the help/reinforcement of the tobacco industry), those who thought they could escape the ill effects if they only took the right vitamins, those who believed but found it hard to quit, and those that were quick to adopt and accept the new info. You can find similar camps with climate change, the big difference is the sacrifice is a much bigger one for all. That is why Al Gore flew to give his speeches, why most struggle so hard to come up with a way to continue personal transportation by car, the ability to run their AC in the summer, and use heat in the winter. These modes of energy use are so ingrained that it is too big a leap for most to give them up. Especially if few of their neighbors/friends are abandoning them, and they themselves are not being forced to do so. Even when the warning signs of more weather extreme events should be seen as a warning shot over the bow.<br><br>Your class analysis is valid (as usual), but not IMO the reason for the political failure of the movement. The working class has as much to loose in their day to day life as any other class, perhaps more. Yes the well off use more carbon, but they have more of everything, and in this society there is a fossil fuel component to everything we do or have. Most working class folks I know would be very hard pressed if fossil fuels went away or were severely limited. Yes, for them it may well be a matter of survival, whereas for the wealthy it is more an inconvenience, but the stakes are just that much higher for them, no? <br><br>Limiting fossil fuel use will disrupt everyone's life, from the uber wealthy to the homeless. That is why it has been such a hard sell, IMO. Very few people want to be early adopters (unlike the latest gadget or video game), no gain for a long time to come.<br><br>It's one thing when someone is yelling a tsunami is coming and you see them running for the hills. Another when they are yelling global warming is coming and they continue flying around. In the first case the risk is immediate, in the second not only is it not coming soon, but it doesn't seem critical enough for that speaker to change their lifestyle, at least not yet.<br><br>You might think gov't would step in and have the long term vision needed to address this, but you'd be wrong. Gov't has more immediate problems, a lack luster economy, a distrustful voting population. Sacrifices for some future vision which worsens those immediate problems does not get you re-elected. You need only look at Trump's stated views on climate change to see where the majority of his supporters come down on that topic and its importance.<br><br>No in many ways, the problem of climate change is perhaps the perfect storm for modern man. Due to our political structures and cross-class societal distrust, it is impossible to deal with the problem in a rational way. Unless that changes, and soon, it will likely be our downfall.<br><br><a href=#c3831322090065012478 title="comment permalink">7/30/16, 4:13 PM</a><br><br>

Every day, almost all of us are working and consuming in the pollution based economy… yet we each have an understandable aversion to giving up our own money or status, We are trying to change the status quo. But we all have a stake in it too. We all rely upon it to survive. And so, every day, we end up feeding the monster we are fighting. This is a humbling fact.” (110)<br>“A lof of environmental rhetoric remains rooted in “crisis” language. It is evident that people who already have a lot of opportunity are sometimes powerfully motivated to act by tales of a planetary crisis. But people who already live in a constant state of personal crisis are not so moved. In fact, they often have the opposite reaction to hearing about things like global warming… But if you tell people who are living in a state of constant personal crisis about the economic solutions inherent in the green economy, then they get excited.” (p.103)<br>“To change our laws and culture, the green movement must attract and include the majority of all people, not just the majority of affluent people. The time has come to move beyond eco-elitism to eco-populism. Eco-populism would always foreground those green solutions that can improve ordinary people’s standard of living- and decrease their cost of living” (p.98)<br>Van Jones, The Green Collar Economy, 2008.<br><br><a href=#c514383371631980317 title="comment permalink">7/30/16, 7:21 PM</a><br><br>

Perhaps you can tell me what this has to do with the subject of this post. <br><br>Nestorian, fascinating. It's entirely possible to make a moral argument for reducing greenhouse gases from a relativist standpoint, but you have to use the kind of consequentialist argument Aristotle used: "greenhouse gas emissions cause x, y, and z, and if you agree that x, y, and z are unwelcome, then we need to cut greenhouse gases." That sort of argument doesn't work as a basis for self-righteous indignation and sneering contempt for disagreement, of course, which may be why it's not so popular these days -- though it may explain why I find Aristotle far more congenial than most of today's writers on the subject of environmental ethics! What you're saying, I think, amounts to the suggestion -- which seems justified to me -- that people who don't believe in an absolute standard of right and wrong handed down by a divine lawgiver have no business acting as though they've smuggled in a surrogate Jehovah just for this one situation. Would that be a fair description? <br><br>Whomever, as I've been saying for years, living in cities is a valid choice, and can be made as ecologically sustainable as living on the imaginary thirty acre homestead that most people seem to have welded into their brains as the only green option. <br><br>Thijs, as I mentioned in response to another commenter, I was carrying out one of my duties as head of AODA when I took that flight. Now that I've stepped down from that position, I no longer have the duty in question. Still, if you want to have a moral purity trial, why, I'm sure you can find some other reason to dismiss what I have to say, if that's really what you want to do. <br><br>Bruce, you may well be right. One of the things I'm trying to do via the Retrotopia story, and a number of my other posts here, is to point out that using a good deal less energy and the products of energy can be more fulfilling and more fun than the options we've got now, but the Puritan streak in American culture won't admit that possibility. The cult of self-righteous hair-shirt asceticism in the environmental left doesn't help that, either. <br><br>Shane, you're misinformed, but it's an understandable mistake. What happens is that as more heat enters the atmosphere, the efficiency with which heat is conveyed from the tropics to the poles increases sharply, and so the poles heat up far more quickly than the equator. In the same way, during an ice age, the tropics cool mildly and the poles drop into the deep freeze, because the efficiency of heat transport from the tropics drops off sharply. <br><br>Nuku, yep. Since grid tied PV does impose certain costs on the whole system, due especially to intermittency, a case can probably be made for the fee. <br><br>Fred, the only things I've had to delete here were some climate denialist trolls and some people who used profanity. I occasionally check out the comments to my post on resilience.org if I want a good laugh, but not otherwise. <br><br>Jessi, I'm fond of Neven's blog as well -- thanks for giving it a shout. <br><br>LatheChuck, hmm. That sounds interesting -- and two weeks of relative solitude and calm crossing the Atlantic could be very, very pleasant! <br><br>Nestorian, but if I hadn't booked that seat, it's possible that it might have gone empty, in which case the airline would have lost a little money and had a little less incentive to add new flights, or what have you. No, it's an issue, but -- as I said at the time -- my carbon offset consists of never having had a car or a driver's license. We all make the best compromises we can, which is why the kind of hectoring moral self-righteousness you've criticized is never a good idea!<br><br><a href=#c292256892050857877 title="comment permalink">7/30/16, 8:05 PM</a><br><br>

Her primary points were that modern economics refuses to admit that people are interdependent, that the work performed primarily by women in regards to carrying for family and household economics is grossly undervalued and ignored in GDP calculations, and that the modern "homo economicus" construct embodies only traditionally masculine attributes such as violence, competition, and greed at its core, purposely excluding other values. <br><br>This relates to the climate change debate. "Economic man dominates through the force of his masculinity. A company's profits can in the same way be allowed to dominate all other ambitions... Justice, equality, care, the environment, trust, physical and mental health are subordinate... And that's the very function of economic man. To flee. To deny the body, emotion, dependency, and context. ... Dependency had for centuries been seen as shameful. It was something that slaves and women were."<br><br>Westerners can't embrace climate change because it flies in the face of not just the myth of progress but the modern myth of just what man is - an autonomous individual that makes his own destiny. How can you sell the opposite?<br><br>If you have to wait on a bus you're not a conquering warrior. Arriving someplace hot and sweaty from biking, or soaking wet, puts you down on the level of field hands, the unwashed "am ha'aretz" that Western people largely imagine they are above and beyond. Etc and so on.<br><br>Not using the same amenities as everyone else makes you look poor, as someone else mentioned - the worst sin in an economy that believes, as Mercal put it, that "the econometric analysis of value is the only one that exists."<br><br>They can't cooperate, not really, because it's all about competition, profiteering, and status. They don't want to be either fair or equal. Trying to sell those to them is a waste of time. They won't buy it, especially when there are still going to be people who are more equal than others. Most people will not change until they can no longer afford to pay for their supposedly non-negotiable American way of life. It is not "rational" to do so either economically or socially at the present time.<br><br>So we are irrational, and we have to convince them to be irrational, in an economy/society that severely punishes irrationality. We should not great ourselves up for not being able to do this. The spiritual / mental / philosophical wind that could have carried this movement simply isn't yet in place and won't be until more people see the light - and it will some sort of further crisis, most likely.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c3434513902970635988 title="comment permalink">7/30/16, 8:41 PM</a><br><br>

A roof with succulents can handle fluctuations in aridity and the water content of the plants minimizes fire risk. The roof is naturally insulating.

(In other words, we reject the Humean claim that there is a "naturalistic fallacy" in deriving an "ought" from an "is.")<br><br>If climate change activists want any hope of winning over this particular constituency, then sneering at them in disdain for their stances on abortion, same-sex marriage, etc., will only achieve the exactly opposite effect - as an examination of any internet comment thread that somehow involves climate change within this particular cultural sphere will quickly reveal. <br><br>At the very least, climate change activists would need to cultivate the art of "dissensus" sufficiently to understand and empathize with where the cultural conservatives might be coming from on these issues. And more fundamental considerations of relativism versus objectivism would also have to be duly discussed and settled in some mutually agreeable way.

I was surprised that the Greens weren't already on the ballot, as there are always a ton of down-ballot third parties every time I've ever voted for president in KY. Now, I fully expect KY to go Trump by a wide margin. Regardless, I do think people should be given that option (Green), as I expect the third party protest vote to be significantly high this year due to the uninspiring GOP &amp; Democratic options.<br>I'm still not buying the excuses for inaction. The 70s example shows that we can find the power to embrace LESS and enjoy it. Honestly, the 70s are popularly remembered as The Last, Great, Fun Decade Before Everything Went South and Got Really Dark Afterward. Even people in their 20s &amp; 30s who weren't even alive have this warm fuzzy feeling about the 70s, and people who weren't old enough to have actually experienced the 70s are wistful that they couldn't (I turned 5 in 1980) Now, if LESS were really that horrible of a sentence, destroying all that's good in life, why the fond collective memory of the last time we collectively embraced LESS, as well as the negative memories of the neoliberal reaction starting in the 80s? Sorry, not buying it.<br>RE: Tobacco control. I'm not so sure that this is a good example to use. I think that is proves, as JMG has said, that humans are not rational creatures and cannot be made rational w/out severe damage. In spite of draconian anti-tobacco restrictions (outdoor bans, exorbitant taxes, etc.), a robust 10-20% of adults still smoke. Since at least the 1960s, smoking cannot be considered rational because it flies in the face of all the evidence. Yet that 10-20% still smoke, and it's taken draconian measures to even get the rate down that low (eventually, the biophobia behind it will wear off, people will lose interest, and the rate will go back up even w/out a powerful tobacco industry) The anti-smoking effort makes the mistake of thinking that people are rational, and make decisions based on rational evidence. People don't smoke for rational reasons, they smoke for non-rational reasons. Poor people in the US smoke (and take other risks w/their health) because their lives are wretched and the thought of living to 80-90 sounds like a nightmare--an earlier death would end their suffering. Yet the rational, salary class intellectual health movement does not account for this.<br>JMG, re: vegans, smoking, hair-shirt ascetic environmentalism, etc.--are Americans just cursed for all eternity w/Puritanism and a stark-raving fear of joie de vivre, or will a severe enough collapse/disruption drive a stake in Puritanism once and for all? Just wondering how resilient our Puritanism will be. For our part, the South traditionally always eschewed Puritanism/idealism/"city on a hill" as a foreign, Yankee idea, and it really didn't take root here until the explosion of evangelical Christianity amongst the lower classes in the late 1800s-early 1900s.<br><br><a href=#c6844167594764219502 title="comment permalink">7/31/16, 6:09 AM</a><br><br>

As to soda: "Countless gallons of water are used to produce products with no redeeming value -- they contribute only to the epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay. Want a suggestion for step one in changing your lifestyle? Get rid of that Coke, Pepsi, or Dr. Pepper and enjoy a cool glass of water."<br><br>Hah. I tell people this all the time. I tell the pretty young nurses who have lost their good figures due to being just a bit fat that if they would just give up the soft drinks they would likely drop 20 pounds without even dieting. I am met with silence. Apparently soda is non negotiable. <br>_______________<br>Nestorian,<br><br>You've assumed that moral relativism is not useful at all. But it is. Just because there are no absolutes does not mean there are not partials. So, if we say that we need the environment to live and something or other pollutes it, it is possible to say that we don't want to do that. Moral relativism can make a decision that something is good or not good for oneself, and one can get together with others and likewise decide as a group on whether something is good for us. What doesn't survive moral relativism is the golden rule.<br><br>And JMG, by the way, I find it an error in thinking that the moral absolutes are handed down by a divine lawgiver as if it were arbitrary. I think the moral absolutes are true in all times and places because they are built into the structure of life and spirit and are how the universe works. Like karma.<br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c4179140148342832001 title="comment permalink">7/31/16, 8:38 AM</a><br><br>

Whenever someone asks me why I don't drive I say "We are running out of oil and the best way to prepare for that is to stop using it now." I sometimes add that using oil isn't very good for the planet or that my principles are sometimes tested when I look at motorcycles, which I used to love. I've fielded a handful of negative responses, but only one or two in the strongly negative. The majority ~90% acknowledge or understand what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. It only comes up with people I already know when it inconveniences things. I don't go around advertising and I don't try to push it on anyone.<br><br> This summer I started commenting on the weather. I'm living in the town I grew up in and the weather has changed noticeably since the 80s and 90s. Whenever the topic of how hot or dry this summer is I try to mention how different it was 20-30 years ago and then say something to the effect of "and it's probably going to be like this (or get worse) for the rest of our lives." There is usually a heavy or sad moment and then the conversation moves on. So far no one has exploded or gotten angry with/at me. I don't mention CO2 because I don't need to.

IF we get the expected whammy of a downturn and he follows through on defaulting/renegotiating the national debt, as he has indicated, then that too may have a positive effect on consumption and carbon.

In the 70s people were connected. Social life, work, education, recreation, art, entertainment happened collectively. We went to movies in theaters with dozens or hundreds of other people. A garage band was a group of people in a garage with instruments, it was not an application on a computer. A club met face-to-face at least once a month. We all watched the same TV shows at the same time, and discussed them in person at work and school the next day. In short, people participated in society as a web of personal, in-the-flesh interactions.<br><br>Now, people are isolated inert atoms. We live in bubbles of information, entertainment, and ideas tuned specifically to our own idiosynchrocies. There is no network of actual people. There is not a real society of people who interact in real space and real time daily whether they want to or not. We are self-indulgent larvae attached to feeding tubes.

I’m a member of one of the less usual Unitarian-Universalist congregations. To tell how unusual, a few weeks ago we had a pagan service: our CUUPS chapter opened the service with a calling of the elements while the sermon was three sermonettes by a Wiccan, a Druid (ADF) and a member of our CUUPS chapter. All members of the congregation, and two of them were members of the Worship Committee. That’s far out even for UUs, especially for a congregation that’s one of the dozen largest congregations in the denomination.<br><br>Today something unusual happened in the service. It was one of the extremely rare services where we have a Christian theme, which started out with a reading from Genesis. I don’t have to take my socks off to count the number of times that’s happened in the seven or so years I’ve been a member of the congregation.<br><br>She went through the process where the Christian right was coopted by the moneyed classes back in 1940 as part of the reaction to the New Deal, by a minister who’d invented the “prosperity gospel,” although he didn’t call it that then, and Rev. Angela didn’t call it that either in this sermon. Then she mentioned that the Bible has a couple of thousand verses about the poor, maybe a dozen about divorce, and nothing whatsoever about abortion or same-sex marriage. Zero. Zilch. Nada. It's hard to even twist something out of shape to address those issues.<br><br>When she finished, something happened I have never, ever seen in any church service I’ve ever attended.<br><br>She got a standing ovation.<br><br>I don’t care whether the current corrupted Christianity listens to me. Jesus had something to say about what would happen to it at the End of Days. If you want my respect, you’ll take a good, hard look at what the old testament prophets had to say about the poor and the way the wealthy class (mis)treats them. And then about what Jesus and Paul are supposed to have said about the same subject.<br><br><a href=#c5334328607802350922 title="comment permalink">7/31/16, 3:08 PM</a><br><br>

Of course coal energy had to be addressed, but there were (and are) ways to do it that don't come across as a bunch of privileged middle class activists throwing the working class under the bus, and the movement never even considered that this was how it was going to come across. That made life incredibly easy for the other side. <br><br>Submarine, why, yes, the Russians have just a little bit of experience with trapping hostile armies in an urban environment and tightening the screws. If Turkey continues its rapprochement with the Russia-Iran alliance, the hippogriffs are toast. <br><br>Wendy, one can indeed. I hope I have the chance to sail on one someday. <br><br>DiSc, good! Yes, that's one to add to the list. Notice, along the same lines, that the federal subsidies for rooftop PV systems were tax rebates -- meaning that if you don't make enough money to pay enough taxes to cover the cost of a PV system in a reasonable time frame, the subsidies don't benefit you. Once again, something that was marketed as an environmental measure turned out to be a fashion statement for the affluent. <br><br>Crow, yes, I thought I'd see attempts to distract the discussion from "what can we do" to "what can we get upset about." That sort of deliberate distraction also plays a large role in keeping constructive change from happening. <br><br>Koen, actually, no, <i>Retrotopia</i> isn't about deindustrialization at all -- the Lakeland Republic has plenty of factories turning out the products of industry. It's a novel about the benefits of decomputerization. You're right, of course, that industrial society is very new -- as I suggested in <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i>, it's merely the first tentative sketch from which the far less wasteful and self-destructive technic societies of the future will eventually evolve -- but that's another issue entirely. <br><br>Jo, thank you. That sudden outburst of sanity earns you this evening's gold star. <br><br>Nuku, hmm! I'll look into that. It sounds like a lot of fun. <br><br>Eric, you've spotted one of the crucial ways in which the culture of intolerance in the climate change movement hamstrung its chances at success: the all or nothing attitude. I forget who pointed out here, some years ago, that one of the big differences between the right and the left is that the right looks for allies to embrace, while the left looks for heretics to exclude. Which one of those is a route to success? The history of the last forty years answers that. <br><br>Hereward, good. I wrote it for the next generation of activists, in the hope that they can avoid making the mistakes that will be pushed on them by their elders as "what you have to do if you want to make social change." <br><br>Dennis, that's another distraction. This really is entertaining -- discuss the reasons conventional activism fails, and people will find excuses to talk about absolutely anything but the reasons conventional activism fails! <br><br>Mark, you and Nuku have convinced me to look into that. Thank you. <br><br>William, I'm going to challenge that. You'll have to wait a few weeks, because it's going to take an entire post, but I'd like to suggest that it's possible to convince a very large number of people to back real cuts in CO2 emissions -- not grudgingly, but with enthusiasm -- if you approach it the right way.

This may generally be true, however I read a book several years ago that gave three examples of cultures making major changes. _The Honor Code: How Moral Revolutions Happen_ by Khame Appiah. The author is hoping to show a way to end the system of honor killings in the Muslim world. The examples he studied were the cessation of dueling in Western Europe, the end of foo-binding in China and the end of slavery. In the case of dueling he points out that the practice ceased within one lifetime--it was illegal but still practiced when Jane Austen wrote and all buy unheard of a few decades later. And this was a practice that had defined upper class honor for centuries. As for foot binding, he asserts that Chinese educated in Europe saw that the practice was considered barbarian by other nations and began to campaign to end it. I think we are seeing something similar in the move away from female genital mutilation. No Western power is sending in armies to stop it but African leaders themselves are responding to moral pressure.

I wonder at what point Trump's going to turn that one on Clinton. My guess is he'll wait until late September, and then do the equivalent of LBJ's ad with the little girl and the mushroom cloud, insisting that a vote for Clinton is a vote for World War Three. <br><br>Bill, that's pretty much the way I remember it, too. I was in high school 1977-1980, and did an essay in an 11th grade writing class on the coming ice age; I thought at the time it seemed very plausible. By 1990 I'd changed my mind as the evidence came in. <br><br>Emmanuel, thank you! That's worth having. <br><br>Donalfagan, yes, that's also a good example!<br><br>Trebor, I'd like to see some research into that effect that integrates class issues into the analysis. I know a lot of working class people who automatically assume that when a suit says something, he's lying, and the more purported facts he drags in to support his claim, the more sure they are that he's lying. I suspect that may be an important factor here. <br><br>Gwizard43, yes, it's been amusing, hasn't it? Everybody desperately trying to talk about everything other than the point of the post...<br><br>Helix, if you were approaching this from the point of view of someone who actually wanted to bring about change, wouldn't your first response to that analysis be, "Let's see, how can we repackage the changes we need to make so they don't look so overwhelming"? That can be done, quite easily, by breaking the work to be done into separate sub-issues that can be addressed one at a time -- but nobody in the movement seems to have been interested in doing that, since that would quite possibly have made for real change. <br><br>Jason, an "imagined letter"? That is to say, disinformation, trying to smear Brexit, Trump et al. by associating them with Daesh. No, there isn't anything to which the status quo won't stoop, is there? <br><br>Kevin, that's an excellent point. Stupid top-down programs that ignore people's needs -- yes, that would do it. <br><br>Bob, oh, it's with the people, and in particularly those in the US who have turned it into green equivalent of "est" -- I don't know how many people remember Werner Erhard's little content-free psych cult from the Seventies, but the way that permaculture gets marketed in the US often reminds me rather too much of that. The ideas themselves are fine.<br><br>Myriad, that's actually a great example of one of the core concepts I want to get across -- instead of trying to tackle a global problem at a single bite, take one specific part of the problem that people can understand as an issue in their own lives, focus on that, accomplish what you can, and go on to the next project. That's the way successful environmental projects have always worked: you don't try to save every species at once by a single program, you campaign to get this pesticide banned, to get that habitat protected, and so on, and build momentum as you rack up successes.

Yes, it is. While apples and oranges are not the same, and the differences really matter if you are, say, making a pie, they are also both fruit. They're juicy. They grow on trees, are roundish and roughly the size of baseballs, and are good to eat. That is to say, there are important attributes that they share. When making an analogy, context matters, right? JMG was focusing on the role of disinformation by opposing campaigns in his comparison. Objecting about other, irrelevant-to-that-point differences between the two risks burying the thread of the argument. I guess I can see that some readers were just analyzing the same comparison in another way, focusing on the interests involved- but I wondered if there was another reason so many folks went down that alley instead of staying on the "main street" of the argument?

I took several of the courses and what they train you in is how corporate and political thinking and operations work. That isn't how they would term it, but I worked for decades in the corporate cubicle and was amazed and offended many times a year at how those at the top could speak one thing and do another. "We stand for integrity and valuing the customer" is something one might hear in a corporate talk. The corporation makes it profit from raping the land, manufacturing overseas paying people $2 a day, and pay employees barely a living wage. A person off the street would think "how do they sleep at night?" and "why doesn't anyone stop them". At Landmark I learned all the language games and tricks they use and the personal philosophies people develop to act as they do. Nothing someone says to the people in power will stop them. Its amazing to take the courses, learn their principles and then see it operating out in the world. So I'm no longer agitated by what the words they use and how they don't match the actions. I used to get so frustrated and angry.

JMG's fifth fizzle factor revolved around interests, but one of the main differences between the same-sex marriage issue and the climate-change issue is the glaring difference in interests involved. So while I understand the "main street" of JMG's argument, I still think the fact that adopting a smaller carbon footprint will entail sacrifices for everyone concerned (as well as political consensus that appears highly unlikely at the moment) figures much more prominently in the climate-change equation than they did in the struggle for same-sex marriage. <br><br>That is a crucial difference, and many commentators felt that should be pointed out.<br><br><br><a href=#c3753762876603592810 title="comment permalink">8/1/16, 7:03 AM</a><br><br>

So I'm hoping that the focus now will shift to a more personal level.

We know or believe we need to make changes but don't know where to begin or how to continue. We worry it will make us different from our friends.<br><br>Our decision to change may be motivated by many things, but it will only become long term change when we experience a benefit. Voluntary simplicity embraces life style changes that reduce consumption but also increase life satisfaction. I suspect this may be human nature and linked to biochemistry. We are all driven by our hormonal system! I doubt humans will maintain voluntary long term change if it leads overall to pain and discomfort.<br><br>Making a major change can make us feeling differently from others but I have found this to be a short term feeling. Once changes are firmly made they cease to be novel and become normal. For example, I recall the euphoria of getting my first flock of chickens. I was so excited I wanted to tell everyone I met, "I just got chickens!" If I ran into someone talking about chickens there was this natural desire to share and compare lessons learned. After having chickens for more than 5 years, it stopped being novel. I no longer feel compelled to talk about chickens, but I'm happy to offer advice if asked. I no longer think of owning chickens as being unusual, but to be honest there are a lot of families in my community that own chickens making it more normal in general.<br><br>There are initial costs and learning curve to owning chickens, but once the coop and fencing are installed it becomes routine. I enjoy collecting and eating fresh eggs. I enjoy starting a new batch of spring chicks every few years. I dislike seeing the mess of feathers and knowing that something got into my coop last night. It is dusty and unpleasant cleaning out the coop in the spring but my garden benefits. <br><br>Every few months I pull up at the local feed mill, pet the office cats laying on the counter looking fat and lazy, and pay for my order. As the guy or gal loads my feed into the back of my pickup truck we usually comment on the weather or exchange some other pleasantry. It's just what "farmers" do. For both of us it's just another day but somehow the exchange makes it a feel like a nice day.

One day our sheep broke out into the longer, juicier neighbour's grass. My husband and I rounded them up and he patched the gap they'd made. Then, from the house above we had a good view of what slowly unfolded. One sheep, but only one, went up and down the fence looking for a weakness. The others grazed, but now and again looked over with some interest. And then she found it. Used her body to open a new gap and slip thru. The others, noticing one by one what she'd done started to head over. (of course we moved them elsewhere &amp; did a better job on fence). <br><br>Ok, so, the moral of this story, that came to me in the garden, is that you are a natural leader. Not that you seek to lead. But nevertheless others will follow you. Why? Because you are pioneering a path, yes, doing the extra hard work of tramping it while it is rough &amp; full of obstacles and unknowns. <br><br>Also, you have personal qualities that shine forth here. I won't go into detail, but I think you're a kind of "show, don't tell" kind of person. <br><br>I don't think you need to change anything you are doing. Followers are going to follow.

It didn't make the claim that the new ice age was imminent, only that it would happen at some point. I commented on this blog before though that some interpretations of the Milankovic cycles projected forward don't have a trigger for a major northern hemisphere glacial epoch for well over 100kyr <a href=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/milankovitch.html rel=nofollow>NOAA</a>. <br><br>Re: organic fruit and veg, I don't know how much of the additional cost of organic veg goes to higher costs of the operation, and how much goes to extra retailer profit knowing they are selling to people with money. <br>I was in the local supermarket this evening, and saw several types of blueberries, looking near-identical and imported from the same country. There was one with the supermarket's 'fake farm' brand name which made it sound like it could be a farm in Britain though it was imported. These were the cheapest per kg, followed by the supermarket's regular own brand, which looked almost the same but were more expensive. The 'organic ones' looked just the same as the cheap brand, except a bit larger. They were the same variety and imported from the same country. One might expect the organic ones to be smaller since they haven't been pumped full of chemical fertilizers to make them grow more. Could it be that the organic and discount brand were from the same source, just they got sorted by size and the bigger ones sold for a premium price under an organic label?<br><br>I think the reason that the 'climate change movement' seems to have got stalled, is that firstly it hadn't really made as much progress say 10 years ago as some among it had liked to think, also I think the post-2008 economic crisis and the austerity agenda has led some people to think of environmental protection as a luxury that couldn't be afforded any more and become more focused on restoring economic growth by any means possible.<br><br><a href=#c8520559622189413420 title="comment permalink">8/1/16, 3:57 PM</a><br><br>

That is to say, it is one thing practicing organic principles, and quite another to be granted permission to display a label that says "Organic". <br><br>My husband and I are currently applying for the second, even though we have a holding that is (mostly) being already operated using organic principles. <br><br>Essentially, sticking an Organic label on our farm products requires us to join a certification body, be audited regularly, keep very comprehensive records (extra time and effort in the office diverting us away from the farm), buy any off-farm inputs from other certified producers at a premium price, and all the extra costs that come with having to support an extensive bureaucracy well as your farm.<br><br>Personally, I think the label has some value, but if we can develop sales directly to local customers who can come and see our operations at any time and satisfy themselves about our animal welfare, the ways we are discovering to maintain and improve soil, water and flock health, boost biodiversity, etc, then, hopefully, we might be able to dispense with the label and the need to support the bureaucracy.<br><br>From the purchaser point of view, I'd say the same thing. Locate your local growers, visit, find out about them, set up local buying networks to help them feel more secure their livelihood. If they can be secure in selling local and direct, they might be able to dispense with organic LABEL bureaucracy as another cost that to pass on to you. <br><br>The bureaucracy only exists, after all, because we are no longer close enough to our food sources to conduct our quality control in person.<br><br><a href=#c7604325925258099217 title="comment permalink">8/2/16, 4:46 AM</a><br><br>

You might be interested to know that the biggest stirring currently there is a massive growth in the "plant based" community which is about favoring a diet of whole plant foods (some still eat small amounts of meat) due to the positive effects people have felt on their health, often people with quite serious illnesses. I went to a "vegfest" to see a doctor talk about this but showed up an hour early for the talk. The speaker before was poorly attended (maybe 10 or 15 of us - all of whom stayed for the next speaker I should add) and spoke about standard animal abuse things and the example of activists who have "liberated" animals, but for the plant based doctor it was absolutely packed in there with many people standing during his presentation to hear him. If this and what I've noticed online are indicators I suspect in a few years this plant based community will completely eclipse the vegan one - I've even joined a plant based group online that is explicitly not vegan and bans anyone for posting irritating vegan messages (animal abuse videos, attacking or judging others etc). It would be nice, in my opinion, if this does become the new standard because I think 1000 people who eat a small amount of meat has more benefit to "the vegan cause" than one person who is boycotting next to everything in an ascetic quest, and it's nice that people can come and go from this lifestyle to whatever degree they want without being a failure (personally I have always done things other vegans do not approve of like eat honey sometimes or wear leather but I never thought this was a problem and just use the word "vegan" for convenience). Also, if it does turn out that some amounts of animal products are essential for human health it would be good to approach that issue rationally and not dogmatically (from either side). <br><br>You might also find it interesting too the way this scene both values science and medicine and is highly suspicious of them. In many ways I think this is macrobiotics in practice but with growing support from scientists and doctors so it's claims are judged pragmatically.<br><br>Sorry to ramble about this - not actually trying to steer you or any of your other readers this way, I just think this mirrors much of what you've been discussing here.<br><br><a href=#c9139011216304315097 title="comment permalink">8/2/16, 5:48 AM</a><br><br>

The pilot was talking about how he was pleased that when he flew his plane, the effective "gas mileage per passenger" was in the high 20's, much better than most cars at the time. Of course his numbers did not factor in the possibility of there being more than one person in the car, or all the associated support energy in keeping the airports open and planes flying safely, etc. <br><br>But what struck me was the implied assumption that these people are going to travel to Chicago, Vegas, NYC or wherever anyway, so we just need to manage the energy usage to be more efficient.

That doesn't capture the totally of the mood change. As JMG has said, the mood change from the 70s to 80s was a 180 snap that we've been in ever since. I well remember the AIDS scare and everyone saying the "gay plague" was good, and what that engendered. I remember the "war on drugs", missing children scares and "stranger danger"/fear of strangers/abduction, ,the Tylenol poisoning scare, the scare of contaminated Halloween candy, the worst American cars ever built and people abandoning American automakers in droves. However, what I don't remember was a drastic, dramatic change in technology. I remember the first PC's w/no hard drives, that ran on 5 1/4 disks, were not online, and the first word processing software. I remember the first expanded cable, w/MTV, CNN, and HBO. I remember the first generation video games on Atari &amp; ColecoVision. All of these seemed like relatively minor changes in technology that did not have the dramatic atomizing effect that would come much later, in the late 90s, with the spread of the internet. So I'm not really sure that technology, as opposed to a nihilistic embrace of neoliberalism, was responsible.<br>@MawKernewek,<br>I don't really think that organic farms are inflating their prices that much to exploit the "organic" label. Having worked on organic farms, there's just not a lot of profit margin, and the more ecologically responsible you are, the lower your profit margins will be. Most of what I was thinking of was the psychology of how organics are marketed, and how exclusionary it seems. Personally, I think we need a whole lot more producers and a whole lot fewer consumers, of good, wholesome, organic food. The only way a lot of people are going to be able to afford good wholesome, organic food is if they grow it themselves. A whole different mindset in how we get our food is necessary, one from consumer to producer.<br><br><a href=#c5992739031326547033 title="comment permalink">8/2/16, 3:03 PM</a><br><br>

You have neglected, perhaps because you are unaware of, a number of crucial reasons why climate change activism failed. The first and perhaps most important of these is that our entire economies are based on carbon dioxide producing industries. Individually it was hard, infact almost impossible to change activities that modern societies force upon us to maintain our places within society. Things like driving to work, where no public transport options even exist and like purchasing clothes of a type suitable for work and having them always spotlessly clean were not opt outable. Without political agreement and legislation any nation or individual doing so would have disadvantaged themselves profoundly and political agreement and legislation did not happen. Another thing is that there may well have been other well funded oppositions but there never was one as well funded as the fossil fuel lobby was. But the most crucial factor, at least in my country, Australia, was an alliance between the right-wing media and our right wing political party. Both of these organisations raised the issue from intellectual to emotional. This elevation and altering of the the way that this discussion was perceived was based on an increased understanding of mob psychology which has evolved very much over recent years. The moment an issue becomes emotional the ability for most people to reason and the effectiveness of reason and logic go out the door. It became a team sport and the greatest predictor of a person's political allegiance was their opinion on climate change. You have done yourself a disservice by not mentioning the roles that these issues have played in the reason of why climate change activism has failed. Here in Australia, the media simply stopped reporting any issues about it, and it is synonymous with the falling of a forest tree, if no one hears about it regardless of whether it has made a noise or not it effectively didn't occur. To my knowledge the media have never acted in this way before and are primarily responsible for the citizens of my country being so blase about the issue.<br><br><a href=#c9175611481022526080 title="comment permalink">8/2/16, 10:39 PM</a><br><br>

No argument there. I'm pretty sure that point occurred to JMG too, though he wasn't explicit about it. I was just pointing out that in my reading of the essay, he was limiting his comparison of the two movements to the issue of disinformation. (It didn't stop the same sex marriage movement, despite some really vile slander in advance of various marriage referendums [referenda?], so the climate activism movement can't claim that disinformation hamstrung its success. You know, "It's their fault, not ours.") I don't think we substantively disagree; I was just interested in the pattern of reaction. From my view, it looked like the response to "Here's one excuse that doesn't wash," was a chorus of "Yeah, but..." When I have the immediate reaction to argue with something, I'm trying to learn to take a closer look at whether there's some reason my buttons got pushed. I've mentioned before that Shane W's posts are often really good at making me gulp, and then think. I was just wondering aloud if a similar phenomenon might be in play here.

It's been documented. Also, a lot of people genuinely believed "facts" stayed by these deliberate liars and spread the misinformation with sincere intentions. For example, perhaps you heard "Earth stopped warming in 1998.". Every quote said 1998 because that was a record high el niño year, so if you pretended it was a normal year you could make the chart look like it shot up to 1998 and leveled off (until now, since we just had another record el niño). When you compare that to data from climate scientists, each data set is complete, the entire record of a given set of measurements, and they cross compare data. Stop listening to pundits (on either side) and start looking at the studies themselves. For example, a climate denier recently blogged about data from a broken, decommissioned satellite to refute data from several other satellites that were functioning and in agreement with each other. But you don:'t have to listen to me or that guy because most of the raw satellite data from all these satellites is available to the public.<br><br><a href=#c5142528476327592733 title="comment permalink">8/3/16, 1:23 AM</a><br><br>

The anthropologist David Graeber wrote of one such example from his field of research, Madagascar, colonized by the French, in his (recommended) book, "Debt: The First 5000 Years". Some of the text follows:<br><br>"“I have already mentioned that one of the first things that the French general Gallieni, conqueror of Madagascar, did when the conquest of the island was complete in 1901 was to impose a head tax. Not only was this tax quite high, it was also only payable in newly issued Malagasy francs. In other words, Gallieni did indeed print money and then demand that everyone in the country give some of that money back to him.<br><br>“Most striking of all, though, was language he used to describe this tax. It was referred to as the “impôt moralisateur,” the “educational” or “moralizing tax.” In other words, it was designed—to adopt the language of the day—to teach the natives the value of work. Since the “educational tax” came due shortly after harvest time, the easiest way for farmers to pay it was to sell a portion of their rice crop to the Chinese or Indian merchants who soon installed themselves in small towns across the country. However, harvest was when the market price of rice was, for obvious reasons, at its lowest; if one sold too much of one’s crop, that meant one would not have enough left to feed one’s family for the entire year, and thus be forced to buy one’s own rice back, on credit, from those same merchants later in the year when prices were much higher. As a result, farmers quickly fell hope- lessly into debt (the merchants doubling as loan sharks). The easiest ways to pay back the debt was either to find some kind of cash crop to sell—to start growing coffee, or pineapples—or else to send one’s children off to work for wages in the city, or on one of the plantations that French colonists were establishing across the island. The whole project might seem no more than a cynical scheme to squeeze cheap labor out of the peasantry, and it was that, but it was also something more. The colonial government was were also quite explicit (at least in their own internal policy documents), about the need to make sure that peasants had at least some money of their own left over, and to ensure that they became accustomed to the minor luxuries—parasols, lipstick, cookies—available at the Chinese shops. It was crucial that they develop new tastes, habits, and expectations; that they lay the foundations of a consumer demand that would endure long after the conquerors had left, and keep Madagascar forever tied to France.<br><br>“Most people are not stupid, and most Malagasy understood ex- actly what their conquerors were trying to do to them. Some were determined to resist. More than sixty years after the invasion, a French anthropologist, Gerard Althabe, was able to observe villages on the east coast of the island whose inhabitants would dutifully show up at the coffee plantations to earn the money for their poll tax, and then, having paid it, studiously ignore the wares for sale at the local shops and instead turn over any remaining money to lineage elders, who would then use it to buy cattle for sacrifice to their ancestors.19 Many were quite open in saying that they saw themselves as resisting a trap..”"<br><br><a href=#c9014001789567600416 title="comment permalink">8/5/16, 11:23 PM</a><br><br>

For example the policy that "80% of fossil fuels will have to stay in the ground." <br><br>Did activists not realize that "80% of fossil fuels" amounts to something on the scale of $200 trillion in mineral rights? Confiscation of that much property would make the Bolshevik confiscation of Russian farmland look like knocking over a convenience store. <br><br>The Bolsheviks had to kill hundreds of thousands of people to confiscate that much property. How many people did climate change activists think they would have to kill to confiscate those mineral rights? I believe the factual answer to the question is something like zero, when it should have been something like, I don't know, five hundred million.<br><br><a href=#c2884557314443424152 title="comment permalink">8/17/16, 2:26 PM</a><br><br>

It would probably help, too, if they stopped leaning so hard on the broken prestige of science, found a positive vision of the future to talk about now and then, backed away from trying to rewrite the recent past, and dropped the habit of demonizing honest disagreement. Still, to my mind, the crucial thing is that the affluent liberals who dominate the climate change movement are going to have to demonstrate that they’re willing to take one for the team."<br><br>Wow! Nice job of blaming the entire climate change-related mess on affluent liberal climate change activists. Sounds like you've finally found a scapegoat. <br><br>I'm not saying you're wrong about that particular portion of the population needing to change their lifestyles, because everybody does (although poor folk likely the least). <br><br>As a climate change activist reading this, though, it really does look like you're blaming us for having failed to save the world from climate change.
