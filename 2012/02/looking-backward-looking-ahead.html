Over the last few weeks, after many detours, this blog’s path has finally finished traversing a landscape I first sighted more than a year and a half ago. I’d like to take a moment here to glance back over the territory we’ve crossed together in that time, wrap up some loose ends, and then take a look ahead at the terrain into which we’ll be venturing in the months to come.<br><br>As June of 2010 began, having wrapped up the sequence of posts on economics that eventually turned into <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/W/The-Wealth-of-Nature>The Wealth of Nature</a>, I took up the next point I wanted to discuss—the role of fantasy, myth, and the nonrational in shaping the industrial world’s nonresponse to the rising spiral of crises that has come to dominate our time. It was a propitious moment to start a discussion of that theme; the first round of efforts to plug the disastrous Macondo oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico had failed, and in response, an astonishing number of people here in America had to all intents and purposes gone barking mad.<br><br>It’s worth reminiscing a bit about the raw nonsense that passed for reasonable thinking during those troubled days. Serious pundits were seriously insisting that the United States government had better hurry up and use a nuclear weapon on the recalcitrant well. None of them that I heard ever got around to explaining how blasting a gargantuan crater in the floor of the Gulf, vaporizing any remaining impediment to the flow of oil, and crashing an oily, radioactive, fifty-foot-high tsunami into the Gulf coast would have helped matters any, but very few people were rude enough to try to intrude that little difficulty into the discussion.<br><br>Meanwhile the hirelings of the oil industry were insisting that dumping millions of barrels of crude oil into the waters of the Gulf would merely add a little piquance to your next dish of Creole shrimp, while on the other side of the fence, rumors were surging through the crawlspaces of the internet that the oil spill was quite literally going to cause the extinction of life on Earth. That’s the sort of gibberish that comes foaming out, apparently, when a nation far too certain of its own omnipotence runs into a hard reminder that there are inconvenient realities called the laws of physics that can’t be bullied or whined into behaving the way we prefer.<br><br>So while oil was spewing out of a broken drill pipe, and nonsense was spewing out of a broken society, I started the discussion that finally wound up over the last few weeks. The delay? Well, that was partly the result of <a href=../../2010/06/merlins-time.html>a post I made</a> on the last day of June, 2010—there’s an Al Stewart joke that belongs here, but I’ll let that pass for now—which suggested that it might be worth reviving the ideas and practices of the 1970s appropriate tech movement. I’d recently helped to translate a <a href=http://www.renaissanceastrology.com/astrologyandmagicbooks.html#completepicatrix>10th-century training manual for wizards</a>, and so, in a flourish of rhetoric, I suggested that maybe the practitioners of the arcane and eldritch arts of organic agriculture, homescale alternative energy, and the like might think of themselves as "green wizards."<br><br>By the time the dust finally settled, that post had garnered more comments and more page views than anything else I’d posted here up to that time, by a large margin, and I’d been deluged by comments and emails asking me to talk about the green wizardry stuff in more detail. That, dear readers, was why I spent the next year and a bit talking about my experiences in organic gardening, energy conservation, and other bits of Seventies backyard-garden and basement-workshop green tech; I also helped found <a href=http://www.greenwizards.org/ >a forum for green wizards</a> to discuss their craft, and had several other posts break the records set by the one that started the process. It was only after all of that was taken care of that I finally worked my way back to discussing what I’d originally started to talk about in June of 2010, more than a year and a half ago. Then that discussion proceeded to veer off in unexpected directions of its own, with results ranging from a science fiction short story contest to a series of posts on a subject I’d resolved never to discuss on this blog, the interface between peak oil and the traditions of ceremonial magic. Looking back on the last nineteen months of <i>Archdruid Report</i> posts, I feel rather as though I’d planned to take the overnight train from my home in Cumberland to Chicago, and finally arrived in the Windy City six weeks later by way of New Orleans, San Francisco, the Aleutian Islands, and the North Pole.<br><br>Still, it’s been a productive trip, and those of my readers who are interested in souvenirs of the journey will have several to hand in the months to come.<br><br>First of all, I’m delighted to announce that last fall’s posts on magic and peak oil have become the seed for a book that will be released this spring. <i>The Blood of the Earth: An Essay on Magic and Peak Oil</i> is being published by <a href=http://www.scarletimprint.com/ >Scarlet Imprint</a>, a small occult press with a big reputation. While they’re best known for their deluxe limited editions—which use, by the way, archival quality paper and bindings, not a minor point at a time when most newly printed books can be counted on to disintegrate into sawdust in a quarter century at most—Scarlet Imprint will also be producing paperback and e-book editions of <i>The Blood of the Earth</i>. Being small and lively, they move fast; I expect to be able to post preordering information in the very near future, and the book will be for sale in a couple of months at most.<br><br>Second, I’m even more delighted to report that the anthology of science fiction short stories about the postpetroleum world is becoming a reality. I’d hoped, when I announced the contest last fall, that I would field a dozen stories good enough to publish. As it turned out, more than sixty stories were submitted, well over half of them were of publishable quality, and many of the rest could have reached that mark given a bit of work and some editorial feedback. It took quite a bit of thought and many rereadings to work down to the final list of stories that will be in the anthology:<br><br>Randall S. Ellis’ "Autumn Night"<br>E.A. Freeman’s "The Lore Keepers"<br>Thijs Goverde’s "Think Like A Tinkerer"<br>Susan Harelson’s "Maestra y Aprendiz"<br>Harry J. Lerwill’s "Caravan of Hopes"<br>Catherine McGuire’s "The Going"<br>Avery Morrow’s "The Great Clean-Up"<br>Kieran O’Neill’s "Bicycleman Sakhile and the Cell Tower"<br>J.D. Smith’s "The Urgent, the Necessary"<br>Philip Steiner’s "Traveling Show"<br>David Trammel’s "Small Town Justice"<br><br>Those of my readers who submitted stories that won’t be part of the anthology should take heart. Much of what was submitted for the contest was remarkably good, and the decision came down fairly often to a hard choice between two or more stories with similar themes or plots, or to that even harder choice of which of two or three good stories would make for a better balance in the book as a whole. One of the unexpected revelations of the long strange trip we’ve taken together is just how large of a pool of writing talent exists among the readers of this blog; if I had the time and the inclination to launch a magazine of postpeak fiction (or perhaps "mundane SF," the current term for science fiction that gets along without invoking <a href=../../2011/09/invasion-of-space-bats.html>alien space bats</a>), I’d anticipate no trouble finding ample raw material to fill its pages right here. <br><br>I’ve taken the editor’s privilege of adding one of my own stories, "Winter’s Tales"—readers who have been following <i>The Archdruid Report</i> long enough will remember a set of three short stories posted here in 2006, set in the winters of 2050, 2100, and 2150 respectively; those were the raw material for my entry—and an introduction to the anthology, and giving it a working title, <i>After Oil: SF Visions of a Post-Petroleum Future</i>. I’ve had a tentative approval from a publisher, but they’re waiting to see it as a complete manuscript; that’s a few weeks away at this point—there’s some editing still to be done—but I’ll post something as soon as there’s a contract and a tentative publishing date.<br><br>Third, of course, is a book on green wizardry, the most extensive of the detours we’ve taken together. That currently exists as a shapeless, sprawling, nearly unmanageable rough draft of 120,000 words—about half again as long as any of my other peak oil books—and is going to take quite a bit more than the usual amount of revision to make it a book worth reading. My usual peak oil publisher, <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/ >New Society Publications</a>, has expressed interest in the project but, sensibly enough, wants to see a couple of finished chapters before cutting a contract. If you hear something that sounds like a machete at work coming from the direction of Cumberland, MD, it’s me, hacking paths through a nearly impenetrable jungle of archdruidical prose. I hope to have the couple of chapters into New Society within a few weeks, and will post further news as it comes in.<br><br>Fourth is the most unexpected of my detours, the systems theory version of the Tao Te Ching I started mostly by accident <a href=../../2011/02/overcoming-systems-stupidity.html>in a post here</a> almost exactly a year ago. That’s not finished yet; I’ve found that it needs to take its own time, but I’ve got 54 chapters (out of 81) finished in draft, and expect to finish it and add an introduction and commentary this year. I have no idea who on Earth will be interested in publishing it, but capable small presses prospering in niche markets are popping up at an encouraging rate these days, so I’ll doubtless find somebody.<br><br>So that’s the scorecard, to shift metaphors a bit, as the dust settles from the last year and a half or so of this blog. To borrow a phrase from the Grateful Dead, it’s been a long, strange trip. And the path ahead?<br><br>The path ahead leads straight into a theme that most Americans don’t want to discuss at all, and that they and the rest of the world’s population desperately need to discuss: the political, economic, ecological, and military implications of the twilight of America’s global empire. The end of the industrial age, as I’ve discussed here at some length already, is shaping up to be a protracted process, as the decline and fall of a civilization usually is. The arc of decline and fall, though, tends to be punctuated by sudden crises. One of the common causes of such crises is the collapse of existing power centers and their replacement by others, which face collapses of their own further down the road. While the overall history of the industrial world over the next few centuries will be dominated by the overall arc of energy decline, the history of the next few decades will be profoundly shaped by the more immediate impact of the end of America’s empire. <br><br>One advantage we’ve got in making sense of this situation is that America’s imperial sunset isn’t the first such collapse of empire in the downward arc of industrial civilization. A century ago, Britain was the nation that enforced peace and unequal trade policies on a restive world, bankrupted itself paying for the bloated military and bureaucracy that its empire required, and ended up being shoved onto the sidelines of history in a series of explosive political, economic, social, and military events that left very few corners of the world unscathed. The United States is well along the same trajectory, and the shape of the American future—as well as the impacts of its decline on the rest of the world—can be gauged in part by studying what happened a century ago to Britain, as well as what has happened to other empires caught in the same downward spiral elsewhere in history.<br><br>That’s the theme I plan on exploring over the next year or so. That exploration is going to have to start from basic questions that haven’t been asked often enough, or answered honestly enough, in recent years. It’s going to be necessary to talk about what empires are and how they function; to get past certain dysfunctional but popular notions on the subject; to talk about how America ended up in its current role as the world’s primary imperial power, and to sketch out what can be learned from the experiences of other failing empires. All that belongs to the first phase of the exploration. The second phase will attempt to sketch out how the collapse of American empire is likely to unfold, how it has already begun to unfold, and how the current barrage of attempts either to insist that America’s empire doesn’t face collapse, or to prevent the collapse from occurring, are making the downward arc that much steeper and more inescapable.<br><br>Finally, I want to talk about what can be done in an age of imperial decline and collapse. Obviously, given the core agenda of this blog, a great deal of what I want to discuss focuses on what individuals, families, small groups, and communities can do to get ready for the likely consequences of imperial collapse, to weather the rough parts of the process, and to find a new equilibrium once the rubble stops bouncing. Still, I think it’s possible to go further than that. One of the common consequences of imperial collapse, wherever it takes place, is a drastic expansion of options: things unthinkable in an age of empire become possible in empire’s ruins. Irish independence and legal standing for labor unions are only two of the impossibilities that became real in the wake of the British Empire’s implosion, for example, and it’s entirely possible that equally sweeping transformations could follow the collapse of the American empire. Of course it bears recalling that not all such transformations must be for the better—I think most of my readers know enough about history to recall what followed the collapse of the German and Austro-Hungarian empires in 1918.<br><br>That’s a very brief preview of the terrain we’ll begin to explore next week. That said, none of the information covered over the last year and a half has lost its relevance, and the conversations over at <a href=http://www.greenwizards.org/ >the Green Wizards forum</a> still have plenty of useful ground yet to cover. I’ll be referring back to green wizardry and other themes already discussed as we proceed; even though this blog has quite a bit of diverse ground to cover, all of that belongs to one and the same future.<br><br>**********************<br><span style=font-size:130%>End of the World of the Week #8</span><br><br>Apocalyptic movements, like most other human social phenomena, follow the law of supply and demand; when there’s a demand for a particular kind of movement, the supply of people willing to launch and run such a movement rarely takes long to respond. Among the more colorful examples of this process in action is the medieval heresy of the Free Spirit.<br><br>To understand the Free Spirit and its followers, it’s necessary to recall one of the curious features of late medieval culture—the great mismatch that opened up between the number of men and of women available for marriage. Since the Catholic church had many more openings for men than for women, and nearly all these openings had celibacy (at least officially) as a job requirement, a very large fraction of women remained unmarried, or married elderly husbands and then faced most of a lifetime of widowhood. The peasantry and the nobility had established roles for unmarried women, and nunneries could take a certain fraction of the remainder, but in the rising urban classes, a great many women ended up consigned to lives of idleness and chastity. Many turned to mystical religion or to illicit love affairs; the advantage of the heresy of the Free Spirit was that it enabled them to do both at once.<br><br>According to the preachers of the Free Spirit, who were mostly defrocked priests and monks, the world was on the brink of a vast transformation of consciousness—the coming of the Third Age—in which the burden of original sin would be lifted from humanity and all people would be naked and unashamed as they had been in Eden, living without sorrow or labor according to a new law of love. Human nature being what it is, that new law was usually interpreted in a distinctly physical sense, with enthusiastic promiscuity and group worship in the nude standard practice in most Free Spirit circles. Another part of the belief system was that in the Third Age, all wealth would be shared freely; since the prophets of the Free Spirit were usually very poor and many of their converts were well-to-do, most of the resulting sharing went in one direction.<br><br>Despite the efforts of the Catholic church to exterminate the heresy, and as many of the heretics as it could catch, the Free Spirit remained an active presence in European culture for at least five centuries, and its influence lasted longer still. Those who belonged to a certain generation still with us will no doubt remember more recent prophets who insisted that a utopian age of easy sex and freedom from work was about to dawn. Still, it’s worth noting that those recent prophecies, like those of the Free Spirit, somehow never quite came to pass.<br><br>—story from <a href="http://www.vivaeditions.com/book_page.php?book_id=25">Apocalypse Not</a>

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c3821774649237859901></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11830861494420303864 rel=nofollow>DeAnander</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I look forward to some mulling over what empire is, what defines it. I've got as far as thinking of Empire as the logical extension of City; a city is a dense core of power and population that exhausts its local territory and is compelled to import resources from a larger periphery (often by duress) -- and an Empire is the same thing writ much larger: a network of cities under a single authority, which constitute a core importing resources from a much wider periphery, definitely by duress (military force). Much ink has been printed about the process by which city-states historically coalesce and become Empires, whether in the Greek peninsula, S America, ancient Babylonia, China or wherever.<br><br>Empire then becomes for me just a shorthand for a certain scale of the consistent core/periphery dynamic that begins (?) with cities or "civilisation" and expands to concepts like "global hegemon" (superdupercore!) In other words, Empire has become for me a term that describes energy flows; no literal "emperor" or royal court is really required for the imperial pattern to replicate. An empire can even call itself a republic, or a democracy :-) But so long as it uses guns (or swords) to extract raw materials (especially food) from weaker polities on its periphery, imho it's waddling and quacking and I call it a duck.<br><br>America obviously qualifies, no question there. I'm debating whether its appendage, Canada, is a colonised province or a satrapy; Canada acts as an imperial supporter and core member by sending troops into the target du jour in obedience to American diktat, and by participating in the kingly lifestyle that imperial force provides to core denizens; but we also serve as a raw materials "superstore" that the US raids at will (check out <a href=http://www.canadians.org/media/DI/2002/15-Jul-02.html rel=nofollow>the terms of NAFTA/GATT</a> which oblige Canada to export a fixed pct of natural gas to the US regardless of domestic requirements).<br>...<br><br><a href=looking-backward-looking-ahead.html#c3821774649237859901 title="comment permalink">2/8/12, 10:20 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c1979079094043331622></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11830861494420303864 rel=nofollow>DeAnander</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>... (sorry, I ran into the comment length limit, forgive the verbosity) (part 2) ...<br><br>I'm also getting a little confused these days about the E-word, as global (transnational) capital creates a whole new kind of core -- a nonlocalised core, if you will, the "loose association of millionaires and billionaires" who extract and liquidate resources worldwide, for world markets, using denationalised, highly mobile money. Canada's government is busy selling off Canadian companies and resources not only to the US, but to China. Does that mean that China is now an empire making claims on N American territory? Or are the transnational 1 percenters (regardless of nationality/language) now an empire in their own right? Is there a nonlocalised core (the international finance industry, say) now raiding all the physical world with more or less equal rapacity and immunity?<br><br>We often describe some region being overrun and devastated by resource liquidators -- such as Appalachia suffering MTR, such as "sacrifice zones" all over the world -- as "like a 3rd world country," which historically means something like "a country which has at some point been colonised and pillaged by an imperial power, often with the active collusion of its own comprador elite, and left in a state of poverty, resource depletion, and corruption." But that's beginning to describe large swathes of N America, allegedly "the" 1st-world country.<br><br>What does Empire mean if it becomes nonlocalised? Can it be nonlocalised? Are these acts of pillage, immiseration, displacement within N American borders symptoms of external empires flexing their muscle and nibbling on the dying hegemon, or are they signs of catabolic collapse of the hegemon, chewing on its own flesh as it starves? Or... where is Empire located today? I can see the resources being looted. I can see the overriding of local interests, the bankrupting of communities, the extraction of money as well as material goods. What I'm beginning to wonder is where the core is these days. Are we all periphery now? If the American Empire is in collapse -- and I believe it is -- then is another Empire rising? Or is the nature of the whole game changing?<br><br>Are we near the same page, or even in the same book?<br><br><a href=looking-backward-looking-ahead.html#c1979079094043331622 title="comment permalink">2/8/12, 10:21 PM</a><br><br>

The polarity of core and periphery makes a very good model for the phenomena of empire, and in fact it's the one I'll be using as we proceed. The hollowing out of the geographical core as an empire moves through its historical trajectory is a common feature, too -- it's always important to remember that the effective core of an empire isn't a country, or even a city, but a set of institutions and the people who run them. More on this later, and on the other points you've raised. <br><br>Castus (and DeAnander), the future of Canada, and of the other members of the inner circle of America's subject-allies, is going to be an important theme in the discussion. Canada in particular is in a very complex situation, not least because it's begun to play the falling and rising imperial powers off against one another -- potentially a risky move, but potentially a rewarding one as well.<br><br><a href=looking-backward-looking-ahead.html#c2688224186138382941 title="comment permalink">2/8/12, 10:53 PM</a><br><br>

Would be interested in your comments<br>(1) Most countries become poorer when they lose their empire. However Britain lost its empire in the period after 1945. This was the best time in history in which to lose an empire as this was the period of the post war economic boom. Loss of empire was accompanied by rising standards of living. This helped to cushion us from the loss of status and power that accompanied the loss of empire. America will not have this luxury. Their loss of empire is happening as oil production peaks and will be accompanied by a reduction in the standard of living. This will make it harder to bear .<br><br>(2) In normal times America would gradually be replaced as top dog by a growing China. However these are not normal times. China is industrialising just at the point where fossil fuels are about to peak and start their long descent. Therefore China’s growth may come to a halt before they become top dog.<br><br>(3) America is still a powerful country and has the kind of military and industrial wealth that British leaders in the 1940’s could only dream of. It is still producing a lot of oil. In theory America should be in a good position to adapt to its relative loss of power. The biggest problem America will have in adapting are psychological and cultural. These are the factors that may prevent America from adapting and lead it to waste its wealth on pointless wars and actions that do not work. <br><br>Jasmine<br><br><a href=looking-backward-looking-ahead.html#c272041522039829253 title="comment permalink">2/9/12, 2:49 AM</a><br><br>

When I reached school in the post-war austerity period the somewhat tattered atlases we were given still had the British Empire coloured a pinkish red that seemed to cover the majority of the Mercator projection. We stood with our mother in line ('queued') with ration books for basic food items, and our new Prime Minister's first job was to get rid of the Empire (first up was India which did not pay its way anymore) and bring back the Regimental Silver and hand strategic military positions to the USA. (For example, Iraq and Bahrein; and we had to smartly get out of Israel and leave that to you Americans. The final exit from Egypt and the Suez Canal - think of an earlier version of Hormuz - took another 10 years until Dwight Eisenhower was forced to kindly put paid to remaining illusions.) We were in debt to the USA for many decades. <br><br>It was only recently however that I learned the real history of British Coal.<br>Until I was in my 20s we still were lighted and heated and in large measure transported by coal. (People largely had trains and bicycles and crowded buses and trams.) Nuclear power turned out not to be a game-changer. <br>Peak Coal had been in 1913 a tad less than 300M tons annually. UK is now well under 20Mt and still going down as we get the last of the surface coal only available economically because of the recent advent of huge diesel-fired machinery in the last years of our decline. We import something like 50Mt of coal for electricity generation. Going back 100 years to that 300M tons at peak, 100Mt went for export. My goodness we could run an Imperial Navy in those days, pay for our vast food imports, our cotton and wool and a lot more raw materials as well as fuel our industries. I guess though the conditions of our mining communities were probably a touch worse than those in modern China who now fill a similar role.<br>In my childhood there were still "true-believers". Our war-time Prime Minister Churchill was truly devoted to 'The Empire' and had a reprise as PM on the edge of dotage in the 1950s.<br>There are still lots of old engineers (and some young ones) who will tell you that UK still sits on massive reserves of coal. They mostly acknowledge though that we are no longer surrounded by a sea of fish. These declines where they are acknowledged are usually attributed, however, to greedy labour unions or Margaret Thatcher (coal) or the European Union (fish).<br><br>I invite you to come over some time and I will take you round the backyards not visible from Olympiad. Forget the multiple towers of London and Princes in uniform. Things are not what they seem. Oil and NG gave us a post-imperial coat of gloss this last 30 years and the financial ‘industry’ produced a whole new definition of Wealth; we still suck it in, but a lot of us are feeling distinctly uneasy, if not queasy.<br>JMG is right. Declines have consequence.<br><br><a href=looking-backward-looking-ahead.html#c8441780360898336743 title="comment permalink">2/9/12, 3:10 AM</a><br><br>

Dante was quite keen on Empire wasn't he? Also, there's the Buddhist belief that to be a World Ruler requires much the same spiritual qualities as to be a Buddha.

It will be more than continuing the old attitudes and beliefs while growing your own vegetables, doing your own plumbing, and walking instead of driving. As Moses supposedly told the Israelites in the desert, the generation that had known the fleshpots of Egypt would have to die before their successors would see the Promised Land.<br><br>Obviously the new won't be exactly a repeat of a previous set of beliefs, but it will be different from the current set, and it is interesting to speculate what they may be, and whether there is cyclicity in these changes, linked to cycles of physical changes.<br><br><a href=looking-backward-looking-ahead.html#c5702112717133715519 title="comment permalink">2/9/12, 3:33 AM</a><br><br>

As a recently-diagnosed diabetic, I see a very grim wild-card on the social horizon. Between 1991 and 2011, the rate of type 2 diabetes more than doubled in the US population. Not only that, but the cohort of teenagers being diagnosed with this disease forced the medical establishment to drop the alternate name "adult-onset diabetes". (I personally blame high-fructose corn syrup, for the most part.)<br><br>When the decline of the US Empire really picks up steam, what is going to happen to all these diabetics who no longer have access to expensive and energy-intensive diabetes-treatment from the bloated medical-industrial complex? Our major cities could very conceivably be overrun by blind amputees in varying stages of kidney-failure. Not only is this a horrible thing in and of itself, there is also the question of how this will affect our other vexatious problems with which we will undoubtedly be dealing. (And it isn't just diabetes. Thanks to industrial "food" combined with the other socio-economic dysfunctions of our declining empire, the middle-aged population is much sicker than it has been in the past! Those of the afflicted whose hearts simply fail under the strain will be the lucky ones, IMHO.)<br><br><a href=looking-backward-looking-ahead.html#c3700494427970233113 title="comment permalink">2/9/12, 5:28 AM</a><br><br>

And thanks to all who comment. <br><br>As you turn your attention back to the twilight of the American empire, I hope you will give plenty of attention to the role of corporations and financial interests in the descent. What sets our empire apart from those of the distant past is that we use corporations to do the day-to-day grunt work of conveying wealth to the center. In Rome and Greece they had to rely on military force. Nowadays, we only use that as a last resort. <br><br>I like to think of corporations as scavenging robots, devoid of any human sentiment, intent only on prying up anything that isn’t nailed down. They are not fully under human control. They lack human morals or feelings. They sell what they find, supplying a seemingly endless flow of goods and services, and bring back the value scraped up to their owners.<br><br>It’s a great system, if you own the robots, or need what they are selling. Not so great if they are plundering your country. If by mistake, or some reversal of fortune, you lose control of your robots, then, you had better watch out. They are just as happy picking your bones clean as they were flattening that rain forest.<br><br>It’s an old SF theme, giant robots running amok, our machines turning against us. I think we will see a lot of it in the near future, as our fortunes change. Can you imagine Google under new Chinese ownership? Game over. <br><br>@DeAnander – When looking for the empire, I follow the money. The ‘loose association of millionaires and billionaires’ looks like the end of the trail to me.

(Yes, I realize the two are not the same; you can be in the Commonwealth and not have the Queen as your head of state. Still, countries as independent and vast as Australia and Canada have chosen to keep her as head of state.)<br><br>Certainly any of those countries could opt out, but they don't-- and the majority of their citizens don't seem to mind. (Just one example: the voted-down-by-the-citizens referendum in Australia in 1999 on becoming a republic.) And, YES, I realize the Commonwealth and certainly having the Queen as HoS and on one's coins are entirely symbolic gestures these days. Still, symbols are potent and representative of deeper feelings.<br><br>My point is simply this: a plurality or majority of the citizens of Britain's former empire still feel fondly enough about Britain to retain these symbols of their former stewardship and imperial rule. But it's difficult for me to imagine a similar fondness for America in the age after the American empire. Beyond a possible fondness for rock music and blue jeans I mean (both of which are obviously global in any event), in ways that actually matter.<br><br><a href=looking-backward-looking-ahead.html#c2361499999061671941 title="comment permalink">2/9/12, 10:34 AM</a><br><br>

Onagawa, the town where I worked, was a town of 10,000 with really only three occupation choices: fishing, the public sector, or the local nuclear power plant. 10% of the population was killed in the tsunami and the town was essentially razed. <br><br>However, when I got there I learned that there was a local paper and radio station where none had existed before, and people were talking about ways to make the Onagawa of the future more accessible and thriving. Most impressively to me, a national education activist who had found little traction for reforms in other places was instituting a completely new school system--partly to cope with the collapsed infrastructure and partly looking ahead. That was especially impressive to me, because I had spent two years seeing the need for change in Japanese education constantly foiled by stifling bureaucracy and resistance to change. Seeing rapid change like that had previously been, well, unthinkable for me.<br><br><a href=looking-backward-looking-ahead.html#c3350464135392418229 title="comment permalink">2/9/12, 11:39 AM</a><br><br>

As mentioned in the post, it was no easy task to sort through so many good stories to choose the twelve I had room to put into the anthology. <br><br>Hanshishiro, oh, one way or another you'll get to read it. I prefer to avoid self-publishing, and these days I generally can. <br><br>Avery, I certainly think it's a fantastic collection!<br><br>Leo, of course. An empire is more than the nation that rules it; it's a structure of relations among nations, and can't be understood apart from the whole system to which the imperial nation belongs. <br><br>Jasmine, I'm already on the first two points. As for the third, you're off by a few decades. The US today is roughly at the same point in its decline as Britain in 1912, when it was still far and away the mightiest nation on Earth, with a military technostructure -- the Royal Navy -- that was strong enough to overwhelm any two competing powers put together. By 1940 that was no longer true...but we haven't reached the equivalent of 1940 yet. <br><br>Phil, I'd love to come over to your side of the pond sometime, when funds permit -- a writer's income won't cover much in the way of international travel just now, but there's always the chance that something will turn up. If I do, I'll look forward to that tour. <br><br>Raven, well, what do you think I've been talking about for the last six months or so? <br><br>Steve, thank you. Working on the translation has been an education in itself. I probably shouldn't even mention this, but I've also begun studying the I Ching as a guide to whole system processes, with an eye toward an eventual translation. <br><br>Source Dweller, by all means recommend it to the CBC! ;-)<br><br>Mister R., it's a bit more complex than that, since one of the main reasons why more people are diagnosed with diabetes these days is that the definition of diabetes has been changed, just as body weights and blood pressures that used to be considered normal and healthy are now used to justify selling you drugs. Still, one of the consequences of the end of American empire is going to be a sharp decrease in the availability of expensive health care modalities and pharmaceuticals. I've discussed that in previous posts, of course. <br><br>Jim, nicely put. I've had some entertaining times with British friends on the left who like to go on at length about the sins of the United States, until the corresponding sins of their own country are pointed out to them. <br><br>Edde, thank you! One of the common experiences of imperial decline is that attempts to try to pull out of decline, if they turn to the old toolkit of warfare and the like, simply speed the decline along. The Neoconservatives are among the best recent examples of that; I'll be discussing them down the road a bit.<br><br><a href=looking-backward-looking-ahead.html#c9222030869187305094 title="comment permalink">2/9/12, 2:04 PM</a><br><br>

As a vet, you've had better reason than most to be aware that the military garrisons we keep in 140 countries around the world aren't there for the sake of their health!<br><br>DaShui, the scientific revolution was the immediate progenitor of the industrial revolution; it just took a while to get there. Read Francis Bacon sometime and you'll see the entire mentality of the industrial revolution mapped out well in advance. Still, I think you're missing the point of this series of posts; the wider decline and fall of industrial civilization is one thing; the near term collapse of American empire is something else again. <br><br>Ghung, fascinating! I'm pleased to hear that distributism still has a following that's large enough to scare the financiers. <br><br>Pentronicus, using financial and economic institutions as a central tool of empire is far from new. The British Empire did much the same thing, for example. To my mind, the current habit of demonizing corporations as such, rather than paying attention to the little man behind the curtain, is not very useful -- though a good case could be made for revoking corporate personhood and making corporations subject to seizure and dissolution as punishment for crimes, as I proposed in <i>The Wealth of Nature</i>. <br><br>Ksc, my experience of groups who think they're fighting the US empire has been, well, "mixed" is a mild way of putting it. I'll have more to say about this in a future post. <br><br>Cathy, thank you! <br><br>Rio, if you want anything to be saved, get to work saving it, because odds are that nobody else is doing that. <br><br>Mike, thanks for the resources. <br><br>Greg, I expect the election circus to provide me with plenty of comic relief for this series of posts over the next nine months or so. <br><br>Nathan, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Kieran, if Canada plays its cards right, it may well become a major world power. If it plays its cards wrong, it may become a battlefield, mashed flat by the military forces of the major world powers. One way or another, it's going to be a wild ride. <br><br>Tyler, that's certainly one possibility. <br><br>Wistful, a large part of the difference is that Canada and Australia were largely settled by emigrants from Britain who, once they were overseas, got wistful about the Old Country. The US didn't have the chance to settle overseas colonies with its own excess population; it sent them westwards, which is why you have so much American patriotism out west.<br><br><a href=looking-backward-looking-ahead.html#c1197403554227803574 title="comment permalink">2/9/12, 2:22 PM</a><br><br>

Canned salmon was "cheap" (if you didn't count the dent made in the entire coastal ecosystem) and (like tea with sugar) made a convenient fodder for underpaid factory workers. I think it also ended up being a strategic resource for feeding UK soldiers in WWII.<br><br>Of course now, as we eat our way down the food chain, salmon is considered a high-status food... even the pallid, artificially-dyed "farmed" variety. Go figure. <br><br>Another aspect of the downslope of Empire is the slowly degrading quality of the "luxuries" fed to the core to keep it quiet and obedient. As the high-value resources are used up, lower and lower-value resources are substituted. As I have often said, people these days eat fish that my Granddad would have used for bait... Presumably this process goes on until the whole system collapses or we all end up eating algae, or each other, or plastic, or...? [I mean, it's legal today to put as much as 3% pure cellulose into food products, so we're already eating sawdust.

While getting rid of our respective and becoming, for all purposes, American quasi-protectorates, was probably beneficial, it definitely was a rough process. France had to go through more than twenty years of uninterrupted warfare, a significant part of which happened on its core territory and two military coups, one of which was successful – yes, Algeria was considered a part of France and De Gaule was put into power by the Army.

An interesting phenomenon is at work in France, no matter whether the current government is right wing or not : the state run services, which once covered the whole territory (post offices, tax offices, police, hospitals...) are progressively regrouped in large cities or “delegated” to resource-starved local or regional authorities<br><br><a href=looking-backward-looking-ahead.html#c3991228531447826184 title="comment permalink">2/10/12, 8:18 AM</a><br><br>

The nuclear "option" was madness, but it made for a terrific (I mean that in both senses of the word) news story. Matt Simmons ideas on how the ocean was going to become completely toxic due to a layer of oil that was, over time, going to slowly rise to the top killing everything in its path also seemed sensational. <br><br>Perhaps one of the best lessons, at least as an observer and not someone involved in the operations of oil rigs, was that you need to take what anyone says in the media with a grain of salt.

I actually had drifted away from this blog for a bit and largely missed that series of posts.

It's been a huge influence on my thinking and has helped take my life in very good directions. I also want to thank the commenters here for the impressive amount of feedback and added information. I'll finally note that this blog's community extends far, indeed. I have a few regular readers of my own blog now who came from here and provide me fantastic and thought-provoking feedback, so you're even helping create spin off communities. Well done.<br><br>Thirdly, I'm very eager for the empire series. I think it's going to be fascinating and, as always, look forward to your illumination of our current situation with historical examples. I never cared much for history in school, but you've helped me realize how fascinating and necessary it is.

I'll try to think of possibilities as we proceed. <br><br>Cherokee, we'll certainly be talking about debt, as part of the mismatch between real and hallucinatory wealth that's become such a massive political force these days. <br><br>Mustard, no argument there. <br><br>Hadashi, thank you. I've suspected for a long time that one of the main factors keeping the collective conversation of our time down at a level of thought appropriate to unusually spoiled six-year-olds is simply the absence of what used to be called ordinary courtesy. The way this blog's community has blossomed makes me think there might just be something to that. <br><br>Maria, it's precisely because my readers were willing and able to explore the possibilities of magic, instead of rejecting them out of hand as most people do these days, that I decided to take the risk. I'm glad it paid off. <br><br>Damien, good to hear from you again! I didn't know that France was going through the process of offloading government services onto local authorities that can't afford them -- that's happening over here, too. I'm wondering now if that may turn out to be a standard feature of the decline now under way. <br><br>Mark, glad to hear it. <br><br>JD, I've exchanged emails with the publisher, and should be able to submit the whole anthology next week if all goes well. Thank you, and thanks to all who submitted stories, for helping make this happen!<br><br>MawKernewek, Israel's going to have to be discussed in the upcoming posts, yes.

I've been interested to note, though, that when I explain to Americans what an empire is, and talk about the obvious evidence that we have one, they rarely argue. We'll see how that works shortly. <br><br>Jason, I haven't read Greene in too long -- will have to correct that. <br><br>DW, I'll take that under advisement -- and will certainly check out his translation. <br><br>Joel, thank you! Spinoff communities are a very good thing -- it's precisely when the ideas we're developing here go spinning out to become part of a wider conversation that the possibility of having a real effect on our time comes within reach. <br><br>Yupped, "popcorn-worthy" -- now that's a useful term! Not to mention a very good label for the near future. The decline and fall of the American empire is partly a function of the collapse of the debt economy, but it's also got other drivers -- more on this down the road a bit. <br><br>Croatoan, very funny. Many thanks!<br><br>Larry, the US only thinks it's the best house in a bad neighborhood. It's got a spiffy new paint job and brand new gutters, true, but the frame is riddled with dry rot and the residents are pulling up floorboards and burning them to stay warm in the winter. One of the standard features of imperial decay is that the facade of power and wealth endures long after the reality has hollowed out. We'll be talking about this extensively in the months to come. <br><br>Gwyneth, thank you. <br><br>Rich, it's always useful to pay attention to what the upper end of the chattering classes are saying, and not only because some of their slogans end up becoming policy. Measure the gap between what <i>Foreign Policy</i> is willing to discuss and what's actually happening and you glimpse the delusions that are driving the US into the ground.

Adding to it the ecological collapse makes it even more honest. <br>How do we create communities, outside of the empirical model (Town boards, Mayors, Congressional reps, etc), that are able to grow food in a vastly changing environment? <br>I just read that the UK is looking at devising a public program promoting the eating of bugs. They want to make it seem normal and cool...Now...Good idea since there won't be anymore fish at the rate they are either being fished or dying... See the docu. A Sea Change, for further unnerving regarding this.<br>The bottom line is our food and water. <br>Unless we develop communities NOW that are able to adapt to already present environmental pressures, the Empire collapse question won't even be pertinent. <br>But you are so right that Empire collapse will complicate how we get ready for environmental changes...<br><br>That's why thousands of people around the globe have stepped out of the Empire paradigm and initiated Transition Towns.

It deals with the three main drivers of American historic involvement in the Middle East: Power (Political/Military), Faith(Religious interests), and Fantasy (The romantic ideal derived from Arabian Nights, etc.) <br>I think the Middle East/Islamic world will prove to be the canary in the coal mine as all of this unfolds due to the fact that the ratio of people to arable land and water is so heavily weighed against them. I believe the Arab Spring is really an expression of this.<br> @Cracked Pot, I have read many different analyses regarding the ratios of Muslims to native Europeans in Europe in 2050. The general (non politically skewed) percentage seems to be around %20-%25. This is a large number but it isn't anywhere near where a lot of the right wing factions in Europe lead one to believe. These numbers are also usually based on the belief in continued economic growth and sustained levels of immigration, so they may be high. The tide already seems to be turning against much more Muslim immigration to Europe. What will be interesting to see is how well Somali immigrants in Sweden cope with the Swedish winters when central heat stops, as one example. Race is really nothing more than a physical representation of climate adaptation and the only factor where race does actually matter.<br>Regarding the US military presence worldwide it is worth mentioning that every embassy has military personnel assigned to it. Another important thing to consider is the fact that a lot of US military presence worldwide is not actually US forces. During the British Raj period in India most of the British forces there were actually native Indians with British leadership. The School of the Americas is a similar example of this for the US.<br><br><a href=looking-backward-looking-ahead.html#c8002140507594814861 title="comment permalink">2/12/12, 2:15 PM</a><br><br>

In short, a rocky, energy-starved country with a bloated bureaucracy and a populace that excels at evading taxes is incapable of paying off its mountain of debt.<br><br>Greece's creditors were foolish to loan them money in the first place, and the Greeks are delusional if they think early, pensioned retirement (among other benefits) at their *expected* standard of living can be provided to the masses given their current financial position and deficiency of crucial natural resources. They should walk away from the debt (it won't ever be repaid) and go about creating an economy that can meet basic needs while consuming as little imported energy as possible. (Or create products and services that cover the cost of these imports!) The EU, however, could choose to subsidize Greece by handing it more and more money, but that course of action won't make crude oil bubble out from under the Aegean or give Greece massive plains of golden wheat :)<br><br>But times haven't changed much, have they?

What I liked about your treatment of hope was that you got past the superficial way that the word is all too commonly used, and laid out a deeper and useful meaning for the word. I mentioned "progress" and the others as examples of words that might also have more profound meanings.<br><br>With this, and your response, on my mind, I came up with the following in a half-dream last night: "Progress is the deepening understanding of the way the world works, and the consequent change of one's behavior, in accordance with that understanding, to make it more consonant with the world's workings." I'm not offering it as a serious definition, but it might point in a useful direction. (By the way, i think there's a possible feedback loop there: part of the change in behavior may be aimed at further deepening that understanding, which leads to further change.)<br><br>Another quick thought on progress: neither progress nor regress proceed linearly -- rather, through sequences of anabolic and catabolic phases (as you've pointed out in various contexts). Given that this is the "way the world works", it behooves, say, a Green Wizard, to learn to work effectively in both situations, and to recognize the onset of phase transtions.<br><br><a href=looking-backward-looking-ahead.html#c6843358391007489309 title="comment permalink">2/13/12, 9:42 PM</a><br><br>

Still, the short form is that an empire is a system of political and economic dominance of one nation over other nations, while a civilization is a basic mode of complex urban society among human beings. Any one civilization (say, Western industrial civilization) may contain several different empires, either at the same time (the British and French empires, say, in 1900) or at different times (the British empire and the American empire, for example). Thus empires rise and fall within the broader arc of a civilization's rise and fall, though the fall of the last empire in any given civilization usually takes place at the same time as the fall of the civilization. Is that a bit clearer? <br><br>Jean-Vivien, the Tao Te Ching project isn't strictly speaking a translation; it's an adaptation, focusing on the book's implications for systems theory, and is based on current scholarly translations. I have a basic grounding in classical Chinese grammar and the vocabulary Lao Tsu used, but no, I'm not fluent in modern Chinese. As for the point of sadomasochism, I have no idea; it interests me about as much as the sex life of sea slugs. <br><br>Jonathan, good! Yes, I'll be talking about those empires, and not merely because Americans tend to be clueless about history; there are important lessons to be learned from them. <br><br>Goldrush, it's all the more fascinating in that the US is embracing more and more overtly imperial imagery as the economic and energetic basis for its empire drains away. At this rate we'll have legions in gorgeous gilt armor shouting "Hail, Mr. President!

These rewards vary with the type of activity. The physical stuff, when more than symbolic, stresses the body in order to stimulate physiological responses akin to a runner's high (endorphins and the kind of trance state in which ego boundaries disappear). S/M techniques for achieving such states with an assistant (the top) require less personal effort than training for a marathon, fasting or meditating for hours on end. <br><br>The role playing, for some people, is a way to cope with deep rooted guilt or shame about sex by pretending to be someone else. For some, it's a safe way to be scared, like watching a horror movie. Sometimes the costumes and roleplaying are just ways to make a partner more sexually attractive by employing a fetish or fantasy. <br><br>Dominants ("tops") sometimes don't receive any direct sexual gratification from the scene.
