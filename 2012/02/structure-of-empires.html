Empires, as last week’s post noted, have been around for a long time. The evidence of history suggests that they show up fairly promptly once agriculture becomes stable and sophisticated enough to support urban centers, and go away only when urban life also breaks down. Anyone interested in tracking the rise and fall of empires thus has anything up to five thousand years of fairly detailed information from the Old World, and well over three thousand years from the New—plenty of data, one would think, for a coherent picture to emerge.<br><br>Unfortunately one major difficulty stands in the way of such a picture, and it’s one that was mentioned last week: empires attract doubletalk the way a dead rat attracts flies. Some of the doubletalk comes from rival power centers, outside the empire du jour or within it, that hope to excuse their own ambitions by painting that empire in the least complimentary colors that can be found, but an even larger amount gets produced by empires themselves—or, more exactly, by the tame intellectuals that empires produce and employ in numbers as large as the imperial economy can support. Between the doubletalk meant to make any given empire seem much worse than its rivals, and the doubletalk meant to make the same empire seem much better than its rivals, understanding is an early casualty.<br><br>Last week’s post gave a few examples of the first class of doubletalk. I could cite any number of examples of the second, but one that’s particularly relevant to the theme of this series of posts is that shibboleth of contemporary economics, free trade. That term’s become so thickly encrusted with handwaving and deliberate disinformation that it probably needs to be defined here; “a system of international exchange that prohibits governments from taxing or prohibiting the movement of goods, services, or money across borders” is as good a definition as any.<br><br>Pick up an introductory textbook of economics, though, and your chances of finding an objective assessment of a system of this kind are very low indeed. Instead, what you’ll find between the covers is a ringing endorsement of free trade, usually in the most propagandistic sort of language. Most likely it will rehash the arguments originally made by British economist David Ricardo, in the early 19th century, to prove that free trade inevitably encourages every nation to develop whatever industries are best suited to its circumstances, and so produces more prosperity for everybody. Those arguments will usually be spiced up with whatever more recent additions appeal to the theoretical tastes of the textbook’s author or authors, and will plop the whole discussion into a historical narrative that insists that once upon a time, there were silly people who didn’t like free trade, but now we all know better.<br><br>What inevitably gets omitted from the textbook is any discussion, based in actual historical examples, of the way that free trade works out in practice That would be awkward, because in the real world, throughout history, free trade pretty consistently hasn’t done what Ricardo’s rhetoric and today’s economics textbooks claim it will do. Instead, it amplifies the advantages of wealthy nations and the disadvantages of poorer ones, concentrating capital and income in the hands of those who already have plenty of both while squeezing out potential rivals and forcing down wages across the board. This is why every nation in history that’s ever developed a significant industrial sector to its economy has done so by rejecting the ideology of free trade, and building its industries behind a protective wall of tariffs, trade barriers, and capital controls, while those nations that have listened to the advice of the tame economists of the British and American empires have one and all remained mired in poverty and dependence as long as they did so.<br><br>There’s a rich irony here, because not much more than a century ago, a healthy skepticism toward the claims of free trade ideology used to be standard in the United States. At that time, Britain filled the role in the world system that the United States fills today, complete with the global empire, the gargantuan military with annual budget to match, and the endless drumbeat of brushfire wars across what would one day be called the Third World, and British economists were accordingly the world’s loudest proponents of free trade, while the United States filled the role of rising industrial power that China fills today, complete with sky-high trade barriers that protected its growing industries, not to mention a distinctly cavalier attitude toward intellectual property laws.<br><br>One result of that latter detail is that pirate editions of the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> were produced and sold by a number of American firms all through the 19th century. Most of these editions differed from their British originals in an interesting way, though. The entry for “Free Trade” in the original editions repeated standard British free-trade economic theory, repeating Ricardo’s arguments and dismissing criticisms of free trade out of hand; the American editors by and large took the trouble to replace these with entries critiquing free trade ideology in much the same terms I’ve used in this post. The replacement of pro- with anti-free trade arguments in these pirate editions, interestingly enough, attracted far more denunciation in the British press than the piracy itself got, which shows that the real issues were tolerably well understood at the time.<br><br>When it comes to free trade and its alternatives, that level of understanding is nowhere near so common these days, at least in the United States—I’ve long suspected that businessmen and officials in Beijing have a very precise understanding of what free trade actually means, though it would hardly be to their advantage just now to talk about that with any degree of candor. On this side of the Pacific, by contrast, even those who speak most enthusiastically about relocalization and the end of corporate globalism apparently haven’t noticed how effectively tariffs, trade barriers, and capital controls foster domestic industries and rebuild national economies—or perhaps it’s just that too many of them aren’t willing to consider paying the kind of prices for their iPods and Xboxes that would follow the enactment of a reasonable tariff, much less the prices that would be required if we had the kind of trade barriers that built the American economy and could build it again, and American workers were paid American wages to make them.<br><br>Free trade is simply one of the mechanisms of empire in the age of industrialism, one part of the wealth pump that concentrated the wealth of the globe in Britain during the years of its imperial dominion and does the same thing for the benefit of the United States today. Choose any other mechanism of empire, from the web of military treaties that lock allies and subject nations into a condition of dependence on the imperial center, through the immense benefits that accrue to whatever nation issues the currency in which international trade is carried out, to the way that the charitable organizations of the imperial center—missionary churches in Victoria’s time, for example, or humanitarian NGOs in ours—further the agenda of empire with such weary predictability: in every case, you’ll find a haze of doubletalk surrounding a straightforward exercise of imperial domination. It requires a keen eye to look past the rhetoric and pay attention to the direction the benefits flow.<br><br>Follow the flow of wealth and you understand empire. That’s true in a general and a more specific sense, and both of these have their uses. In the general sense, paying attention to shifts in wealth between the imperial core and the nations subject to it is an essential antidote to the popular sort of nonsense—popular among the tame intellectuals previously mentioned, at least, and their audiences in the imperial core—that imagines empire as a sort of social welfare program for conquered nations. Whether it’s some old pukka sahib talking about how the British Empire brought railroads and good government to India, or his neoconservative equivalent talking about how the United States ought to export the blessings of democracy and the free market to the Middle East, it’s codswallop, and the easiest way to see that it’s codswallop is to notice that the price paid for whatever exports are under discussion normally amounts to the systematic impoverishment of the subject nation.<br><br>In the specific sense, flows of wealth can be used to trace out the structure of empire, which is a more complex matter than the basic outline discussed so far might make it seem. It’s entirely possible that a long time ago, when empires were new, there might have been one or two that consisted, on the level of nations, of a single imperial nation and a circle of subject nations; and on the level of populations, of a single ruling class and an undifferentiated mass of oppressed subjects. If empires this simple did exist, though, it was a very long time ago.<br><br>Nowadays an imperial system normally involves at least four distinct categories of nations, and an even more complex set of population divisions. On the level of nations, the imperial nation is in a category of its own; around it is an inner circle of allied nations, who support the empire in exchange for a share of the spoils; the third category consists of subject nations, the cash cows that the empire milks, and in due time will milk dry; finally, around the periphery, are enemy nations that oppose the empire in peace and war. In theory, at least, this last category shouldn’t be necessary, but it may not be accidental that when an empire loses one enemy, the usual response is to go shopping for another.<br><br>On the level of populations, the sort of crudely manipulative rhetoric that divides an elite 1% from an oppressed 99%, which was made popular last year by the Occupy movement, is a formidable barrier to understanding. An empire that tried to manage its affairs along those lines would fall in weeks. From ancient Rome to contemporary Washington DC, “divide and conquer” has always been the basic strategy of empire, and the classic way to do that in modern times is to hand out shares of wealth and privilege unequally to different sectors of the population. The British empire turned this into an art form, using arbitrary privileges and exclusions of various kinds to keep ethnic groups in each subject nation so irritated at one another that they never got around to uniting against the British. From the simmering rivalry between India and Pakistan, through the troubles of Northern Ireland, to the bitter mutual hatreds of Israelis and Arabs in what used to be British Palestine, the ethnic hatreds whipped up deliberately for the sake of Britain’s imperial advantage remain a live issue today.<br><br>These same divisions can be traced out within the imperial nation as well, and readily make hash out of any attempt to sort things out along the simplistic “us and them” lines favored by political activists. In contemporary America, for example, different sectors of the population are subject to the same sort of privileges and exclusions that defined so much of life in British India; if you’re an American citizen, the average annual income of your parents is a more exact predictor of your own income than any other factor, but your gender, your skin color, the location on the urban-rural spectrum of the neighborhood where you grew up, and a great many other arbitrary factors have far more to say about your prospects in life than America’s egalitarian ideology would suggest. These complexities are hardly accidental.<br><br>Still, there’s more going on here than simple manipulation from the top down. Within an imperial system, different nations and population groups are always competing against one another for a larger share of the wealth and privilege that empires make available. That happens on the scale of nations, for example, when a subject nation in a strategic location becomes an ally, or when an ally—as America did in 1945—supplants the former imperial center and takes the empire for its own. That also happens on the scale of populations, and on smaller scales still.<br><br>The ruling class of any nation, for example, consists of a loose alliance of power centers, held together by the pressures of mutual advantage, but constantly pursuing their own divergent interests and eagerly trying to claim a larger share of power and wealth at the expense of the other power centers. There are always families, factions, and social groups rising up into the ruling class at any given point, and others falling out of it; while outside the ruling class is an even more complex constellation of groups who support power centers within the ruling class, who expect to receive wealth and privileges in return for their support, and who rise and fall in their own intricate rhythm. Proceed step by step down the pyramid, and you’ll find the same complexities in place all the way down to the bottom, where a flurry of ethnic, cultural, and social groups compete with one another over whose oppression ought to get the most attention from middle class liberals.<br><br>On the level of nations or that of populations, in other words, it’s neither possible nor useful to divide the structure of empire into the simplistic categories of oppressor and oppressed, ruler and ruled. Many nations in any imperial system fall between the summit and the base of the pyramid, and are permitted to pump wealth out of nations lower down on the condition that they forward a certain fraction of the take further up. The vast majority of people in the imperial nation and its allies, and a certain fraction of those even in the most heavily exploited subject nations, receive at least a modest share of wealth and privilege in exchange for their cooperation in maintaining the imperial system, compete constantly for a bigger share, and generally limit their criticisms of the imperial system to those aspects of it that profit somebody else. That’s why empires have proven to be so enduring a human social form; the basic toolkit of empire includes an ample assortment of ways to buy the loyalty, or at least the passive acquiescence, of all those potential power centers that might otherwise try to destabilize the imperial system and bring the empire crashing down.<br><br>Yet empires do come crashing down, of course. The fact that the form has proven to be enduring has not given a comparable endurance to any individual empire. Britons during Victoria’s reign liked to boast that the sun never set on the British empire—though that may have been, as the Irish liked to suggest, because God Himself wouldn’t trust an Englishman in the dark—but the sun did set on that empire in due time, and once the sunset started, it proceeded with remarkable speed. Children who were just old enough to remember the celebration of Victoria’s diamond jubilee in 1897, when the empire was not far from its zenith, had not yet reached retirement age when the last tattered scraps of that empire went whistling down the wind.<br><br>The collapse of the British empire is a fascinating story in its own right, but it’s also an object lesson of great importance just now. That collapse opened a window of opportunity through which several nations tried to climb, and the one that succeeded is today’s dominant imperial power, the United States of America. Understand Britain’s imperial sunset, and the broader patterns by which empires overshoot their economic basis and go under, and you understand one of the most important and least anticipated facts of the decades ahead of us—the parallel collapse of the American empire, and the struggle to replace it. We’ll explore that in outline next week.<br><br>*****************<br><span style=font-size:130%>End of the World of the Week #10</span><br><br>England has a long history of tolerating eccentrics, and its apocalyptic prophets have accordingly been among the more colorful examples of the species. From the Middle Ages through to the present, some truly exotic claims have been made by English prophets, but I know of only one who announced that she would bring about the Second Coming by the simple and elegant means of duplicating the role of the Virgin Mary and giving birth to Christ.<br><br>This was Joanna Southcott. Born in 1750 in the West Country village of Gittisham, Southcott led an unremarkable life until middle age, when she began to develop a reputation as what people at that time politely called a “wise woman” and earlier generations had called by the more robust label of “witch.” Her skills as a folk healer and fortuneteller attracted a modest following, which grew considerably in 1792 when she announced that she was the woman clothed with the Sun described in the twelfth chapter of the Book of Revelation. Moving to London, she began issuing prophecies in bad verse—one of them stating that the Second Coming would occur in the year 2004—and providing followers with seals that declared them members of the fortunate 144,000 who would enter into the New Jerusalem.<br><br>One of the job requirements of the woman clothed with the Sun, though, was to give birth to a man child who would rule the nations with a rod of iron. In 1814, at the age of 64, Southcott announced that she was pregnant and would give birth to the Messiah after the normal interval. Nine months later, with an exquisite sense of timing, she died; her followers, convinced she was in a trance, kept her body warm with hot water bottles until the smell of decay became intolerable.<br><br>—story from <a href="http://www.vivaeditions.com/book_page.php?book_id=25">Apocalypse Not</a>

Every generation is aware of failed empires, but each generation seems to rationalize why they must be different.

Australia has more head of sheep than pretty much anywhere else on the planet and we produce wool and meat (lamb and mutton) cheaper than pretty much anywhere else too. Yet despite this and a US - Australia free trade agreement the tariffs on imported wool and sheep meat products in the US are such that they protect a very small number of sheep farmers in the US. Go figure?<br><br>The wealth pump is an old tool. Take one project for example, currently Australia is pumping money into the US military for the development of the Joint Strike Fighter project and we haven't seen a single aircraft yet. Unsurprisingly enough, earlier last century we were pumping money into the British military via the purchase of ships for the Australian navy which was intended to augment British sea power in the Pacific via Australian expenditure. Such is life on the in.<br><br>Your description of power centres, pyramids and shifting alliances seems spot on to me. Truly I no longer understand why people are so fixated on the old binary of left and right when discussing power struggles and politics. To me it seems more like pedalling influence and dividing the spoils which is why there is virtually no change when a supposedly ideologically different goverment is elected. I might be wrong, but that's how it seems to me.<br><br>I read a funny bit of invective that I thought you'd enjoy:<br><br>"That's shear bullypup!"<br><br>From the master story teller himself - Jack Vance.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=structure-of-empires.html#c7074107493703357122 title="comment permalink">2/22/12, 10:14 PM</a><br><br>

Under the illusion, I might add, that they're doing something new and original. <br><br>DeAnander, without meaningful protection for intellectual property, writers, artists, musicians and other creative people have no way to make a living from their work. Of course the corporate sphere has taken that valid point much further than it should reasonably go, and the political sphere has taken it further still; still, I'd like to see the people who think they shouldn't have to pay for creative work stop getting a paycheck for whatever they do for a living, and see what they think of their own logic then. <br><br>Cherokee, I'll remember "bullypup" -- that's a good one.

Regarding your observation that "a healthy skepticism toward the claims of free trade ideology used to be standard in the United States," Chang likes to show American audiences the quote, "within 200 years, when the US has gotten out of protection all it can offer, then it too will adopt free trade." He then asks them who said it: Dennish Kucinich? He then shows them a $5 bill, pointing out that Grant was responding to the British Thomas Friedmans of the day, who were who argued that the U.S. would remain backward if it failed to open up its markets to the extent of Latin America. After all, the world was flat, right?<br><br><a href=structure-of-empires.html#c4004737698506113699 title="comment permalink">2/23/12, 12:08 AM</a><br><br>

I ask this because having travelled the world and lived amongst many different peoples, it really is the case that the higher the income ladder you go (in any nation), the more English is spoken, even if it is just loanwords tossed into the local tongue. With it comes of course cultural influences, values and ideas from the Anglosphere (now primarily America, but in the past it was Britain) that are only reinforced when people study English. Most of my colleagues from Asia who have sufficiently studied English to fluency might be nominally anti-American, but still readily digest the political philosophies and intellectual movements of the USA while dismissing their native cultural institutions as 'traditional'. With this comes emulation of social structures and political institutions.<br><br>Historically in former empires this was much the case as well. The whole of East Asia learned Chinese and with it Chinese values, statecraft and philosophy. During the heyday of Muslim empires everyone from Spain to India wanted to learn Arabic with similar results.<br><br>Basically, the language of an empire becomes a prestigious subject of study and the more an outsider learns it, the more access to privilege and wealth they will have. This is why the majority of children in Asia are expected, if not ordered, to learn English.<br><br><a href=structure-of-empires.html#c2214603506791730324 title="comment permalink">2/23/12, 12:48 AM</a><br><br>

It became clear that 'ownership' of the global inventory of world crops was neither a trivial nor unrelated issue. There are interesting requirements enshrined in what were then, 1994, GATT agreements, and that are now subsumed under World Trade Organization (WTO). Signatories must for example adopt some legal plant variety property protection. I will not go on, but unresolved issues of 'farm-saved' or 'farmers' seed, were major obstacles. One way favored by conglomerates who were busy hoovering-up both seed companies and technology, was to move toward patenting. Stick a novel gene into it and it was yours and the world must pay rent for as long as it takes to reap large profit. <br>I have been thinking about these realities since I was 17 when I won a formal school debate, (England in the late 50s), using the slogan of the day: "Aid through Trade". I was an honest though naive lad and the arguments I had trotted out then kept coming back for detailed scrutiny over the years. Haunted me? Eventually they were refuted by examples both contemporary and historical. <br>It’ s interesting that a recent DOHA trade round failed in China because of agricultural trade, much to the puzzlement of a British politician who was doing time as the EU Trade Commissioner. Mandelson seemed genuinely not to understand why China could not go for free-trade in agriculture or horticulture. The fact could have escaped him that half the population of China still lives on the land while their children increasingly work in factories and building sites. They produce a lot of food per acre but perforce must eat most of it themselves and sell the remainder to buy essential inputs. A very tricky proposition for China not to pauperize that lot (i.e. deny them the means for a living) while feeding the growing urban masses with cheap enough food. And they must grow a middle-class at the same time. So it goes. Real instances trump theory every time. For whatever reason I do not know, but I keep worrying over details; so these discussions help.<br><br><a href=structure-of-empires.html#c4960297228401265506 title="comment permalink">2/23/12, 2:49 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c5545337043840359025></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/12572732427329842166 rel=nofollow>wvjohn</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>A nice analysis especially in light of the current political maneuvering leading up to the next presidential election. Viewed from a cynic's perch, the paymasters of the American Empire must be rolling in the aisles laughing at the antics on the Republican side, with each candidate trying to empower an increasingly marginal but vocal following. It hearkens back to the days of the British Raj where the Majarajah of X was encouraged to dispute some marginal claim with his neighbors in the hope of a slightly larger piece of the pie. Of course, there is absolutely no reason the centers of power would want to see a change in the current regime: their interests are now well protected. The financial industries managed to nearly destroy the economy by a variety of actions, both legal and illegal, but the current administration is much more interested in shutting down online poker sites and locking up street level drug dealers than poking around Wall Street and alienating its “supporters.”<br><br>The ultimate purpose of this thaumaturgy is, of course, to deflect any meaningful discussion of anything that might upset the apple cart, both at the national and world levels. It would be amusing to see some talking head ask a candidate to evaluate the chance of the US becoming a client state of the Chindian Empire, as Greece has become to the EU. The list obviously goes on and on. <br><br>It is a daunting task to try and look down the timeline into the lives of our children and what that might be, much less the children of the 7th generation. But we can take heart from the fact that there is a growing community of people willing to discuss these issues with some intellectually honesty, and who are willing to begin the transition to a different form of society.

It's amazing to hear his words:<br><br>"Listen, O fairest queen of thy world, Rome, welcomed amid the starry skies, listen, thou mother of men and mother of gods, thanks to thy temples we are not far from heaven: thee do we chant, and shall, while destiny allows, for ever chant. " <br><br>Rome was over, but it appears Rutilius simply refused to believe it. He was of the opinion that Rome's failure was setting the stage for a roaring comeback:<br><br>"Raise, O Rome, the triumphal laurels which wreathe thy locks, and refashion the hoary eld of thy hallowed head to tresses fresh and fair. Golden let the diadem flash on thy tower-crowned helmet; let the golden buckler belch forth perpetual fires! Let forgetfulness of thy wrongs bury the sadness of misfortune; let pain disregarded close and heal thy wounds. Amidst failure it is thy way to hope for prosperity: after the pattern of the heavens losses undergone enrich thee.

It is more likely that the collapse will occur more gradually over decades and maybe even over a century similar to ancient empires based on a conflagration of states such as the Zhou dynasty in ancient china. I suspect that the empire will collapse slowly as local powers(states) starts to ignore or gain considerable power when the federal government lost its mandate for rule for example by not helping the states due to the bankruptcy of the federal government. However, the american empire may linger on in name at least for more decades but in form local states will start to dominate and in the post peak world, it is even possible for different states to become aggressive towards each other over the different resources available.<br><br><a href=structure-of-empires.html#c1426630135519262399 title="comment permalink">2/23/12, 7:48 AM</a><br><br>

I didn't know about this.<br><br>Regarding the end of the US empire, I don't think this is something new. At least in continental Europe there have been books and opinion pieces about an emerging "multipolar world order" for years. The reasoning is that with the collapse of the other "empire", the Soviet Union, the US filled the void for a decade or so, but now others are up and coming. <br><br>These articles and books also usually suggest that we must build a stronger EU, loosen our ties with the US (at least to some extent) and cooperate more with Russia, China, India and the Middle East. As far as I can tell, this is quite an influential way of thought among many (continental) European politicians and is actively being pursued. Europeans have always been opportunistic, you know. :)<br><br>We certainly live in interesting times now. The United States are struggling to maintain their worldwide influence, but ultimately, this will prove impossible. Germany is slowly restoring its "soft hegemony" over continental Europe, with France as an accomplice (lately, Sarkozy has publicly suggested several times that France and the rest of Europe need to become more like Germany). Southern Europe is being forced to adopt the economic and political ways of the North (i.e. Germany). The EU is getting stronger and more dominated by Germany the longer the current "debt crisis" lasts - and it will probably last some time, because it's been convenient for Germany (and to some extent, France). The UK might eventually leave the EU altogether and intensify its relationship to the US; or, more likely, it might be forced to stay and accept even stronger integration by economic necessity.<br><br>And then there are Russia, China, India, Brazil and certain middle eastern countries trying to extend their own spheres of influence …<br><br><a href=structure-of-empires.html#c8556449704467805086 title="comment permalink">2/23/12, 7:54 AM</a><br><br>

They wanted to prevent the rise of domestic, self-sufficient industries outside of Britain (hence confict with the U.S.). Modern-day America, by contrast, exports raw materials and uses its trading partners mainly as sources of cheap labor (wage arbitrage), in the process exporting nearly its entire industrial base to China and leaving its own factories to rust in the rain. I remember seeing a reporter a few years back (I think it was on Moyers' show) at a West Coast port asking what came in and out. The manager replied that raw materials and agricultural products left the port, and manufactured goods from China came in. The reporter commented that this pattern was more in line with third-workd countries than the world's largest economy. Of course, the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency is what allows this. Meanwhile, instead of providing jobs its citizenry, the American empire has resorted to incarcertating them on a scale not seen since Stalin's Russia. One in four of the world's prisoners sits in an American jail. It also uselessly exhorts for "more education" as some kind of solution to this, despite its reluctuance to hire American labor (indeed, American corporations now hire more workers overseas than domestically, even before accounting for H1-B visas and the like).<br><br>Ruling over an impoverished and desperate populace seems to be an odd way to run an empire. More and more resources need to be spent on domestic policing just to keep the population in line. And to top it off, the welfare payouts that buy the complicity of the lower classes are not expanding, but rather are under assault by the wealthy class and their political backers in the Republican Party (We're broke!!). Are they nuts? Or do they really beleive their own rhetoric? Do they really think they can manipulate people through the media or intimidate them through the police and courts enough to keep their ill-gotten gains? The benefits of empire seem to be accruing to an ever-smaller slice of American society, while the costs (in money and blood) are quite well-distributed.<br><br>P.S. I was reminded of the intellectual property issue reading <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17017791 rel=nofollow>this BBC article</a> on how Charles Dickens soured on America. America in 1842 was like China today - full of pirated of editions of Dickens' novels, costing him quite a hefty sum. Dickens came to America full of idealism, and left thinking of Americans as lacking in social graces, rude, and obsessed with money.

This week's post brings to mind something from Kunstler's blog a few months ago, in which he wrote about a visit to Sweden. In no uncertain terms, Kunstler seemed to paint Sweden as this fairy-tale land full of tall, attractive, and intelligent people who lived on higher moral ground than the stupid, ugly, militaristic Americans. When I pointed out, in the comments section, that the Swedish people profit quite handsomely (think IKEA) from the American Empire, I received several fiery denunciations. When I suggested that, if the Swedish really had a problem with what the Americans were doing, they would stop cashing in by selling us their overpriced furniture (or, more to the point, developing fighter jets for the DoD--see Saab), it seemed that I had ruffled quite a few feathers. <br><br>It's common on the Left these days to see Europeans as oh-so-enlightened and above the brutal engagements of the American empire, when in reality they have all taken their turn at the empire game, and still do quite well for themselves as tight-knit American allies. Your post this week serves as a great counterpoint to that mistaken belief.<br><br><a href=structure-of-empires.html#c4195856318004162553 title="comment permalink">2/23/12, 8:58 AM</a><br><br>

The GOP seems to be going out of its way to find the most unelectable candidate they can. <br><br>SMJ, no contradiction at all.

When people steal my books online -- and there's quite a bit of that; check out how many torrent sites come up when you Google my name -- they're taking money out of my paycheck and making it harder for me to pay my bills and keep writing. If you don't like the current system of intellectual property, fine -- come up with some other way for writers, artists and musicians to make a living while doing their work; I'd be entirely cool with that.

Within the factions of the elite (cats in a sack) there have always been some that would take absolutely and leave nothing to the greatest extent possible. There have been others who recognized the instability of this approach, such as perhaps FDR. Periodically the scorched-earth set got the reigns and invariably over-reached with the expected backlash. <br><br>However, in times past there has been sufficient extra wealth in terms of natural resources or the spoils of empire after WWII to allow a correction back to stability. This time is a bit different, in that after the US peaked in oil production in the 1970s we moved into the realm of debt. We relied much more heavily on the tools of empire to provide the energy resources we needed. But we found there wasn't any need to take everything and leave nothing when you could simply create more out of thin air. The wealth pump ran overtime, but that was nowhere enough and the difference was borrowed – from the future and from the rest of the world. <br><br>There don't seem to be any reasonable voices anymore, maybe because it's obvious we cannot pay it back and there won't be enough, maybe because the idea of compromise got left behind when we believed we could have it all by borrowing. So now the scorched-earth crowd is everyone and there won't be enough spoils to buy off the large numbers who can't get what they want this time around.

There is a belief that any collapse must take place over a period of decades or even over the next century. It gets repeated often enough here so it must be believed to some extent.<br><br>I'm making no predictions, because I have no idea, but it does occur to me that we live in a rather abstract society.<br><br>If you take technology as an example. Over the past century or two technology has slowly developed on the back of older ideas / older technology. It's an incremental increase. To me current technology doesn't seem particularly backwardly compatible. A current vehicle, or say, a current tractor would be of little value in a world of constrained energy - even though the predecessors of that technology would have happily existed in a world of constrained energy.<br><br>Plus, with the loss of large scale, high volume manufacturing facilities in first world countries + the skills to build, operate, resource and maintain them you could not produce the appropriate technology items for a constrained energy world anyway - even if it was agreed that this was the correct way forward.<br><br>I guess the summary of this is, it is far easier to go up on a gentle trajectory, but virtually impossible to come down gently unless an organised retreat is generally agreed and acted upon.<br><br>Thanks for the mention of the ANZAC's. It never ceases to amaze me by how widely read you are. I can't adequately describe the national emotions surrounding the ANZAC's so I've attached a link to a song.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urtiyp-G6jY" rel=nofollow>Redgum - I was only 19</a><br><br>Since the fall of Singapore during WWII, Australia has thrown it's lot in with the US. The US came south to defend us against the Japanese. When people ask why would the free trade agreement be run the way it is, it is because that's how it is. Historically we looked to the UK for protection and now we look to the US. There is a price to be paid for this and we pay it.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=structure-of-empires.html#c7495390612859388551 title="comment permalink">2/23/12, 11:55 PM</a><br><br>

But, thoughtful and endearing old buffer though he seems, with a colourful career in front-line geopolitics, we need to remember he was British of his time and place toward the end of empire. There was plenty of decadence around in the upper reaches of European society pre-1914, but I am not sure that is what Glubb had in mind. <br>An alternative hypothesis occurs to me. Empires gradually go over the top by continuing the very same activities and expanding, or trying to expand the same structures that grew them in the first place? This might include expanding the reach of dominant aggressive sub-groups, or indeed, those sub-groups creating a whole culture in their own image. But it is BAU that does them in.<br>A study of the short-lived Swedish empire has revealed in that somewhat special case some stark realities and driving forces. An area of slow-growing forest where the season of good light is very short is not the eco-zone where one could expect much surplus food production. Convenient biomass while it lasts, iron smelting and export of iron and military equipment, can start a wealth pump, but it is a pump that needs ever more pumping. Any American doomsters looking for more fantasy material need go no further than large late-mediaeval armies roaming the adjacent erstwhile food-producing plains of North West Europe in the 17thC.

If these comments are unwarranted I apologize, but I have seen enough hints in your previous writings to feel inclined to offer two warnings. <br><br>I hope you will not succumb to the temptation to goad your American readers unnecessarily with supposed proofs that their nation is a grasping empire and that its moment in history has passed. Both of these things may be true, but going on about them excessively, especially in a snarky way, will not help anyone accept what is coming, and will only make it easier for opponents to paint you as a frustrated intellectual "hater" on the margins of society. Chomsky does something similar, demonstrating with great skill that the USA is a terrorist state and so on. Such assertions, made on purpose to provoke anger and outrage, do not help people. Few are convinced or guided; most are only prompted to resistance. You know that old story from Aesop about the sun and the wind.<br><br>The second warning -- related to the first -- is that I see grave complications in any argument that suggests the baton of world empire is in the process of being passed to China, something you hint at in this article and have suggested more than once in your earlier writings. The current Chinese state is essentially as dependent on fossil fuels as the American, their cities are as wasteful, their aspirations just as much orientated towards information and physical superhighways as our own. To demonstrate, with any credibility, that limitations of fossil fuel energy will necessarily favor that nation relative to the USA, would require far more thorough accounting than you have so far provided. A related problem is that the passing of "empires" appears only marginally related to Peak Energy at all -- it happened before the big run-up in energy use began, and continued to happen while that run-up was in progress.<br><br>Again, apologies if these comments are unfounded.

I think the mechanism goes something like this: <br><br>I'm a business owner who makes metal toys. It's 1970, and I'm doing okay. The workers in my American factory are unionized, so I have to pay them quite a bit. The workers in the steal mill are unionized and their operation is subject to environmental regulations that increase the cost of production, so I have to pay quite a bit to purchase my raw materials. <br><br>So I'm doing okay. I make 50 times the salary of the average worker in my company. But I could be doing better, much better.<br><br>What I need is a free trade agreement.<br><br>With a free trade agreement, I can move my entire operation to a third world country whose previous protectionist government has been recently overthrown by the United States. Once there, I don't have to pay my workers much, thus increasing my wealth, likely at their expense, since I've also brutally outcompeted any piddling local businesses. More, I can purchase my raw materials in this or another third world country whose compliant government has, again quite helpfully, eliminated any regulations that might have increased the cost of raw materials.<br><br>I thus extract, at a low cost to myself, resources directly from the periphery. I reduce the population in the target country to the condition of near-serfdom, especially if I buy up their productive land, which, thanks to that handy free trade agreement, I can do without restriction. Heck, I can even sell the fruits of their own labor and what used to be their land back to them at a markup. <br><br>Meanwhile, I get rich, the resources of the target country are transferred to me. My ability to leave renders the population in my home country more vulnerable, so that maybe in a few decades I can reopen a plant here at home at far lower cost. At the same time, the folks back home like the cheap goods I'm providing, and they also like the fact that it's someone else's land that's being destroyed to provide them, so they are unlikely to complain even as their living standard plummets. So everybody wins. <br><br>Is that basically it, or does anyone (JMG?) have a different understanding?<br><br><a href=structure-of-empires.html#c3783280749386353714 title="comment permalink">2/24/12, 1:25 PM</a><br><br>

Nevertheless an entertaining read and I thank the OP. It's interesting that Glubb ascribes the decline of empires to *deficiencies of character* in the population, accumulating over time (as sort of moral apoptosis) -- rather than to material factors like resource drawdown, lengthening supply lines, increased complexity with increasing inability to manage it, etc.<br><br>In essence he seems to be saying that manliness or masculinity -- warrior ethos -- leaches out of imperial culture over time, and this leads to collapse.

That doesn't mean that I'll be engaging in an exercise in fingerpointing, though. The point here is to understand what it means that the US is the current imperial center in the world system, and what its fall from that status will mean. <br><br>As for China, there's an issue here concerning time frames that I think you're missing. Of course any prospective Chinese global empire will be dependent on fossil fuels (though global empires don't have to be -- the British Empire was built at a time when wooden ships powered by sails were the world's most advanced transport technology). Right now, as I've argued in previous posts, we're in the transition between one form of industrial society, which I've called abundance industrialism, and another, which I've called scarcity industrialism; that latter is geared to the early downside of Hubbert's curve in the same way that abundance industrialism was geared to the upside, and so we probably have fifty to a hundred years in which various forms of scarcity industrialism remain in place, at least in some parts of the world, while others slide down into the salvage societies that will be the next phase. The Chinese empire I foresee will likely last through that period, and then fall in its turn -- and it's exactly the increasing shortages of energy, and of the things that energy can provide, that will both drive the shift in power from the US to China (or, just possibly, another power center) and then drive the later shift away from Chinese hegemony. <br><br>Jim, "what you contemplate, you imitate" seems apropos here -- spend too much time staring at NASCAR audiences, and you start to resemble them...<br><br>Glenn, a couple of commenters already in the stack have done as good a job as I could have done, showing how the process works. <br><br>Steve, good! The funny thing there was that the British Empire already existed when Voltaire wrote. To a great extent, Britain for him was the same kind of inkblot onto which to project political fantasies as, say, Cuba sometimes is for some sections of the American left (in and out of the peak oil scene). <br><br>DeAnander, yes, that was a popular bit of codswallop at that time, largely motivated by the tantrum British conservatives were throwing just then about the movement to give voting rights to women. Gah. That reminds me -- I'm probably going to have to bring up Otto Weininger one of these days; I'd rather not, but his ideas (filtered through the overheated prose of Julius Evola) are being rehashed by some corners of the occult community again, and may well spill outside of it in the years ahead.<br><br><a href=structure-of-empires.html#c2519662562635283434 title="comment permalink">2/24/12, 7:27 PM</a><br><br>

Why are their elites so cooperative? They as well as their people would do better if they developed their own resources and industries for themselves.<br><br>In the classic case of colonialism in English North America, the home country had a monopoly on manufacture, while the colonies provided raw materials and paid the freight both ways. The English displaced the natives and exploited the land. The French traded with the natives for furs and other luxuries. Very different ways of exploiting the same land. In the end, the English model prevailed in North America.<br><br>OPEC manufactures nothing, exports a comodity and does very well. The Congo manufactures nothing, exports commodities and does very poorly.<br><br>Why the differences?<br><br>One model is that in the formerly colonial countries the elite were trained to rob the people and siphon the wealth to the colonizers. In West Africa, after independence they continued, but kept the wealth. That's pretty obvious to me.<br><br>But there are many countries the U.S. (and other industrial nations) exploits in that fashion, that have never been colonized and which we have never defeated in war.

That's what happens to a subject nation that fails to toe the line.

In our financial system, money is created by banks making loans, and most dollars represent an IOU from someone to somebody else. Our financialized economy depends on creating an ever growing supply of debt. If that process stops, everything stops, yet the core of the empire can only absorb so much. We're drowning in debt. What to do? Ship it overseas! Make development loans to third world countries, loan monies to foreign companies and individuals, get other countries to only accept dollars for their goods so someone will have to borrow dollars. Trade government debt for stuff made in Asia. The opportunities are endless. <br><br>The incentive for free trade wasn't just vacuuming up all the good stuff that's out there.

The “wealth pump” idea makes a lot of sense, and I was often uneasy when NGOs reported on all the “good” they were bringing “poorer countries” – too often it seemed they were giving with one hand and crippling with the other!<br><br>I read the Glubb article, and it had much food for thought. However I did want to mention that red flags were raised for me in several areas, and I don’t think people should read it uncritically – ex: when he first says that the empire dates were “somewhat arbitrary”, but then immediately used the “amazing similarities in dates” as the basis for much of the subsequent article! That felt like slippery logic. So I looked up the range of empire dates (using Wikipedia – which I realize is also not meticulously verified) and some of Glubb’s dates matched, but a number of them seemed way off, which messes up his theory. Another example of sloppy thinking (or writing, at least): <i>Poor, hardy, often half-starved and ill-clad, they abound in courage, energy and initiative, overcome every obstacle and always seem to be in control of the situation.</i> I have to ask: Why, if they are “in control of the situation” are they “often half-starved and ill clad”?? It’s that kind of inconsistent reasoning that made me cautious.<br><br>And I became increasingly uneasy with all the “manly virtues” stuff, and no mention of women at all… and then I came to: <i> An increase in the influence of women in public life has often been associated with national decline.</i> Um… really?? Elisabeth the First might argue with that, or Boedicea, or Catherine the Great or Cleopatra… or more recently Maggie Thatcher and Hillary Clinton. He makes this blanket statement that reminds me of the “water must be making me drunk…” logic (if you haven’t heard that one, tell me). So then he lost quite a lot of credibility (not just because as a woman I bristle at this “inferior sex” stuff, but because I know the history of this better and so can refute it without a lot of research.) So all I will say is: caveat lector – read the pdf with a sharp, attentive mind.

I can't help but notice how many commenters refer to China and I wonder if somehow China is being portrayed as the new bogeyman? Is this a necessary thing to divert attention away from internal matters?<br><br>A couple of decades ago I used to work for a badly run business that always spent more than they earned. Eventually, the directors conceded their problems and decided to get financing. Fortunately for them a Malaysian company provided that financing very cheaply in return for equity in the business. So the directors kept spending on their merry way, until eventually the Malaysian company owned the business outright. It was an exceptionally cost effective way to purchase a business and avoid all that messy goodwill component. I think that the China - US situation is more like this. <br><br>It is unlikely to be settled on a military front, as they need you as much as you need them. There is often talk about China relying on its' large domestic market to see out any global downturn. This talk is poodledoo (I made that up!), because China relies heavily on imported energy and raw materials and their economy would quickly collapse without an export market with which to provide foreign exchange reserves to pay for it all. It is not for no reasons that China has such massive foreign exchange reserves (as well as raw materials). It is their buffer. Sure, they built an aircraft carrier, but they are more interested in rattling sabres with their neighbours over a few rocks in the South China Sea.<br><br>Hi pentronicus,<br><br>A lot of interesting financial products were sold off to Australia which turned out to be toxic assets (sub prime mortgages etc).

Toynbee connects hardiness to the paucity of the land, and Glubb does much the same thing.<br><br>Also, with Glubb, I seem to remember that he comments that women tend to rise toward the end of the lifespan of a civilisation because they remain less decadent than the men - he's not suggesting that women themselves bring on the decline.<br><br>It's a sociological fact that the sexual and gender "norms" that were fairly rigid until as recently as the 1950's have changed enormously in the ensuing decades. Now, this might be a good thing, but Glubb's suggestion that this is a temporary phenomenon associated with the breakdown of a civilisation does undermine the notion that it is a result of social "progress" in this area.<br><br>And as uncomfortable as that idea may be, I think Glubb is right on this. I would be very surprised indeed if the social and sexual mores of the West in one hundred years' time turn out to be as liberal as they are now.

My analysis centers on other factors. <br><br>Joel, that's a complex issue; the Civil War was a while ago, and the balance of power in the nation has shifted quite a bit -- you'll notice that much of what was the Union in 1861 is now known as the Rust Belt. More on this down the road a bit. <br><br>MawKernewek, until the Second World War, the annual exercises of the US Army focused on repelling a British invasion launched via Canada. A lot of old bases along the northern tier of states were pretty clearly positioned in case that became a possibility. Thanks for the links, also!<br><br>Dad, thank you!<br><br>Pentronicus, good. Another way of thinking about that is to notice that the US gets to import the wealth of the world and pay for it with essentially worthless IOUs. <br><br>Cathy, Glubb is problematic -- he's fascinating, in large part, because he's such a fine example of British imperial ideology. You'll notice that I don't cite him. <br><br>Cherokee, America's collective psychology always needs an enemy. Jung's comments on projecting the shadow are highly relevant here. I'm not so sure that all empires have the same requirement. As for China, if they're smart -- and I would bet that way -- they're utterly uninterested in fighting us; their best strategy is to wait until our empire collapses, and pick up the pieces, much the way we did with Britain in 1945. <br><br>Phil, my guess is that the shift in gender roles in recent decades will turn out to be more durable than that; the old structure of gender relationships had long since stopped being functional in much of any sense. Still, we'll see. <br><br>Jess, I'll be putting together a reading list as time and circumstances permit. Between the peak oil science fiction anthology, the peak oil and magic book, and the Green Wizardry book, time's been a bit sparse. Still, two of those are out of the way -- the anthology went to the publisher last week, and <i>The Blood of the Earth</i> is through proofs and indexing -- so I should be able to put more time into the literature of imperial collapse. <br><br>Lewis, I read his <i>The Reenchantment of the World</i> years ago, found it profoundly frustrating and problematic on many different levels, and haven't really followed his work since then. I'll have to take another look, though, since he's done a number of things on the decline of the American empire.<br><br><a href=structure-of-empires.html#c6208357066851450771 title="comment permalink">2/26/12, 6:05 PM</a><br><br>

S. might offer to another empire when such arises. The answer seems pretty clear to me, having lived for most of my life in the Midwest: farmland. Lots and lots of it. And about all of the land from about the Missouri-Kansas border east is farmable on rainfall, at least under current climate conditions. I wouldn't blame other nations with large populations for looking at that resource, and the way we've mismanaged it, with an eye toward making better use of it than we have.<br><br><a href=structure-of-empires.html#c4206706130896512020 title="comment permalink">2/27/12, 9:50 AM</a><br><br>

For Lewis &amp; JMG.<br> Morris Berman came a long journey from "Re-enchantment of the World". Along the road over the decades I for one was grateful for many of the subjects covered; not least his forensic antidote to New Age hind cast projections on to the ‘inkblot’ Palaeolithic. His more recent "Dark Ages America" to this non-American began to read like an extended rant, but I actually found it was interestingly well-researched, and moving. I don't think MB properly understood (2005/2006) peak oil, but he has a lovely quote from the great Cavafy poem "Waiting for the Barbarians", and an accompanying choice from Robert Lowell about policing the earth in a new Heart of Darkness; “our children when they fall in small war on the heels of small war”. This was Bush 2nd Term; maybe 'the barbarians' already were in charge, but Berman still bravely believed with Vidal, that we can count on "time's mystery and man's love of light". Otherwise he is firmly depressing and I guess rightly so.<br><br><a href=structure-of-empires.html#c6730663938511826848 title="comment permalink">2/27/12, 3:51 PM</a><br><br>

Wouldn't another empire have to ship the food by water if they were to make use of our farmland? I know that the Navy must be very vulnerable to peak oil and empire collapse ...
