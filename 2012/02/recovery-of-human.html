The myth of the machine, the theme of last week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> post, has implications that go well beyond the usual terms of discussion in the peak oil scene. One of those implications, which I mentioned briefly last week, unfolds from the way that so many people who are concerned about peak oil fixate obsessively on the hope that some kind of machine will solve the problem.<br><br>There are at least three ways in which this fixation gets in the way of any meaningful response to the end of the age of cheap abundant energy. The first, of course, is that peak oil isn’t a problem, because by definition a problem at least potentially has a solution. Peak oil has no solution. That’s true in the narrow sense of the term—no possible turn of events will allow industrial civilization to extract a limitless supply of crude oil from a finite planet—and it’s becoming increasingly clear that it’s just as true in the broad sense—no other energy source can provide anything close to the torrent of cheap, highly concentrated energy that petroleum provided to industrial society during the last century.<br><br>Peak oil is thus a predicament rather than a problem, since nothing we or anyone else can do will make it go away. Instead, we and our descendants down through the millennia to come will have to live with the reality of a world much less lavishly stocked with concentrated energy sources than the one our ancestors inherited a few short centuries ago. The task awaiting us and our descendants is that of finding creative and humane responses to that implacable reality. To that challenging and rewarding task, in turn, the current obsession with fantasies of salvation via machine offers no help at all. Quite the contrary, by distracting attention from the adjustments that will have to be made, the obsession makes the work ahead of us more difficult than it has to be.<br><br>The second sense in which the obsession with machines gets in the way of a useful response to the predicament of peak oil is that it pushes responsibility for doing something onto someone else. I sincerely doubt that any of my readers have any influence worth noting over the decisions involved in building giant wind turbines, say, or developing thorium reactors, or turning some substantial fraction of Nevada into one giant algal biodiesel farm. This makes it easy to insist that steps like these are the appropriate response to the coming of peak oil, since the people doing the insisting don’t have to follow through on the insistence; it’s all somebody else’s job.<br><br>No doubt the sheer convenience involved in this approach has much to do with its popularity, but there’s another factor involved. An enormous amount of rhetoric about the future these days starts from the assumption that the lifestyles of the middle classes in today’s industrial societies are normal, and ought to be available indefinitely—at least to those same middle classes. Now in fact there’s nothing normal at all about the pampered and privileged lives of today’s middle classes; from strawberries in midwinter to vacations in the tropics, those lives are full of the most absurd sort of extravagance, and only a civilization surfing the tsunami of cheap energy that ours gets from fossil fuels could convince itself that such habits are anything else. Still, those who have access to such things are predictably unwilling to let go of them, and insisting that it’s someone else’s job to come up with a way to keep them around is one way to express that unwillingness—at least for the moment.<br><br>The downside of depending on someone else to do that or any other job, of course, is that dependence always has a political cost. Frank Herbert’s classic SF novel <i>Dune</i> has one character explain this to another with commendable precision: "Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them." The same dynamic is present whenever people allow themselves to become dependent on machines, for reasons that follow from the points made last week.<br><br>Power exerted through a machine is defined purely by I-It relationships; the only way to relate to a machine is to compel and control it, and (not, please note, "or") to be compelled and controlled by it.. That defines the direct relation of person to machine, but it also tends to define the indirect relation of person to person when a machine is the medium. The logic here is straightforward: a machine can only transmit those aspects of relationship that require no inner life to communicate, since a machine has none. The more thoroughly an interaction between people is reshaped for machine processing, therefore, the more completely any potential for I-Thou relationship is filtered out of the interaction. <br><br>It’s possible for a relationship between people that passes through a machine to avoid being flattened out into a relationship of compulsion and control, but it takes work, and tends to be most successful when the people in question also have interactions that aren’t dependent on machines. The more that human life and human interactions are defined by machines, the more difficult this tends to become—and of course it’s not incidental that people who want to compel and control, or to be compelled and controlled, can do that easily enough without going to the trouble that’s involved in sustaining an I-Thou relationship in a world of machines. Carry this logic out to its natural endpoint and you get the total erasure of all human values that Jacques Ellul anatomized in <i>The Technological Society</i>, a system in which every relationship is forced into the Procrustean bed of mechanism because anything else would be inefficient.<br><br>Ellul assumed that this trend was inescapable, but then he was a man of his own time, and the first faint shockwaves of the end of the age of abundance apparently slipped past him unnoticed. Other social critics who commented on the same thing—Lewis Mumford and C.S. Lewis are among those I’ve mentioned in earlier posts—assumed, along the same lines, that only a sustained effort to oppose the rule of mechanism could halt the march of society toward a future of inhuman efficiency. What very few thinkers of their generation grasped was the extent to which the myth of the machine misstated the source of the power that machines had during the twentieth century. What made industrial society so powerful in their day wasn’t any particular strength or virtue in the cult of mechanism itself, or in the habits of thinking that an obsession with mechanism made popular for a time; it was simply that during a relatively brief window of historic time, the amount that could be done by machines powered by fossil fuels, and following the internal logic of machinery, was vastly greater than the amount that could be done by humans powered by human energy sources, and following their own internal logic.<br><br>That window of time is coming to an end around us right now, and the third sense in which an obsession with machines gets in the way of a useful response to the predicament of peak oil unfolds from that fact. Those people who are rushing around trying to find a mechanical answer to peak oil are jumping aboard a bandwagon when the horse pulling it has just fallen over dead. Lacking the cheap, abundant, highly concentrated energy that only fossil fuels can provide, complex machines are by and large much <i>less</i> efficient than human beings, and the obsession with machines is therefore a habit of thought that’s well past its pull date.<br><br>It’s hard to think of anything that flies in the face of contemporary attitudes more comprehensively than the suggestion that human beings are more efficient than machines under any circumstances at all. Still, if you consider the whole system upon which each of the two depends, the superiority of the human is easy to see. Behind the machine—almost any machine in the modern industrial world—stands a sprawling infrastructure that depends on constant inputs of energy: not just energy in general, either, but very large quantities of cheap, concentrated energy fitting precise specifications. That energy powers the machine, to be sure, but it also manufactures it, keeps spare parts in stock, and powers and supplies the huge networks that make it possible for the machine to do what it does. A laptop computer all by itself is an oddly shaped paperweight; to make it function at all, you have to add electricity, and thus the entire system that produces the electricity and keeps it flowing; to make it more than a toy, you need the internet, and thus a far more complex system, which among other things uses a vast amount of additional energy; and of course to produce the laptop, the electrical grid, and the internet in the first place, counting all the products and services needed by all the economic sectors that contribute to their manufacture and functioning, you need a fairly large proportion of the entire industrial economy of the modern world.<br><br>Human beings do not suffer from the same limitations. A human being all by herself is capable of meeting her essential operating needs in a pinch, using only the very diffuse energy sources and raw materials available in a natural environment; a few dozen human beings, given suitable knowledge and skills, can support themselves comfortably over the long term on a tribal-village level, using the same diffuse energy sources; a few thousand human beings subject to all these limits can create a civilization. In a world without vast amounts of cheap energy, human flexibility and creativity consistently beats mindless mechanical rigidity. That’s why, for example, the ancient Greek inventors who created the steam turbine and crafted highly efficient gearing systems didn’t launch the industrial revolution two thousand years early; the recognition that fossil fuels existed in enough quantity to power steam engines, drive gear trains and replace human labor with mechanical force was missing, and without that, Hero of Alexandria’s steam turbine and the Antikythera device’s clockwork mechanism could never be anything more than clever toys.<br><br>A society used to turning as much of its work as possible to machines faces a similar failure of understanding when the fuel for the machines runs short. The missing piece in the present case, though, is the extraordinary potential for productive and creative work that exists within human beings. Machines fill so potent a role in our emotional lives that most people in the modern industrial world shy away from the thought of doing much of anything without them. Even if we could count on a limitless supply of cheap energy, this would be an embarrassing dependency—a shiny high-tech crutch is still a crutch, after all. A limitless supply of cheap energy, though, is exactly what we can’t count on, and so what would otherwise be merely an embarrassment is shaping up to be a lethal liability.<br><br>Thus one of the greatest challenges ahead of us as the age of abundance ends is nothing less than the rediscovery of the possibilities of our own humanity. The work that needs to be done—and in an epoch of decline, there will be plenty of that—will have to be done with the capacities woven into the human body and mind, along with those additional capacities that can be developed in both by training and practice. The effort that nowadays gets poured into teaching people how to manipulate machines will need to be redirected into teaching them how to bring out the creative and productive capacities in themselves. That can’t be done effectively, please note, by trying to manipulate them like so many machines, or by teaching them to manipulate themselves in the same manner; I-It relationships do very poorly at directing human productive and creative powers. It will require instead the ability to understand human beings as human beings rather than inconveniently squishy bipedal machines, and the capacity to enter into I-Thou relationships, that has always defined good teachers and good leaders.<br><br>Less than a hundred years ago, the sort of awareness I’m suggesting here was a common response of people across the industrial world to the mechanization of everyday life, and less than forty years ago a revival of that same approach—the human potential movement of the Seventies—achieved a not inconsiderable success before it was stomped by the same backlash that flattened the industrial world’s last real attempt to turn aside from the mess it’s made for itself. The recognition that the potential within the individual human being is the industrial world’s most thoroughly wasted and neglected resource has surfaced at intervals straight through the history of industrialism, and been hurriedly swept back under the rug time and again. Go back to the origins of contemporary industrial society in the scientific revolution, in fact, and you can trace the same opposition in the tangled conflicts by which the first versions of modern science seized the cultural conversation of their time from the remnants of Renaissance humanism and set our civilization on the path to its current predicament.<br><br>There are immense issues involved in a recovery of the human, a refocusing of attention toward what human beings can do with their own innate possibilities and potentials for learning and away from the quest to replace as many human functions as possible by this season’s crop of computerized gimmickry. I’ve touched on a few of those issues in the sequence of posts on magic that appeared here in the last months of 2011, and plan on bringing up others here and there in the months to come. For now, what I hope to get across is the core idea that the most important resources we have left at this point, the most promising potentials for a response to the end of the age of cheap abundant energy, are not machines, or potential sources of fuel, or anything else outside the individual human being.<br><br>Even considering that thought, as I’ve suggested, flies in the face of deeply rooted prejudices. Point out, for example that a human mind with appropriate training can remember impressive amounts of data—there was once an entire system of mind training, the Art of Memory, designed to make this possible—and most people will come up with any number of reasons why some kind of remembering machine is a better idea. In a world with drastically limited supplies of concentrated energy and far too many urgent uses for those supplies, a system of training that can take care of the need to remember data without adding to the demand for electricity, spare parts, or the like is pretty clearly the better idea, but that recognition can only happen once people step outside the myth of the machine.<br><br>There are any number of other examples of things that human beings can do, or can learn to do, that will fill essential needs in a deindustrializing or fully deindustrialized world, when permanent shortages of concentrated energy suitable for powering machines makes the vast majority of today’s technology useless except as scrap. A significant number of them are still being practiced, or—like the Art of Memory—can be revived with relative ease from written sources dating from the Renaissance or, in some cases, more recently still. A great many more will need to be invented, or reinvented, in the years ahead. The supposedly serious thinkers of our time are unlikely to contribute anything to that task; in contemporary industrial civilization, as in every other human culture, the basic qualification that makes thinkers respectable is an unthinking acceptance of the basic myths of their era. Nowadays, the myth of progress is one of those basic myths, and the myth of the machine stands right beside it.<br><br>The myth of progress is coming to pieces around us as I write this. The myth of the machine will follow it in due time. In the interval before they dissolve and are replaced by narratives better suited to the needs and possibilities of the deindustrial age, there is a great deal that can be done to begin the rediscovery of the human, to preserve those teachings from the past that can fill critical needs in the future, and to sketch out the first rough drafts of new disciplines that will apply the creative and productive possibilities of the individual to the challenges ahead. How that might be done—well, I hope to talk about that, among other things, in posts to come.<br><br>*******************<br><span style=font-size:130%>End of the World of the Week #7</span><br><br>Picking the Antichrist has been a popular sport for close to twenty centuries now, since the Book of Revelation made its way into the assortment of sacred books that became today’s Bible and provided generations of believers with a set of potent metaphors for the experience of immanent evil. There have always been those who took the visionary narratives of John of Patmos as a symbolic description of eternal spiritual realities, to be sure, and there’s also a long and by no means implausible tradition of interpreting the Book of Revelation as a whole as a prophecy of the fall of the Roman Empire; still, a great many Christians over the centuries have taken the whole thing more or less literally as a factual description of events that would come to pass someday. To a significant minority of them, in turn, that "someday" was expected very soon.<br><br>Well before the tenth century, when Adso of Melk published the most popular medieval biography-in-advance of the Antichrist, a good many attempts to predict the End Times came to focus on the sinister figure of history’s ultimate bad guy, and that habit remained firmly in place as the centuries rolled past. During the American Revolution, for example, some wag figured out that the words "Royal Supremacy in Britain," when translated into Hebrew, added up to the dreaded number 666, while Tolstoy’s sprawling novel <i>War and Peace</i> includes a scene in which Pierre, one of the main characters, adds up the letters of "l’Empereur Napoleon" and gets the same inevitable sum. During the Second World War, with equal facility, British Christians announced with some enthusiam that if the letters in the alphabet are all given numbers starting with 101, so that A=101, B=102, and so on—well, try the name "Hitler" and see what sum you get.<br><br>Still, a little before this latter bit of ingenuity went into circulation, a great many people in the Western world were convinced that the Antichrist had clearly revealed himself at last: Benito Mussolini! As candidates go, at least in the years before the Second World War, he certainly looked impressive; his warmongering and his claim to rule a revived Roman Empire certainly helped, as did his status as Europe’s most colorful demagogue—it’s not often remembered these days that until 1940, when the Blitzkrieg abruptly tipped the scales, most people thought of Hitler as that funny little man in Germany who was trying to imitate Mussolini. There was accordingly quite a bit of prewar literature insisting that Mussolini, as the Antichrist, would shortly seize control of the world and usher in the Tribulation.<br><br>Somehow things didn’t work out that way. The funny little man in Germany turned out to be one of history’s most hideously talented megalomaniacs, while <i>il Duce</i>, for all his natty uniforms and blustering speeches, proved hopelessly incompetent at doing much of anything but posturing. Well before he met his end dangling from piano wire, those who had been loudly proclaiming his status as Antichrist apparent quietly pulped their books of prophecy and went looking for other candidates.<br><br>—story from <a href="http://www.vivaeditions.com/book_page.php?book_id=25">Apocalypse Not</a>

Yesterday, finding myself on a long drive through the Southern California and Arizona deserts, I was thinking about the idea that part of what we'll be doing over the next couple decades is shedding the use of machines in favor of the use of human beings. We'll be reestablishing humans as the basis of our experiences, rather than machines and high technology. This seems quite a good thing to me, even though it will undoubtedly create problems.<br><br>One way in which I was thinking about this is through a memory of a summer evening on the farm last year, sitting around a fire outside with a group of people, a few of which were playing instruments and singing. It was a highly enjoyable experience of music and was no doubt one of the most common experiences of music throughout human history. Today, however, I would imagine listening to one's ipod--at least in industrialized nations--is a far more common experience. And how degenerate an experience is that in comparison to hearing people sing and play instruments live, in a setting of conviviality?<br><br>I don't think it will be bad at all for us to lose the ipods and other electronic music players in favor of live music. And I know of few people who don't find that experience much more emotionally satisfying and evocative than the electronic reproduction of music.<br><br>As we've replaced humans with machines over time, so we'll walk back that process over the coming decades and centuries. I look forward to the more human results, as trying as the transition may be.<br><br>Joel<br><a href=http://www.ofthehands.com/ rel=nofollow>Of The Hands</a><br><br><a href=recovery-of-human.html#c510715841227744877 title="comment permalink">2/1/12, 11:10 PM</a><br><br>

It plays, and mostly in the same sense that JMG is intending to convey — that for the most part the State suffers from the same expectations as technology, and is burdened by the same projections. The Nanny State is not much more than the sum of all those (literal) machines we believe we need to maintain our cultural, social, and personal identity-myths (and their attendant life-styles). Even the Frank Herbert/Dune quotation works in this transformation; and the I-It relationship is inverted, since the all-consuming State (in a delicious and annoying irony) regards its citizens/consumers as machines to be controlled on the Procrustean rack.<br><br>What we can expect in the social level is for States to forget that there ever were human values, and sacrifice humanity for leverage (another mechanical metaphor) to maintain its myths and powers (for its owners).

In a number of places I have seen reported that ethanol from Brazilian sugar cane has a respectable EROEI around 7 to 8. What someone pointed out was that a large part of that is due to the fact that the sugar cane is cultivated completely by hand. If you used machines for that, the EROEI would be cut drastically.<br><br>I think the rule of thumb is that <i>whatever humans can do, they can do more efficiently (energy-wise) than a machine can do</i> by itself. Some things people simply can't do, like fly. Flying may not be necessary, but I did see an interesting story of a rancher who bought an ultralight plane. With it he could search a canyon for lost cattle in 30 minutes. Without it the search took half a dozen men half a day. (Of course, I wonder what they could accomplish with a trained falcon and a webcam.)<br><br>Coming back to the irony of this blog, the answer lies in the fact that humans can't communicate vast distances instantly (telepaths not included). We would have to be physically much closer to have a decent conversation. You still could write your blog as a print newsletter after the Internet goes down, but commenting back and forth would be limited.<br><br>By all means, we should develop human potential as much as possible, and humans should do as much as they can without machines.

The book is fascinating and very relevant to this blog. Turkle is a psychologist trained in psychotherapy who has been studying the machine and it's effect on the human psyche for the last 30 years. The book reaches back that far into her experiences studying these things. The first half looks at what robots do to our psyche and the second part looks at what the internet does. I'm half way through the book now. <br><br>What I find interesting is that she has essentially been studying the generation of humans who came up along side the robot. Robots, specifically social robots, like the Tamagochi and Furby and now more sophisticated robots like AIBO, PERO (A robot seal designed to "take care" of the elderly's emotional needs)and My Real Baby. This generation of children who came of age in the 90s, are more than willing to accept robots to do the social work of humans because they are efficient and unbiased. In many cases they find it easier and more comfortable to talk to a robot rather than a human. They are willing to fill in the inner life of the robot. <br><br>I can't help but think that these people have been sculpted by this machine society to be sort of deselected for the future. When the machine dies they will die having no idea what human life is about. Having no idea how to meet their human needs. I suppose the problems they present will take care of themselves in due course.<br><br><a href=recovery-of-human.html#c4916580074342225922 title="comment permalink">2/2/12, 1:37 AM</a><br><br>

When my great grandfather stowed away on a boat to the USA from potato-famine-ravaged Ireland, people had the skills and capacity to support their lives with their own labor and the resources at hand. As demonstration of this, the population of Ireland immediately prior to the famine approached eight million, and this was achieved with a simple, agragrian, locally-based mode of living. (The fatal flaw was becoming too dependent on the potato, a new-world crop that proved surprisingly well-suited to even chilly, boggy environments such as one finds in Ireland.) Ever since the famine, the population of that country has never been any higher than the current five million.<br><br>When you compare people in North America and Europe today to people of that previous era, you see that the moderns are as dependent on technological systems and the money economy as a newborn baby is on its parents.

These days I’m spending about half my time working manually in the home, and the other half working as a contractor on various IT projects in the healthcare industry. It is giving me good perspective on the amount of wasted effort that goes into playing around with machines. I’ve just finished the morning chores: feeding the chickens, fetching stove wood, spreading ashes and compost on the garden beds and generally getting ready for spring. No machines, all muscle. Relaxing for my mind (not much thinking required), good for my health and creative in various ways. Plus I’m hungry and deserving of breakfast, which is always good. What’s not to like? <br><br>Later I’ll head off into an office somewhere and try to nudge a computer project forward. I’ll sit in meetings, write documents, draw fantastic pictures on whiteboards and fiddle around with my phone. In about six months some sort of counting system will be produced and we’ll all move on to the next assignment. It’s supposed to be an efficient and progressive way to spend my time, but it feels hopelessly inefficient, conceptual and unproductive. The whole office is one big machine, and I feel a sort of captive in it. My main challenge is keeping a straight face and pretending to take it all seriously.<br><br>So give me manual work any day. This double life will need to continue, though, as long as we continue to need cash. But a large amount of the earned cash is then used to feed the machines that remain in our lives.

Indeed these were based on using machines as instruments of power, and organizing people as they were parts of machines. The error in those narratives is failing to understand that the power of resource limitations trumps that of machines, and of political systems. <br><br>Similarly there are many political writers and thinkers who I have a great respect for and who have brought to light many excellent insights, but rarely do they recognize resource limitations and the role they will play in providing hard limits to power. Ultimately this make their analysis rather one-sided and flawed. Further, I've noticed that some of that group is apparently becoming depressed and/or panicked at the state of affairs in our world today – without understanding resource limitations they wrongly assume we're entering the end game where the authoritarian “machine” will assume final permanent control, when the opposite is really happening. Instead it's the beginning of the end of it as the energy and materials required to support it fail.<br><br>Unfortunately, rather than this being a moment of glory, there are far too many humans than can be supported without the machines and energy that drives them, and with far too few skills in surviving without them.

Therefore, not nearly as many jobs would be created as we would hope, and those jobs would require advanced technical training. But hey, the machines will increase production and that is what keeps us all from being miserable subsistence farmers. So all will be well. Then, a most telling moment came when a listener called in saying he worked with metal as a blacksmith, and had more business than he could handle and maybe that was a good type of work/training for the future.

The machine world reciprocates man's love by expediting his wishes and desires, namely, in providing him with wealth"—then peak oil would be our hive collapse.<br><br>Your observation that resonates most for me from this post, however, is, “The more thoroughly an interaction between people is reshaped for machine processing, therefore, the more completely any potential for I-Thou relationship is filtered out of the interaction”. This is highlighted quite well by the medium you use to disseminate these thoughts, the Internet.<br><br>The Web can be a wonderful means of communication and distribution, depending on how it’s used. However, too many authors on the Web don’t write with a human audience in mind.

It is long. It is larded with metaphor and complex sentence structures. And its title would likely be mistaken by a search engine as being a story about the Costa Concordia wreck.

Still, I think it's more important just at this moment to notice the way that our technology flattens out our relationships to fit the I-It model, since so many people think of technology in such a wildly uncritical and sentimental way. <br><br>Jusbuc, nah, social anxiety can be found in eras where the sort of technologies we have now weren't even imagined yet.

Once that process begins in earnest, I'll be assessing the possibilities for a print newsletter or a column in a larger magazine, and yes, arrangements will be made to get it to overseas readers. As for myths -- well, myths are born, not made; what stories, right now, make most sense to you? <br><br>Thijs, pen and paper are a good deal less dysfunctional than their current high-tech equivalents, and require more human capacity to use -- as I'm sure you noted as you wrote your comment. The irony is that the Art of Memory is remarkably easy to use; a little daily practice, and it quickly becomes second nature. <br><br>Tuba, you can always smile and point out that a machine doesn't give milk, as goats do, or keep your body fit and healthy, as a nice couple of hours of work with a shovel surely will. I lift weights in the winter just to get the bursts of intensive exercise that gardening gives in spring and fall. <br><br>Brent, bingo. The entire social structure of industrial employment is defined by the I-It relationship, and predicated on reducing the employee to a machine. <br><br>Ando, it's always a good time to read Schumacher!<br><br>Gregorach, of course Hero's aeolipile wasn't a practical steam engine; the principles it demonstrates, though, could easily enough have been worked up into economically viable technologies given an interest in doing so. As for slavery, that existed in Britain and the US at the time of the industrial revolution; as I see it, it's because fossil fuels produce so much more of an energy return on investment than slaves do that the one triumphed over the other. <br><br>Mister R., exactly. I've been doing a lot of reading on the American Civil War in recent months -- given that the last time the US was so bitterly polarized was in the years right before Fort Sumter, it seemed like a useful thing to do -- and the physical resilience and the range of practical skills possessed by your average infantryman of either side make today's young men look remarkably weak and clueless. <br><br>Don, that's not a challenge I'd risk. Crows are mighty smart; I'd give even odds that their descendants will be the intelligent species that replaces us. (It's them or raccoons, take your pick.) <br><br>Jason, as I see it, spirituality isn't about "being yourself", especially when "yourself" usually consists of a mishmash of mental automatisms and assorted scrap picked up all anyhow from popular culture and stuck together at random into some semblance of a personality. Spirituality is a relationship, and thus -- like all relationships worth having -- hard work.

"These are the demonstrations of Los, &amp; the blows of my mighty hammer!" <br><br>Yupped, that's a good point and a fascinating one. Just how efficient is the industrial system these days, really? It occurs to me that its massive inefficiencies may have been covered over by immense wastage of energy. <br><br>Urban, my understanding is that Moore's Law is breaking down, and that Moore himself has said that it no longer applies. <br><br>Nick, an I-Thou relationship can still be unequal, even abusive, and an I-It relationship can be constructive. Feudalism is based on unequal I-Thou relationships; it's one of the blind spots of the contemporary left that it insists on mapping today's I-It human relationships back onto the past.

Remember that the cult of progress is a missionary religion, and the delusion of giving iPads to the global poor makes more sense -- it's exactly the same logic as giving Bibles to people who are starving to death. <br><br>Repent, there are dozens of good books on organic gardening; as a complete beginner, you might find Mel Bartholomew's <i>Square Foot Gardening</i> especially well suited to your needs. No need to wait for me to get around to a book on the subject!<br><br>Jason, yes, there's a lot of anger in young men these days, and -- at least to my mind -- a lot of forces driving it. I'll have to mull that one over. <br><br>Kieran, the art of memory uses the visual memory to break through the 7 +/- 2 barrier using a variety of simple coding systems. Still, of course there are tools that can be added to a trained mind to make a lot of practical tasks easier -- the slide rule comes to mind. <br><br>Robo, excellent. The point I'd make is that machines that fake an I-Thou relationship still have no inner lives of their own -- their appearance of an inner life is either projected by the user, or faked by the builders -- and so there's no "Thou" there. That's why they're so seductive -- you can make the imaginary "Thou" into whatever you want it to be. <br><br>Rich, yes, I've read it.

One way to simulate such an event is to implement regional rolling blackouts like the ones that occur daily in various countries around the world. Naturally, Joe Citizen will complain and protest, so the trick is to present it as a sort of beneficial inoculation -- a powerful vaccine that will build your "survivor skills" and better prepare you to meet the challenges of a post-carbon future.<br><br>Repeated blackouts of a few hours duration would help to get the populace thinking about energy conservation and self-sufficiency. However, the most instructive power outages would be those that lasted beyond the time your local supermarket shelves emptied and your local gas/diesel supplies ran out (2 or 3 days). When there's no electricity to run lights, appliances, and motors for your furnace &amp; water pump, and there's no more fuel for emergency generators, and no trucks are bringing food &amp; water and other necessities... what happens then?<br><br>I almost learned the answer to that question accidentally during the Northeast Blackout of August 2003, but luckily our village had its power restored on the third day. If lengthy rolling blackouts were implemented as part of government policy, bookstores would soon be awash with titles such as "How to Survive a Permanent Blackout!", and talk show hosts would be promoting them as something useful to read by candlelight on cold winter nights.<br><br><a href=recovery-of-human.html#c9121380110977965014 title="comment permalink">2/2/12, 6:30 PM</a><br><br>

The future fate of knowledge consigned to the digital age? Ouch!

Without the tools to repeat and understand scientific work, what passes as 'knowledge' will become even more the currency of convenience or dogma? It is still interesting though to examine counter-factual dogmas that propagate even now when we still have both the tools and knowledge to correct them. Is this the big myth being born? A version of 'Burn the Books' anticipated back in the better days of SF? Is privileged modern life so contradictory and intolerable that already it is spawning a counter revolutionary attack on the notion of sharable enquiry? Or, as I think you JMG suggest, this is a privileged but unequal society who that cannot look at what the numbers suggest is staring them in the face?

A tool is also a device which enables us to do certain kinds of jobs more easily. To remove a nail from a piece of wood, we can use a claw hammer. Scientifically, both tools and machines enable us to do work more easily so we could then say that a tool is also a machine.

This term shows the relationship between a load and the force applied.<br>...[see site for diagram here]. It is the practice that whenever we use a machine, the effort/force applied is usually less than the load.

How did people find their way around, especially in places they’d never been before? <br><br>Like most questions asked in our tech-dependent era, these underestimate the power of the human mind. It is surprisingly good at developing “mental maps” of an area, a skill new research shows can grow stronger with use. The question is, with disuse — say, by relying on a GPS device — can we lose the skill, too? <br><br>[snip]<br><br>If maps help us, what is the problem with GPS? A lot: in my opinion, it is likely that the more we rely on technology to find our way, the less we build up our cognitive maps. Unlike a city map, a GPS device normally provides bare-bones route information, without the spatial context of the whole area. We see the way from A to Z, but we don’t see the landmarks along the way. Developing a cognitive map from this reduced information is a bit like trying to get an entire musical piece from a few notes. <br><br>Our brains act economically: they try to decrease the amount of information to be stored (e.g., by relating new thoughts to already known content) and avoid storing unnecessary information. That may be the unconscious appeal of a GPS, but it means we’re not pushing our brains to work harder. <br><br>And a GPS device may even contradict your mental map by telling you to go left (e.g., for a faster highway) while your target is actually to the right. All of this leads us to use our mental maps even less.</i><br><br>Regarding Europe - no less a 'conventional' authority than Paul Krugman has made the exact same argument.

As for your decision, may you make the right choice, whatever that turns out to be.<br><br>John, that's fascinating! I'll have to read Bock. As for patience vs. passivity, the Latin verb <i>patior</i> means "to suffer" and also "to allow": for example, "suffer the little children to come unto me." The practice of patience requires a strong and well-disciplined will, which can choose to suffer and to allow for good reason, where passivity is the absence of will. <br><br>Leo, poverty is a relative term, and what counts for stark poverty in the US would be a decent standard of living in much of the global South. Read it as "you're going to be getting by on much less than you think you need." As for myths, the source I have in mind is within. <br><br>Phil, we need equivalents of those artisan clubs again, precisely to get past the inability of a privileged, unequal society to allow itself to notice what's staring it in the face. <br><br>Maria, that's quite true.

Remember that my actual ham radio experience dates from the 1970s, when I got my license as part of a Boy Scout club; while I went out and got relicensed again a couple of years ago, I'm still putting together the money (and the spare time!) to assemble a station and get back on the air, so a lot of my knowledge is theoretical only. <br><br>Dweller, I've always appreciated the version of Godel's theorem I found on a philosophy humor website a while back: "In every logical system there is at least one theorem that will be misunderstood by popularizers." ;-)<br><br>Glenn, thanks for the clarification!

I think you are already seeing this wherever its possible or necessary to get by without one. Given a set amount of income, the 20-30 somethings I see are choosing to trade-up in terms of food/booze and gadgets/web-devices, and down in terms of clothes, living situations, and autos. When you cut out a car and live 4 people to a one-bedroom apartment, even on close to min. wage there's still money for iPhones, boozing, and a bit of locavoring...at least in Portland. Not saying this lasts forever, just that the fallout may be lumpy and the distribution uneven among the masses.<br><br>@JMG on slavery: would you see the factory slavery in SE Asia and China as a representation of agricultural-type exporting? It seems humans are used more for those labor-intensive jobs machines can't do (even with artificially cheap energy); and that now takes the form of polishing iPad cases moreso than picking cotton. Some may even argue that being a slave in the 1800s is a better existence than what a factory-worker gets in India/China.

(JMG, he's been well explained by others - I'd add that he gets a good deal of greenwashing street-cred for single-handedly propping up the economy of New Orleans through a misguided but good-natured sense of social justice.) I saw a bit of it by chance and managed to catch the very, very obvious topic-swerve he did. The interviewer asked him a question about the Oscars or something, and instead of answering he did a very obvious "hey, we're gonna talk about the environment now" and launched into a three-minute diatribe on the stupidity of cars and the inanity of fossil fuel gobbling in general. It was one of the more heartening things I've seen from a celebrity in years.<br><br>@Leo - check out SM Stirling's book "Dies the Fire" for someone's very...interesting take on what happens to popular mythology/culture when the electronics stop working and Finnish sagas start to get conflated with The Lord of The Rings after a few generations of being recited side-by-side round the dinner fire. One of the bits of bookshelf I'd be most loath to part with is the several high-quality, bound-to-last collections of folk tales and myths from around the world. If you can find it, W.B. Yeats' "Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry" is one of my favorites in print, and the recordings of folk tales from around the world done by Jim Weiss are absolutely phenomenal - anyone who ever expects to read or tell a bedtime story should learn from his tale-weaving skills, he's truly gifted.<br><br>- Echo<br><a href=http://www.septembersvirtue.com rel=nofollow>September's Virtue: Realism for a World of Consequences</a><br><br><a href=recovery-of-human.html#c5301701249066519373 title="comment permalink">2/3/12, 11:19 AM</a><br><br>

There's an elm tree to the west that overhangs the patch, so it's in the shade before noon in the summer. The rhubarb comes up before the elm leafs out, so it gets close to full sun in the early spring when it's still cooler. I also make sure to keep them watered enough in the heat. The plants never look as good as they do up north, and some summers I've lost a plant or two in the heat, but they still are well worth growing here, if you like rhubarb. Last summer was one of the hottest on record, with one day getting to 112 degrees, but I didn't lose any rhubarb plants. <br><br>I don't know your location so can't say if it would work for you, but many plants that grow best in the full sun in cooler climates will do better with some afternoon shade in hotter ones.<br><br><br>I just wish that seed catalogs, nurseries, and such would pay even half as much attention to heat tolerance in plants as they do to cold tolerance. Heat stress manifests very differently than cold damage, but it's just as important to those of us dealing with hot summers. There is actually a heat zone map, http://www.ahs.org/pdfs/05_heat_map.pdf which like the winter hardiness zones is far from perfect, but it would at least be a start if it were used more. Especially with climate change happening, more of us will need to pay more attention to heat resistance. Even most of the "heat loving" garden plants lose vigor and have more problems in the kind of heat we had last summer.<br><br><a href=recovery-of-human.html#c7032820257022868899 title="comment permalink">2/3/12, 3:05 PM</a><br><br>

But that's the rub. With manually generated Morse code, we'd have minimal reliance on fragile technology: LCD screens, rotating disk memory, and so on. The transistor-based electronics of radio equipment should last "forever" (unless struck by lightning), especially if designed for survival (vs. size, weight, ease of operation, and cost). On the other hand, modern modulation modes can get a message across with much less transmitted power.

While we do indeed rely/depend on machines to do our work, the obvious drop in slavery (in the western world) with the rise of the machine is no coincidence. There will always be those who look to have others or machines do their bidding. It will be interesting as the machine begins to die off and the only energy source we are left with (humans) goes back to becoming a commodity. Though I can see the argument that the average worker who gets up early, leaves his or her family behind, goes to 'the job' and spends in excess of 40% of her time (65-80% of the awake hours) 'working for a paycheck' which is then spent on basic necessities has been doing this since the beginning of the IR. <br><br>One other comment I have often wondered, but been unable to formulate until now, who made and created the machines? Man (woman). Then how is it that we, who have created these as tools to help, feel that they are our savior and that humans are fallible? If we are fallible, then anything we create should be MORE fallible. I believe, after reading this blog for the past year, that religion and 'ism's' have done a wee bit of magic on us and forced us to believe this. As with the slave, it is their job to make the human feel less than human.

One of my favorite generals was Williams Carter Wickham. He was a member of the Virginia aristocracy and very much a member of the 1 percenters of his day. When the War of Northern Agression;)(I'm giving away my regional heritage here)began he joined the Virginia Cavalry and rose to the rank of Brigadier General (granted social status had a lot to do with attaining rank at that time.) He fought in almost every major campaign of the eastern theater and was wounded twice. One wound was a severe saber wound. You don't get wounded by an enemy sword if you are directing the battle from some hill top looking through binoculars. While the cause for which he was defending was not the just cause, he did have the conviction to defend it with his life. I find that highly respectable. I may have missed it but I don't recall seeing any news stories about the CEO of Shell Oil kicking in doors in Falluja in'04. It seems that the status quo of previous eras had a far greater sense of honor and duty than what we see today.

You farm vegetables in rows so that when you are walking up and down the paths adjacent to the rows you don't compact the soil. I find the denser, compost based soil in vegetable beds is far more prone to compaction than the more mulch based soil in the orchard.<br><br>Where it has gone really wrong in agriculture is when the rows are mono cultures (or close to) and people think this is normal. If for example, you were a cabbage moth and you just happened to fly down into a row of cabbages (or other brassica plants) then it would be party time. If that row had been a diverse poly culture then the moth would have had difficulties obtaining the same amount of food.<br><br>In addition to this, different plants have different requirements from the soil and a mono culture will quickly strip mine soil of that plants particular requirements. Think more in terms like a hedge row.<br><br>Hi Jennifer,<br><br>Good luck with your course. I hope they spend some time on soil as it is the single most important thing in organic agriculture, next to diversity of course.<br><br>Hi Ozark,<br><br>My two rhubarb plants died this year over the summer heat.

I think the morality-based campaigns were relevant -- and heroic -- and influenced the timetable; but I suspect that they would not have succeeded if the result had been a guaranteed decline in standard of living for the comfortable middle class. <br><br>Given a culture-wide energy shortfall, and a fairly large privileged class deeply attached to a lifestyle of excess and luxury, what could be more obvious than re-instituting slavery?<br><br>Now, call me paranoid/cynical, but are there not some straws in that wind blowing by us even now? the enactment and enforcement by neolib/neocon governments of ever-more-draconian laws criminalising more and more citizens (and depriving them of full citizenship); the relentless nibbling away at constitutional protections, habeas corpus, posse comitatus and the like... ever-expanding definitions of "terrorist" and "security" and "enemy of the state" -- are we really all that far from modest proposals to use the absurdly large population of prison labour as a substitute for expensive fossil fuel? [Already one lawmaker in California has proposed that prisoners be charged per diem for their "accommodations." The proposal failed, but it shows which way certain people's thoughts are heading.]<br><br>And will the moral outrage of the liberal class (the "conscience of society" as it likes to think of itself) be any more effective against the re-institutionalisation of slave labour than it has been against the stripmining of the biosphere, immiseration of peasants worldwide, ubiquitisation of toxicity, etc? If the deployment of slave labour in China doesn't dissuade people from buying iPads, would the deployment of slave labour w/in N America dissuade people from, say, driving on roads maintained by chain gangs? <br><br>We (most of us) don't mind buying veg and fruit that are tended and harvested by wage-slave labourers exposed to all kinds of nasty chemicals; would it trouble us (most of us) that much more if they were literal slaves? And suppose they were prisoners, wouldn't a lot of people feel better about it knowing that Those Bad People "deserved" to be punished anyway?<br><br>This seems to me the disturbing shadow side to the argument that the sunset of cheap fossil fuel means a return to realising the value of human energy and potential; we can "realise" that potential in the sense of becoming aware of, and able to use, the full range of our own skill, strength, and power -- or we can "realise" it in the market/commerce sense, as in arbitrage and exploitation based on the energy and potential of other human beings redirected to serve ourselves. <br><br>I do worry about this. I would be interested (and reassured) if someone could offer a convincing reason why history would not "rewind" as fossil energy gets more expensive, at the point where the EROEI of slaves starts to look 'better' to the beancounters than that of oil. Please, tell me that corvee labour, chain gangs, debt-slavery, debtors' prison, the workhouse, etc. are not in our future as other sources of energy get more and more expensive and our most abundant energy resource is humans. As I quipped (in Grook mode) during the runup to Iraq II<br><br><i>world oil reserves are running dry,<br>but of foolish young men we have ample supply;<br>therefore we conclude it is no great matter,<br>in securing the former, to squander the latter.</i><br><br><a href=recovery-of-human.html#c3861406091992320434 title="comment permalink">2/4/12, 12:11 PM</a><br><br>

My guess is that over that period, some kind of computer retailing will continue, at least at the junk-and-salvage level. <br><br>Taking some advice from Ontario nuclear-catastrophes-survivalist Bruce Beach (http://www.webpal.org/webpal/index.htm; <br>VE3UAL), I have checked out the computer mode PSK31. It turns out that Bruce gets a pretty clean 80-metres PSK31 signal into the ICOM 756-PRO II which we have at the University of Toronto, even though he uses a mere "Warbler" radiating something like 5 watts, and costing a mere one or two hundred dollars. <br><br>It would be interesting to see how the ever-so-easily-used PSK31 stacks up against packet ham radio, in which I have no experience. Perhaps packet will still work intercontinentally on, say, 30 metres or 20 metres, just as PSK31 does, provided one is patient? Packet, unlike PSK31, does incorporate sophisticated error-correction, with the receiver supposed to do something like send an "ACK" packet back to the transmitter. This may help overcome the corruption-miseries inherent in intercontinental shortwave. <br><br>Anyone wanting to experiment on PSK31, in which thanks to Bruce and others I now have some modest relevant experience, or on packet (for which I have access to hardware but lack experience), might want to contact me as <br>Toomas dot Karmo at gmail dot com. <br><br>Anyone needing to ponder ham radio generally could ask me via that same e-mail address for a copy of my general capabilities-and-plans ham-radio writeup (an essay of around 1500 or 2000 words, formatted in plain text, i.e., in "flat ASCII"). <br><br><br>Sincerely, <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo <br>www dot metascientia dot com <br><br>73 de VA3KMZ <br>(i.e., in CW: <br>dadadididit,didididadah; <br>dadidit,dit; <br>didididah,didah,didididadah,dadidah,dadah,dadadidit)<br><br><a href=recovery-of-human.html#c4693700513490126255 title="comment permalink">2/4/12, 3:12 PM</a><br><br>

The railway, like much other still-unavoidable machinery, is now tamed by technician guilds. <br><br>Guildpersons formally forswear competition. They formally forswear financial influence from outside capitalists, even as the old Debian GNU/Linux programmers forswore it back in the Year of Grace 2012. And they make it a point of honour to master, as far as in them lies, their science. <br><br>It is a dull February afternoon in 2184 when young Malcolm McTavish boards the Ocean Limited at Truro, Nova Scotia. <br><br>The Ocean Limited of 2184! - a solid four-carriage affair, pulled from the Halifax Ocean Terminal through Truro, Moncton, Campbellton, Miramichi, Riviere-du-Loup, and Charny to Montreal's ancient Gare Centrale in 36 hours, at speeds sometimes attaining 40 km/h, by Sterling engines harbouring hot blue biomass-evaporate jets. <br><br>The Ocean Limited of 2184! - a machine keeping no secret from its guild designers-owners-engineers, from those thirty free Nova Scotian men and women who calculated its specs with their own slide rules, who drew its every part with their own nibs. <br><br>Those Nova Scotian engineers had, admittedly, handed their formal shop drawings off to a cooperative of (similarly free) metallurgists near Boston. And those metallurgists had, admittedly, sailed their parts to a Halifax millwright-and-fitter guild under contract with a cooperative of (similarly free) Gloucester schoonermasters. <br><br>Malcolm, Truro's sole boarding passenger, is as serious as any young physicist. He aspires to membership in the newly formed Canada Guild of Radio. He cannot hope to build, or even to service, CW transceivers under guild supervision until he is certified in the Maxwell equations and in appropriate ancillary mathematics - in ODEs, in multivariate calculus up to Gauss-Green-Stokes, in tensor methods sufficient for 1905 Special Relativity.<br><br>Small wonder, then, that Malcolm's railway carpetbag is now well stuffed with papers for five days of McGill University examinations in downtown Montreal. <br><br>The strangest of the old Fossil Fuel Era machines was the university, operated as a business corporation, warehousing the young with useless programmes in things like "Media Studies". And - this was the greatest evil of all - the Fossil Fuel university destroyed the natural relation of affectionate trust, the relation meant from all Eternity to bind student and teacher, by perversely decreeing that students would be examined (would get "marked", like lumber) at the hands of the very people entrusted with teaching them. <br><br>Now, with the Fossil Fuel Era over, it is understood that, so far as undergraduate work is concerned, universities are mere undergraduate examining boards. <br><br>The real work of teaching has in Malcolm's case been done with a private mathematical coach in Truro and three laboratory-renting Halifax physics consultants. These specialists have staked a part of their joint pedagogical reputation on Malcolm's impending performance at the celebrated new McGill Radio Physics Examining-Certifying Board, and Malcolm has reason to believe his own preparations solid. <br><br>Now, finally, the Ocean Limited flexes all muscles. With Belmont, Debert, Londonderry Station now past, the tough little train opens its throttles, widens its hot-cold reservoir-temperatures gap, revs its generator armatures, strains its DC-motor shafts to their maximum safe torque, and charges the harsh ascending grade of Wentworth Mountain that divides Truro from Moncton. <br><br>Under the rail-gripping flanges that apply the final traction lies, now as always, Sir Stanford Fleming's 1872 Intercolonial railbed. <br><br>With the daylight fading, Malcolm knows himself at one with New Scotland's brooding slopes; at one with the throbbing transport machinery; at one with currents, potentials, and free-space radiating dipoles; at one with Reality.<br><br><a href=recovery-of-human.html#c8546227557970189681 title="comment permalink">2/4/12, 7:35 PM</a><br><br>

One of them is slavery, it raises it's head every couple of months.<br><br>Firstly, about slavery, it is alive and well and probably happening not too far from where you all live. We just happen to turn a blind eye to it. Think nail salons, brothels, fruit/vegetable picking, construction sites - and yes, I even read a couple of weeks ago that the powers that be in mining industry want to bring in labour from overseas on cheaper rates than the locals (I could be wrong on this). These were the same people opposing the mining super profit tax and who also toppled a Prime Minister (again, I could be wrong on this). Well done.<br><br>Secondly, slavery is really an extension of the myth of the machine. Someone, somewhere else can do the work and you won't have to worry about how it gets done.<br><br>Thirdly, slavery is not possible from an ecological perspective unless a society has unexploited reserves of top soil. Slave societies have generally arisen in areas that can support them. Presently, this is not the case as collectively our top soils are not in a good state of health and couldn't feed all of those mouths. <br><br>I really enjoyed George R R Martins most recent installment in his Ice and Fire series, but ecologically, he is way off the mark. It drove me bananas all those armies, all those slaves. How could you possibly feed them all? Still a ripping yarn.<br><br>Relax, stop worrying about being made a slave, as you'll probably starve first. Three weeks without food is probably about as much as you could take.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=recovery-of-human.html#c2030316781358423019 title="comment permalink">2/4/12, 8:06 PM</a><br><br>

What do people think about a project that would bring together historians of technology, craftspeople (but not just artsy ones, ones that make basic necessities--e.g. blacksmiths, barrel-wrights, glassmakers, framing carpenters, shoemakers, etc), engineers, priests/magicians (people who engineer cultural events that edify and enhance I-thou relationships) and system theorists, in order to plan a village technology and economy for food, water, clothes, shelter, healthcare. The constraints would be locality of energy and materials (hence no fossil fuels or electricity in most places), edifying work for all, and time for developing self and I-thou relationships. It would be OK to use fossil fuels and high tech in order to achieve this goal, but once achieved it must be sustainable without these. Some might say that this is not something that can be planned, that it has to evolve. Evolution can take a very long time though. <br><br>Think of this as a Manhattan project with the goal of preserving our species and all that is good about our civilization, instead of building an atom bomb. The motivation for the project is not just peak oil--it is to preserve our humanity also. <br><br>Some might not see the point because they think all you need to do is garden and have some energy conservation measures in your house. But gardening (and field farming and animal husbandry) require tools, and houses require tools and materials which currently are subsidized by petroleum and also encourage I-it relationships.<br>I wrote a rough draft proposal (and I hope to get funding for it) that I will post on my blog, and people could tell me if they would like to participate there. www.culturalspeciation.blogspot.com<br><br><a href=recovery-of-human.html#c624968705563969409 title="comment permalink">2/5/12, 9:26 AM</a><br><br>

However, this bit of reading I did last night pushed me to share. <br><br>Marie-Louis Von Franz, in her book, “C.G. Jung: His Myth in Our Time”, says that Arnold Toynbee (whom I haven’t read) described cultures along the same lines as Jung described individuation phases. I found her description of what he said amazingly appropriate for this discussion (whether it’s more her take or his take, I don’t know): “A majority of the cultures we know anything about today stand in the relation of a child to an earlier culture, in that the new culture successfully carries out or deals with a task or problem on which the earlier one came to grief…. The solution of the new problems is always first achieved by individuals and is then imitated by others. In this very fact lies the seed of the later downfall, because imitation always brings with it standardization and mechanization. An overvaluation of one’s own accomplishments and institutions begins to take place and this is accompanied by a mood of presumption or arrogance….In the stage of decline, division occurs, a cleave, as it were, in society and in the soul of the individual. Those in power are no longer creative and come to rely only on their power; the masses become an “inner proletariat”, that is a group of men and women who feel they have been denied their rightful place in society.<br><br>Her bio of Jung is drier than Barbara Hannah’s, but lots of good stuff in it. Anyway, thanks for the post and all the interesting comments!<br><br><a href=recovery-of-human.html#c5637540631351392070 title="comment permalink">2/5/12, 9:57 AM</a><br><br>

Just swap the right crystals around, retune, and the rig was now on 10. No new parts needed. The later synthesized ones with a synthesizer chip usually could be modified by changing some jumpers and re-tuning.<br><br>Packet on HF is one of those things that sounds great in principle, but actually works quite poorly in practice. First, packet does not have any error-correction, it has error detection only. I’ll explain more in my writeup on the different digital modes. Suffice it to say, that on any channel with less than wire-line clean signals and lack of interference, throughput almost always drops to near zero. Packet works excellently on VHF or UHF FM radios for that reason. PSK31 may not have any error correction but it will almost always beat HF packet by a wide margin, and you can always switch to the QPSK variant and the forward error-correction will more than make up for the slower transmission speed. Slower but more robust, where have we heard that before?<br><br>Once I get re-located in far northern CA later this year I’ll be back on HF. I’ll be on bands from 80 Meters through 10 Meters.

Historically speaking, it exists on any sort of scale only when there's a large export market that can be supplied by unskilled and unwilling labor -- the American south before the Civil War, with its cotton monoculture, and the Roman latifundia producing grain for export, are classic examples. (Ancient Greece was the same way -- the export crops there were wine and olive oil.) In the deindustrial age, once transport breaks down due to cost and safety issues, slavery won't support itself any more than it did in the last set of dark ages. A thousand years from now, as global trade picks up again, things may be different, but I don't propose to worry about that too much right at the moment. <br><br>Tom, thanks for the details! This is a conversation I'd like to see continued -- yes, the green wizards forum might be a good place for that. <br><br>Glenn, nicely put.

That's an interesting question that seem to have many different answers depending on who you ask. I did not plant the patch I have now, I inherited it and kept it going these past four years, but have no idea how old it is. However, I still remember the first rhubarb plants I started, when I was a child, in Minnesota, a pretty ideal climate for rhubarb. I started two plants from seed in pots indoors and transplanted them out to the small garden that I had, nothing added to the soil, just the lawn grasses that had been turned under. However, the soil was rich to start out. By that fall, the plants were as big as any of the neighbors' mature plants. The next spring, they were quite vigorous and I decided to harvest from them even though all the books said to wait st least another year, because the plants looked just like mature ones. The plants took it quite well and remained healthy. My personal opinion is that the overall size and vigor of the plants are more important indicators of when it's appropriate to start harvesting than age, some rhubarb plants in some conditions reach it a lot sooner than others.<br><br><a href=recovery-of-human.html#c5506119494616644688 title="comment permalink">2/5/12, 7:15 PM</a><br><br>

It reports that Sacramento is host to at least 10 server farms. The city is attractive to these enterprises because of proximity to the Bay Area, but with less threat from earthquakes, and cheap electricity. The article was primarily about the safeguards server farms use to prevent any interruption in their customers' services. These safeguards include diesel powered generators and banks of batteries. One of these farms was described as using as much electricity as a city of 40,000. The local AT&amp;T facility keeps 96 hours worth of fuel on site for their generators. The article did not mention how much power the AT&amp;T building used, but it is only one of many facilities in California alone. Since this part of California is not subject to hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms or other weather likely to cause power interruptions of more that four days AT&amp;T is probably safe in their fule stockpiling, at least for now.<br><br>I have been thinking about different definitions of poverty. I suppose the absolute extreme would be to not know from one day to the next whether one would have enough food to maintain strength and health. In other words, if you start each day needing to earn. or beg enough to buy that day's food, or procure it in some other fashion such as dumpster diving, hunting or gathering. Additionally, to not know where one would be sleeping at the end of the day. Adam Smith spoke of not having the "decencies" expected in one's culture. For an English peasant in his time those included shirt and shoes. For a Scottish peasant, he noted shoes were necessary decencies for men but not for women. He added that if one does not have these decencies others will assume that bad character has contributed to one's situation. There is obviously a lot of distance between these extremes and the normal middle class lifestlye in America.<br><br><a href=recovery-of-human.html#c5092503971501298835 title="comment permalink">2/5/12, 9:08 PM</a><br><br>

The American is dammed at Folsom Dam just east of Sacramento. (There is also a smaller dam located downstream from Folsom to help regulate stream flow.) I was told by a hydrogeologist that the discharge data used to determine the dam's specifications are not representative of the flows on the American, i.e., the dam is underbuilt.<br><br>There are various functions used to calculate the probability of a given flow occurring during a given year ("100-year flood"), but all of them need a representative, long-term set of discharge data to produce meaningful probabilities. In the American West, you can sometimes get discharge data dating back to the late 1800's if you’re lucky. As you can imagine, using non-representative discharge values as the basis for water infrastructure design can be problematic. (An extreme example: using stream discharge data collected during a protracted drought to design a dam.) Urbanization generally leads to increased runoff during storms, and when Folsom Dam was built in the late 1940s/early 1950s, the Sacramento area had not yet succumbed to extensive suburban sprawl. Folsom Dam and the levees around Sacramento are, however, being upgraded.<br><br>I've seen simulations prepared by an engineering firm showing what might happen if a levy were to break near the city, and it's not pretty. Many of the server farms are actually located in suburbs outside of Sacramento proper, so they're not in the highest-risk areas.<br><br><a href=recovery-of-human.html#c7903898139809649155 title="comment permalink">2/7/12, 12:00 AM</a><br><br>

'We' – AKA in this instance ‘science’ - do not have much knowledge of human evolution and only glimmerings about growing brains in different cultures. <br>Humans differ profoundly from other primates while retaining obvious continuities. Humans live longer, are born more infantile and have longer childhoods and exhibit less sexual dimorphism. Our behavior (not least from evidence from remnant original, or in some cases secondary, hunter gatherer bands) suggests a human default mating strategy technically described as "colonial monogamy"; - think certain birds with long-lived mating bonds but living in breeding colonies. A very rare strategy in mammals I am told. We are also apparently uniquely able to develop different ‘cultures’ that ‘culturally evolve’ (not necessarily voluntarily) a mix of both primate-type social hierarchy and a different non-hierarchical collective action. HG bands look as though they must work hard at diminishing potential for social dominance and hierarchy, aggressive sub-groups etc. and to cope with colonial monogamy in small bands of mixed relatives, non-relatives etc. Hard work being modern human, but until the last 10K years pretty successful during the first 100 - 200K years after we got our modern genetic inheritance! <br>Agricultural cultures seem to have a very strong propensity for, among other characteristics, generating aggressive sub-groups and large scale collective hierarchies. I have no predictions of what happens to future cultures urban post-industrial, whatever. Nate Hagens grew his brain in America and schools etc and made his way among aggressive/co-operative 'financial' subgroups dominated by billionaires. The boy has done well to take a different tack.<br><br><a href=recovery-of-human.html#c9182651642891019071 title="comment permalink">2/7/12, 2:29 AM</a><br><br>

Both of them depend on vast networks to keep working...humans on an ecosystem tenuous enough that we almost didn't make it through the last 500k years...and machines on an ecosystem of energy and human maintainers. Each has their strengths and weaknesses. A computer is greatly superior for numerical calculations needed for predicting the weather or the load bearing capacity of a building. A human is greatly superior in some of the ways you mentioned. Which one is more energy efficient depends on the task...a room full of human computers is much less energy efficient than a laptop for numerical calculations. It seems inevitable to me that machines will evolve with the constraints humans face. For example, I don't see any reason to expect that humans will forget how to make basic silicon microchips or solar panels to power them.
