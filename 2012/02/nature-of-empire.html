Niall Ferguson is arguably the most uneven of our living historians. His <i>The War of the World</i> is perhaps the best one-volume survey of the era of global war that began in a flurry of bullets at Sarajevo in 1914; his <i>The Ascent of Money</i>, by contrast, is little more than an exercise in cheerleading for the same misguided economic notions that are setting the stage right now for an explosion that may well rival the one that followed Sarajevo, and the same divergence can be traced straight through his work. Still, Ferguson’s writing makes an excellent starting place for any attempt to make sense of the phenomenon of empire—though this is something of a backhanded compliment, as his misses illuminate the subject at least as well as his hits.<br><br>It would be useful if the same thing were true of the other misunderstandings of empire that jostle one another in the collective conversation of our time. Regrettably, that’s anything but the case. In order to make sense of the impact that the fall of America’s empire is going to have on all our lives in the decades ahead, it’s crucial to understand what empires are, what makes them tick—and what makes them collapse. To do that, hovever, it’s going to be necessary to bundle up a mass of unhelpful assumptions and garbled history, and chuck them into the compost.<br><br>We can start with the verbal habit of using empire—or, more exactly, the capitalized abstraction Empire—as what S.I. Hayakawa used to call a snarl word: a content-free verbal noise that’s used to express feelings of hatred and loathing. The language of politics these days consists largely of snarl words. When people on the leftward end of the political spectrum say "fascist" or "Empire," for example, these words mean exactly what "socialist" or "liberal" mean to people on the right—that is, they express the emotional state of the speaker rather than anything relevant about the object under discussion. Behind this common habit is the most disturbing trend in contemporary political life, the replacement of ordinary disagreement with seething rage against a demonized Other on whom all the world’s problems can conveniently be blamed.<br><br>In too many cases this sort of thinking is taken to frightening extremes. Consider David Korten’s <i>The Great Turning: From Empire to Earth Community</i>, which manages to be both one of the most popular works in the anti-Empire canon and one of the most profoundly antidemocratic tracts in recent memory. Korten’s argument is based on the theory that certain people—quite explicitly, those who share his background and opinions—belong to a higher "developmental stage" than anyone else, and the world’s problems can only be solved if power is taken away from those who have it now and given to the gifted few. If you want thoughtful analysis of the ideas and motivations of the supposedly less evolved people who hold power nowadays, don’t look for it in Korten’s book; what you’ll find instead is an unusually crude version of the standard left-wing caricature of right-wing thinking.<br><br>Empire, in Korten’s book, amounts to the whole of the existing order of society, portrayed in the shrill language of apocalyptic rhetoric—unless the gifted few who have "spiritual consciousness" get the power they ought to have, one gathers, all life on Earth is doomed. It’s interesting to note, though, that exactly how the utopian state of Earth Community will deal with the flurry of planetary crises luridly depicted in the first part of <i>The Great Turning</i> is nowhere detailed. The reader who is able to step back and cast a cold eye on the book’s argument may thus be forgiven for thinking that Earth Community is simply Empire with the ruling class Korten prefers, just as the "emerging values consensus" that guides Earth Community can be hard to distinguish from the ideologies that guide Empire, and so on down the list of inevitable parallels.<br><br>The need to sidestep this sort of manipulative rhetoric, it seems to me, makes it urgent to get past the habit of using terms like "empire" as snarl words, and recover their actual meaning as descriptions of specific forms of human political, economic, and social interaction. Getting rid of that initial capital letter, arbitrary as it seems, is one step in the right direction. Just as the younger Bush administration was able to disguise a flurry of dubious motives and justify a misguided rush to war by converting the tangled reality of Muslim resentment and radical militancy into the capitalized abstraction of Terror, too many people on the other side of the political spectrum have covered equally dubious motives and justified a range of unproductive actions by converting the tangled realities of influence, authority, and privilege in modern industrial states into the capitalized abstraction of Empire. The so-called Global War on Terror, of course, turned out to be an expensive flop, and much of what passes for "fighting Empire," though a good deal less costly in blood and money, has not been much more successful.<br><br>This post and the ones that follow it, then, will be discussing empire, not Empire, and as soon as we get past some initial questions of definition, they will be discussing specific empires—the one the United States currently maintains, primarily, but also the British empire that preceded it, and a variety of others that cast useful light on its past, its present, and its future. One striking detail, of course, sets today’s American empire apart from most of its predecessors, and that is the curious fact that very few people will publicly admit that America has an empire at all.<br><br>This is where Niall Ferguson enters the picture, because he’s one of the notable exceptions. In several books and a flurry of essays, Ferguson has argued that the United States fills exactly the same role in international affairs today that Britain held a century ago, and since nobody then or now finds it especially problematic to talk about the British empire, open discussion of the American empire ought to be an equally straightforward matter. He makes a very solid case that the United States is an imperial power. What makes this all the more interesting is that while most people who talk about American empire these days mean the label as a criticism, Ferguson does not. Quite the contrary, he thinks America’s empire is a good thing, and has publicly urged American politicians to take their imperial role more seriously—in other words, to get out there and lord it over the world in earnest.<br><br>Some of what’s behind this quixotic rhetoric is doubtless the spluttering indignation it evokes from liberal pundits—Ferguson has admitted that one of the motives that got him involved in conservative politics in his student days was the fun to be had by baiting the left—but there’s more to his argument than that. He points out that periods when one imperial power dominates any given system of nations tend to be periods of relative peace and stability, while periods that lack such a centralized power tend to be racked by wars and turmoil. It’s a valid point—imperial Britain’s century of world dominion from 1815 to 1914 featured fewer wars in Europe, at least, than any comparable period up to that time, and American dominion since 1945 has imposed even more rigid a peace on that fractious continent—and Ferguson goes on to claim, on the basis of that undoubted fact, that imperial rule is a good thing for everyone involved, ruled as well as rulers.<br><br>That last step, though, goes well past what the evidence will support, and a good hard look at the claim will prove revealing. Partly, this shows Ferguson’s tendency—which is of course shared by many of his peers in Britain and the rest of Europe—toward an unthinking Eurocentrism. While Europe was relatively calm between Waterloo and Sarajevo, there were very few years in that interval where the British army wasn’t busy fighting someone somewhere in the world, and the smaller colonial empires other European states acquired by Britain’s permission during those same years were in many cases just as racked with wars. Still, there’s another point that’s even more crucial, which is that peace, stability, and the Victorian British idea of good government for the natives are not necessarily the only goods worth weighing in the balance. By this I don’t mean to bring up such intangibles as freedom and self-determination, though of course they also have a place in any meaningful moral calculus; the issue I have in mind is one of cold hard economics.<br><br>A broader view of history may be useful here. The first explorers to venture outwards from Europe into the wider world encountered civilizations that were far wealthier than anything they had known. After returning to Italy from the Far East in 1295, Marco Polo was mocked as "Marco Millions" for an account of China’s vast riches that later travelers found to be largely accurate. When the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama made the first European voyage around Africa to India in 1497, he and his crew were stunned by the extraordinary prosperity of the Indian society they encountered. When Hernán Cortes reached the Aztec capitol of Tenochtitlán in 1519, it was easily among the most populous cities on the planet—current estimates range from 200,000 ato 300,000 within the city alone, and another million in the urban region surrounding it—as well as one of the richest. A few centuries later, at the zenith of Europe’s age of empire, China, India, and Mexico ranked among the world’s poorest nations, while England, which had been a soggy backwater on the fringes of Europe mostly known for codfish and wool, was one of its richest.<br><br>Plenty of reasons have been advanced for this astonishing reversal, but there are times when the obvious explanation is also the correct one, and this is among them. The point can be made even more clearly by noting a detail I’ve brought up here before—the curious fact that the 5% of humanity that live in the United States of America, until quite recently, used around a quarter of the world’s energy and around a third of its raw materials and industrial product. This remarkably disproportionate share of the world’s wealth didn’t come to us because the rest of the world didn’t want such things, or because the United States manufactured some good or provided some service so desirable to the rest of the world that other nations vied with each other to buy it from us. Quite the contrary; we produced very little in America during much of our empire’s most prosperous period, and the rest of the world’s population is by and large just as interested in energy, raw materials, and industrial product as we are.<br><br>It’s considered distinctly impolite to suggest that the real reason behind the disparity is related to the fact that the United States has over 500 military bases on other nations’ territory, and spends on its armed forces every year roughly the same amount as the military budgets of every other nation on Earth put together. Here again, though, the obvious explanation is the correct one. Between 1945 and 2008, the United States was the world’s dominant imperial power, filling the same role in the global political system that Britain filled during its own age of empire, and while that imperial arrangement had plenty of benefits, by and large, they flowed in one direction only.<br><br>With this in mind, we can move to a meaningful definition of empire. An empire is an arrangement among nations, backed and usually imposed by military force, that extracts wealth from a periphery of subject nations and concentrates it in the imperial core. Put more simply, an empire is a wealth pump, a device to enrich one nation at the expense of others. The mechanism of the pump varies from empire to empire and from age to age; the straightforward exaction of tribute that did the job for ancient Egypt, and had another vogue in the time of imperial Spain, has been replaced in most of the more recent empires by somewhat less blatant though equally effective systems of unbalanced exchange. While the mechanism varies, though, the underlying principle does not.<br><br>None of this would have raised any eyebrows at all in a discussion of the mechanics of empire, in America or elsewhere, during the late nineteenth century. Such discussions took place, in the mass media of the time as well as in the corridors of power, and it was widely understood that the point to having an empire was precisely that it made your nation rich. That’s why the United States, after a series of bitter public debates we’ll be discussing a little further on in this series of posts, committed itself to the path of empire in the 1890s, and it’s why every nation in western Europe either had or desperately wanted an overseas empire—even Belgium, for heaven’s sake, had its own little vest pocket empire in Africa, and exploited it ruthlessly.<br><br>The near-total domination of the world by European empires in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, in conjunction with the popular racism of the time—Kipling’s pompous blather about "the white man’s burden" was embarrassingly typical for its era—has given rise in some circles to the notion that there’s something uniquely European or, more precisely, uniquely white about empire. In reality, of course, the peoples of Europe and the European diaspora were by and large Johnny-come-latelies to the business of empire. Ancient Egypt, as already mentioned, was as creative in this as in so many other of the arts of civilization, and had a thriving empire that extended far south along the Nile and north along the Mediterranean coast.<br><br>The great arc of city-states that extended from modern Turkey through the Tigris and Euphrates valleys and the mountains and plateaus further east to the Indus Valley gave rise to dozens of empires at a time when Europe was a patchwork of illiterate tribal societies that still thought bronze was high tech. China had its own ancient and highly successful empire, and half a dozen other east Asian nations copied the Chinese model and pursued their own dreams of imperial expansion and enrichment. Sub-Saharan Africa had at least a dozen great empires, while the Aztecs were only the latest in a long history of Native American empires as splendid and predatory as anything the Old World had to offer. Empire is one of the most common patterns by which nations to relate to one another, and it seems to emerge spontaneously whenever one nation has a sufficient preponderance of power to exploit another. Its emergence sets certain patterns and processes pretty reliably into motion; we’ll be discussing those during the weeks to come.<br><br>*************<br><br>In other news, I'm delighted to report that my new book <i>The Blood of the Earth: An Essay on Magic and Peak Oil</i> is now available for preorder from Scarlet Imprint, in two limited editions. (The paperback and e-book editions will be available for preorder a bit later.) Everything's on track for a release at the upcoming Spring Equinox.

He was born somewhere around 1135 in the Italian province of Calabria, worked for the government of the Kingdom of Sicily for a while, then got religion in 1174 and entered the Benedictine order—yes, that’s the twelfth-century equivalent of leaving your corporate job and ending up in a New Age ashram in Sedona. In 1184, while on his way to Rome on monastery business, he stopped at an abbey in Casamari, and that’s where he suddenly metamorphosed from common or garden variety mystic seeker to full-blown medieval guru.<br><br>While he was at Casamari, to be precise, he had a series of visions that revealed to him the secret meaning of the Book of Revelations and the entire shape of the world’s history. The short form was that all of time was divided into three parts, which related to the three persons of the Christian trinity. The Age of the Father ran from the creation of the world to the advent of Jesus, and was the age of law; the Age of the Son ran from there to the downfall of Antichrist, which either Joachim or his students—nobody’s quite sure which—expected in the year 1260, and was the age of grace; the final Age of the Holy Spirit, the blissful age of love and liberty, ran from then on until the end of the world. Thus the various cataclysms of the Book of Revelations, in Joachim’s thought, were simply rough patches on the road to paradise on earth.<br><br>Joachim’s good news proved to be highly popular, and made him internationally famous. When King Richard the Lionheart was on his way to the Third Crusade, he made time to stop by Joachim’s monastery and ask for a prophecy about the upcoming war with the Saracens; Joachim obligingly did the necessary calculations, and told the king that the Crusade would be a huge success and Jerusalem would be recaptured by the Christians; he was wrong, but that did nothing to dent his reputation. He went to his death in 1202 serenely convinced that the wonderful Age of the Holy Spirit was going to arrive on schedule in not much over half a century. Instead, his views were condemned as heretical by the fourth Lateran Council in 1215, and when 1260 rolled around, nothing out of the ordinary happened at all.<br><br>—story from <a href="http://www.vivaeditions.com/book_page.php?book_id=25">Apocalypse Not</a>

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c5940662127857113739></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11830861494420303864 rel=nofollow>DeAnander</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I was waiting eagerly for Weds evening :-) and it's a nice kick-off to the proposed series. One reference that occurred to me as I read the ArchD's comments on the durable "empire as peacekeeper" trope was Byron Farwell's little book, "Queen Victoria's Little Wars," which documented the sheer number and variety of minor military actions carried out by British troops in the peripheral zones of the British Empire during the Queen Empress' reign... anyway, interesting reading if you like that period, and a good antidote to that popular trope.<br><br>I think there's also historical support for the suggestion that peace and quiet can prevail even in an absence of draconian centralised power: Ascherson's 'Black Sea' iirc documents a period of multicultural tolerance, diversity, and prosperity in a constellation of mid-size communities on the shores of the Black Sea. Alas it was not a lengthy period in historical terms -- a mere couple of centuries or so and a minor portion of the story he's telling -- but it must have been rather nice if you were born at the right time. The rest of his story is more conventionally filled with hostilities, skirmishes, and outright wars (sigh).<br><br>The other thing that strikes me (rather depressingly) is that empire might be a human pattern -- something like the concentric patterns of lichen growing on rocks, or the pattern of tree rings. Suppose that you have 4 human cultures sharing borders (map theorem stuff). If one of them is more populous or stronger or more aggressive than the neighbours, then it would tend to expand and absorb their resources and become even larger and stronger... a kind of Gresham's Law of politics, in which "bad" (aggressive, warlike) cultures drive out "good" (peaceful, good-natured) ones. However, its growth would eventually be limited by its ability to manage the complexity (Tainter) and/or the limits on biotic productivity in the region it's trying to metastasize into (Diamond, Ponting, CoR, et al).<br><br>Through this biological/pattern/systems lens, empire would be inevitable in any areas where biotic productivity was such as to permit the accumulation of surplus. So (as in fact we find) there isn't much empire in resource-poor environments (like the Kalahari, or the outback of Australia); places like that tend more to tribal bands who, while they may not be cute little Ewoks ('cos no one is), are not forming regimented armies and enslaving their neighbours for fun and profit... continuing this dismal line of thought, the pattern of human culture would be to occupy rich biomes, develop empires, loot the local biosphere until we hit complexity or resource limits, crash, rinse, repeat; if we strip the biome badly enough to make it into a desert (N Africa, etc) then the pattern is over and some more sparse, less regimented and complex culture is the new pattern. Any takers? I don't like this theory because it seems so darned deterministic, as if we had no moral agency at all; but when you look at our history, moral agency does seem to be hard to detect...<br><br><a href=#c5940662127857113739 title="comment permalink">2/15/12, 9:54 PM</a><br><br>

I was wondering two things:<br><br>First, was there a 19th century analog to the Soviet Empire, and, if not (I can't think of one), how can the US position post-WWII really be analogous to the British?<br><br>Second, are you familiar with Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's book and concept of Empire (capital E intended)? I'm not writing as a partisan, but I think this idea has quite a bit of currency on the left. The idea is that the present global political-economic configuration consists of a whole mess of globe-hopping centers of power, with imperialism ("empire," as you define it) largely a thing of the past that enjoyed a recent, failed revival under the Bush crowd. <br><br>I think there's something to this idea. But I wonder how it relates to your concept of empire and the project you've outlined for this blog.<br><br><a href=#c415639828113169457 title="comment permalink">2/15/12, 11:00 PM</a><br><br>

I occasionally come across diatribes (snarls?) condemning corporations using the same language that people use to condemn the concept of empire. The East India company was a massive funnel of wealth back to Europe for a couple of centuries.<br><br>You’re probably not aware (and why would you be?) but my favourite news source has recently undergone a majority shareholder purchase by Australia’s (and one of the world’s) richest persons. Well done.<br><br>So, here am I sitting up in the forest on a hot afternoon, after a mornings hard work with a couple of hours to spare and wondering about the general merits of editorial integrity! It was quite auspicious that the question came up last week about what news services you yourself perused.<br> <br>I usually only have time for a few websites, but to cut a long story short, I had a look at The Oil Drum and was most impressed. There are some bright people writing there. <br><br>However, I can see that they’ve fallen into a trap. They’ve raised the alarm, but there is little consensus on a way forward and therein lies the trap. They are also clamouring for someone, somewhere else to enact their bold visions. <br><br>In general, it comes across as if the information presented is all theoretical posturing. Harsh? Maybe? I’m a practical kind of guy and thoughts do not translate into actions.<br><br>Now, I don’t expect you to comment on the above for obvious reasons which don’t need to be spelt out.<br><br>But, given that so much of our society has a magical basis, I can see why people think the way they do over there at The Oil Drum.<br><br>On a different issue, I came across a natty quote recently I wanted to share: When you get in the mud with pigs, you get dirty and the pigs get happy. As part of that thought, I have been trialling your nonlinear thought / action process and have found that the do nothing approach has been very effective. I now have a new thought / action guide which is, if in doubt, do nothing. Very powerful stuff.<br><br>The same person who provided the quote also stated that people offering help were viewed in general with suspicion and perhaps even a little envy. This had never occurred to me as I’ve always offered help genuinely. The strange thing is, that it is rarely taken up and I’ve been given to wondering about why this may be. If people offer me help, I’m quickly organising times and dates. This thought has been on top of my strange experiences in the past couple of years with volunteering, where I deduced that people do not respect work that they get for free, so I have decided to no longer offer help to anyone.<br><br>What I can also deduce out of my experiences and learning is that social currency has no value and until it does I’ll look after my own affairs which entails getting my own house in order (which it mostly is). If in doubt, do nothing.<br><br>PS: I look forward to obtaining a copy of your new book.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c4026686838160210677 title="comment permalink">2/15/12, 11:02 PM</a><br><br>

I think I may have worked out how the US empire funnels wealth back into the US. I'd been thinking about this for a while and picking up a bit of information here and there and then suddenly the light switched on.<br><br>Most forward exchange hedges and international purchasing contracts (including long term supply contracts) are conducted in US dollars. This is a constant right across the world (there are some minor exceptions).<br><br>When your federal reserve prints money and injects it yours and the worlds economy, it is creating monetary wealth because the rest of the world is forced to buy US dollars and thus slowing the rate of devaluation of the US currency that would otherwise be occurring under any other circumstance. It's genius really, but risky as you'd think at some point there may be a tipping point when countries, individuals and corporations no longer decide to swap physical goods and energy for what is essentially paper. This is where your military steps in.<br><br>It wasn't discussed widely but Saddam Hussein had for a while been using the Euro (instead of US dollars) in Iraqs oil sales and I have often wondered whether if his government had not done so whether things would have turned out differently for him?<br><br>All speculation really, but still fascinating stuff.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c5554739184020321119 title="comment permalink">2/15/12, 11:26 PM</a><br><br>

The idea of human societies as primitive organisms (like yeast, or lichen rings, or bacteria) is scary, yet it rings true somehow. It rather contradicts our fundamental notions about scale -- we ourselves are complex beings with language, tools, culture, memory, agency, moral qualms etc, but we are made up of countless less complicated organisms like cells (with mitochondria living in 'em), bacteria, etc. Or, to take another tack, the behaviour of a bee or ant colony is "intelligent", yet each individual ant or bee doesn't seem to have much brain.<br><br>So I tend to think of large agglomerations of less complex organisms as the definition of more complex organisms. But what if... what if... colonies of humans are less complex in their behaviour, more deterministic, less intelligent, than individual humans? what if we each have more brain than all of us? What if we get stupider as we pass Dunbar's Number? We have traditional jokes about the intelligence of a crowd being inversely proportional to its size and so on. What if they're nearly true? Argh. <br><br>And yet it could be argued that the inside of the "civilisation" colony with its resource-rich "core" environment permits the development of ever-more complex and sophisticated behaviours (art, literature, drama, music, fashion, laws, finance, religious pomp, conspicuous consumerism) for individuals? this is often cited as a justification for urbanisation and even for empire.<br><br>Is "complex and sophisticated" the same thing as intelligent?<br><br><a href=#c7025828397178751960 title="comment permalink">2/16/12, 12:11 AM</a><br><br>

See how situations in faraway countries that could have erupted into total war throughout a region, like the Palestinian intifada or the Taiwan dispute, were instead cooled down by the presence of American power!

It's kind of bizarre that what should be a matter-of-fact obvious reality is instead a point of contention. We have an empire. I suppose it just doesn't fit with the myths we tell ourselves about who we are. <br><br>I've been using the term western industrial empire, because it seems that with fossil fuel driven high speed transportation and communications the core of the empire is tied less to a nation-state and more to a class of people. Or at least the movers and shakers identify more with their class than their nation. Perhaps it's more of a descendent-from-white-European empire. Canada, Western Europe and Australia are in, Mexico, South America, Asia and Africa are out. But I suppose this has parallels in the Roman empire and others, and I expect that as the availability of fossil fuel energy decreases people will begin to emphasize their regional identity again.<br><br>Anyway, by refusing to see the reality of the empire and what its purpose is, people leave themselves open to misunderstanding what is driving the use of military force around the world, why we are where we are and what is likely to happen next. They believe instead that touchstone singular events (such as 9/11) shape our actions, rather than these actions being the typical machinations of an empire trying to keep itself going (and past the point on negative marginal returns).<br><br><a href=#c3816291459860261879 title="comment permalink">2/16/12, 6:34 AM</a><br><br>

He outlines the surprising fact that violence has declined for the past 800 years, which is a result of Enlightenment Humanism. In the process he shows how Hume was right, the concept of the ‘noble savage’ is wrong, and rehabilitates the Civilizing Process that trade has (made possible and expressed by empire). Not done with it, but it’s certainly challenged my automatic assumptions of the evils of empire. He’s been described as Chomsky’s heir, and is clearly no establishment apologist.

It took the rise of Germany to force England and France into an uneasy alliance in the first years of the 20th century. As for Hardt and Negri, I haven't read their book so can't comment meaningfully. <br><br>Cherokee, corporations are part of the structure of 21st century empire just as they were essential to the 19th century equivalent. As for the mechanisms of the current wealth pump, yes, the hegemony of the dollar is part of that, though only part -- there's been a lot of ingenuity put into working out ways to extract wealth from subject nations over the years. <br><br>Robo, not a bad metaphor. <br><br>Girl, we'll be talking about all those points in quite some length over the months ahead. The decline of British empire was made a lot less brutal than it might have been by the deal Britain cut with the rising power of the US, and a similar deal might be in America's future -- but it's not likely. <br><br>DeAnander, again, it's mostly the behaviors of individuals that become complex and sophisticated. Human societies as meta-organisms remain very primitive in their relations to one another and their environment, possibly because they haven't been around for that long in evolutionary terms. <br><br>Surfer, excellent! Yes, that's one of the foundations of democratic society -- the recognition that since nobody has privileged access to absolute truth, tolerance and diversity are the best policies. I wish more people read Locke. I'll be talking about that at quite a bit of length down the road a bit. <br><br>Avery, sure, but the flip side of the equation is that outside the imperial core, the peace of empire comes with poverty and repression, and within the core, empire is a self-terminating phenomenon with a nasty hangover. We'll get into that further on. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, Barbara Tuchman's <i>The Proud Tower</i> is a useful introduction to the world just before the First World War, and Adam Hochschild's harrowing <i>King Leopold's Ghost</i>, on the Belgian empire in the Congo, is well worth reading as a sample of European imperial praxis. Beyond that -- well, I'm waiting for a bunch of library reserve requests to come in; I'll be in a position to offer a more detailed reading list once I've had a chance to survey the results. <br><br>Mustard, funny. I notice, though, that they weren't singing about the Belgian slave labor camps in the Congo, where the natives who didn't meet their daily quotas had their hands cut off. Just sayin'. <br><br>Damien, exactly. In the US, most soldiers come from the poorer classes of all colors, and they've been fighting somewhere in the world most of the time since 1945, so it's much the same thing.<br><br><a href=#c3973211281000770849 title="comment permalink">2/16/12, 9:53 AM</a><br><br>

John Gray, in Two Faces of Liberalism, makes a good case that Locke's sort of liberalism is blinkered by its presumption that there is an absolute truth in the first place for us to disagree about. Toleration, on this model, is a matter partly of forgiving each other's ignorance of the truth, and partly of enabling a 'marketplace of ideas' in which the play of reasonable disagreement will help us arrive at the truth or a better picture of it.<br><br>This latter is the trouble. Gray's point is that it's a dangerous business to operate with the idea that there's any truth we can ever arrive at. In extremis the notion provides constant temptation to Jacobins of one stripe or another. But even in more temperate hands, a toleration of varied means doesn't make the spectre of a common social end go away, and that spectre is what produces apocalyptic political faiths like Leninism or the free market. <br><br>What Gray proposes we emphasise instead owes more to Hobbes than to Locke: liberal tolerance as a modus vivendi, a minimal way of compromise among many overlapping institutions and lifeways that aims to maintain peace without hoping to improve the general state.<br><br><a href=#c5986857060943783350 title="comment permalink">2/16/12, 10:31 AM</a><br><br>

Probably hierarchy, a leisure class, warrior aesthetic, etc. arise from surplus, but maybe empire arises from the end of surplus: Our Gang had a cushy lifestyle and did a bit of raiding and reiving, but now we've kind of wrecked our topsoil and raised our numbers and cut down our trees -- and rather than see our lifestyle decline, we'll just go next door &amp; take someone else's food (and labour) and so on.<br><br>I'm thinking about the raider cultures -- like the Haida, the Kwakiutl, the Vikings, quite a few others, who were warlike as all git-out, hierarchical, status-oriented, complex, luxurious by local standards, violent, took slaves, stole stuff -- but never really went in for the whole annexing and administrating thang. They stuck to their home ground. Their periphery was fairly close to home and they "harvested" it in brief bursts, not continuous exploitation as in "real" empire (Rome, et al)... but maybe, if the Haida, say, had been left alone by whiteboy for a bit longer, their numbers might have increased to the point where they were driven to colonise, settle, extract.... Still thinking about the whole lichen-patch model...<br><br>It's always interesting to see the US doing stuff that "looks so Roman" -- like the wonderful recent trick of offering posthumous citizenship benefits to immigrant guys who die in combat (you may fall, comrade, but your wife and kids will get US citizenship!). So similar to the old Roman game of offering the legionaries a way out of slavery, or a bit of land in the provinces (land ownership equalled full citizenship in those days). What it makes me think -- as I also think when some nastiness somewhere reminds everyone of the Nazi regime -- is not so much "wow, they're acting like Rome," as "maybe all empires behave in certain predictable ways at certain junctures in their expansion/decline." Maybe the script is pretty standardised. If it is, then surveying historical examples really would have predictive power.<br><br>Why does everyone else get so much more interesting captchas than mine?

Thousands of human cultures have flourished throughout the human past, but there have been only about 24 civilizations. And all (except our current global industrial civilization—so far) have collapsed."<br> <br>"Tainter describes the growth of civilization as a process of investing societal resources in the development of ever-greater complexity in order to solve problems. For example, in village-based tribal societies an arms race between tribes can erupt, requiring each village to become more centralized and complexly organized in order to fend off attacks. But complexity costs energy. As Tainter puts it, “More complex societies are costlier to maintain than simpler ones and require higher support levels per capita.” Since available energy and resources are limited, a point therefore comes when increasing investments become too costly and yield declining marginal returns. Even the maintenance of existing levels of complexity costs too much (citizens may experience this as onerous levels of taxation), and a general simplification and decentralization of society ensues—a process colloquially referred to as collapse."<br><br>To Bill's point, resource limitations are key to the resolution on the substance and efficacy of empire. Peak civilization is what comes to mind (sorry to use "peak"--it is so overused)when I think about the material threshold to the carrying capacity of a system mired in imperial processes. It begs the question, may we find a "prosperous way down" as Odum has coined so vividly in his writing?<br><br><a href=#c9180750993282654764 title="comment permalink">2/16/12, 2:08 PM</a><br><br>

I don't mean WHAT you say, exactly. You're much older than I am and have much more experience in researching information.<br><br>Nothing you say is WRONG or INACCURATE, exactly, and I've learned a great deal from you that I didn't know before...<br><br>...but sometimes, you try to answer certain questions, and then "go no further," that is, you sometimes don't generate further questions to address further complexity, in a way you frequently complain about when your posters do the same.<br><br>The example I'm thinking of is that in this post, you were highly critical of David Korten. For good reason, by the way, I think Korten's a whack job too.<br><br>And, you were very insightful in pointing out how often the left tends to caricature the right.<br><br>Again, I completely agree.<br><br>However, you seem to "stop there," and because of that, you often portray the left as caricature, in a way that made you angry in this very post when the left does the same to the right.<br><br>You essentially picked David Korten as representative of the left, or at least that was the signal I was getting from you (please tell me if I'm wrong). David Korten is a totalitarian, so obviously that means the left is totalitarian. Do you see the problem, IF I am summarizing you accurately?<br><br>Every single time you even discuss the left (that my still-limited thinking capacities could ascertain, anyway), you always discuss leftist arguments in their "weakest form" instead of their "strongest form." <br><br>The Stalinists, the Marxists, David Korten, the sellout environmentalists who won't take public transportation instead of cars, Derrick Jensen, and so on.<br><br>But you're very complex and open-minded and capable of seeing a group's multiple sub-groups when it comes to untangling the strands of the right; you can tell the difference between a fascist and an authoritarian and a capitalist, and you can tell the difference between Ann Coulter and Edmund Burke, just for example.<br><br>Here's my question: How come (as near as I can figure when I'm reading you) when you're discussing the right, you insist that leftists not stereotype and caricature them, and you always address the right's strongest arguments (Edmund Burke, Spengler, the working-class right-wing voters, C.S. Lewis, etc.) but when you're discussing the left, you always go after the folks with the poorest arguments or most frightening arguments?<br><br>When discussing the right, you bring up Edmund Burke the wise man, but when discussing the left, you either bring up David Korten the totalitarian or Derrick Jensen the angry dualist. Have you considered the possibility that maybe the left is composed of disparate groups just as the right is, a small percentage of which might even be right about something or other?<br><br>Please tell me if I have accidentally phrased this question rudely or if I've caused you pain by leaving this comment. Like I said, I respect you immensely; this has just been bothering me for a while.<br><br><a href=#c3791230051582413812 title="comment permalink">2/16/12, 2:14 PM</a><br><br>

I'm thinking mostly, empires seem to collapse because of bigger picture systemic pressures and crashes. <br><br>I grew up in a family that had long ties to the British Empire, with several generations working in China and India in various middle manager or junior officer roles. I also knew a few “retired colonels” when I was growing up: ex-military men who would prop up the bars of country pubs and tell of how the world was so much better when they were running various parts of it. On a systemic level, we all know that empire is about shoveling out the resources and sending them home, in various obvious and not so obvious ways. But on a personal level I don’t remember a single individual British person who was actually involved in managing the Empire ever referring to this directly. It just wasn’t mentioned. I’ve tried tackling my Dad on the subject. He’s a mild-mannered and reasonable man, but he still tends to see the British Empire as a net good for those under its control. “But we brought them the railways, dear boy” is one of his more memorable lines. Funny. Maybe the discussion at the time was more direct, and maybe ex-managers of empire just see things more rosily in the rear-view. <br><br>My guess is, though, that we get put into situations we don’t understand, and then reach for the myths and stories to make ourselves feel better once we start to realize what’s really happening. Few of my US friends are prepared to talk about this topic and most subscribe to some version of the we’re-more innovative-enterprising-optimistic-etc story when asked to account for our relative wealth.<br><br><a href=#c8952812932857705123 title="comment permalink">2/16/12, 2:39 PM</a><br><br>

I'd like to think I do so less today than I did a few years ago, as my understanding of the Left's role in empire progresses. I look forward to having my gut political reactions deconstructed and objectified by JMG, he's been very helpful to date.<br><br>(Must make a note to myself, on the other hand, not to adopt "thaumaturgy" as another snarl word... it's an attractive one!)<br><br>In answer to Thijs and others who wonder whether USAians do or do not accept the use of the word "empire" to apply to themselves... it depends a lot on your polling sample. <br><br>Those who would call themselves the enlightened Left do accept it, in my experience, but only as a statement of situation, not as principle. In other words, they say the Right during the 1980s transformed America from a mythical golden age (which probably never existed) where America was an independent, self-reliant nation promoted Freedom, Prosperity and Democracy across the world; into an Empire, over the objections of the Left. <br><br>Meanwhile, those on the Right and in the dwindling center, still find themselves nonplussed and offended at the use of the word empire to describe the United States. It just doesn't fit their ontology, their worldview; they don't conceive of the United States in that way. Partly it's because they believe the mythos that the United States is always on the side of Democracy and self-determination.<br><br>But besides Democracy, the hidden assumption is that the success and expansion of the American style of industrial and high-finance Capitalism (by its own methods of measure, I must point out) is proof that people everywhere around the world envy, want, and aspire to join that system of commerce. Both sides buy into the Capitalistic propaganda which says that all business transactions are by definition voluntary and nobody could ever be co-erced into such a thing. So, if you take it as a given that the world's participation in the American economy proves how popular we and our system of government and commerce together are, it lets you sleep at night and disregard the evidence that the system is maintained at a great cost in blood.<br><br>I have read numerous examples of this tacit concurrence in the New York Times lately, but I dismissed them as pabulum so I'm having trouble citing one; <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/g/gaddis-war.html rel=nofollow>here's an example</a> which says: "...the United States... made no significant attempts after 1920 to shape political-military developments on the Continent. It chose this self-effacing path, historians have variously argued, because the nation's long-standing tradition of peacetime isolationism reasserted itself... United States's failure to assume Britain's role as global economic hegemon left an absence of managerial authority... Americans were reluctant to assume world responsibilities in the absence of clear and present danger..." <br><br>Man, quite a load of dingo's kidneys! This guy is supposedly the Godfather of Cold War historians. He might want to check with people in, say, Cuba, Chile or Iran about whether Americans were ever reluctant to assume world responsibilities. But clearly those places "don't count" as meddling in world responsibilities, because, ummmmm, because, ummmm, because Western Europe is the only place that matters.<br><br><a href=#c671816872445950607 title="comment permalink">2/16/12, 2:43 PM</a><br><br>

There were a lot of complex debates leading up to that, and the disagreement was as much about styles of empire as anything else; we'll get to that. <br><br>Nathan, the problem there is that most nations, at some point in their history, either have an empire or try to get one. Which comes first, the dysfunction or the empire? A challenging question. <br><br>Michelle, I don't have those answers, but it would be an interesting subject for research -- since it's in your bailiwick, perhaps you might consider looking into that as a project? <br><br>DeAnander, I think it's more common that empire arises, not from a biotic surplus, but from an imbalance of military power -- and that has any number of sources, ranging along a spectrum from material to social factors. As for Oil Drum, it's a very good place to keep track of how the numbers are moving, less so for responses to the larger picture. The Drumbeat columns tend to be very good snapshots of peak oil news. <br><br>DC, exactly what counts as a civilization is a complex and nuanced issue, and it's a bit unfair to say that all civilizations but ours have collapsed, when in a great many cases what happens is that ours moved in and destroyed rival civilizations that had lasted for a very long time. Still, I've discussed the fall of civilizations at great length in previous posts; we're on to a different topic now. <br><br>Shadow, yes, I figured that at least one of my leftward readers would pitch a fit over my comments in this week's post. If you'll glance back over past posts with a little less animus, you'll find that I lampoon the idiots of the right just as often as I do those of the left. I don't cite a lot of left-wing thinkers because I don't often find their work useful to the specific purposes of this blog; when they are useful -- for example, the work of Paul Blumberg, who's decidedly left of center -- I cite them in detail. Still, when it comes down to it, if you don't like the sources I use, you know, there are plenty of other blogs out there. <br><br>Leo, excellent! Excellent! I'm going to break my usual rule and award two gold stars today. Yes, that's exactly the issue, and we'll be talking about it in detail in a bit. <br><br>Yupped, I've never heard of an empire collapsing due to a lack of support from its work force, no. Quite the contrary -- attitudes like your father's are standard issue in every empire I've ever heard of. <br><br>Thomas, good. (Among other things, "dingo's kidneys" is an exquisite bit of invective.) You've touched on the big argument in American politics in the early 20th century, which wasn't about whether we'd have an empire -- that was settled by then -- but whether the empire would get tangled up in the politics of the Old World.

I am currently reading Matt Ridley’s “The Rational Optimist” - amusingly the opposite point of view of the whole civilization trajectory. Right now I am in the middle of his writing on cities and empires. An enjoyable parallelism.<br><br>Since you expect some leftish opposition to a part of your post, let me say this. The intellectual standards on the right are just atrocious nowadays, even compared with appalling representation of leftish ideas in the politics and the media. Just look at the GOP primaries circus... I dare to mirror you by saying that your apologetic habit of left-right equivalence looks like an emotional thing, just as the (thoughtful?) response <i>”go read somewhere else”</i>. On substance, I suggest that old-school leftish judgements of what fascism is should be held in certain regard, if only because self-identified socialists and communists spilled by far most of own blood fighting fascisms, whether on the Eastern front, in Spain or Latin America. In turn, conventional fascist regimes had targeted the left most consistently. By now, serious leftish commentators are very shy to bring up fascism, fully anticipating that any rational element in a discussion would disappear then.<br><br>By the way, a quintessential old-school leftish personality, Noam Chomsky, just published <br><a href=http://www.salon.com/2012/02/14/the_hysterical_american_decline/singleton/ rel=nofollow>two articles</a> on the <a href=http://www.salon.com/2012/02/15/americas_apocalyptic_imperial_strategy/ rel=nofollow>American empire</a> on the internet.

You <i>do</i> know that they were the first Europeans who tried to settle America and they had not only settlements but actual kingdoms in Iceland, England, France, Sicily, Russia and Ukraine (going there via the Mediterranean &amp; Black seas)? That doesn't make them an empire, granted, but you can hardly call that 'sticking to your home ground'. <br> Also, minor quibble: the Romans didn't offer their legionaries a way out of slavery. Only full citizens could be in the <i>Legiones</i>. Non-citizens would join the <i>Auxilia</i> (such as the <i>Cohortes</i> or <i>Alae</i>) and sometimes be rewarded with citizenship. But even in the auxilia you wouldn't find slaves - only in ad hoc formations consisting of, e.g. gladiators.<br><br>@Thomas Daulton: the funny thing is that, actually, "people everywhere around the world" <i>do</i> "envy, want, and aspire to join that system of commerce". Or rather, they want to have the material symbols of the American way of life: coca cola, hamburgers, blue jeans, rock &amp; roll... The military force of an Empire is only a part of the story. Propaganda always plays a very important role too (at least in the empires I know best, the Roman and the American ones).<br>Parts of the periphery will always be drawn to the core, because that's where the luxury is...

But let me tell you a little about my experiences in Mexico, where I lived for three years.<br><br>If you ask any American why Mexicans immigrate to the US illegally, almost to a man Americans will say it's because the Mexicans envy, want, and aspire to the American way of life.<br><br>But if you ask Mexicans why their countrymen immigrate illegally, you will quickly find that Mexicans, almost to a man, are extremely patriotic and have deep roots on their land. Virtually no Mexican works in the US because he would rather be here than at home.<br><br>There is a sharp divide in Mexico between the city Mexicans and the country/rural Mexicans. City Mexicans tell you that Mexico is capable of achieving everything America is. Hang out in downtown Guadalajara and Monterrey and indeed, the level of technology and luxury -- for the upper and upper middle classes -- is almost identical to the US. They have all the same gadgets and commute in the same cars to the same offices; the only difference is they're speaking Spanish. And almost none of the city-born, upper class Mexicans have spent time in America besides vacations.<br><br>Go out to the country, though, where virtually all the immigrant pool is from, and you hear a different story. These Mexicans value hearth and home and family, and their traditional way of life. But they will explain that they have no choice but to leave their loved ones against their will and go to America because there is simply not enough opportunity to earn money in the country, it's impossible to earn enough money to support their families. And the city Mexicans won't hire them. So they migrate. And quite a number of them are pretty vocal about how the US subsidizes its agriculture for export specifically in order to depress the farming industry in Mexico. Meanwhile, Americans are pampered and lazy and are willing to pay outlandish prices for simple manual labor. So, they migrate.<br><br>So I'm not denying or gainsaying what you're telling me. Nevertheless, the idea that foreigners envy Americans is a bit more complex and multilayered than that. I can't help but think that even though Gauls got educated at Roman universities, they didn't necessarily regard the whole Roman Empire system as a just system. Probably the same goes for the British versus their subject nations. Yet as Noam Chomsky famously said, there has never been an oppression which didn't feel like the most natural, proper and justified thing in the world to the people doing the oppressing.<br><br>(Blogger captcha: Shedbeh Almighty -- I realize we're polytheists around here, but that's still a little odd)<br><br><a href=#c9159273754411570987 title="comment permalink">2/17/12, 7:22 AM</a><br><br>

When the settlers created the Icelandic General Assembly in 930, they established a unique government which consisted of a legislative and judicial system but which lacked a central executive or administrative branch. The Icelanders were deeply suspicious of monarchies and certainly remained so through the Sturlung Age.

Or as he later follows with, that it's when that surplus starts to run dry, that the drive for imperial possession begins.<br><br>Certainly agriculture allows for the specialisation of skills which can lead to the building of armies and weapons which then help build the empire -- or 'wealth pump', as JMG so succinctly defines it.<br><br>But most interestingly this morning, before I read any comments, my mind was drawn to how similar empires are to agriculture itself. If we define agriculture as a 'resource pump', we can then look at agriculture as a system for benefiting the core (humans) whilst exploiting the periphery (the natural world), in much the same way that empires pump wealth - indeed, that wealth is first generated by agriculture/resource extraction in the imperial periphery.<br><br>Admittedly, my thinking in this is heavily influenced by Catton - I no longer look at the rolling landscape of England as a bucolic idyll of farmsteads, but rather a terra-formed landscape of confiscated ecosystems (confiscated from other species), in which farmers are desperately fighting back the forces of ecological succession so as to extract some of the energy flows for the table. The idea of this energy flow (farming) being both a necessary pre-cursor, and a consequence of imperial living arrangements is a fairly profound one - well, for me at least. And I wonder with regard to imperialism: did the drive to take from other tribes/cities/civilisations originate from our domination of the landscape itself? ie when we first began to farm.<br><br>One other thing John: I note that you are at pains to take the 'snarl' out of the word empire - and rightly so. But what do you personally feel about empires as living arrangements? Given that they inevitably involve exploitation of other people &amp; species, it's understandable why there would be strong moral reactions against them.

Often the research they cover is very political (think defending science in the face of political attacks).<br><br>Anyway, the theme of the conference is "flattening the world" (in the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Is_Flat rel=nofollow>Thomas Friedman sense</a>), potentially quite an anti-imperial idea. However, when people talk about the challenges of the future, the phrase that seems to come up is "maintaining a decent standard of living". (Funnily enough, I think Noam Chomsky used the same phrase in a recent article). How that is defined is left open, but looking around at the crowd last night at the opening ceremony (nobody overweight, so few members of ethnic minorities it may as well have been all white), my guess is that it means "our American middle class standard of living". And while I think there's some concern for, say, people on the periphery starving to death, this almost feels like it's more about the unrest that causes (see the Arab Spring) than for the plight of the people.<br><br>Anyway, early days yet, and it's not all bad (well apart from the session that posits that all the economic growth of the past 30 years is attributable to Moore's law).

Were the Viking kingdoms administered from "home"? if so then they would look more like empire to me: a central core of authority and power sending out "runners" (like strawberry plant) and funnelling wealth back up the ladder. I'll have to strike the Vikings from my list of "mobile raiders," I guess, and think of them as raider/settlers. <br><br>Actually the plant analogy might be worth pursuing. Some plants reproduce via seeds which become independent plants, often far away. Others prefer to send out runners or rhizomes to colonise an ever-greater area as one organism (running bamboo, for example, and spider plants...)<br><br>Some warrior cultures throw off independent kingdoms -- individual war leaders go out and conquer themselves some territory and set up as new kings, without being bound to obey the Big Guy back home. But empires send out runners, siphoning nutrients back to the core and following the strategic directives of the core. I dunno, maybe it's a pointless distinction and expansionism is expansionism....<br><br>Good point about the Roman military too. How about foreign mercenaries?

I wrote about that at some length back a ways, in relation to the end of the Seventies and the brittle faux-cynicism that's been so fashionable since that time. <br><br>Nathan, excellent. That's quite true, and there are other close equivalents to the wealth pump that we'll be talking about shortly. <br><br>Cherokee, getting people to remember a cautionary tale -- the South Sea Bubble makes as good an example as any -- is difficult when people have parked their dreams of unearned wealth in a fantasy that requires not remembering that cautionary tale!<br><br>Librarian, well, as I know nothing about the show, and haven't watched TV in my adult life, I'm not qualified to speculate. <br><br>Jeffrey, thank you. <br><br>Das Monde, it's always amused me to watch the left redefine fascism as a right-wing phenomenon, which it wasn't -- a point I'll be discussing in more detail later on -- and claiming the defeat of fascism as their own doing, which it was only in part. A great deal of the most sustained opposition to the Nazi regime, of course, came from the right -- and that's as much the case inside Germany (Claus von Stauffenberg comes to mind) as outside it (Churchill was hardly a leftist, just for starters). More on this down the road a bit. <br><br>Unknown, I see the banks, etc., as an integral part of the system of empire; they've become dysfunctional at this point because the empire itself has become dysfunctional, and (like the banks) is costing more than it brings in. <br><br>Jim, yes, and we'll get to that. <br><br>Phil, "free trade" is always imperial. Britain was the great proponent of free trade during the heyday of its empire, and the US maintained hefty tariffs and trade barriers, to keep its industrial economy from being flattened by Britain's massively subsidized equivalent. Now we've got the heavily subsidized economy, and it's China that's comfortably sheltering behind trade barriers and building up its economy. <i>Plus ca change...</i> <br><br>Croatoan, I've noticed that in trips to DC. Call it the Versailles syndrome; it's a common cause of heads of state ending up in a basket on the wrong side of a guillotine. <br><br>Goldrush, my personal opinion about empires is like my personal opinion about bloodsucking leeches -- I dislike them intensely, but I'm aware that they will continue to exist whenever conditions are suitable for them. As far as the evidence suggests, empires usually emerge whenever political organization, military methods, and transport technologies are effective enough to allow movable wealth to be pumped from one society to another by force. It's possible that at some point far in the future, changes in human social structures will make empires obsolete, but we're not there yet, nor anywhere close.<br><br><a href=#c7002706607432054801 title="comment permalink">2/17/12, 11:01 PM</a><br><br>

I'll take another look at Foster -- what I've read of him so far hasn't been promising. As for the Dutch, though, yes, we'll be discussing their empire among others. <br><br>Mustard, thanks for the link!<br><br>DeAnander, what Heinberg doesn't say is that the vast majority of those thousands of human cultures have also collapsed. It's like saying that water must be toxic, because everyone who's ever ingested it either has already died or is going to die within mere decades...<br><br>Mark, the problem with critiquing Jensen is that so much of his work is just emoting on paper. Korten at least makes coherent arguments, disingenuous as they are; Jensen is simply venting his feelings about his childhood, and that's not subject to any sort of useful discussion. <br><br>Sophie, I find Zinn useful, in that the bias in his books -- which is considerable -- is equal and opposite to the bias in the sort of cheerleading histories he criticized, and so it's possible to find a balance by contrasting the two. Still, one of the massive difficulties in the way of making sense of the US empire and its impending fall is precisely the insistence that a simplistic moral analysis of a nation's behavior is the goal of historical discussion -- and that's equally counterproductive, it seems to me, whichever way the judgment falls. <br><br>Lewis, seen it but haven't read it -- let us know what it's like!<br><br>Joel, that's a fairly late work of Toynbee's; I haven't read it yet, as <i>A Study of History</i> is still being digested and reread.

You only tend to get about 2 years worth of productive strawberries from a plant because of a build up in viruses in the soil over that period of time. This is all quite natural, but they are more like hunter gatherers moving on to avoid their own pollution.

Mussolini began as a socialist and his fascist movement had mass appeal for former socialists. Fascism can be seen as an ideology of the radical centre rather than the right since although Mussolini came to power by crushing the Italian communists he also made demands of business. I believe the trade unions were given a role in the economy under a social partnership system where organised labout had a voice. This system of corporatism worked well and fascism was immensely popular in Italy for a time. It's a cliche to say that Mussolini made the trains run on time but he did succeed in providing law and order, full employment and a successful economy which gave Italians pride in their country. Italian fascism was not anti semitic to begin with and there were Jews in the Fascist Party. Mussolini's fatal error was to be seduced by Nazi Germany into entering the war on the wrong side. Had he not done so it's most likely that his regime would have survived at least as long as Franco's did.<br><br>As for the Nazis the official name of their party was the National Socialist Workers Party and there were socialists in the party, mainly among the SA and the Strasserites who were purged by Hitler. Hitler came to power because German industrialists and the Junker aristocracy saw his mass movement as preferable to communism which to them was the greater evil. So was the right who invited Hitler to become Chancellor, not the left. <br><br>However during the Thirties it was possible to believe in good faith, and many people did, that the real monster was Stalin and his bolsheviks not the Nazis. The Holocaust didn't begin until after the outbreak of war but Stalin's Gulag and man made famines were happening in peacetime.<br><br>Both communism and arguably fascism were ideologies of the left that grew out of control.<br><br>I say this not because it gives me any pleasure - I consider myself pretty left wing - but one has to be honest about history.<br><br><a href=#c4273606487419980732 title="comment permalink">2/18/12, 9:00 AM</a><br><br>

Fascism emerges in societies in which the center has been abandoned by all major parties, leaving ideas that most of the population supports to be used as fodder by ambitious demagogues. That's why Kunstler is off base to worry about his "cornpone Hitler;" the figure we need to fear, here in America, is the plausible, charismatic figure who seizes the abandoned center and builds a movement around giving the American people the policies they want, by any means necessary.<br><br><a href=#c1196640111635962079 title="comment permalink">2/18/12, 10:01 AM</a><br><br>

It does seem inevitable that empires in general will continue to exist for quite some time. I do wonder if some other form of organization will eventually replace them that's as unfamiliar to us as civilizations would have been to our paleolithic ancestors. For the (relatively) shorter term, I would guess that, as fossil fuels get scarce, some areas that don't have the resources necessary for a surplus will become out of reach of empires.<br><br>Something else I've been wondering about is the intersection of empire and ecological thinking. The way I think of China is that it may have its period of dominance, but it's set itself on the same ultimately unsustainable and self destructive path as the USA. Most people now consider environmentalism and sustainability the realm of the left, although I also see an increasing number of the "rugged individualists" type of the right turning toward sustainability in order to reduce their dependence on the system.<br><br>In the early twentieth century, J. Russell Smith in the book "Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture" invoked national pride and patriotism when speaking against soil erosion, comparing the outrage that would occur if another country were to invade and destroy a tiny piece of America to the mass destruction of America by destructive agricultural practices. Few environmentalists now speak in such terms, but that may change.<br><br><br>I'm thinking that as some point, many of the imperialists themselves, may realize that abusing the land is also undercutting the foundations of the nation. It's too late for America to maintain its status as superpower, and I doubt China will revamp itself quickly enough to adapt to the age of decline, but some future power may see those mistakes and fuse imperialism with environmentalism. <br><br>I've mentioned this to some who say that wouldn't happen because the urge to dominate nature and to dominate people go hand in hand, and those who respect nature wouldn't subjugate people either. I disagree, because there are plenty of very religious conquerors who were dominating of humanity but submissive toward their gods. I could see a similar mindset in an empire that considers restoring the land as one of its values. This in turn could be used as an excuse to subjugate other cultures (We can maintain the land better then they can).<br><br>I'd prefer ecology without empire myself, but if empire is what we're stuck with, at least those of us in areas with enough resources, I'd imagine that eventually empires with some sorts of ecological values will prevail because the others will self-destruct. When people can't depend on their machines and technology to do so much of their work, fitness and health will matter much more again, and healthier land makes for healthier food which makes for healthier, stronger people. So, a ruthless imperialist could get into ecology purely out of self-interest.<br><br><a href=#c6890896840986216964 title="comment permalink">2/18/12, 2:36 PM</a><br><br>

Nevertheless, I like your original comment that propaganda makes many provincials envy the empire without realizing that its wealth comes mainly from their own shores.

However there are clever stove designs -- which don't require any special technology, just arranging bricks and maybe a metal pipe -- which vent the smoke outside the kitchen area. Google "Improved Chulha" or "Rocket Stove" to see some options.

It seems that there was no impetus to establish colonies abroad as the raw materials were more-or-less obtained from the sources available in the home country or its European trade partners. One can think of few hypothesis to solve this puzzle: <br><br>-raw materials siphoned from the periphery were turned to inexpensive industrial goods which would not sell in the domestic markets yet were sought-after in the colonies. At the same time domestic markets were often protected by tariffs against similar products from the colonies. However, this explanation concerns mostly non-strategic raw materials such as cotton which is not needed for empire building like iron ore and coal for these were obtained from domestic/continental sources as Bairoch noted. Still, this mechanism provided significant financial rewards for the empire (interestingly, by the end of the 19th century, Lancashire mills accounted for one quarter of Britain's entire export trade).<br><br>-19th century industrial revolution made it possible to establish colonies on a large scale and acquire luxury raw materials on a similarly large scale. Thus the lure of luxury would have been one driving force in colonialism and imperialism that followed it. This sounds simplistic, but thinking about gold, diamonds and ivory that were associated with the colonies in the popular culture of 19th century - well, at least we have ample evidence that many contemporary minds were captivated by the idea of getting rich in the colonies. <br><br>JMG notes that the original commenter reads the definition too narrowly. Might we learn more about the Archdruid's definition of empire in the coming weeks?<br><br><a href=#c7675112903475863976 title="comment permalink">2/19/12, 4:36 PM</a><br><br>

I have a hypothesis about what happened that it wasn't vetoed by anybody on the executive council.<br><br>Basically there were three votes that mattered: Germany, Russia, and China.<br><br>I still can't figure out exactly what kind of armtwisting we did to Angela since she actually ran for office saying that she would veto the UN Resolution. Then, literally the day after she was reelected, she turned around and abstained. Still not sure what happened there.<br><br>Russia ended up abstaining too. Not sure exactly what happened there, but I think it had to do with not getting involved in South Ossetia and letting the Russians do there thing there...<br><br>China has always been the weird one. The Chinese said repeatedly that they would veto the resolution, but they ended up abstaining also. Here is my hypothesis.<br><br>You might recall that there was a "labor dispute" going on at the time on the West Coast. Basically the Pacific Maritime Association, which runs all the ports on the west coast, locked out the longshoremen. (Please be aware that this was NOT a strike.) The ports shut down and this went on for months. This caused all kinds of problems in the "just in time" supply lines of the US empire. Basically all the ships in the Pacific Basin were sitting off Long Beach waiting to unload there plastic toys and other stuff. There are pictures of Hong Kong with NO ships there! There were estimates that his was costing the Chinese more then $1 Billion a DAY in lost exports. <br><br>This situation resolved itself in a most curious way. Right at the time of the UN vote the Bush Administration invoked the Taft-Hartley Act and FORCED the longshoremen BACK TO WORK. (Remember, this was not a strike, but a lock out!) And China abstained from the vote on using force in Iraq.<br><br>Those are the facts. Now for my hypothesis: I think the Bush Administration went to the PMA and said, "Go ahead and lock out the longshoremen. We will take care of it for you later and it will take care of your labor issues at the same time."
