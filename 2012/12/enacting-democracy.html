<div class=MsoNormal>
The recovery of reason, the theme of last week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, has implications that go well past the obvious. One of the examples that comes first to mind is also directly relevant to the theme of this series of posts, and it unfolds from an experience that many people have mentioned to me in recent years:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the inability of Americans with different beliefs to sit down and have a constructive conversation about their disagreements.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who have tried to do this any time recently, unless they were very lucky, will have found stalemate the all but inevitable outcome. Each side trots out its favorite talking points, most of them sound bites culled from popular media of one kind or another. When these fail to have the expected effect on the other side, both sides try again, with similar results, until finally one or both sides withdraw into frustration and hostility. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Though it’s unpopular these days to point this out, both sides in the current American culture wars follow this same wearily predictable pattern. Yes, I’m familiar with the recent flurry of liberal psychologists who insist that conservatives are just too irrational to accept what liberals see as self-evident truths; I don’t buy their claims, not least because I’ve watched liberals behave with exactly the same degree of illogic in parallel situations. The problem on both sides, as I see it, is the debasement of thinking discussed in last week’s post:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the malign transformation of our inner discourse into a set of arbitrary linkages between verbal noises and simple emotional reactions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>If a verbal noise produces warm fuzzy emotions in one person and cold prickly emotions in another, they are not going to be able to communicate unless both are able to get past that unthinking reaction—and getting past that unthinking reaction is something that very few Americans these days are able to do. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s another useful way to speak of the confusion of language in today’s America, and that’s to point out that nearly all our collective discourse has been reduced to <i>phatic communication</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That seemingly exotic phrase describes a very familiar process:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the use of verbal noises to signal belonging and readiness for social interaction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>When two men sit down in a bar here in Cumberland, and one says to the other, “So, how about them Ravens?”—we’re halfway between Baltimore and Pittsburgh, so in football season it’s either that or “How about them Steelers?”—the question needn’t indicate any interest in the team in question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rather, it’s a formal way to acknowledge the other person’s presence and claim membership in a community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In a different context, the question might be “Nice weather, isn’t it?” or some other equally vacant utterance. The form varies but the content—or more precisely the lack of content—remains identical. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Much of today’s political discourse serves exactly the same purpose: it signals readiness for social interaction and claims membership in a specific political subculture, and that’s basically all it does. The verbal noises that get used for phatic communication in that context vary even with fairly small shifts across the political landscape, but if you sit in on a discussion among people who more or less agree with each other’s politics, you can usually figure out pretty quickly what the relevant warm-fuzzy and cold-prickly phrases are, and once you’ve done that you can identify yourself either as a member of the community or as an outsider with a very few words.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s an experiment I recommend, partly for the entertainment value, and partly because there are few better ways to learn just how much of what passes for political thought these days is a set of essentially content-free signals meant to define the boundaries of a group. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s really quite remarkable to watch the range of things that get turned into phatic labels for political subcultures these days. Not long ago, for example, "Merry Christmas" and "Happy Holidays" were equally content-free phatic utterances used from the middle of November to the end of the year across most of American society. These days, "Merry Christmas" has been turned into a phatic badge on the rightward end of the contemporary culture wars, and "Happy Holidays" is well on its way to becoming a phatic badge of equal force on the left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Myself, I have no problem wishing my Christian neighbors a merry Christmas—that is what they’re celebrating, after all—and wishing a happy Hanukkah, a blessed solstice, or even a merry Krampustide to those who celebrate these other festivities; one of the benefits of being able to use language for purposes other than phatic communication is that, when a phatic noise is the right thing to use, you can choose your signals deliberately to get the results you want. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It thus probably needs to be said that there’s nothing wrong with phatic communication. Human beings are social primates, with the normal set of social primate instincts and reactions, and casual comments about football teams and the weather are no more objectionable in themselves than the grunts and postures baboons use to accomplish the same ends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The problem here is simply a function of the fact that human language has functions other than phatic communication, and when those other functions are of crucial importance, staying stuck in phatic communication doesn’t help much. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s an old word, dialectic, that may be worth introducing here. No, it doesn’t have anything to do with Marxism; long before Hegel’s time, it was used for exactly the kind of communication that’s most lacking in American society these days, the kind in which two or more people sit down and say, in effect, “let us reason together.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The ancient philosopher Plotinus described dialectic as the most precious part of philosophy, and the point’s a valid one; the ability to sit down with someone who disagrees with you about some important issue, discuss the matter, determine what common ground exists and where the differences of opinion lie, and either resolve the disagreement or sort out the questions of fact and value that have to be settled in order to resolve it, represents a high level of the practical wisdom that philosophy once upon a time was meant to cultivate. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Dialectic is a learned skill, and not a particularly difficult one, either. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Anyone who can tell the difference between a fact and an opinion, recognize a dozen or so of the standard logical fallacies, follow an argument step by step from its premises to its conclusion, and forbear from dragging the discussion down to the level of personal slurs, can pick it up promptly given a competent teacher and a little practice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the ancient world, dialectic was the way that philosophy was taught: a teacher would start a conversation with a couple of senior students on some specific theme, and go from there. If the dialogue that followed was any good, it wouldn’t simply rehash existing knowledge, but turn into an adventure of the mind that broke new ground; those of my readers who are familiar with the dialogues of Plato, which were meant to imitate dialectic at work, will have some sense of how this worked. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Pass beyond the circle of students around a teacher, and dialectic merges into rhetoric. That’s a word that gets plenty of use these days, nearly always with a heavy cargo of cold pricklies attached to it. Until quite recently, though, rhetoric was well understood as one of the essential skills of citizenship: the ability to stand up and explain, in clear, concise, and compelling language, what you think about a given issue. Of all the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>skills of democracy, it’s hard to think of one more thoroughly misplaced than this one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>How many times, dear reader, have you heard people bemoaning the fact that people in America aren’t willing to listen to one another?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There’s a reason for that, though it’s not one you’re likely to hear; it’s that next to nobody in this country seems to be able to make a cogent, sensible comment on an issue—on <i>any</i>
issue—and then sit down, shut up, and let somebody else take the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It seems to have been completely forgotten nowadays that competent rhetoric makes the listener want to keep listening. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Rhetoric is another learned skill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are plenty of good textbooks on the subject, ranging from ancient Greek texts to online tutorials packed with the latest buzzwords, and there’s also a voluntary organization—<a href=http://www.toastmasters.org/ >Toastmasters International</a>—that teaches rhetorical skills via a network of local clubs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s not particularly difficult to learn, either. The great obstacle here is the terror of public speaking that’s efficiently instilled in American schoolchildren by the culture of bullying that pervades our public schools, and that can be outgrown; I had a world-class case of it not all that many years ago, for example. The benefits to learning it are not small, and are far from limited to its crucial role in fostering democracy, but we’ll stay focused on this latter for now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When citizens can stand up in a meeting and present their points of view in concise, thoughtful, and convincing words, democracy becomes possible. When they can’t—when the only thing that takes place in a meeting is a collection of verbal noises denoting "warm fuzzy!" and "cold prickly!" to those others present who happen to link noises and emotions in the same way the speaker does—democracy is not an option, because it’s impossible to establish any shared basis for communication between those with different emotional reactions to any given set of verbal noises.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Transform those noises into words with mutually agreed meanings and you can get past that barrier, but transforming verbal noises into words with mutually agreed meanings is a skill very few Americans know any more. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The ability to converse in a reasoned and reasonable fashion, and the ability to present a viewpoint in a clear, cogent, and convincing manner, are thus among the core skills of democratic process that have been lost by contemporary American society and need to be recovered in a hurry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Add these to the basic capacity to reason discussed in last week’s post, and you’ve got all the foundations for democratic process. You don’t yet have anything built on those foundations, but that’s the next step.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Democratic process itself comprises one more set of skills—the skills that allow a group of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>people to meet together, discuss controversial issues, and agree on a collective response to them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those skills are not to be found in the so-called consensus methods that have kept activists on the Left spinning their wheels uselessly for three decades now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I trust my readers remember the flood of self-congratulatory verbiage put forth by the Occupy movement in 2011; that movement vanished with scarcely a trace once the weather turned cold last year, and despite loud claims that it would pop back up again in the spring, it did no such thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>There were a good many factors behind its failure, but among thwm was
<a href=http://fritztucker.blogspot.com/2011/11/american-autumn-pt-3.html>the manipulative behavior of activists</a> who seized control of the movement using a supposedly egalitarian consensus system that placed all effective power, and a great deal of donated money, in their unelected and unsupervised hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
After months of circular debate that never quite managed to result in meaningful action, the vast majority of the protesters were convinced that their concerns would not be addressed and their efforts were wasted, and simply went home. This would be significant enough if it was new; in point of fact, it’s been the outcome of nearly every attempt at organized protest since the early 1980s, when the current suite of manipulative pseudoconsensus methods were adopted across most of the activist Left. If you want to know why the Left accomplished next to nothing for thirty years, while activists on the right were getting candidates into office and laws on the books, that’s an important part of the reason. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is all the more embarrassing in that the toolkit of democratic process has been sitting on the shelf the whole time, waiting for somebody to notice that liberal and radical groups in the past used to use methods of organization that, however unfashionable they have become, actually work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are a lot of details, and entire books in fine print have been written on the minutiae, but the core elements of democratic process can be described in a paragraph.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is how it works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Everyone has an equal voice and an equal vote, but the right to participate depends on willingness to follow the rules, and members can be ejected for abusive behavior; the chairperson of the meeting, and the handful of other people needed to make it work, are elected to be impartial referees of the process, and can be overruled or removed by vote if they abuse their positions; one person speaks at a time, and the chairperson determines who speaks next; an overly longwinded speaker can be told to shut up by the chairperson, or by vote of the members; once a vote takes place on any issue, the issue can’t be brought back up for debate again without a 2/3 majority, to keep a minority with an agenda from holding the meeting hostage; and the goal of the meeting, and of every part of the process, is to come to a decision, act on it, and get home at a reasonable hour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s democratic process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It evolved organically over many centuries from its origins in the rough but functional practices of Anglo-Saxon tribal assemblies, and like other organic systems, it looks much sloppier but works much better than the idealized abstractions cooked up by radicals on either end of the spectrum. It’s easy to compare it unfavorably to one or another of those idealized abstractions, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating; those who want to demonstrate that some other system is as effective as democratic process are welcome to use that other system on smaller scales, with voluntary organizations and local communities, and prove that it works. That was, after all, how democratic process emerged as the default option in the Western world: in actual practice, in an assortment of voluntary organizations, local communities, political parties and protest groups, it proved to be more effective than the alternatives. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I should say, finally, that even the most lively revival of the core skills of democracy isn’t likely to affect the political sphere much for a couple of decades at least; if nothing else, the sheer inertia of a political dialogue debased as far as ours has been will take at least a generation to pass off. The point in reviving these things now is to lay foundations for the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Right now, in the fading years of the Age of Abundance, it’s fairly easy to learn the things I’ve discussed in last week’s and this week’s post; the intellectual resources needed for such a project can be found readily in libraries and on the internet, and a great many people have enough spare time to invest in such a project that much could be done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The further we proceed into resource depletion, infrastructure breakdown, environmental instability, and the rest of the bubbling witch’s brew we’ve cooked up for ourselves in the cauldron of the near future, the less true that is likely to be. Thus any effort to make democratic process and the skills that make it possible available to the far future has to begin now, or soon. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a good season to keep such logic in mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those of my readers who have gardens, or are planning to plant one in the new year, will already be glancing through seed catalogs and roughing out, at least in the mind’s eye, what they will need for the spring planting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the same sense, though on a larger and more daunting scale, those of us who are watching the stormclouds of a greater winter gather on the horizon should be thinking about what seeds they intend to store for a more distant springtime. To my mind, at least, there is no greater challenge and no more important work to be done. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the meantime, I wish each of you a blessed solstice, or whatever other festival your own faith or traditions assign to this time of year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Next week, when winter is here and the partying is done, we’ll have a lot more to talk about. </div>

****************</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: large">End of the World of the Week #53</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The last months of 1999, the subject of last week’s End of the World of the Week, were in many ways just a running start for one of the most wildly popular apocalyptic dates in history, the year 2000. An astonishing number of predictions of all kinds clustered around that impressively round number. For decades beforehand, in fact, the odds were pretty good that any projection of trends in the fairly near future would begin, “In the year 2000...” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Apocalyptic prophecies were among the many notions that clustered around that year, with the widely ballyhooed Y2K bug only the most heavily publicized among them. As far back as the 13th century, the Catholic theologian Peter Olivi predicted that the Second Coming would take place that year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Isaac Newton made the same prediction in an early prophetic work, before settling on 2060 in his later writings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Puritan pastor Jonathan Edwards, author of the famous sermon <i>Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God</i>, tapped 2000 as the beginning of Christ’s millennial reign, as did Edgar Cayce and Sun Myung Moon. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Plenty of more exotic apocalypses were pinned on the same date. Popular psychic Ruth Montgomery proclaimed that the Earth would be knocked off its axis. Melody Mehta, a less widely known figure in the same business, insisted that a comet would knock Mars’ moon Phobos out of its orbit and send it careening into the Earth. On a less cosmic scale, financial writers Peter Jay and Michael Stewart predicted economic collapse and the rise of dictatorships in Europe and the US in a book somewhat unoriginally titled
<i>Apocalypse 2000</i>. No matter what kind of apocalypse you were in the market for, 2000 had something on offer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Except, of course, that none of them happened. In fact, the vast majority of all the predictions made for the year 2000, from the most exotic to the the most prosaic, landed with a thud.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The fact that so many predictions clustered around that date, it turned out, showed only that when people try to predict the future, some dates are more popular than others. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

What I felt was that my goodwill was being used up rather than nurtured and that the group had simply forgot why they were there. Perhaps it is easier to create dissent and rabbit on about some rubbish than actually implement core goals? I don’t actually know the answer, but have thought on it a bit since. Still, I put it down - at the time - to reflecting a dysfunctional community into the sphere of the group. Your post has given me much to think about as usual.<br><br>I've also seen the occasional business where people at the top of the chain deliberately cause difficulties because it is easier than doing their paid responsibilities.

I remember having discussions with my fellow students, mainly oin epistomology, that all ound down to the good old warm-fuzzy/cold-prickly business. We all had years of studying formal logic, the Platonic dialogues and the shebang under our belt, and we dug pretty deeply, but when we hit rock bottom we could only conclude that we were still standing on different rocks, scratching our heads and wondering whuy on earth the other fellow would want to stand <i>over there</i>.<br><br>The reason for that being, of course, that logic and reason are wonderful tools, but in the end they are just tools, just means to an end; the end you choose to pursue cannot be chosen using logic any more than a hammer can help you decide on which wall you want to hang up a picture.<br><br>Which is why rhetoric, to be convincing, must always appeal to emotions as well as to reason.<br>In that sense, democracy might be defined as the political system in which the rhetor who succeeds in playing on the emotions of the largest group of people gets his way.<br>All that being said, I certainly agree that it is much nicer and more civilised to have discussions in a thoughtful, reasoned manner.<br><br>Two minor itches I need to scratch: I think your view of the origins of democracy is needlessly anglocentric. There have been several democratic traditions that arose without any help from Anglo-Saxon tribal customs: The Icelandic Althing(Nordic, not Anglo-Saxon) the Dutch Republic (Largely arose out of local water management councils)and, you knew it was coming, Athens. There are no doubt others. Sveral of these traditions have been more or less influential in shaping democracy as we know it.<br><br>Second itch: the Platonic Dialogues. Urgh. Dialectic, my foot! Especially the later ones are mostly Socrates explaining 'his' views and everyone else going 'Oooh, by Dog, Socrates, you must be right!'<br><br><a href=#c4620256781477951217 title="comment permalink">12/20/12, 1:08 AM</a><br><br>

Even so, they can be telling. Here's a telling one.<br><br>For forty years I was an active member of the faculty at an Ivy League university. Every month we had a faculty meeting, run according to Robert's Rules of Order. These rules provide that when a motion is under consideration and an amendment to that motion has been proposed, you vote first on the amendment to the motion (whether to amend it or not), and then on the motion (either in its original form or as amended, according to the previous vote). Logical, yes? Simple, yes? <br><br>In all those forty years, no matter how many times and how carefully it was explained to the faculty present at the meeting, a significant fraction of the faculty would end up thoroughly confused by this simple and logical procedure, and claim that they could not be sure what their votes "meant" under that procedure. -- And these colleagues of mine are generally ranked among the brightest of our nation!

However, the challenge in motivating people to want to learn these skills is huge. In my experience most people do not want to actually invest their time in learning these sorts of skills and in doing the reading, research and so on required to develop a solid understanding of politics, world events, and history and so on. <br><br>For example, recently I was conversing with someone about politics and world events and her eyes literally glazed over at the mere mention of these matters. Her response was along the lines of "I do not know about these matters but I am fine, so why should I care?" Now this came from an educated person doing a PhD so she presumably has the intellectual capacity to understand these matters. What she, and so many others, lack is the motivation to actually engage with these issues. I think that has a lot to do with the fact that they really are emotionally challenging issues to grapple with for various reasons ranging from the fact that it can be deeply unsettling to truly confront the predicament of industrial civilisation, the corruption and cruelty endemic to the world today, to the fact that people in the industrial world often benefit from unsustainable, cruel and corrupt practices. These people do not have an incentive to allow their happy and comfortable bubble to be pierced by reality. Therefore, they will probably only ever bother to really engage with these issues and start to think critically after the situation has become much worse rather than taking action now as you counsel. More likely, though, is that they will embrace some demagogue or revitalisation movement that promises simple easy ways to restore the status quo. Hence, what we are really looking for is a motivated (hopefully large) minority that is willing to make sacrifices for a future that they will not necessarily see or benefit from. I guess that is the story of history though - motivated and idiosyncratic minorities making sacrifices for the greater good and posterity.<br><br><a href=#c2056833259545291894 title="comment permalink">12/20/12, 2:54 AM</a><br><br>

I'm currently reading "Classical English Rhetoric" by Ward Farnsworth, a good, simple guide jam-packed with examples from the best English writing and speaking.<br><br>However, I take issue with your comments on the Occupy movement, which seem calculated to make it sound rather flippant. <br><br>First, the Occupy movement did not vanish "with scarcely a trace once the weather turned cold". It was brutally suppressed by the State, and it did not vanish. It is quite active in a number of areas. There are many Occupy groups, such as Strike Debt and Occupy Together, organized around the country and building a network - the kind of network that can respond quickly, such as Occupy Sandy, which has been providing relief to the victims of the storm that the State has not been able (or willing) to provide and is now organizing in the Rockaways politically to fight rapacious landlords and the government's refusal to deal with the poorer areas affected. <br><br>Is Occupy making the kind of rapid political or social changes we might like to see? No, of course not. But I find the simple fact that it exists, is functioning, and is growing, quite encouraging. While some groups at some times may be co-opted by a few folks who can use phatic discourse to seize some momentary power, the Occupy movement was learning how to recognize that and fight against it - when the militarized State forces suppressed it. They are continuing to learn. Considering that we're educated NOT to know how to combat or even recognize that sort of discourse, I find this especially encouraging. <br><br>I hope you'll give that some thought.

I'll check out your blog as time permits. <br><br>Cherokee, the sad thing is that the community group you left might have been able to accomplish much if its members had simply had the skills that are needed to avoid the common problems you mentioned. Not that it was your job to teach them, mind you, and once a dysfunctional pattern of leadership gets set into place in an organization, it's often impossible to pry it loose. <br><br>Avery, that's quite plausible. Congrats for joining Toastmasters, by the way!<br><br>Johan, very much so. <br><br>Thijs, remember that I'm talking about America, and thus about American democracy, which is primarily rooted in English models (with a significant contribution from Native American sources). Of course there are other models in other parts of the world. As for Plato, of course some of the late dialogues descend into lecture, and some of the early ones are little better than parody; it's a rare writer that can stay at the top of his style all through his career. <br><br>Cam, thank you!<br><br>Robert, that's far from surprising to me. Sad, but not surprising. <br><br>Jason, there are two issues here. First, the specific forms of representative democracy that evolved in western Europe and north America are culturally specific, and while the forms have been adopted elsewhere they don't always work the same way in a different culture -- I think of the various attempts to impose that system in Africa and the Middle East. Second, if the foundations I've discussed in this and the last post aren't available, any attempt at democracy is going to be more or less of a charade -- as it's increasingly become in the US. <br><br>CGP, that's why I commented in the last part of this week's post that this is not a project that will change society in the next decade or two; the glazing-over effect is one manifestation of the inertia of debased thinking I mentioned. I don't expect to reach a large minority, either -- a modestly sized one would be enough, as it has been so often in the past. <br><br>Raven, that's the plan.

The logic here is the same as the logic behind the Green Wizards project: it's a lot easier and more practical to learn the skills you need now, when you don't yet have to rely on them for survival!<br><br>Spirited, find out what version of the Rules of Order your town board uses; it's probably Robert's, but there are a few other options. That's the bible of democratic process. Learn it inside and out, and ask yourself at every step along the way, "What is this meant to facilitate or forestall?" Then you'll be ready to roll. <br><br>João Carlos, I wish I had that kind of funding!<br><br>Ando, exactly. Our universities these days have abandoned education in favor of job training, generally for jobs that don't exist. <br><br>Barath, up through the Sixties there was a flurry of books with titles like "How To Run A Meeting," which were easy introductions to democratic process and got you ready for Robert's Rules of Order. I'll have to see what can be found online these days. <br><br>Robert, er, I let your comment through despite the profanity; please tone it down next time. As for the content, exactly. <br><br>Brian, "brutally suppressed"? The kind of treatment that caused Occupy to crumple didn't faze the protesters in Tahrir Square, to name only one example. More broadly, it's true that there are still small groups of activists waving the Occupy banner and doing things that don't expose how few people actually support them, which is probably a good idea. Still, the dreams of a mass movement so loudly proclaimed in 2011 have turned out to be empty wind -- and the manipulative pseudoconsensus methods imposed by activists on the rest of the participants are a very large part of the reason why.<br><br><a href=#c8479316540435605616 title="comment permalink">12/20/12, 7:45 AM</a><br><br>

Students are no longer taught how to think, but to believe and repeat what they are told. Few develop the ability of independent critical thinking, and they are handicapped by authoritarian information filters and propaganda in their search for truth. (ie. all "facts" from government, academia, foundations, media and other corporations are suspect.) Those who are open about their critical thinking usually also have to deal with social ostracism.<br><br>IMHO It appears the oligarchy decided it can no longer afford the expense of actual debate and real opposition. The actual left and right have been reduced to heretical schisms to be eliminated in the interest of a soon to be mandatory state (world?) political religion.

A major role has been played by the post-modern over reaction against positivism. The positivists tried to make language about scientific precision. The post-modernists correctly showed that this can't work, but went too far and left us with toxic idea likes 'all language is a tool for exerting power over others.' Many on the academic left don't like to admit it, but their excesses in the past 50 years have played a big role in creating our modern inability to communicate.<br><br><a href=#c2127868303682848711 title="comment permalink">12/20/12, 9:12 AM</a><br><br>

Back during Howard Dean's run in the 2004 Democratic primary, I started following liberal political blogs. I became immersed in the world for awhile but eventually burned out on politics and then--over the last few years, as I started to farm--began to discount the utility or worth of American politics. I still consider myself liberal in many regards, but I no longer live and die by the size of the Democratic caucus in Washington D.C.--and, indeed, no longer think it much matters at all.<br><br>But I do still visit some of the political blogs that I so fervently followed in the past, and it's fascinating to view them with a somewhat more detached eye. Daily Kos is probably the biggest liberal political blog on the internet and one that allows any and all of its users to publish their own posts. What's absolutely fascinating about it is how often you can find people there pillorying conservatives for doing the exact same things that they themselves do.<br><br>A sort of diary that regularly pops up on the blog is of someone going to a conservative blog or news site, finding some sort of silly or irrational behavior or argument, and posting it for group mockery. Many commenters then pat themselves on the back, noting how much more reasonable, logical, realistic and fair they are than their conservative counterparts.<br><br>Of course, the hilarious (and depressing) part is that for every one of those diaries casting stones upon conservative behavior, you can easily find numerous examples of the exact same behavior reflected through a liberal prism on that very site. It's all the same behavior; it's just the terms and signals that are different.<br><br>Of course, I could see that far, far better once I was able to distance myself from my emotional investments in the political scene being discussed. At that point, the parallels became obvious and glaring.<br><br>(continued below . . . )<br><br><a href=#c3973536963821367637 title="comment permalink">12/20/12, 9:17 AM</a><br><br>

There, too, the phatic communication becomes evident. I remember posting a diary once about raw milk--which is a very contentious issue, oddly enough. It was pro-raw milk, but it was more in the vein of me writing about why I'll pay extra for raw milk as opposed to regular milk, looking more than anything at the system behind the production of raw milk in comparison to pasteurized milk and what that supports (such as small farms, local communities, care and individuality.) A number of people there wanted my head for arguing in favor of raw milk and believed me an anti-science nut attempting to get others killed. Another group proclaimed my support the gospel truth and argued vociferously against pasteurization and large, industrial dairies. Both sides grouped together and mostly clung to a set of arguments that they wrote over and over again in increasingly exasperated textual tones. I attempted to respond reasonably to both sides, though I did at times slip into the pro-raw milk group, seeing as I do have strong opinions on the issue. Still, it was fascinating to see the same talking points coming from different people, the intractability, the my-life-depends-on-this nature of the arguments. Everyone talked past each other and few people attempted to find common ground. In fact, common ground seemed almost a blasphemy, as though ceding <em>any</em> agreement was a moral failing.<br><br>And all about raw milk! I mean, this hardly seems the greatest issue facing us. But what I find so fascinating--especially in the context of your post--is the different ways you can see this phatic communication taking place. There's the macro of liberal against conservative and then there's the micro of disagreements within the liberal world. But they all take on the same form and sets of behavior, and they're repeated on both sides. Occasionally someone may try to break in with an attempt at critical thinking and actual discussions, but it mostly boils down to finding your group and your argument and sticking with it, no matter what anyone else says.<br><br>I've been guilty of it myself far more often than I care to say. I thank you for the last few posts, as they've provided me a number of tools to apply to my own communication behaviors. I'm going to be far more aware of my own phatic communication tendencies from here on out.<br><br>Joel<br><br>P.S. Last week, I mentioned picking up an abridged version of Toynbee's A Study of History. As you inquired, it is indeed the 1972 illustrated edition. Glad to hear you like it.

I wasn't always comfortable as meeting chair - it did sometimes involve reining in members who wanted to monopolize the time, a process I found emotionally draining - but I got better over time at that aspect as well. I also did my best to identify and train a replacement for me, and she's doing a very good job, I think better than I did.<br><br>Oddly, even though I'm quite introverted, I have always enjoyed speaking in public and crafting an effective presentation.

My father is a conservative Republican and I am a reluctant liberal Democrat. (I'd rather be something like a communitarian socialist, but that isn't really an option in our system.) When I was young, my father and I used to throw phatic fuzzies and pricklies at each other until we both cut off communication angry and frustrated. Eventually, we came to see that that kind of exchange was fruitless and actually quite boring. Recently, we have been able to engage in something like dialectics. We agree on things like the importance of community building, the problems with some aspects of popular culture, and the nefarious influence of money in politics (though he thinks it is mainly union money that is harmful while I think it is mainly rich people's money that is harmful). However, we always reach a point where we cannot agree because we have fundamentally different values. He believes that there is no acceptable role for any unit of government beyond policing, judiciary, and military functions. He believes that the United States should dominate the world militarily. Economically, he believes that every family should be completely self-reliant and should even be allowed to starve to death if they can't support themselves, though he has no problem with private charity. He feels that any contribution to another's well-being should be voluntary. By contrast, I believe that government's primary responsibility is for the well-being of its people, including their economic well-being (though I do think that government serves people better by assuring that there are useful jobs for them than by giving them handouts if they're able-bodied). I believe in minimizing government's military ambit to protecting its citizens from attack on their own territory and that government should not try to project military power globally. So on these fairly fundamental points, my father and I disagree. I don't see a way for dialectic to get around such fundamental disagreements about values.<br><br><a href=#c8347481721423852961 title="comment permalink">12/20/12, 9:50 AM</a><br><br>

Only “educated” people were elected in the halls of power, and education in those days meant the trivium. This, along with a certain sense of <i>noblesse oblige</i> among the elite, meant that at the end of the day politicians of both stripes ended up in compromises that are all but impossible to imagine today. How many times have we heard about the death of “civility” among our two warring parties, and how recent it is? Rather than “educated” men in the halls of power today (it is representative democracy, after all), political paymasters have instead funded radical Jacobins with no such training who brook no compromise and see politics merely as war by other means. They are backed by a massive propaganda apparatus modeled, ironically enough, on those the left had initially developed, and co-opted by authoritarian movements in Europe.<br><br>As to the sad state of affairs described above, there is no space here to discuss the death of the trivium and its devolution into today’s public “schools” designed to churn out a passive obedient, homogenous consumer “product” designed for rote industrial work based on the Prussian model rather than thoughtful, individualized citizens. Readers who are not already familiar with John Taylor Gatto or Gene Odening are encouraged to use the Google machine to find out more. I suspect the trivium may make its appearance on this blog in due course.<br><br>But the fundamental question is <i>cui bono</i>, who benefits from this state of affairs? Who benefits from each side split into its own warring camps immersing themselves in confirmation bias where not even basic facts are agreed upon? I would suggest it benefits those with the most control over the means of information, and that is the corporate right. I would also posit that this is the real source of their success – being able to control the cognitive mindspace of the public and squelch alternatives as “unrealistic”, even alternatives which once existed in practice (such as the economy before neoliberalism). Please note, the “war on Christmas” is entirely a creation of Fox News. I suspect much of what considers itself the “left” is also controlled from this same source.<br><br>It is the foundation of modern advertising to associate products with emotional states. This was further developed by people like Edward Bernays who created the “science” of public relations. This is now how all politics in America is conducted – who is the better emotional manipulator, perfect for a nation of “consumers.” I advise you to watch campaign films available on YouTube, preferably with the sound off, to see this in action.<br><br>Happy Festivus and <a href=%E2%80%9D rel=nofollow>Merry Krampustide</a> to all!<br><br><a href=#c1900166173684452486 title="comment permalink">12/20/12, 10:02 AM</a><br><br>

"Political debate" amounts to repeating talking points gleaned from one media source or another.

I started with The Wealth of Nations (a Harvard Classics edition, as it happens), and I worked my way through Marx (who I'd rejected entirely before) and Keynes, Von Mises and Bohm-Bawerk and Murray Rothbard. I read Lenin's "Imperialism" and Kropotkin's "Fields, Factories, and Workshops" side by side (they both propose communist alternatives in light of the development of monopoly capital at the end of the 19th century, but those alternatives are as different as night and day) and Hayek's Road to Serfdom for good measure. (Reading two authors that disagree with each other at the same time is something I highly recommend, by the way.) <br><br>The result is that I get the Cold Pricklies less, and I can more easily sit with different views. But I still regularly fall back into the mental trap of only reading things I agree with. I have to regularly force myself to go and find different perspectives, and to sit with them, rather than hurling magic words at them. <br><br>This post is becoming overlong, but one last thing: I mentioned the Occupy movement; I've also participated in a number of other activist groups and movements that apply "consensus." And I want to thank you for your criticisms of it. In my experience, the whole thing amounts to a big mask for what's really going on, which is a hierarchy structured basically like the nastiest clique in a high school. This may explain why activist movements on the left are almost always dominated by people between the ages of 18 and 24...<br><br><a href=#c4274283921955833339 title="comment permalink">12/20/12, 12:23 PM</a><br><br>

One of my wife's great-great-grandfathers, Benjamin Randall Jordan, spent his life farming and doing small odd jobs a rustic town (Newfield) in Southwest Maine during the first half of the 1800's. He had less than three years of formal schooling in the town schools: reading, writing and arithmetic through the rule of four. Nonetheless, he was a clear and logical thinker, with a good command of verbal persuasion. He was also a competent poet, who was once even payed good money by another poet (one Thomas Randall) to prepare the latter's work for publication in the 1830s. We still have BRJ's library, his handwritten volumes of poetry and thoughtful essays, and the chronicle he wrote of his life. They strike me as more thoughtful and better written than many of the undergraduate essays I had to read and grade during my academic life. <br><br>You could argue, if you like, that these facts prove he was not an "average man," despite his lack of education.

As a software developer for half a century, I've spent much of my professional life in meetings, mostly with small teams needing to decide what to do and/or how to do it. In such cases, a 60% majority overruling a 40% minority would indicate an unresolved issue and a threat to the result of the project -- whatever the outcome, we all not only had to live with it, but to contribute to making it a success.<br><br>In my more recent experience with a local neighborhood council, we do follow Roberts (sometimes awkwardly), and do vote on motions that represents the council's position on an issue or action to be taken. Most of the dialogue leading up to a typical vote, however, has a consensus-seeking character, and we do get unanimity fairly often. (Of course, some of Los Angeles' neighborhood councils have a rougher time, especially in neighborhoods that have deep divisions among groups. All too often in such cases, whatever process is supposed to be used gets badly corrupted.)<br><br>I should add that I'm using "consensus" in a fairly colloquial sense. If you dig below the fuzzy/prickly (delete whichever is inapplicable) connotation of the word, you find a robust topic, worth considerable exploring. Wikipedia has a healthy article (and talk page) on "Consensus decision-making", as well as one on the way it's understood and used there (Wikipedia:Consensus).<br><br>Generally, the conversations I've had with NC activists (and earlier, with my fellow software team members) have been largely free of the kind of degraded discourse described in this post. I attribute that at least in part to the large shared area of concerns, and the explicit and implicit commitments to accomplishing shared goals. I've done some reading into the work on "common pool resources" by Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues, and I have the impression that a similar dynamic has operated in those stakeholder-managed commons that have survived for centuries.<br><br>Based on that, I'd guess that the best situations to "plant the seeds" of effective group processes would be in places and among groups where managing a common resource over long periods of time is critical to survival. (Examples: watersheds, soils, local roads.)<br><br>@Jason: thanks for the pointer to William Irwin Thompson; I've been enjoying his essays (and those of his Lindisfarne colleagues), especially his explorations of the intersection between science and spirituality. One good takeaway I've already gotten is his reference to Jean Gebser's treatment of efficient and deficient manifestations.<br><br><a href=#c369921760417931767 title="comment permalink">12/20/12, 6:50 PM</a><br><br>

I'm coming from what’s probably a different perspective: reading bell hooks, Paolo Freire, Parker Palmer, to about critical thinking skills in a community context, and build democracy out of that.<br> <br>It’s interesting (as usual) reading your definition of an aspect of the predicament. I previously thought that the definition of rhetoric was 'a set of manipulative tools to essentially conceal the substance of speech', similar to what you call thaumaturgy. With a different understanding, I can learn more about rhetoric.<br><br>Since I'm commenting, I hope you will be encouraged to hear that the compost heap is repelling the frost nicely, the community food-growing group have secured access to an acre of good land with a secure lockup tool store and kitchen space, a small group of friends meet to sew using a treadle machine, and my studies in bringing science home are proceeding via soap-making using my novice slide rule skills. The recent discovery of a beautiful early C20th microscope that I may get the use of is an exciting development (my professional background is in microbiology).<br><br>Coincidentally, recently I have begun studying dialectics, because I observed an excess of hostility and point-scoring in public discourse. That contrasts sharply with the sincere search for truth in company with others of different opinions, which I only recently learned is, as you state, the platonic definition of dialectics. I wonder if attending with an agenda of watching for logical errors and attempting to facilitate good thinking might provide me with the fortitude to bear the mixture of tedium and hostility in local public meetings. Perhaps I need to practice my democratic skills in the small food-growing group for a few more years before I can attempt larger public meetings again.<br><br><a href=#c6514420177023748167 title="comment permalink">12/20/12, 10:02 PM</a><br><br>

I got to the point of being able to do it deliberately, and with relish, only after a lot of practice and some serious training in magic. <br><br>John, the problem there is that the privileged upper middle and middle classes are now using the 1% mantra as a thoughtstopper to justify their own extravagant lifestyles. I've literally had people ask me why they should give up their SUVs when the very rich have luxury yachts, etc. <br><br>Dan, yes, I thought I'd get at least one hissy fit from the left, complete with several good examples of the arbitrary identification of verbal noises with cold pricklies I've been talking about. That phrase "false moderation," by the way, in plain English means "how dare you point out that I'm doing the same things as the people I hate?"<br><br>Richard, again, I'm not aiming for the near term. The goal is to keep the elements of functional democracy going in the hands of those few who value them, until the rubble stops bouncing a bit and new possibilities open up. <br><br>Justin, never blame on conspiracy what can be quite adequately explained by stupidity. <br><br>Ganv, that's a good point. Positivism itself did a lot of erasure of meaning, since its quest for precision ended up excluding a lot of unquantifiable but real human experiences. Still, as a survivor of a university with a bad case of postmodernism -- I still tend to think of deconstruction as what jackals do to dead lions -- I'm not going to dispute the role played by postmodernist cant in all this. <br><br>Joel, excellent! You get tonight's gold star; the key to all of this is the ability, not to mention the willingness, to apply these points to one's own thinking and speech. <br><br>Loch Wade, I'd disagree on both points. First, there's a lot more overlap between one human reality and another than you've suggested -- and I say this as someone who's been married to the same woman for 28 years; second, the unraveling of our political and religious institutions is proceeding at a pace that, as far as I can see, makes any but the most temporary of gulags a forlorn hope of would-be tyrants. Chaos rather than totalitarian control is far and away the more likely endpoint of the current trajectory. <br><br>SLClaire, exactly! I've had the same experience: groups run on a consensus basis either dissolved in endless bickering or had a covert hierarchy that could not be held accountable for its actions; groups run by democratic process tended to get things done.<br><br><a href=#c8868015373139090958 title="comment permalink">12/20/12, 10:06 PM</a><br><br>

As often as not, it reveals core differences of values that cannot be reconciled. By doing that, though, it allows the participants to figure out what common ground they do have, and that in turn allows whatever projects appeal to both to be pursued jointly without constantly being slammed back into the same disagreements. <br><br>Alex, do you expect television to be gone 20 years from now? I wish I was so optimistic. <br><br>Escape, yes, we'll be talking about the trivium in due time. As for the rest, again, I'm loath to credit to conspiracy what can be more than adequately explained by stupidity. <br><br>Maria, too funny! <br><br>Elsie, I haven't had a television in the house in my adult life. That's given me hours a day to do more useful things, and I suspect it's also contributed to my emotional balance. That is to say, I think you have a point. <br><br>Vera, no argument with your latter point. As for the former, if a meeting's run according to democratic process, the chairperson isn't in a position of power -- he or she serves at the will of the meeting and can be deposed by vote if he or she gets out of line. <br><br>Sgage, that's still my favorite cartoon about the 2012 follies. <br><br>Justin, excellent! I'll have much more to say about the seven liberal arts, and possible redefinitions thereof, in a future series of posts. <br><br>Robo, that's a bleakly accurate description. In response, I recall the way a bunch of my friends and I would sneak away from the mandatory pep rallies in high school, hang out in the room where the debate club met, and find more interesting things to do with our time. It didn't stop the mindless yelling, but at least we didn't have to sit there and wait for it to finish. <br><br>Steve, okay, I don't usually award two gold stars in a single night, but I'm going to make an exception. Piling into the books to figure out what's going on behind the sound bites is a response I wish I saw much more often. As for the resemblance between consensus-run groups and high school cliques, you're spot on; the actual effect of current consensus methods is that they make it impossible to discuss, or rein in, the hierarchies that inevitably develop.<br><br><a href=#c452866576495487554 title="comment permalink">12/20/12, 10:21 PM</a><br><br>

The previous incumbent had been up to quite a bit of mischief some of which was illegal - but that is another story.<br><br>Anyway, I commenced my role as a healer establishing systems, routines, responsibilities and boundaries. This worked for a while until the inevitable tensions - and feelings of hurt - surfaced not too long afterwards.<br><br>At this point, I switched tactics, faced them all down and within hours identified the ringleader of my opposition - who incidentally was also the most obstreperous - and then publicly walked that person from the office. I then split the office into two functional areas and nominated two assistants (i.e. lieutenants) to supervise the remaining staff and then never had another days trouble.<br><br>What the above example is trying to illustrate is that the major entities within our society (corporations, military, religious etc.) are not democratic institutions, they are in fact hierarchical. These are currently effective entities too, on many different levels.<br><br>Given the sheer influence these entities all have on the day to day structure and thought within our society, it is impressive that we have as an effective level of democracy as we currently enjoy.<br><br>This point seems glaringly obvious to me, but it is rarely addressed or discussed in public. Those entities are given license to operate within and for the benefit of society, but I would suggest that in some respects they have abused that license.<br><br>Thought provoking stuff.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c9165456680887623032 title="comment permalink">12/21/12, 3:10 AM</a><br><br>

But I don't think escaping this state is so simple as some return to a rational democratic past (which I think for the most part is utterly mythical, which I can get into later). <br><br>What, after all, is this implicit proper approach to, and degree of, phatic communication? Who is the "we," necessary to all political conversation, that is being invoked here? And why? So far it seems like you are addressing American citizens who have "warm fuzzies" for "democracy" and "the USA." <br><br>Even if that's not the case, I think this framework is ossified in a fully and exclusively Western, even (as another commenter pointed out) Anglo-centric discourse, based on the historical ground and vocabulary. This is not to my tastes, and I have to wonder about it, especially considering the troublesome fact that soldiers under banners of "democracy" have eradicated a number of peoples substantially freer and more "democratic" than they were.<br><br>I could be mistaken on your notion of "we" so I'm looking for some clarification. You seem to be lukewarm toward left-wing radicalism-- but, and here's where my stance comes in-- abandoning its explicit internationalism (and anti-nationalism) is unequivocally tossing the baby out with the bathwater. Please, let's allow our obsession with kinship and colored flags die where it should have died: in the trenches of the Somme.<br><br>Looking forward to elaborating a fruitful dissensus.<br><br>- 'Awad<br><br><a href=#c7925336954851315113 title="comment permalink">12/21/12, 3:37 AM</a><br><br>

However, there are obstacles. <br>Perhaps the greatest erosion of former skills has been caused by the invention of TV and the development of advertising, aka, propaganda.<br>What advertisers discovered was that appeals to emotions, prejudice, primitive urges, tastes and other facets of the reptilian brain are much more effective than appeals to facilities housed in the cerebral cortex. Given that most voters are now appealed to on TV, those methods used to sell deodorant and toothpaste are now also being used to sell political ideas. <br>It seems to me that unless TV and by extension, new internet media go away, old fashioned reasoned discourse does not stand much of a chance.<br>But even so, reasoned discourse can be had only in an environment where we all hold some amount of shared premises.

Also, adding to what Robert said in reply to escapefromwisconsin, I offer an excerpt from Bill Holm's most excellent essay, "The Music of Failure," the whole of which I highly recommend (apologies for the lack of tags):<br><br>They accumulated no coffee cans full of bank notes, no hidden treasure, nothing of any genuine monetary value; the Bardals were in that regard truly poor. But not poor in mind and spirit! They owned books in three or four languages: Plato, Homer, Bjornson in Norwegian, Snorri Sturlusson in Icelandic, Whitman, Darwin, Dickens, Ingersoll, Elbert Hubbard; piles of scores by Handel, Bach, Mozart, George Beverly Shea, and Björgvin Guðmundsson, old cylinders of Caruso, Galla-Curci, Schumann-Heink, John McCormack; cheap books reproducing paintings and sculpture from great European museums. There was an organ, a piano, violin, and trumpet; manuals for gardening, cooking, and home remedies; the best magazines of political commentary and art criticism next to Capper's Farmer; the Minneota Mascot, and the Plain Truth; dictionaries and grammar books in three or four languages; books of scientific marvels, Richard Burton's travel adventures, old text books for speech and mathematics, Bibles and hymn books in every Scandinavian language; Faust, Reader's Digest, and Sweet Hour of Prayer. That tiny house was a space ship stocked to leave the planet after collecting the best we have done for each other for the last four thousand years of human consciousness....What one realized with genuine astonishment was that the Bardals piled this extraordinary junk not only inside their cramped house; that house was a metaphor for their interior life that they stocked with the greatest beauty and intelligence they understood. They read the books, played the instruments, carried the contents of that house in their heads, and took it with them at last into their neat row in the Lincoln County graveyard.<br><br><br>The family Bill is remembering emigrated from Iceland to rural Minnesota in 1880. Few could aspire even to high school in that region in those days--my adoptive mother, for instance, wanted very much to go but couldn't because it meant boarding in town, which meant money, which the family didn't have in the depths of the Depression. Yet, I suspect the Bardals' interest in matters of mind and spirit were not unique in their day. For one thing, when a large percentage of your recreation is talking with other people, it really does help if you have something to talk about; the weather, the crops and the children will only get you so far.<br><br><a href=#c7171368556339737055 title="comment permalink">12/21/12, 9:29 AM</a><br><br>

Mam Gaia reminded us who's in charge last night but (most of) the trees are still standing (the weak ones already got blown over this year.)<br>Second, I'm no friend of consensus myself, but recently encountered an interesting counterexample in the work <i>In the Absence of the Sacred</i> by Jerry Mander. (Which I read on the recommendation of someone on this blog - perhaps yourself(?)) He describes a council in the Haudenosaunee ("Iroquois") confederation that is run by consensus, and frequently takes days or even weeks to come to a decision. This does not matter all that much, though, since the society is so conservative that the underlying assumption is that <i>nothing needs to change</i>. I.e., proposals which incorporate change are few and far between.<br>Another method I've seen used occasionally is one in which members of a meeting can also state <i>how much</i> they care one way or another. Sometimes it works: for instance, when compiling the platform of a political party or campaign there are many issues about which I would vote one way but not really care all that much. If others care a lot and the vote is close (and if the people who care have studied the issue), I'm happy to let it go the other way. It is, however, easy for this to get abused.<br><br><a href=#c3852171091707691062 title="comment permalink">12/21/12, 1:17 PM</a><br><br>

Public speaking skills will return when there is a forum or context where they actually matter. If we had a participatory democracy, where we had to understand the issues in our community in order to run it, then we would figure out how to talk and to listen. And we'd do that pretty quickly. People are smart. As it is, there is no reason to do laps around the Toastmasters track, so for the most part people are not going to.<br><br>I also think that your simple preference for representational, committee-style democracy over consensus-based institutions is simplistic. I acknowledge that consensus does not work well for large groups, but rule by committee has its own problems, mostly relating to lack of flexibility and a tendency to lose dynamism. In the context of the Occupy movement, there are some good reasons that rule-by-committee would not be a good option: 1) Who gets to vote for committee members? No-one knows who is and is not a member of the movement, and in fact its membership was changing rapidly. 2) Centralized leadership makes an oppositional movement vulnerable to decapitation and/or corruption. 3) A big part of the reason for Occupy was not really to accomplish some set of practical objectives (i.e. sit in a certain park), but just to get people out of their living rooms and to recognize themselves and each other as the people who should be running the country. 4) If the movement ever did overthrow the existing system, the committee would instantly become the new Communist Party, which was clearly considered an undesirable outcome.<br><br>My preference is for organization based on small units (neighborhoods, cells, etc) which do operate by something approaching consensus. These units can then ally and cooperate voluntarily within larger movements or governments when desirable. Occupy had the right idea in having each city's Occupy exist as an independent but allied institution which could follow its own desires. It just should have followed this direction even further.<br><br><a href=#c7991734346472374125 title="comment permalink">12/21/12, 3:23 PM</a><br><br>

As recent high school graduate (going to university soon) socialist Indian living in NZ, I find your blog thoroughly interesting and eye-opening.<br><br>Many people here have talked about the reluctance of even intelligent people in discussing politics. I have encountered similar responses from many of my classmates. In my opinion dialectic thinking and discourse starts from school. I am very grateful to the education system here for fostering such important skills, supplemented by my time in schools debating. I find that people respond the same way to me as some others have described: "I don't get why what you're bringing up is important to me" or "don't wind him up again."<br><br>In regards to the warm fuzzies and cold pricklies, I have seen that it is an endemic problem with most on the left as well as the right. Thus I have a thorough distaste for many of the marxists I follow on Tumblr. I have found that in reality there is no-one with whom I can totally agree with. Nevertheless, dialetic discourse has led me to have discussions with many on the far-right too.<br><br>In my time serving on many committees and being a prefect I have realised that there are some very distinct types of personalities that tend to control or hinder any public discourse. However high-school politics here, like everywhere else in the world, revolves around a personality cult. It is really fascinating to see that regional and national politics are in a way a direct imitation of the flawed system I was a part of in school. The school curriculum here is changing quickly to copy the failed model of the US. In a way I might be from one of the last batches to learn some of the key thinking skills that have kept the NZ education system near the top of international rankings.<br><br>Another interesting point you brought up was the fact that not all forms of democracy are entirely compatible everywhere. I think the failure of Indian democracy is due to the fact that the first Prime Minister (Nehru) tried to force a western model onto what was a very different type of country. Also recognizing that ancient India had its own democracies and its distinct way of thinking which were in some ways quite different from the west.<br><br>I find your blog gives the weekly reality check which is very important. I hope your engaging weekly articles continue, I have learnt a lot from them.<br><br>Happy Solstice!<br><br><br><a href=#c3889303760640269388 title="comment permalink">12/21/12, 5:06 PM</a><br><br>

Your article is excellent. Your paragraph about a democratic system is simple, which is how it should be.<br><br>I was wondering if you are aware of Participatory Budgeting? It started in Porto Alegre, Brazil, and now exists in over 1,000 cities in the world. The neighborhood I grew up in––Park Slope, Brooklyn––started doing this last year, and I've been part of the process this year.<br><br>There are obvious limitations, like the fact that the million dollars given to District 39 by its assemblyman can only be used on public infrastructure, and the Board of Education and Department of Transportation are not compliant. Also this is a somewhat idealized version of democracy, figuring out the grand direction society should take is not on the table for discussion. However, it is a great way of spending taxpayer money, and is an essential component in the democratization of society.<br><br>Two things I noticed that have made this process different from the one at Occupy Wall Street: <br><br>1) the process is almost completely intellectual. Nobody gave riveting speeches. And most of all, there were no twinkle fingers in order to display one's "warm fuzzy" and "cold prickly" feelings. Experiencing this made me realize how much the OWS process was designed to instill group-think. In District 39's PB, we broke down into groups, compiled lists of potential projects, and very quickly read these out loud to the entire assembly. It was up to each person to think about each proposal, and decide, over the course of six months, what they want to vote on.<br><br>2) My hatred for facilitators vanished. The facilitators were people who were not from the district, and while not uninterested, were thus disinterested. They made things run incredibly smoothly. The meeting was an hour and a half, with a half-hour dedicated to giving the participants a background with PB. Over 100 people were there. Every single person made suggestions for potential projects. We were all home by 9pm.<br><br>There is a great book on the history of Participatory Budgeting: Militants and Citizens by Gianpaolo Baiocchi. I will hopefully be writing my masters thesis on Brooklyn's Participatory Budgeting next year.<br><br>As I've said before, democracy marks the end of dialog, the synthesis to the dialectic when an agreement cannot be made and things need to get done. Therefore, democracy without dialog and dialectic is as worthless as dialog and dialectic without democracy. Occupy Wall Street did a great job at creating a "town square" where an incredibly variety of people came to have political discussions. That wonderful atmosphere, however, was almost completely wasted by the insistence on the consensus method by the leaders of that oh so leaderless movement.<br><br>Keep up the good work,<br>Fritz<br><br><a href=#c2224450828410540314 title="comment permalink">12/21/12, 5:52 PM</a><br><br>

Therefore, establishing membership in the group is more important that the nominal goals of the group.<br>In many parts of the world, many people are shifting their identity to smaller units. In Europe and the former Soviet Union, people are turning to regional identities that had been subsumed within a nation-state. Right now, this is happening in Scotland and Catalonia for example. <br>But in the US, such regional identities have less strength. So perhaps identifying with a political philosophy is more about having a smaller, more familiar, more reliable identity that the national one. That would also explain why both sides support groups that so often lose on their behalf. <br>Yes, the NRA may have been more successful than climate change groups, but conservatives have also lost the battles against abortion, gay marriage (and homosexuality more generally), and secularization. <br>What I can not explain is why this rise of smaller-size identities has not resulted in more overt Southern or New England or Texas regionalism.<br><br>About US education: Yes, the capacity to think for oneself is less developed, but certain technical kinds of functions are quite highly developed. One reason for this is that universities have changed from being oases of alteratives to corporate culture into being functions within corporate culture. As the source of profit has shifted from things to knowledge, knowledge production (in a very broad sense) has been integrated more thoroughly. <br>On top of that, knowledge production has been integrated within the old thing-production system. The result is that knowledge production is more about creating opportunities to extract rents and less about useful information.<br>This also helps explain much that is twisted about left-wing politics, because it is knowledge producers, with their contradictory position in the social structure, who dominate the left now.<br><br>About dissensus: Wow. Thank you for this. This is so useful.<br>The concept of producing democracy and consuming it is very powerful too.<br><br><br><a href=#c8204024253946766013 title="comment permalink">12/22/12, 2:37 AM</a><br><br>

Another commenter (“elsiereally”) then responded (to paraphrase) that this lack of interest in politics and world events may be a defence mechanism against engaging with issues that are presented in the darkest possible light by the media on television and so on as a means of avoiding depression and other unpleasant feelings. I agree that television is a toxic influence and that some people may become depressed paying too much attention to the mainstream news and therefore must avoid it to prevent an exacerbation of their depression. However, I do not accept this as a universal explanation for the widespread disinterest shown in politics and world events including by people who should be more than intelligent enough to have at least somewhat of an understanding of these matters. Rather, I would point to personality factors such as callousness, selfishness and outright narcissism and even psychopathy in explaining this. <br><br>To expand on the anecdote I told in my first comment, that person did not seem particularly depressed or vulnerable to depression. What she did seem to be, though, was determined to preserve her happy, shallow and convenient worldview at all costs. Yes, this is an anecdote but it speaks to the fact that one cannot simply point to depression or debased thinking to explain a disinterest in politics and world events; rather one must also look to a debased morality to understand this. To provide some more anecdotal evidence I have come across people who do actually pay attention to and understand politics and world events but are still as callous and selfish about these matters as someone who does not understand them. <br><br>Moving from anecdotal to some empirical evidence, there is evidence to suggest that there is a growing prevalence of narcissism, especially among the young, which can obviously explain why so many people are simply too selfish to care about politics and world events even if they have an intellectual understanding of them. Given that the world (governments, corporations etc.) is largely run by psychopathic individuals and institutions, and that often bad behaviours are rewarded and good behaviours punished, this growing moral debasement, callousness and selfishness should surprise no one. Please do not make the mistake of assuming that intelligence and knowledge always give rise to morality and decency. I would assume that most people here would know that.<br><br><a href=#c4784103357359192756 title="comment permalink">12/22/12, 4:45 AM</a><br><br>

There are Pope's translation of the Iliad, Butler's Hudibras, Dryden and Congreave's translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses, each in two small volumes, printed with what must be 8- or 10-point type. There are William Ward's thorough and fairly dispassionate "A View of All Religions and the Religious Ceremonies of All Nations" (the last *half* of which is devoted to what the author calls "Pagan" religions), Goodrich's History of the U.S., Worcester's Dictionary, and so forth.

You make me evaluate my own actions as human being with your writings, and that is very rare reaction indeed. Thank you for that. My personal, humble opinion still is that religion is more important factor molding society than political system. Political system is born from deeper structure of society (mostly religion), not other way around. What kind of faith, that kind of society. Religion is the ultimate narrative that molds how people see universe. In the West, many have lost connection to any faith bigger than themselves, and just see how f***ed up western world is right now. Individualism is sure path to failure. Ideologies are just religions in disguise. They are making quite poor job, as they are stripped from any deeper, mystical view of the world. I have this deep belief that faithful shall prevail in the end of Age of Abundance, democracy can be nice ornament crowning it all, but not THE most important thing. <br>Anyway, to celebrate birthday of the Son, here is truly mystical song from 14th century, representing living mystical and religious tradition, unlike artificial constructs of modern paganism.

That's why consensus systems either have a covert hierarchy or tear themselves to pieces trying to establish one. The point of democracy isn't to eliminate the normal human tendency to define a pecking order -- it's to make the pecking order public, accountable, and less burdensome for those toward the lower end of it. <br><br>'Awad, it's not surprising that you'd find the nation-state unappealing; in the part of the world you're from, it's a late and artificial import. Where I'm from, it's an organic growth. This is one of the reasons that, as you noted, I'm addressing Americans primarily in these essays; having never lived in another country, I don't feel myself to be qualified to make proposals for the rest of the world (and the rest of the world has had far too many clueless Americans telling it what to do for too long, anyway). <br><br>Approliving, may I take that last sentence of yours, have a blacksmith put it on the business end of a branding iron, and apply it to the backsides of a great many people I know? <br><br>Wolfgang, that's why individuals and small groups need to cultivate reasoned thinking now, learn how it's done, and develop the degree of self-awareness that allows them to recognize when thoughtstopping gimmicks of the sort used by advertising and the like are being directed against them. <br><br>Cathy, I've grumbled quite a bit about Monbiot's more dubious thinking, but that essay's good. Many thanks for sharing it!<br><br>Dan, thanks for a very civil response. Here's your homework, if you will: find every phrase in your earlier comment that has no relevance to the point under discussion, and serves only to stir up negative emotional reactions. Here's an example -- your suggestion that I must be watching "O'Reilly Factor," which I assume is some kind of right wing TV show. If you've been reading this blog at all, you know that I haven't owned a TV in my adult life; thus the only purpose of that phrase was to establish an arbitrary linkage between the idea of mine you wished to denounce and a verbal noise ("O'Reilly Factor") that generates cold pricklies in those readers who share your set of emotional reactions. Now find the rest of them -- and when you write another comment, do the same exercise in advance, and delete all the phrases that do the same thing, as well as those that make linkages to irrelevant warm fuzzies. <br><br>Alex, I expect the major national grids to have suffered serious breakdowns by that time, but more local grids to have partially replaced them. As more Americans lose access to grid power, in turn, I foresee the coming of a new business model -- the TV cafe, where people can go sit around and watch television when they don't have power at home and can't afford a TV anyway. Eventually those will be limited to reruns and videos, but it'll be a while before the last of them flickers out. <br><br>Blackwings, many thanks for sharing this!<br><br><a href=#c7797619510678084436 title="comment permalink">12/22/12, 10:18 AM</a><br><br>

Quaker meetings are good at that, and so were many Native American peoples, the Haudenosaunee among them. Again, it's the manipulative pseudoconsensus methods used by so many of today's activists that are the problem, not consensus as a whole. <br><br>Bill, I was wondering about that as well. "Republicans With Attitude" was my best guess. <br><br>Renaissance, as I've pointed out repeatedly in this context, it was perfectly reasonable to worry about the Y2K bug in 1996 or so, when it was by no means certain that the necessary resources would be mobilized to fix things. It was no longer reasonable to insist that the world was going to crash in flames in the autumn of 1999, when every computer geek I knew in the greater Seattle area was buying a new car, house, or yacht on the proceeds of three years of overtime at sky-high wages fixing everybody's computer systems, and when people in the tech industry were quietly admitting to me that they were letting the hysteria roll on because it was just so lucrative to them.<br><br>Hal, if you're reading up on the Greek foundations of dialectic, you're way ahead of the game. Good for you. <br><br>Solomon, notice that your initial claim -- "if we had a participatory democracy...we would figure out how to talk and listen" -- puts the cart squarely before the horse. If we want to have a participatory democracy, we have to learn how to talk and listen first. It's the implied notion that somebody ought to give us a participatory democracy, and then of course we'll know how to use it, that's most of the problem. As for the rest, if that's what you want to try, by all means go out and try it -- but I'd remind you that the activist left has been doing the (pseudo-)consensus thing for decades now, and the results have been consistently bad. <br><br>Leo, they may be simple, but simple is not always the same thing as easy. <br><br>YJV, thank you! I expect to keep at this for the foreseeable future, for whatever that's worth. <br><br>Fritz, thanks for commenting! I've used your post several times in this blog, as it brings up some crucial points. I have nothing against facilitators as such, so long as they're not trying to force their own agenda on the group, and so long as the group has some means to replace a facilitator who abuses the position. As for participatory budgeting, I'll check it out as time permits. <br><br>Kieran, no argument there.

Extending that concept further, it is amazing that we have as an effective democratic process as we actually have. It also provides a glimpse - well I believe it to be the case - into why our democratic processes are withering away under the guise of culture wars which serve the purposes of some of those major entities.<br><br>Dunno, could be wrong, but I reckon there may be something in it.<br><br>Back here in peasant land though...

Strangely enough they asked me if I knew about the tree by GPS co-ordinates. I thought they were joking, but they were remarkably earnest, so I guess not. Ahh, the worlds between us! It looks like a plum tree and the fruit ripens about now and it has been there for years….<br><br>What becomes quite clear during these food preserving activities is just how far ahead you have to plan in terms of quantities, equipment, methods and storage. The industrial food system really simplifies the whole process for the majority of the population, but if you do it yourself, then you discover just how complex and vulnerable that Industrial system is!<br><br>The other thing that is interesting about it all is that you start to get a feel for how much you need to preserve for the future.

And this go to other readers as well whose feelings were hurt. I had no malign intention in my comment; writing with foreign language, sentences come out very blunt and seem to be more "extreme" than I mean. This has been pointed out to me earlier by persons who can follow discussions in my native language too; I sound harsher in English. I don't like harshness, so I feel little bit embarrassed now. <br><br>Paganism is very fascinating subject, and I have no problems with people following these modern forms of it. What I meant was that modern shamanism is quite young project, started with Thelema, Wicca and Adonism (and Franz Sättler) I guess..? After a hundred years from now, maybe you have rooted into world new religion, and with such nice subjects as organic gardening in roster that is not bad thing to happen. After all, Christianity was new religion also some millennia ago. With term "artificial" I just meant this newness and historic discontinuity I personally observe in neopagan movement. This newness has some consecuenses though. You guys are pioneers in new religion, in good and bad. Most self-proclaimed neopagans I have met have no deep internal belief, they have mostly political or other secular reasons for their worldview. So they don't really BELIEVE. But on the other hand, how many persons out of six-seven billion have I met? Very few. Animism and/or Tantric Buddhism of Eurasian Steppe is closest to old-school, organically growth paganism I have encountered, this being just my personal opinion. Those animist Buddhist rituals, and now I don't mean Richard Gere type of thing but buryats and mongols waiting for next Bogd Khan, they are quite scary. Visiting Seven Towers Temple in Hohhut; and afterwards listening western neopagans; you just notice huge difference between their views of shamanism. But like I said, what do I know? Very little indeed. So, to all good people, have a good solstice/Christmas/happy holidays and be careful out there!<br><br>By the way, I am not devout Christian. Just coming from very traditionalist background, and seen total hollowness of modern society, I actually have no idea what to believe right now. I just honour my ancestors by respecting their faith, because being loyal to your own is the most important thing in this chaotic circus we call planet Earth.<br><br><a href=#c328726346914243401 title="comment permalink">12/23/12, 3:09 AM</a><br><br>

Positive thinking is appreciating the good, be it be in a present situation or a possibe future outcome (regardless of its favourability). Positive thinking is closely related to constructive thinking, which is making the best out of the good, bad, and neutral aspects of any situation.<br>This distinction might be obvious to some (yourself included I'd imagine), but I reckon most people would regard "positive thinking" and "optimism" as synonymous. Because of this conflation, many people are both reluctant to get involved in civic life and too scared to comtemplate any future which doesn't involve progress.<br>The key point I'm trying to make here is that perhaps its possible to be positive and constructive about reviving democracy - or any other worthwhile endeavour - without setting one's heart on achieving a favourable outcome.<br><br><a href=#c7373672383027669602 title="comment permalink">12/23/12, 3:51 AM</a><br><br>

A collapse would wipe out most of the corporations, impoverish most of the audience, and severely reduce in numbers several target audiences i.e. the ill, the old, and the disabled (see daytime TV). There is no point to mass marketing if there is no mass market, and TV is expensive mass marketing, so TV will collapse along with the rest of the corporations as their markets and incomes shrivel. The small niche channels will go down with the big boys as they ride on the physical broadcasting infra-structure of the big media corporations<br><br>The business that will replace the national and global advertisers will be mostly local and regional, and due to energy constraints will not have the cash or the need for an expensive mass marketing industry i.e. TV. I see a revival in local radio and press as an efficient (cost effective) advertising medium. Internet advertising may go either way it depends upon whether the search engines survive.<br><br>I am using the term ‘collapse’ to signify a sharp/large contraction in complexity and energy use in a society, not a single step from space age to stone age, rather one of JMG’s step downs in the long descent.<br><br>Of cause I could be completely wrong! <br><br>State Socialist TV anyone!<br><br><br><br><a href=#c693512433392597958 title="comment permalink">12/23/12, 3:36 PM</a><br><br>

I actually thought I had good understanding of neopagan movement, and now I have to admit that was not the case. I aknowledged that umbrella term of neopaganism emerged in Europe during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, born from wider occult movement... Containing as separate sects as ariosophy and thelema. What I didn't know was that your religion, neodruidism reaches back as early as 1717. I also confused term shamanism to wide variety of different groups, probably because people communicating with drum and dance with supernatural world of Underside is what I am most familiar with. If you know what other person believes, you know vaguely how he/she thinks. So I am literally lost in the dark here, connecting you to wrong branch of historical tradition. My apologies for that. Still my original claim holds true: before tradition is solidly build, it's under construction and in state of constant flux. Only after equivalent of Nicaea/Chalcedon councils it is possible in any religion to be born inside edifice of faith; so that narrative is so strong you don't even recognize it, you just live by it. Word religio actually means proper performance of veneration, as you surely know; without agreed and stable structure there is no possibility of true religio. But of course, once the world of ideas has been transformed, reality cannot hold out for long. It is all about how people see the world; good and evil and purpose of existence always being created anew. Maybe some form of neopaganism can become one of few grand narratives in this world during forthcoming problems; maybe not. But it was fascinating to learn something new. After this I abstain from commenting your blog; English language is the weakest of three foreign languages I speak, and I have already caused ill-will and annoyance with my blunt use of it. Keep on writing this stuff, and I keep on reading it.<br><br>And even if synthesizer work in Stella Splendens was little out of place, that was not the point. Point was that song being part of direct line of tradition descending through 600 years. It is wonderful this kind of traditions can stay alive even in plastic, future-oriented West, where history is normally thrown to trashcan. In the Scythia it was possible to meet families counting their succession from voyevoda under taxation of Zolotaya Orda from 13th century onwards; it kind of gives you purpose in life, belonging to that kind of tradition. I have this feeling that belonging to something solid is going to be valued again in not so distant future.<br><br><a href=#c6561367168953131590 title="comment permalink">12/23/12, 4:59 PM</a><br><br>

I thought at the time I read your post that while you have an excellent vocabulary you may not have meant to offend.

I would imagine that selfish and destructive traits would not be adaptive in societies built around small communities with high levels of interdependence (e.g. hunter-gatherers). However, in our overpopulated modern societies such traits are unfortunately rewarded too often. This probably has something to do with our overpopulated societies being overly atomised, individualistic and competitive making such traits helpful in “getting ahead” and making it harder to hold people directly accountable for destructive and selfish behaviours, not to mention that often these traits are confused with confidence and other desirable traits. There would be many other factors as well. As for corporations given how dependent modern societies are upon them (e.g. we need petroleum, pharmaceuticals, financial credit etc.) it is unsurprising that corporations would be able to affect and influence society in many ways including through political contributions shaping policy, ownership of the mainstream media and by modelling psychopathic behaviours that tend to get rewarded which sets a bad example. Once again I am sure there are many other factors as well. <br><br>As for freedom I agree that this is a concept that is often misunderstood and abused. I think the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau was extremely insightful when he wrote that “the mere impulse of appetite is slavery, while obedience to a law which we prescribe to ourselves is liberty”. I found the book “The Freedom Paradox: Towards a Post-Secular Ethics” by Clive Hamilton (an Australian intellectual), which discussed freedom from this sort of a perspective, an interesting read.<br><br><a href=#c2463795443217584322 title="comment permalink">12/24/12, 5:08 PM</a><br><br>

My ex-wife would be happy to find out how extraordinaly strong-willed I am :). It is refreshing to find out that you CAN have conversation via internet between persons with widely different backgrounds, and keep it polite. Even if some mistakes are made, like I obviously did. I would like to understand how you think little bit more. Let's barter; I tell something about my worldview, and I hope to get answered. In my country we have this popular saying "vanhassa vara parempi", roughly translated as "older ways are better than new ones". Working system should never be changed; ideals brought to real world more often than not lead to massive bloodshed. What works in real world is the thing that has always worked in the real world. There is nothing new under the sun, and mankind has not evolved anywhere from where we have always been. Behind the border, in the Rus, this feeling of conservatism runs deep; liberal modernists are tiny minority of academic world. There are more Rus wishing heavenly czardom making comeback and leading nation once more as Third Rome, than people dreaming about liberal democracy. Eighty years of political experiment paid by blood sacrifices has kind of whipped this in: never trust anything new. I don't share this monarchist worldview, being Finn myself, but I respect reasoning behind it. What I share with them is deep suspicion towards liberalism and progressive ideology; I see them as utter failures when building stable society. All religions, all narratives that give some form to disturbingly formless world around us are artificial (?) constructs of human mind; time and age are best tests which of them truly works. When system is old, it means it has already survived and worked very long time, evolved organically to its current state. It actually works in this perfectly unperfect world of ours. Example from daily life: deeply traditionalist and religious couples I know tend to stick together, produce more children and raise them to be wellbehaving human beings. Liberal couples, agnostics (like me, unfortunately) and all kind of "progressives" tend to divorce more often. Small number of children they produce suffer more often than children in religious families from mental disturbances, rootlesness and simple bad behaviour. This is no insult towards anyone, just obsevation. Other model works in real world, other doesn't. It doesn't matter what ideological politruks of West say about it. Couple of hundreds years is shortest time even worth mentioning when testing endurance of some idea; everything else is just buzz of the fly in the ear of hearer. This is how I view time; I have deep suspicion of present time, I abhor the future being presented to us by liberal Western politicians and I trust and respect past. To me, Western generation of sixties and liberal discontinuity of tradition it represents is greatest tragedy that mankind has ever encountered.<br><br>Hoe do you view these things? How much you keep in touch with your extended family, are you for example ready to sacrifice your career choices to serve your parents if they are ill? Is there something greater in your life than illusionary satisfaction of animal instinct of self? Is future more important than past, and how you evaluate what works and what works not in society? These questions are indeed very nice Christmas present, but that is the way I am, always so light-hearted...<br><br><a href=#c5398415795882103417 title="comment permalink">12/24/12, 11:20 PM</a><br><br>

I may well have overreacted; it's just that it's very common for Christians to use the kind of language you did as a casual put-down. As for the modern Pagan movement, more on this in response to your later comment below. <br><br>Cox, your best bet these days is to Google the following search string...<br><br>how to run a meeting roberts rules<br><br>..and then read half a dozen of the web pages that offer an easy introduction to the process. You can get a good basic rundown on democratic process that way, and then proceed. I learned the process by way of fraternal orders, and haven't yet had time to go looking to see what's available in print. <br><br>Approliving, excellent! Yes, that's a crucial difference. It's the difference between hope and a sense of entitlement, in effect. <br><br>Liquid, funny! I'm not a great fan of synthesizers either, for what it's worth. <br><br>Hal, you're not the only one who finds Jim's endless cracks about Nascar fans and Cheez Doodles wearing, for what it's worth. I think you're quite right that the South has a better chance of coming through this with intact social systems than most other parts of the country -- and it's a source of some amusement to me to note the reaction of people in the leftward end of the peak oil scene to the thought that they're not the only ones who might relocalize!<br><br>Anselmo, er, did you read the post before this one? I covered that point in some detail there. <br><br>Beren, whether it's a sudden discontinuity or a slower unraveling, the production of new TV programs will doubtless come to an end for exactly the reason you've suggested: if it can't pay its way, it won't happen. Still, I suspect that there'll be a lag time, possibly an extensive one, in which recorded shows, videos, etc. are still available to those who have the electricity and the TV to use it. <br><br>Juhana, it's a mistake to assume that the paradigm of Christian history can be applied across the board. Most other religions never saw a point in having an equivalent of the councils of Nicaea and Chalcedon, and remained far more flexible and open to new ideas long after the initial phase was over. Druidry's a good example. Our formative phase was mostly in the 18th century, though it drew on older movements rooted in the pagan revival of the Renaissance; by the early 19th century, much of our core philosophical and ritual material was in place; yet the movement has continued to enrich its body of practices and teachings all along, and we're seeing quite a bit of new ground being covered (as well as a very respectable upsurge in active membership) in recent years. There will never be a Druid Nicene Council, because dissensus is a core value of the tradition and we've learned to provide ample room for our visionaries and innovators, as well as those who preserve and transmit the core materials of the past. <br><br>Glenn, funny. <br><br>Cherokee, why not incorporate them into the imagery? Tiger the Christmas Shark is Santa's inseparable companion; when children are good, they get toys from Santa, and when children are really awful, Tiger the Christmas Shark eats them. He's the Down Under equivalent of Krampus, the devil who goes around with St. Nick in central Europe, and whips naughty children with a birch switch.<br><br><a href=#c6394336406501008840 title="comment permalink">12/25/12, 3:28 PM</a><br><br>

Union bylaws can give rank and file members a lot of influence or almost none when it comes to choosing their officers, choosing their shop stewards, deciding how their dues will be spent, choosing whether to go on strike, and conducting and settling strikes. Setting aside instances of outright corruption, in some unions ordinary members have a say in those important decisions. In others, indirectly elected regional or national officers ("union bosses") or unelected staff make all or most of those decisions in a paternalistic way.<br><br>The relationship between organized labor and the American leftists is estranged for a variety of historical reasons. Among them:<br><br>1. Sometimes the economic interests of the dues-paying members of a union are not the same as the interests of non-unionized workers or the working class as a whole.<br><br>2. Union members are not necessarily liberal in their political or social views. A large number of union members and at least one major union, the Teamsters, supported the Vietnam War when the entire Left opposed it. Unions have had a mixed record on racial and gender equality.<br><br>3. In the 1930s and 1940s, many union activists were affiliated with socialist or communist political groups. In the 1950s and 1960s, the allegiance of those activists to the United States came under suspicion and most of them were purged from the unions. At the same time, President Eisenhower and the larger U.S. corporations made a deal with trade unions whereby union members would receive higher wages and benefits and job security in return for the unions giving up any say in achieving broader social goals.<br><br>4. Organized labor is a major and reliable donor and source of volunteer labor to the Democratic Party. Those leftists who see the Democrats as opponents rather than allies in achieving their goals see labor unions in the same light.<br><br><a href=#c9075530954706712668 title="comment permalink">12/25/12, 8:05 PM</a><br><br>

I am going to try open it with my quite humble logical capabilities during next days. And yes, you are right. System cannot become too inflexible. I personally believe that during forthcoming contraction most solutions will come from pre-industrial past; but I admit it is not going to be enough. We need fresh ideas also. It is one reason why I enjoy reading this blog; there are practical tips and new point-of-views to consider. To be such a dull, patriotic reactionary as me, I am surprisingly adaptive to learn new... If "new thing" is small, practical and comes with no high ideals. You just have to have some boundaries, eh?<br>And I am impressed: you actually know something about Finland. There was very big societal change in this country during late 50s/early 60s, breaking down our small-scale, labour-intensive and largely horse-powered agriculture, replacing it with agrobussiness. That change also flooded our small cities with rootless workers succumbing very often to alcoholism. My granparents were part of that migration from land to city. You see why I am such a conservative..? I have lived large part of my life some 30 kilometres away from border zone to Russia, and I probably am more connected to whereabouts of that big bear of East than most Finns. So I probably have soaked some conservatism from there too. But you had a good point in that. <br><br>Law of engineering: you should never change working system, without calculating all possible outcomes. All changes must be tried out little by little and carefully. It is all about control theory and about mathematics dealing with the behavior of dynamical systems with new inputs. I believe that society reacts similarly to changes as closed-loops systems, so we need feedback controllers for transfer functions... Sorry, my English is just not enough for that conversation. But yes, some changes are needed time to time, but they must be small and very, very anti-revolutionary. No grand experiments like globalism or mass immigration or socialism or fascism, thank you. We had culture revolution in sixties, and in large parts of Europe we are having this radical counter-revolution as reaction against it right now, especially in the East. Revolution leads to bloodshed, sooner or later, and now is later. Revolutionarism from right or left, from all political colours in general is scary and bad thing, and I am very, very phatic in that one.<br><br>I keep on trying that riddle!<br><br>@JMG:<br>It is good that apology was accepted. I am actually quite eager to learn little bit more about druidism. It was little shameful to be so ignorant, and still commenting. Reading tips would be nice, for further learning. But you understand, most neopagans I have heard about or met, well...they have quite heavy political leanings to certain directions. There is this this new, I would say surprisingly big and popular wave splashing around many Eastern European countries right now... You can imagine my feeling of cognitive dissonance when I found your blog through Oil Drum and tried to connect your paganism to this movement... Here is link for you, to estimate personally this blend of paganism/mystic orthodoxy (?). I suppose druidism has to engage into debates with these guys here in Europe in not so distant future. You are claiming same historical heritage, you just don't agree about contents. Paganism is not universalist, it is localist, and as such semi-nationalist with mystic leanings. Certain universalist morality of old-school Christianity (orthodoxy and papists of Rome) is blessing that is going to be missed when lost. You will see.<br>And to hammer point into less-gifted readers of your blog, I don't have any connection or enthusiasm to ideas represented in following link, just following my time... After all, I am following druidic blog also and sending JMG texts as links through internet regularly, and I am no follower of neodruidism either. <br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4HXDXTYzHE&amp;list=UUH7rhou6lExUiGDBuQLvmcQ&amp;index=5<br><br><br><br><a href=#c1775085568911934785 title="comment permalink">12/26/12, 12:57 PM</a><br><br>

I'll cop to "O'Reilly Factor" and "false moderation" as items of phatic communication. I'll also apologize for having used the phrase "misunderstood or misrepresented" as it's an unfair (and silly) rhetorical ploy.<br><br>One quick word in my defense: "Partisans believe X; therefore, X is false" is not a logically valid inference. One cannot conclude a proposition is false merely because some people may believe a proposition for bad reasons. This is what I had meant by "false moderation" but similar phrases are used heavily and much less equivocally by a great many liberal idealogues and so I shall try to find a better way to say this.<br><br>My father tends to be more "conservative" than I am in his political opinions but when I talk to him I find our superficially contradictory opinions are quite often based on very similar values. When we take the time to talk through issues on which we disagree we often find each other objecting to particular uses of language rather than having any sort of fundamental disagreements. This is to say I found more to agree with in your post than to disagree; I regret having emphasized the disagreement, especially on such small and tangential issues.<br><br><a href=#c1437960019362136490 title="comment permalink">12/26/12, 2:37 PM</a><br><br>
