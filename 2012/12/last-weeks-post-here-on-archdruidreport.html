<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week's post here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> attempted to raise a question that, as I see it, deserves much more discussion than it gets these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Most currently popular ways of trying to put pressure on the American political system presuppose that the politicians will pay attention if the people, or the activists who claim to speak in their name, simply make enough noise. The difficulty is that the activists, or for that matter the people, aren’t actually giving the politicians any reason to pay attention; they’re simply making noise, and the politicians have gotten increasingly confident that the noise can be ignored with impunity. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s what’s implied by saying that protest marches, petitions, letter-writing campaigns, and the like consume democracy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These standard modes of activism only work if the officials who make decisions have some reason to think that the activists can follow through with some more effective action, such as a serious challenge in the next election, if they’re ignored.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It’s those other actions that produce democracy or, in less metaphoric terms, convince elected officials that ignoring the activists could put their careers at risk. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What sets democracy apart from most other systems of government is that it gives citizens a peaceful way to make good on such threats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is a huge advantage, for the most pragmatic of reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In autocratic societies, where the populace has no way to get rid of inept officials short of revolution, a vast amount of administrative idiocy and incompetence goes unpunished. The notion that autocracies are by definition more competent than democracies is quite simply untrue; the annals of autocratic states such as <i>ancien r<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>é</span>gime</i>
France and Communist Russia are packed with examples of the most egregious incompetence—and no, despite the slogans, Mussolini didn’t make the trains run on time, either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s simply easier to cover up governmental stupidity in an autocracy, since there aren’t media independent of government control to spread the word and embarrass the powers that be. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yet that advantage, again, depends on the ability of citizens to vote the rascals out when they deserve it. In today’s America, that ability is little more than theoretical these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve discussed in a number of posts already how what was once one of the world’s liveliest and most robust democratic systems has lapsed into a sham democracy uncomfortably reminiscent of the old Eastern Bloc states, where everyone had the right to vote for a preselected list of candidates who all support the same things. The reasons for that decay are complex, and again, I’ve talked about them in detail already. What I want to address this week is what might be done about it—and that requires a second look at the countervailing forces that were once hardwired into the grassroots level of the American system. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A thought experiment might help clarify the issues here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Imagine, dear reader, that early next year you hear that a couple of legislators and popular media figures in your state are talking about forming a new political party that will offer a meaningful alternative to the stalemate in Washington DC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The two major parties ignore them, but by early 2014 the new party is more or less in existence, and candidates under its banner are running for Congress and a range of state offices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The morning after the 2014 election, Republicans and Democrats across the nation wake up to discover that they are going to have to deal with a significant third-party presence in Congress and a handful of state governments controlled lock, stock and barrel by the new party. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The two years leading up to the 2016 election pass by in a flurry of political activity as the old parties struggle to regain their joint monopoly over the political process and the new party scrambles to build a national presence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 2016, the new party nominates its first presidential candidate, a longtime activist and public figure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The campaign faces an uphill fight, and loses heavily; some of the new party’s people in Congress and state governments are ousted as well. Pundits insist that it was all a flash in the pan, but they’re discomfited in the midterm elections in 2018 when the new party scores a major upset, winning a majority in the House of Representatives and nearly doubling its Senate presence. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The new party’s gains strain the existing structure of American partisan politics to the breaking point. As the 2020 election nears, the Democratic Party, outflanked and marginalized by the rising new party, disintegrates in internecine feuding and fails to field a presidential candidate at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Republican Party breaks in two, with Tea Party and country-club Republicans holding competing conventions and nominating separate presidential tickets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yet another new party springs up, composed mostly of old guard politicians from what used to be the middle of the road, and nominates its own candidate. Under US law, whatever party gets the most votes in any state wins that state’s votes in the electoral college—and so the new party, by winning a plurality of the popular vote in just enough states to matter, sees its candidate raising his hand on January 20, 2021 to take the oath of office as the nation’s next president. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Suggest a scenario of that kind to most Americans today and they’ll dismiss it as impossible. That’s all the more curious, in that every detail of the thought experiment I’ve just sketched out is drawn from an earlier period in American history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The years in question ran from 1854 to 1860, and the new party was the Republican Party; the Whigs were the party that imploded, the Democrats the party that split in two, the short-lived fourth party was the Constitutional Union Party and, of course, the tall figure standing up there taking the oath of office in 1861 was Abraham Lincoln. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yet it’s true that an upset of the same kind would be much more difficult to pull off today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Several different factors combine to make that the case, but to my mind, the most important of them is the simple and awkward fact that the skills that would be needed to make it happen are no longer to be found among activists or, for that matter, American citizens in general.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Organizing a new political party, building up a constituency on a national level, and making the machinery of democracy turn over in response, requires the pragmatic application of certain learned and learnable skill sets, which most people in America today do not know and are by and large uninterested in learning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are, broadly speaking, three such skill sets, and we’ll take them one at a time</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first can’t be discussed without opening an industrial sized can of worms, one that will take the rest of this post and still leave ends wriggling in all directions, but that can’t be helped. I’d like to start the can opener going with one of the odder conversations that spun off from last week’s post.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>My regular readers will remember that one of the core themes of that post was the suggestion that, though democratic systems are routinely corrupt and suffer from a galaxy of other pervasive problems, they generally provide more civil rights and more consistent access to due process to their citizens than do autocratic systems, and that this is true even in a nonindustrial setting. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of my readers took heated exception to this claim, and insisted that preindustrial America was no better than any other country of the time. It’s the debate that followed, though, that brought out the detail I want to emphasize.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To defend his counterclaim, my reader talked about the current US prison system, the evils of intellectual property rights, and a flurry of other issues irrelevant to the point at hand, ending up with a claim that since Adolf Hitler was elected Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Nazi Germany was a democracy and democracy was therefore bad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>None of his arguments had any bearing on whether citizens of the United States in its preindustrial days—not, please note, all its residents, much less people outside its borders; democracies abuse noncitizens more or less as often as other forms of government do, which is why I specified citizens in my distinctly lukewarm words of praise—had more civil rights and more reliable access to due process than citizens of autocratic countries during the same period. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a matter of historical record that in 1800, say, when the United States was still almost wholly agrarian, an American citizen could stand up in a public meeting anywhere in the country, say that President Adams was a liar, a thief, and a scoundrel who should be hounded out of office at the first opportunity, and suffer no civil or criminal penalty whatever for that utterance—and could go on with equal impunity to make good on his words by doing his best to hound Adams out of office and put Tom Jefferson in his place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s equally a matter of historical record that making a similar comment in the same year about First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, Tsar Pavel I, Sultan Selim III, the Jiaqing Emperor, or Shogun Tokugawa Ienari in the respective domains of these autocrats would have resulted in a painful death, or at best a long stay in prison under ghastly conditions, and let’s not even talk about what happened to people who showed any sign of trying to replace these heads of state with some other candidate. That’s a significant difference in civil rights, and it’s what I was talking about, but my attempts to suggest to my reader that he was not addressing my point got answered by increasingly irritable comments insisting that yes, he was. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It finally dawned on me that from his perspective, he was, because the point he thought I was making was something like “democracy is good,” or more exactly that the verbal noise “democracy” ought to be linked with warm fuzzy feelings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was insisting in response, more or less, that the verbal noise “democracy” ought to be linked to cold prickly feelings, and his rhetorical strategy—a very common one on the internet these days, as it happens—was simply to attempt to associate various cold prickly feelings with the verbal noise in question, in the hope that enough of the cold prickly feelings would stick to the verbal noise to make his point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The fact that I might be trying to do something other than linking a verbal noise to an emotional state seemingly did not occur to him. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s only fair to point out that he was far from the only person whose response to that post amounted to some equally simplistic emotional linkage. On the other side of the political spectrum, for instance, was a reader who insisted that the United States was not an empire, because empires are bad and the United States is good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>To him, the verbal noise “empire” was linked to cold prickly feelings, and those clashed unbearably with the warm fuzzy feelings he linked to the word “America.” It’s a fine example of the lumpen-Aristotelianism against which Alfred Korzybski contended in vain: A is A and therefore A cannot be not-A, even if A is a poorly chosen hypergeneralization that relates primarily to an emotional state and embraces an assortment of vaguely defined abstractions with no connection between them other than a nearly arbitrary assignment to the same verbal noise. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I don’t bring up these examples because they’re in any way unusual; they’re not. I bring them up because they quite adequately represent most of what passes for political discussion in America today. Examples abound; for one, think of the way the right uses the word “socialist” to mean exactly what the left means by the word “fascist.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In plain English, either one translates out as “I hate you,” but both can be far more adequately represented by the snarl a baboon makes when it’s baring its teeth in threat. Now of course both words, like “democracy” and “empire,” actually mean something specific, but you won’t find that out by watching their usage these days. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For another—well, I wonder how many of my readers have had, as I have, the experience of attempting to talk about the policies and behavior of a politician when the other person in the conversation insists on reducing everything to personalities. I think of an email exchange I endured a while back, in which my correspondent was trying to convince me that I was wrong to criticize Barack Obama, since he was a nice man, a man of integrity, and so on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Every issue got dragged back to the man’s personality—or, more precisely, to my correspondent’s impressions of his personality, garnered at third hand from the media. When I brought up the extent to which the Obama administration’s policies copied those of his predecessor, for example, I got a frosty response about how wrong it was to equate Obama and Bush, since they were such different people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One was, after all, linked with warm fuzzy feelings in my correspondent’s mind, while the other was linked with cold prickly feelings, and A cannot equal not-A. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One way to talk about the point I’m trying to make here is that the great majority of Americans have never learned how to think.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I stress the word “learned” here; thinking is a learned skill, not an innate ability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The sort of mental activity that’s natural to human beings is exactly the sort of linkage of verbal noises to emotional states and vague abstractions I’ve outlined above. To get beyond that—to figure out whether the verbal noises mean anything, to recognize that an emotional state is not an objective description of the thing that triggers it, and to replace the vague abstractions with clearly defined concepts that illuminate more than they obscure—takes education. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course we have an educational system in the United States. More precisely, we have two of them, a public school system that reliably provides some of the worst education in the industrial world, and a higher education industry that provides little more than job training—and these days, by and large, it’s training for jobs that don’t exist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You can quite easily pass through both systems with good grades, and never learn how to work through an argument to see if it makes sense or check the credentials of a purported fact. That’s a problem for a galaxy of reasons, but one of them bears directly on the theme of this post, for it’s a matter of historical record, again, that democratic politics work only when the people who have the right to vote—however large or small that class happens to be—also get an education in the basic skills of thinking. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s why the first-draft versions of Western democracy emerged in the ancient Mediterranean world, especially but not only in the city-states of Greece, at a time when the replacement of hieroglyphs with alphabets had made literacy a common skill among urban citizens and one of history’s great intellectual revolutions was inventing logic and formal mathematics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s why democratic ideas began to spread explosively through western Europe once education stopped being a monopoly of religious institutions and refocused on the same logical and mathematical principles that sparked an equivalent shift in the ancient Mediterranean, courtesy of the Renaissance and its aftermath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s why the extension of democracy to previously excluded groups in the United States followed, after varying lag times, the extension of public education to these same groups—and it’s also why the collapse of American education in recent decades has been promptly followed by the collapse of American democracy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s common enough to hear claims that American voters of previous generations must have been as poorly equipped in the skills of thinking as their equivalents today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I would encourage any of my readers who want to make such a claim, or who like to think that the inhabitants of our self-styled information society must inevitably be better at thinking than people of an earlier age, to take the time to read the <a href=http://www.nps.gov/liho/historyculture/debates.htm>Lincoln-Douglas debates</a> in their entirety, and then compare them to this year’s presidential debates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Lincoln and Douglas, remember, were not speaking to a roomful of Ph.D.s; they were in a hotly contested Congressional election, in front of audiences of farmers, millworkers, shopkeepers, and craftsmen, the ordinary voters of 1858 Illinois, few of whom had more than an eighth grade education and many of whom had much less.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It does not speak well for the pretensions of today’s America that its presidential candidates this year pursued their debates on a level that a crowd of Chicago feedlot workers in 1858 would have found embarrassingly simplistic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s among the many reasons why devising a framework for adult education outside the grip of the current American education industry is one of the most pressing needs of the decade or two right ahead of us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That huge topic, though, is going to require a series of posts all to itself. What I want to stress here is that teaching the electorate to think is not the only challenge here; those of my readers who may be involved in trying to change the direction of contemporary American society on any scale, and for any reason, might find it useful to turn a cold and beady eye upon their own mental processes, and on those of the movements they happen to support. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As extraordinary amount of what passes for argument in today’s activist scene, after all, is exactly the sort of linking of verbal noises with simple emotional reactions, warm and fuzzy or cold and prickly as needed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some of this may be coldly cynical manipulation on the part of canny operators pushing the emotional buttons of their intended targets, to be sure, but a cold and cynical manipulator who sees his manipulations failing normally changes tack, and tries to find something that will work better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That isn’t what we see among activists, though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Consider the way that the climate change movement went from an apparently unstoppable juggernaut a decade ago to nearly total failure today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The strategy chosen by the great majority of climate change activists could be adequately described as the mass production of cold pricklies; when the other side in the debate figured out how to counteract that, the activists’ sole response was to shout "Cold prickly! <i>Cold prickly!</i> COLD PRICKLY!!!" as loud as they could, and then wonder why people weren’t listening. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You can’t craft an effective strategy if your mental processes are limited to linking up verbal noises, simple emotional reactions, and vague abstractions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It really is as simple as that. Until those who hope to have an influence on any level recognize this, they’re not going to have the influence they seek, and America is going to continue stumbling on autopilot toward a wretched end. Once that hurdle is past, the remaining steps are a good deal easier; we’ll get to them next week. </div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
Does it make an apocalyptic prophecy more likely to come true if several different visionaries, from different traditions and times, agree on it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well, the last months of 1999 were targeted for the end of the world by a flurry of predictions from a diverse cast of would-be prophets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Hal Lindsey, who admittedly predicted the end of the world every ten years or so all through the latter 20th century, insisted in one of his books that the Second Coming would arrive before the year 2000; so did preacher James Gordon Lindsay (no relation); so did conspiracy theorist Texe Marrs; so did literature released by the Seventh Day Adventists and the Jehovah’s Witnesses; and so, curiously enough, did Timothy Dwight IV, the distinguished Revolutionary War era educator and theologian. </div>

The broad brush you paint with makes great sense when discussing big ideas or the arc of history, but fails when discussing modern politics. My one guilty habit is to spend a great deal of time studying not just the American political system, but the fighting that goes on in Washington on a day to day basis, the deals that are struck in congress, the actions by the executive both big and small, and so on. So I can say with a fair bit of confidence that one of your refrains on this -- that there's no basically difference between Obama and Romney/Bush or Democrats and Republicans -- is false. Here's what I will agree is true: neither party is responding to the issues of imperial decline or energy descent and of the progress myth. However what I think is also true is that since they aren't different on the issues that matter to you in particular, you describe them as not different at all. I would say that there is a very clear difference on issues that might not matter as much to you (and I do not mean to presume here), such as gay rights or womens rights, and in basic competence in running various basic services of the government like FEMA -- not just in words but deeds.<br><br>Again these are small potatoes in the scope of the Long Descent we face, but they matter to many in the here and now and some of these differences can mean the difference between putting food on the table or a roof over one's head or not during this bad economy for people I know. I agree these differences between party are small (too small) and that their policies won't do a thing for the bigger issues we face. But when one looks at the particulars, they can matter to real people on a day to day basis, and I never forget that when I go to vote.<br><br>(I hope you don't think this is too blunt.)<br><br><a href=#c150203964057196724 title="comment permalink">12/12/12, 9:31 PM</a><br><br>

"Devising a framework for adult education outside the grip of the current American education industry" is one of the very most important tasks we face, right up there with gardening, conservation and weaning ourselves from all our high-tech entertainment.<br><br>I taught at one of the elite universities in New England for about 40 years, and watched all this develop. Back in the '50s I got an excellent education in the public schools in California. When I began teaching in '67, most students came to my university already knowing how to think clearly, logically and with quasi-mathematical precision, not just to emote, to moralize, and to play games of clever verbal tennis. By the '80s there were noticeably fewer of these students, and by the '90s they had become so rare as to stand out sharply from the mass of students in general.<br><br>For a variety of historical reasons, universities have transformed themselves within my own lifetime into a sort of minor wealth pump in their own right, and they abjectly feed into the greater wealth pumps of the nation for their own profit. Too much money is at stake for any reform in the near future, and in the more distant future our current institutions of higher education will inevitably starve to death as economic growth ceases forever and the flow of wealth dries up.<br><br>It would be a distraction to argue about the historical reasons for this change. The change itself is a fact, and needs to be reckoned with.<br><br>So how might one develop such a framework? Perhaps in much the same way as JMG has developed a framework for green wizardry one could develop one for a genuine education. I'll have to think about this more . . . <br><br>As a starter, perhaps I could make or find PDFs of a *very* few of the most demanding and clearest high-school textbooks that were published in the 19th and early 20th centuries: G. A. Wentworth's texts on algebra, plain and solid geometry and trigonometry, S. S. Greene's advanced textbook of English grammar, and so forth. Suggestions of other authors and titles would be welcomed! <br><br>I am a medievalist and a humanist, not a scientist, though I have a taste for mathematics. So I tend to think in terms of the medieval list of school subjects: grammar, rhetoric, logic, mathematics, and the mathematical treatment of such things as astronomy, celestial navigation, music theory, etc. (And I would add magic to the list, but YMMV.) This particular model may not be the best one to follow for the coming hard times. But whatever the model, it should not be a practical curriculum that teaches one how to do things. It should be a curriculum that teaches how to use the mind.<br><br>Thoughts, anyone?<br><br><a href=#c3278111468574661034 title="comment permalink">12/12/12, 9:49 PM</a><br><br>

When I say moral degradation I do not mean religious, I mean in terms of discipline, restraint and empathy. Industrial society has become soft, weak and selfish as a result of abundance and extravagance. This has led to intellectual laziness for a number of reasons which hinge on the fact that there are fewer incentives to actually think critically and originally. After all when the status quo provides not only food and security but also pleasures and adventures why go to all the trouble of actually straining your brain with critical thought? Moreover, why think critically if you are going to be condemned and shunned? Better to stay stupid and keep receiving invitations to the parties. <br><br>Another issue that needs to be considered is that this intellectual and moral degradation has been going on for generations now meaning parents have internalized the stupidity and decadence and are now passing that onto their children. Therefore, many children do not have a positive intellectual and moral influence at home, at school or in their social circles so what chance do they have? An example of bad parenting is the obsession in instilling self-esteem in the absence of any actual achievement. Studies have shown this leads to bad outcomes. For example, instilling self-esteem in low achievers does not make them achieve higher grades but it does make them feel better about their poor performance. I think this self-esteem movement is just a way of giving credence to lazy parenting because it is an excuse not to get tough, impose rules and boundaries and then enforce them which all require active and engaged parenting. It is just easier to ignore problems and then say "well if I was to lecture Johnny for his recalcitrance that might impair his self-esteem" before returning to some reality TV show about some pornographic cretin of a “celebrity”.<br><br><a href=#c894691979503811 title="comment permalink">12/12/12, 10:22 PM</a><br><br>

One thing I've wondered in regard to our political system is how much industrialism and globalization necessarily distorts the ability to have a functioning democracy in comparison to smaller, more localized economies and communities. Much as a small business is often more accountable to the community it serves than a large corporation, surely democracy is more accountable at small, local levels--not to mention within less complex circumstances?<br><br>What you write here about the failure of critical thinking skills leading to a failure of democracy makes sense to me. But I've also wondered if, as we slide down the curve of descent, we find that democracy might become more accountable and functional (potentially, that is, with a lot of work and engagement on the part of local populations) as our societies and economy necessarily become more localized and more rooted in reality rather than in abstraction. How much does that play into what you write here? If we were a well-informed citizenry widely capable of critical thinking, might we still be suffering--though probably to a lesser degree--a non- or poorly-functioning democracy due to the distortions of our industrial and globalized way of living?<br><br>Or perhaps I'm just viewing non-industrialization with a certain undeserved romanticism. I have to admit that industrialism produces the cold pricklies in me (despite the many benefits I accrue from it and my constant utilization of it) while other modes of living, such as agrarianism, produces the warm fuzzies--both to undeserved degrees, no doubt. I also must admit that one of the reasons I love your writing so much is the way you utilize history, which is a subject I'm far too unfamiliar with. So there's an excellent chance here that I'm projecting my warm fuzzies onto a past that I simply don't understand well enough and thus romanticize and escape into.<br><br>(I'm working on all that. Picked up a big, eight dollar, used hardback abridgement of Toynbee's Study of History at Powell's the other day.

It's changing our infrastructure and our economy, so that soon we will be trading in carbon credits as well as money.<br><br>I find it quite difficult to have a discussion with people about what the movement is really achieving which is any different from the status quo, because you get labelled a denier who doesn't really care about the future. <br><br>The reality however is the climate change movement is doubling their efforts to consume resources in the name of saving the future. It's promoted if we all get solar panels on our roofs tomorrow, and connect to the national electricity grid, it will reduce resource depletion. This is in spite of the fact, they need to double their efforts to use resources, because they're acting in tandem with old industrial technology.<br><br>Really, how is that different from the status quo - I guess only in that it's worse?

At least it did that trick with me. It is so true that our system is driven by raw emotions and equally raw propaganda. Cool thinking and willingness to compromise have left spectrum of politics long ago. I wonder if true conservatives died as species with downfall of classical education styled after Roman examples? We truly need them now, when they are not around any more. As a person caught between two classes (working class and middle class) and two cultures (Eastern European and Western European), I have this deep feeling of sorrow and desperation when I think about future. There is so little understanding and dialogue between different interest groups, and so much cheap shots and hate brewing under closed lid. We have already entered an era when there are less and less to distribute among more and more people. At the same time politicians have become very idealistic, and that is very scary and bad thing to happen. Idealistic persons are not seeing real world with real problems and people; they they look into the world of Grand Ideas. And when politicians think big and shiny thoughts, little people get hurt. The label does not matter; Free Markets, International Communism, Green Paradise, Globalism No Borders, Liberalism etc. are all equally bloodthirsty gods. They all thirst after blood sacrifice of human blood. But you know what; I have seen those altars of sacrifice of one Utopian project, that of Russian origins. And suffering of people indeed is very real, but paradise is still lacking. So do you see any realistic strategy to defuse this situation of political idealism combined wit crumbling economy into least harmful political solution? You have to remember, if problems escalate far enough, you just have to stand with your own kin, even if you personally prefer peace. There is no room for individualistic mental masturbation of High Morals in trenches or tribal wars a la Ulster; meaningful moral moves must be done BEFORE things escalate too far. And there must be willingness to compromise; shouting hateful slogans just leads to actual shooting, given enough time. You have given some practical instructions about composting and gardening before; practical instructions would be nice in this subject too.<br><br><a href=#c3356252946542490249 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 12:36 AM</a><br><br>

This message is primarily pushed through non-political speech (advertising, entertainment, etc.), but the political commentary in a noisy sort of way mirrors that same emersion.<br><br>Thus you have Draft speaking about the real difference between the parties, but having difficulty seeing that these are differences within a fairly narrow paradigm.<br><br><a href=#c6863394621507986908 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 2:54 AM</a><br><br>

It was called, “Affluenza” and was written by the Australian, Dr Clive Hamilton. I'd never before understood how easily we were all manipulated by emotive content until that point.<br><br>There was even a throw-away line in the book about the development of a 5 blade razor for shaving (at that time 4 blades was the maximum in the marketplace). Sure enough, it turned up in the market about a year later. Scary stuff.<br><br>I didn't need further convincing, we live in a society founded on magic. Unfortunately, after this point I saw the world differently and started asking hard questions which on the positive side led me from the top end of the corporate bad-lands to where I am today. It’s been an interesting journey and I haven't even told half of it.<br><br>Please don't get a big head, ego or anything like that, but I truly respect you. It was very wise to let commenters vent their collective spleens and show their mental processes last week as comments this week have been most civil and courteous (well so far, anyway). You are teaching us all (well most of us anyway!). <br><br>Years back I ran a graduate program with a large corporate (in addition to hands on work) and I used to love challenging the graduates to get their mental processes working. Occasionally, if they were stubborn enough, I let them fail as there are lessons in that too for them. <br><br>Had to cut short my previous comment as there was a bit of rain today, but for the next two days I may get an inch per day. With such summer rain predicted, it’s time to transplant self-seeded herbs about the place. It has been a dry Spring and Summer so far here, but when it rains it has an almost tropical feel about it. As the surface waters of Indian ocean to the north west and the Pacific ocean to the north east are heating up they are spreading tropical conditions further south. My memory unfortunately is not reliable enough to recall whether this was always the case. Still the level meter on the water tanks don’t lie and I’m now down to 70% with a further 20% capacity in reserve in another tank. It is early summer here. <br><br>I’m not sure whether anyone is aware, but the El Nino cycle did a strange unprecedented flip this year (well in recorded history anyway). It was heading into El Nino (drier cycle) conditions which were clearly observable on the ground here and suddenly flipped to neutral conditions because of the surface temperatures of the two oceans previously mentioned apparently increased evaporation and atmospheric humidity. Strange times.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c3488894119116394382 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 2:58 AM</a><br><br>

It is a series of books for learning Latin through the Direct Method -- everything from the preface to the index is in Latin except for the copyright paragraphy by the publisher. It's very suitable for autodidactic use with or without the answer key.<br><br>In general, a lot of language learning material from around the 1960s is superior to courses from the 80s and 90s regardless of the methodology employed. You might find Alexander Arguelles's Youtube videos on the change in content in language textbooks interesting.<br><br>I'd also like to recommend Karl Sandberg's books which focus on reading knowledge of various Western European languages as well as T.K. Ann's Cracking the Chinese Puzzles series.<br><br>Whatever other purposes the Internet may serve though, it is still a very useful tool for learning so many different things. More and more courses, especially on electronics and higher mathematics, from top universities are now available for study for everyone with an internet connection, a huge range of out-of-copyright books is now available for free download and there are online communities dedicated to learning specific topics that can be very useful for autodidacts. <br><br>For language learning, I think the availability of high-quality free podcasts at all levels as well as a variety of other materials has shaken the publishers up a bit and recent courses are an improvement over the glorified phrasebooks of the 80s and 90s (c.f. the Teach Yourself series). <br><br>@Robert Mathiesen, while a noble sentiment, I don't think it would be feasible for the vast majority of the population to maintain knowledge of things that can't be put to practical use in a time of economic contraction. JMG has noted elsewhere on this blog that the mediaeval monks who preserved (a selection of) the knowledge of the classical world in Western Europe made very extreme sacrifices in personal comfort, even for that era.<br><br><a href=#c8439784059712447933 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 4:15 AM</a><br><br>

Interesting too that some of your stuff here on alphabets forming societies goes towards McLuhan, of whom I seem to remember you aren’t too fond.<br><br>Have you considered that (in addition to the natural dumbing-down media performs -- after all, fuzzly/prickly rhetoric is that of commercial advertising) there is simply and always a loss of ability with a culture’s symbolising mechanisms once that culture is truly on the way out?<br><br>John David Ebert points out:<br><br><i> "If we just blame electronic technology, then our thesis isn't broad enough to account for the gradual erosion of literacy in ancient civilizations like Egypt, China, and Rome... Lucan is not as good as Ovid, and Seneca's plays were written not to be performed but to be read aloud because the gladiatorial shows had put theatre out of business... Seneca's plays, consequently, are crudely violent because he had to compete with the arenas. In the next, and last generation of Roman literature, with Martial, Juvenal, Suetonius and Valerius Flaccus, there is a further falling away... But the curious thing is that by the time of Marcus Aurelius... Roman literature is finished. After that generation, from about 150 CE on, there are no Roman writers whatsoever. What happened to them?</i><br><br>Were the factors the same in that case -- a downslide of education? Are there some other hard-to-pinpoint factors that link cultural decomplexification with intellectual and psychological decomplexification? It seems to me for example that at “peak complexity” you have a literature on almost any subject that no one human being can keep up with, and a lot of snarl-words exist so that lazier people needn’t bother to read outside the box.<br><br>(“Vitalism” is one such word and gets <a href=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110718111421.htm rel=nofollow>good confirmations now and then</a> -- relevant since we qigong players know warm/fuzzy and cold/prickly aren't just metaphors ^_^.)<br><br>And that laziness in turn exists because the reading only leads to little things like truth and knowledge, rather than the important stuff -- remuneration, which is now on the downslide no matter how much anyone knows.

To this day I am a voracious reader and have even authored a couple of books.

As already mentioned, their scope of influence is severely constrained by State mandates, yet they still manage to muck things up with wretched regularity.<br><br>Over a year-and-a-half ago, our school board closed down our local elementary school (a beautiful 85-year-old building) as a cost-saving measure, requiring us to bus the little ones 8 miles into town to a now over-crowded and even shoddier building. <br><br>In response, many local parents formed an educational cooperative (led by a freshly retired school board member who quit due to the shenanigans), enrolled our kids in a “charter school for home-schoolers” (so they can still get State-provided materials) and proceeded to rent a big house where we could all meet, fund-raise, and play Education Reform.<br><br>Meanwhile, we set our sights on getting that empty building returned to the community, mainly by convincing the School Board that, without a plan for its use, it was a clear liability to them and not as big an asset as they had dreamed (less than zero). Because the building is so locally beloved, we were also able to form a wider community group to rally around its rescue, and this week, success: a big bag of keys and all the paperwork signed!<br> <br>Now comes the real work of re-hosting the school (er, I mean educational cooperative), re-planting the gardens, and forming a true community center with senior stuff, computer access and seed library (my little pet). And of course, fixing the badly leaking roof, vandalized windows, and other damage incurred in the time it was abandoned by the ignorant fools and waiting to be loved again by its true people, the neighbors who all passed through its halls.<br><br>Of course, everyone’s still thaumatized into sending the kiddos to college, and very few have even the remotest idea how richly important this revitalized building will become in the de-industrialized future.

How many times I've heard people say something along the lines of “I never talk about in public because it only leads to arguments and people get angry and nasty”. I know I've said it too. Sometimes it's because neither side knows how to discuss ideas on their merits, but to have a conversation requires both parties to be able to think, listen and consider. That's turned out to be too high of a threshold these days so we just don't talk to each other.<br><br>I have to go back to my perennial whipping boy, the prevalent forms of mass media. Audio and video media make it too easy to manipulate emotions – tone of voice, body language, constant repetition of hot-button phrasing, etc. Of course there are whole industries devoted to doing just that. While it is certainly possible to make emotional appeals in the written word, the simple fact that it is not a real-time medium allows the careful reader more opportunity to see and filter that out.<br><br>It will be interesting to see what you propose that might help break the log jamb.

I could be wrong (I wasn't alive ~150 years ago), but I'd assume that people have always had to put up with people's idiotic and irrational arguments.

In particular, the claim seems to be that the more well-educated political body (however large or small that happens to be), the more well-functioning it is. Your examples are ancient Greek democracy and (it seems) Renaissance Europe.<br><br>But I don't think you can simply take the contemporary US to be analogous to either ancient Greece or Renaissance Europe. At least two factors make them importantly different: size, and the difference in the nature of thinking &amp; education (which, I argue, cannot be understood apart from the historical epoch itself). Your Toynbee-style, synchronous comparison of historically remote societies is highly questionable here, in short.<br><br>Greek Democracies had one thing going for them: they were relatively small, concentrated city-states (as you point out), and as such, their Democracies were direct ("true"). A democracy of a hundred-thousand or less is both quantitatively and qualitatively different than one of three-hundred + millions. You may be right abt the correlation b/w ed levels and functioning of a demos, but our demos is simply another thing entirely. In fact, that qualitative difference means that the nature of thinking in the one does not compare to the other. They are different, ontologically speaking. <br><br>As a result of this ontological difference, the form of education is also different. Just look at the univ. curriculum c. 1400 to see: the trivium and quadrivium were both under the unifying ambit of a theological-philosophical system, that is, a coordinating frame of reference. Mutatis mutandis for ancient Greece. Indus. Capitalism changed that; in fact, it's a non-system in this sense. Our world is one that, relative to these worlds, is fragmented and diffuse, and one that is losing its moorings to a historical past (post-Ind. Cap. tends to annihilate time/history &amp; even space).<br><br>Second, those societies were run by relatively small groups, and, in addition to being supported by massive slave populations, had the time for wide learning. And, they could function well because the power was so narrowly confined and highly concentrated, as was its geography, culture and its history.<br><br>Lastly, as for US c. 1860: how do we know what to conclude from the intellectual level of the debates? Do we know that the populace to whom they were addressing themselves could actually follow in fair detail what was being said? But I don't want to quibble -- perhaps they could. My point is that, since we are no longer an early Industrial society, and that we are transitioning (and have been for 50+ yrs) into a new civilizational config, this inaugurates ontological and, therefore, epistemological changes.<br>Given that, c. 1860, the US was in the early-to-middle stages of Industrialization, I'd say that more people had more of a common frame of reference then, and far fewer independent bits of information to contend with, than we do now; today, knowledge and therefore education is diffuse and specialized (an ontological consequence of Industrialization, I'd say). What we see happening in the "debates" today is merely the necessary consequence of this epistemological diffusion and specialization. In fact, you don't have debates: you have a spectacle, a media-event -- something ontologically remote from Lincoln-Douglas.<br><br>Nevertheless, I think the US does have a poor ed system, lacks the ability or knowledge to think (or doesn't even know what it is), and doesn't have a functioning democracy. I just question the link between these things, and the Toynbee methodological &amp; philosophical presuppositions.<br><br><a href=#c9136351796379444575 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 9:01 AM</a><br><br>

(At least in NJ.) This is due to political contribution limits, and the fact that there are 560 municipalities, 21 counties and only 1 state.<br> The majors are vulnerable at the local level because towns and boroughs are constantly being placed in the "wealth pump" which goes <i>up</i> to the state and national level, and this is done by the same major parties. Therefore, it gets little criticism at the local level because back-stabbing is punished by a cutoff of party spending on one's next campaign. (Candidates don't raise much money at the local level, and the close races are decided by huge influxes of party money.)<br> Communities could probably look out for themselves better by forming parties that have no ties to parties at the state or national level and have no reason to keep their mouths shut about the wealth extraction going on. They would also have no reason to "toe" some "line" for the benefit of a state-wide organization.<br> If these local parties start winning, the corporate contributions to the local committees of the majors would dry up because they would no longer be able to create a return on investment via public spending. If this happened in enough towns, it would have the effect of kicking the feet out from under the major parties.<br> I've run as a third party candidate on two occasions. I did not win, but in one campaign I had the majors flummoxed because they had no idea how to run without using negative campaign literature (which does not work as well with more than two candidates). If I had done this in a non-presidential election year, I think I would have received a high enough percentage to encourage others to follow up. (Presidential elections bring out the most ignorant voters, who tend to vote straight column because they have no idea what else to do.) If there's a next time for me, I'll know better, but hopefully I can get someone younger to be the actual candidate.<br> Note to readers: 2013 is <i>not</i> a presidential election year. As JMG pointed out - you don't need a majority of the vote, you only need more than the other candidates.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c814675405912121570 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 11:37 AM</a><br><br>

So,”2-3°C warmer” looks like being well over 5M years.<br>Hansen &amp; Sato say, quote: <i>We conclude that Pliocene temperatures probably were no more than 1-2°C warmer on global average than peak Holocene temperature. And regardless of the precise temperatures in the Pliocene, the extreme polar warmth and diminished ice sheets are consistent with the picture we painted above. Earth today, with global temperature having returned to at least the Holocene maximum, is poised to experience strong amplifying polar feedbacks in response to even modest additional global mean warming.</i><br>best<br>Phil<br><br><br><br><a href=#c592856662570331037 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 2:38 PM</a><br><br>

Our most heated debates are usually internal and boil down to 'X gave me the cold pricklies'. Sometimes I respond lawyer-style which I think at least comes closer to proper thinking, but it doesn't go down well. The usually unsaid response is something like 'Well lawyery arguing gives me the cold pricklies too so you're obviously on X's side, and clearly a big meanie to boot...'. Suggesting a group hug would probably go down much better. I despair. <br><br>That said I also despair about my own thinking abilities. Feel like I hit my intellectual peak at about 13 and it's been downhill ever since. I like to write but since reading your blog I've realized I don't actually think well enough to have something worth saying. I'm tempted to blame my non-sleeping baby but the brain fog definitely predates her grand arrival by some years.<br><br>But where does a sleep deprived person find the time and energy to work on thinking more clearly while getting on with the practical peak oil preparations, working and keeping aforementioned sleep-depriver entertained?

It's impossible to think everything at once, that is. The foundations and limits are likely to have vital irrational components, laid down by geographical vitality (Athens, Rome) or a coherent universal tradition (High Middle Ages Catholicism).<br><br>To take a simple illustration, a Protestant and a Catholic in 1600 are going to have a much harder time thinking together about anything that touches on implicit limits than two Catholics or two Protestants, because they will have foundational disagreements that have an irrational (or magical!) component. This can't be argued or thought out of the picture, really, it can only be accommodated (which is the point of Hobbesian liberalism) or suppressed forcibly (difficult in a democracy) or magicked (e.g. Shakespeare).<br><br>In groups of people, the effort to think clearly and the effort to imagine differently run, often, at cross-purposes. Thinking clearly always means, to some extent, *thinking clearly within agreed limits*, and imagining differently means changing the limits. Find an intellectual person well-trained in Catholic tradition and try to explain druidry to them, if you want an immediate lesson in what this means.<br><br>So, while thinking is a goal to be ardently pursued and its loss lamented, it may be at a cultural weak point partly because re-imagining is the more important task. Necessary strife-and-love, in other words. It's not thinking that accomplished civil rights for black Americans or made paganism a somewhat acceptable belief or made some Westerners engage seriously with the concerns of indigenous people, after all, though of course thinking helped in the process.<br><br><br>(The acid of capitalism and its hostility to limits is also relevant, but I can't think of an upside to this.)<br><br><a href=#c2422571902731071185 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 3:46 PM</a><br><br>

I've been mulling over ideas of what education should consist of, but almost entirely in my mind. Now you've triggered me to put down some of my thinking. (Much of it is too sketchy to inflict on people at this point.)<br><br>For me, the driving question, with regards to democracy, is "what are the requirements for a citizen of a democracy to be an effective participant in a government of the people, by the people, and for the people?" Currently, two things stand out: information and the knowledge of what to do with it.<br><br>I think a citizen requires (at least) the following characteristics of information about a subject concerning which he/she needs to make a decision: timeliness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Information that isn't available when it's needed isn't useful; incomplete information can be only marginally useful, or even misleading; inaccurate information may well be worse than no information. This needs considerable exposition, clarification, etc., but I'll leave it for now.<br><br>As to knowledge, this gets into the topic of your post. Governments, like societies and economies, are always evolving; a well-functioning democracy more than most. Thus, the citizens will necessarily be engaged in continuous learning. Any system of learning will need to be inherently designed for this. Another characteristic, I think, is that the system will need to be driven and directed by the learners. There will be teachers for some subject matters, but they'll need to be able to adapt their material to the emerging and changing needs of their students. (And if A teaches B in one subject, B may be A's teacher in another.)<br><br>(Continued...)<br><br><a href=#c1919140515351867767 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 3:51 PM</a><br><br>

(By the way, I don't distinguish between childhood and adult education; some of these topics will be subjects of learning throughout life.)<br>- Personal competence (my own term, maybe there's a better one): basically, learning to understand and master oneself. This gets into the kind of magic that JMG discussed earlier, and of course some Eastern disciplines as well. It also includes our increasing science-base understanding of the way our bodyminds work, and how to make them work increasingly well.<br>- A sense of time: understanding oneself and all one's environments as parts of an process. Learning what it means to "create the future". Tradeoffs between energy and time. Pacing one's endeavors, including one's learning. Learning from history.<br>- How to do community (including family): communal life is an important aspect of everyone's existence (except for hermits). As with personal competence, we need to understand it better, and learn how to heal and prevent dysfunctions and "diseases".<br>- Creative thinking: putting imagination to useful work, scenario thinking, systems thinking, the use and limits of models, ...<br>- Understanding language: "linguistic competence". This spans personal and community competence.<br><br>In addition, I think there are some topics that should be addressed early on, since they're badly needed just now:<br>- Critical thinking, of the sort JMG has brought up. An important subtopic will be learning to understand the nature of advertising and propoganda, and how to "immunize" oneself to it (I'd start that learning pretty young, even pre-teen).<br>- The distance between actions and consequences. Two kinds of distance: temporal (delayed consequences) and spatial (consequences occurring away from the action).<br>Demographics and the dynamics of population growth and decline.<br>- The nature of money and economies. (Richard Douthwaite has used the term "the ecology of money", which I find very evocative.)<br>- Cycles of growth and decline, of increasing and decreasing complexity, at all scales.<br><br>This is somewhat a brain dump. I hope to organize it and expand it over time, probably with many useful inputs from our gracious host.<br><br><a href=#c5959800551486023272 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 3:52 PM</a><br><br>

Before I took on my present work of helping others learn and practice various aspects of sustainability, I spent years teaching critical thinking skills and democratic process to my students. And even just the other night, as a guest lecturer in a sustainable landscape practices class, part of the class was devoted to participation in local government as a way to help get sustainable land use practice into local governance.<br><br>However, I think it is too easy to simply say something like American Education is --insert something negative here. America is a big place. There are many educations to be had. My children went to a public high school with excellent history teachers, and my husband and I made sure they took those classes, and, also important, made sure they did their homework. Equally as important, however, we consciously discussed,critiqued and analyzed a wide range of topics at the dinner table and in general conversation. <br><br>Thus, to me one issue is not only a lack of serious teaching of critical thinking skills, but also that among many people there is a kind of learned helplessness, so that students wait to be told what to do, how to think, etc. This could be from life long immersion in a thaumaturgic culture full of controlling messages (packed with fuzzy/prickly meta-content and emotional massage) whose purpose is precisely to dull critical thinking -- a form of conditioning which it is very difficult for mere teachers to break through, especially if students lack other, countervailing forces in their lives.<br><br>Teaching adults is, in my experience, a very different proposition -- lots of folks more set in their ways, minds perhaps a little less nimble -- but also, often, possessing enough life lived to value new knowledge,to know they don't know it all and that presumed certainties are often wrong. It's important for the teacher to honor what these learners already know and to go in softly, as a fellow traveler.<br><br>This is my experience, at least, and why sweeping general statements about what American Education does or does not do make me somewhat uncomfortable.<br><br><a href=#c7154541191795503728 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 3:53 PM</a><br><br>

It tilts against the most powerful economic interests on the planet (and the economy itself, as it is currently understood) ... in short, the deck is heavily stacked against any notion that we should not blow through fossil fuels as fast as possible.<br><br><a href=#c2428675960098407792 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 5:58 PM</a><br><br>

OK - education.<br><br>Basic logic can not be that hard to teach. Earlier, someone posted a link to the 20 most common logical fallacies. Despite multiple college degrees and a wide-ranging resume, I had never once seen all 20 of those fallacies listed in one place before today. This, despite the fact that much of what passes for political discourse in the United States these days depends on endlessly MANIPULATING one or more of those 20 logical fallacies. Which might explain why they are not generally or systematically taught in schools, I suppose. <br><br>That sort of easy manipulation of the public is also probably why the dangers of consumer credit, compound interest, and personal bankruptcy are not generally addressed anywhere in the educational system, either.<br><br>Several posters suggest that home schooling instills logical thinking skills in a way that public school does not. I'm not sure about that. At least in my corner of the country "home schooling" is often seen as a good way to avoid exposure to dangerous ideas like "evolution," and "geologic history." As with anything else, superior inputs produce better outputs, I suppose.<br><br>A populace lacking the skillset to defend against logical fallacy also explains what is wrong with today's "activist scene," on climate change - at least partly.<br><br>But here, we may find an example in the US firearms and ammunition industries backing of a successful NRA - which deceased equine received a merciless flogging in last week's thread.<br><br>"Global Warming" was a popular and easily understood term - but "skeptics" poked holes in it. <br><br>Those same "skeptics" forced the popular press to go from using the term "Global Warming," to using the term "Climate Change," to using the term "Anthropogenic Global Warming," - - - at which point the general public, being generally science-phobic, completely lost interest in the whole situation.<br><br>What the "activist community" lacked in this case was a commercial rational for which to SELL Global Warming, as a concept by which to make someone some money. Lacking that, they lacked the organized focus to pick a simple marketing strategy and stick with it.<br><br>And the logical facts concerning CO2 production and climate change have since been countered at every turn by Exxon Mobil, Peabody Coal, and monopoly power companies in almost every State of the Union.<br><br>SCOTUS declared that corporations are people. We should not be surprised, then, to see those corporations fight to the death against ideas that might cause them harm.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c2225553833262730878 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 6:04 PM</a><br><br>

I'd suggest checking out his green wizard forum at http://www.greenwizards.org<br>or checking in at some of the other blogs that try to answer the questions of how to prepare for and live in the long descent. There are quite a few good ones out there. Mine is at http://eighthacrefarm.blogspot.com I cover topics such as the hows of organic gardening, building with salvaged things and composting, and have links on the side to others that have similar content.<br><br>I view JMG's blog as a starting point. I think he provides an intellectual platform for all of us to start from and build upon. I don't try to answer the 'why' so much as the 'how', since Mr. Greer is much better at the 'why' part of it all anyway.<br><br>BTW- great post as usual, Mr. Greer. I too look forward to every Wednesday night or Thursday morning to see what you have to say.

However, I don't think that the problem is primarily one of inadequate education, even though our educational system is woefully poor. Fundamentally, I think that we have a deep cultural problem. A large majority of Amerians are not interested in critical thinking and are actively antagonistic toward any kind of intellectual pursuit. No amount of educational reform can overcome such profound anti-intellectualism. How can you educate people who are determined not be educated?<br><br><a href=#c4615573586266024428 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 6:49 PM</a><br><br>

We now live in a 24 hr control and surveillance grid. You haven't been "come for" yet because they don't need to- yet.<br><br>I endured a conventional substandard public education overseen by a great many incompetent, if (sometimes) well-meaning people called "teachers".<br><br>I educated myself because my mother did two things right- she encouraged me to read and refused to have a television in the house.<br><br>Despite the many holes present in self-learning, I am always amazed at how much more I know than many of my college educated peers. More than that, I am not afraid to teach myself anything new I might want to learn. i am further amazed at how many people are afraid to do something because they haven't been "taught" how by someone else.<br><br>One key element that is not and cannot be taught by any form of pedagogy is how to develop a conscientious strength. This is the heart of critical thinking- to develop a moral conscience that cannot be swayed by any threat or promise of co-option. A moral conscience runs counter to all forms of power and is the one thing that renders all worldly powers impotent. The moral conscience is the one thing feared therefore, by all those who exercise power, and this must be suppressed at all costs.<br><br><a href=#c8424706053803487952 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 6:50 PM</a><br><br>

More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Yossi, good. Yes, I'm quite familiar with the trivium and quadrivium; we'll be talking about them at length down the road. <br><br>Avery, excellent!

There's a whole series of factors feeding into the dumbing-down effect, and yes, the normal decline of a civilization is one of them. All the more reason to get busy and preserve what can be preserved, in subcultures or even monasteries if it comes to that. <br><br>Plotinus, I'm quite aware of that; I'm not sure my commenter was, though. <br><br>Farmer, that parallels my experiences closely. <br><br>Hawlkeye, excellent! That's exactly the sort of step that can give rise to the educational systems of the future. <br><br>Twilight, one of the things I've learned in the course of hosting this blog's comment pages is that it's possible to create a space for reasoned discourse, but only if there's a way of excluding those who aren't willing to abide by fairly basic rules of courtesy and relevance. I suspect along these lines that what's needed is a social framework that fosters discussion but has firm and enforceable boundaries to keep the trolls at bay. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>B-Man, I haven't -- thanks for the tip!<br><br>Sue, the principle here is that of herding cats. That can be done quite easily; all you have to do is take a #10 tin of tuna to the place you want the cats to go. I'm less interested in dragging people to the wells of knowledge than of seeing if there's anyone interested in joining me on the trip there. <br><br>Don, that's a useful point. What we're discussing is in large part a mental habit of emotionally driven overgeneralization. <br><br>Ing, excellent! You get tonight's gold star. That's exactly the point: it's the emotional baggage, from a variety of sources, that makes issues seem impossible to discuss. Recognize the difference between a fact and a value, and between a value and a feeling, and you're halfway home. <br><br>Alex, did you read the Lincoln-Douglas debates I posted? Do so, and then try telling me that the level of analytical ability common 150 years ago was equivalent to what it is today. There are, by the way, hundreds of other examples of the same contrast.<br><br><a href=#c2379954762417210547 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 7:10 PM</a><br><br>

There are other contemporary sources of equal value about these and similar debates. More generally, it's easy to claim that because A is different ("ontologically" or otherwise) from B, no part of A can be understood by comparing it with B. Claiming an ontological difference between contexts does not by itself invalidate the value of such comparisons, since every comparison is by definition a comparison between two different things. <br><br>LW, one of the requirements for a successful third party is the willingness to stop caring about which of the other parties wins. In your example, Gary Johnson's solid third-place finish, if it's combined with a successful push to get candidates into Congress and state governments, could put his party in position to take the White House next time around. Since the Dems and the GOP are going to pursue the same policies anyway, does it matter whether Bush III or Clinton II gets in? Not to a third party that matters. <br><br>Jamie, excellent. I don't usually give out two gold stars at a sitting, but your point is crucial enough to earn one. <br><br>Blue Sun, nah, we spent this week's post talking about the first of the three skill sets. The second and third will be discussed next week. <br><br>Keith, thank you! This is great. I'd like to encourage every reader of this post to print out a copy and pin it on the wall somewhere. <br><br>Robert, exactly. It doesn't matter to the left that Obama is doing all the same things they denounced Bush for doing because the verbal noise "Obama" is linked to warm fuzzy feelings, and that's all that matters. <br><br>SLClaire, I'll check out the website. It'll be interesting to see the reasons they suggest. <br><br>Steve, excellent! I have a set of those, and of the Harvard Classics, a similar collection. As I'm away from home I don't have access to my library, but you might try <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/28/science/great-plains-or-great-desert-the-sea-of-dunes-lies-in-wait.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm" rel=nofollow>this Nrew York Times</a> article for starters. <br><br>Andrew, thanks, but anything with high tuition is a nonstarter. <br><br>Kieran, reminds me of the famous Wiccan author who denounced her critics as "mean, cruel, and academic." I wonder what she thought the last word meant...<br><br><a href=#c7800257371240482771 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 7:30 PM</a><br><br>

It doesn't seem to help much. <br><br>Ando, exactly. <br><br>Owl, yes, I've seen the various psychological attempts to blame assorted social evils on the right. Did it occur to you that this is simply another way of associating cold prickly feelings with a group of people that, by and large, liberals despise anyway? <br><br>Stu, of course it would have to involve a heavy grassroots push, from the very beginning, and continuing from there. We'll be getting to that. <br><br>Fern, any Druid with a slide rule is a Druid after my own heart! I'd like to see slide rules become part of the standard Druidical kit -- I know, it's a reach, but as Wowbagger the Indefinitely Prolonged said, "A being can dream." <br><br>Wiseman, if you reread my post you'll notice that I was talking specifically about America. That was deliberate; it's not my job, or for that matter my place, to try to affect the governmental systems of countries other than my own. <br><br>Justin, as far as I know it's sheer accident. This part of the end of empire series was envisioned from the very beginning, around the first of the year. <br><br>BoysMom, I'd encourage you to network with other homeschooling parents, and see whether it's helpful to assist each other in various ways, up to and including the sort of thing Hawlkeye talked about earlier in the comment string. To my mind, that's where you can make a real difference. <br><br>Ganv, I think our brains can handle it if we take the time to learn how to do so.

After realizing how futile it is to have decent discussions about these big topics, even with people who I consider intelligent, I have thought long and hard about why, and what might help. I have a strong urge to create a local “forum” where people would agree to meet weekly, to learn how to discuss and then to discuss the topics of importance to them. The way I see it, there is one obstacle to such a discussion that I haven’t seen this mentioned yet (except for Jaimie) in comments: people need to have the time to talk about it – we’ve lost the community that allowed us to meet up with the same people often enough to explain our reasoning, do research (if needed) and prepare “come-backs”, and dig beneath the surface of a topic. People may be brainwashed by hour-long tv talk shows, but nothing much is accomplished by these “mini-debates” (I can’t even watch them anymore).<br><br>The way I see it working is that a group of maybe 12 (not much more) agree to come weekly for a two-hour meeting, for at least a couple months (and make a commitment – that alone is hard these days). Start with learning how to define fact and opinion, how to determine a valid source of information, how to build an argument based on facts – and this wouldn’t be pedantic; it would be the group agreeing through discussion (well, with some texts or lectures if they’d never done logic), what sources would count for fact-finding (and why) and what “arguments” were valid, which were ad-hominem, etc. And I could see using high schoolers to 1) write on white boards or type into laptops w/projector, so we could see where we were in discussion and 2) look things up on internet and report – and meanwhile they’d be learning how to discuss! It would be tough at first, but I think it could work, depending on who was in the group (there are some who simply want to shout their opinions – they would have to be directed out in the same way you don’t allow trolls online). There would have to be a neutral facilitator, to keep the discussion on track, to tally what the group has agreed on, and to point out where someone might be tangled up in emoting or circular thinking. But it might be that the group, over time, could rotate through the facilitator role. Having the white board/ laptop might help with another common obstacle – the over-abundance of data and the need to figure out if it’s worth reading! Establishing a group of reliable sources would eventually (hopefully) streamline the discussions w/o hobbling them. And just as important, learning how to judge the worthiness of a source. <br><br>I want to believe that there would be enough people even in a small town who would be capable and interested in having real discussions. In fact, I’m deeply disappointed that I’ve been so disabled recently that I simply don’t have the physical energy to try to start a group like this (have had to give up volunteering with the local food group due to disability)… I will still keep my eye out for some energetic younger person who might have the skills. Anyway, thanks for bringing up the topic, and I’ll look forward to seeing your ideas!<br><br><a href=#c6044151644991759105 title="comment permalink">12/13/12, 8:44 PM</a><br><br>

However what passes for education in North America has been failing to teach critical thinking for two generations now. I believe that there are rather many confluent causes for this, viz.:<br>For one, the introduction of all sorts of modern hypthetical ideas about education in the late 1960s that fell away from hard "reading, 'riting, and 'rithmetic" that was the backbone of education for over a hundred years and instead explored emotion-based learning, and the primacy of self-esteem, most of which failed. Apparently forcing children to learn grammar and spelling was akin to putting a straitjacket on creativity and indivituality; objective measures of ability were crushing to the budding spirits who couldn't cut the mustard. So for years, children have not been taught to read properly, to write properly, or to think properly, but to feel good about themselves anyway. (This does not work: real self-esteem derives from achievement.) I had the benefit of an education in Europe, where we spent hours in class, disecting sentence structure and exploring verbal conjugation. I don't think I was emotionally crushed and intellectually crippled; at least not by that.<br>I think another cause would be one I mentioned in passing a couple of weeks back, based on Wendell Barry’s writing about the industrialization of farming. What I realized is we've applied industrialization to education. Schools have become 12-year assembly-lines to process (valueless) raw material (young children) and produce sufficiently literate &amp; functional (value-added) workers and consumers (N.B. NOT citizens) ready to take their place in the economy. Any attempt to include civic virtues or instill ecological values or social awareness is derided as "social engineering" by people who were socially engineered to worship the great God Hy-Tek and his Holy Writ of Free-Market Industrial Economics that will make everyone infinitely wealthy forever. (ah, men!)<br>Yet another cause seems to me to be what Terry O'Reilly has explored over 5 years in his CBC radio program "The Age of Persuasion". At this end of the 20th Century, the art of persuading people through emotional manipulation has been so spectacularly effective at commerce that it has been applied everywhere, however inappropriate. But what works for inducing people to buy cars, sugar-pop, and i-thingys is definitely wrong for politics or activism. Emotional appeals create intense, intrasigent divisions. I suspect that is why fewer people bother to vote and why activists have been sidelined so effectively. Greenies do not -- cannot -- argue cogently, and industrialists are much, much better at manipulating fears.<br>Pop culture, i.e. TV and movies, is all about passive emotion and distraction. The Point of View changes about every 3 - 4 seconds. Everything wraps up neatly in an hour or so. The viewer must mentally jump from a show to disconnected ads and back and so on. People sleepwalk with their "smart" phones, continuously reading ‘tweets’ and emails and SMS and watching YouTube shorts.... all of which is inducing an ADHD-like mental state that directly militates against the concentration required to read and absorb a Lincoln and Douglas debate.<br>This list is not exhasutive, but I am exhausted, so I’ll leave other causes for your other readers to explore.<br><br><a href=#c1070718647560898096 title="comment permalink">12/14/12, 3:27 AM</a><br><br>

My husband and I were lucky to have good educations in the sense you are describing -- particularly mine, a great books curriculum -- so we fostered a certain type of family culture, and kept a lookout for good teachers, which I'm not sure is exactly an outlier, but is not in the broad middle swath of the bell-curve, either. <br><br>As a former rhetoric instructor in a community college, who taught logical fallacies in class, along with how to evaluate the messages we receive from the media--and there are tens of thousands like me, in other disciplines, too, working this way-- I am very aware of the dismal facts and statistics! <br><br>At my school, rhetoric is a required course. I dealt with the results of poor schooling every day; but it also felt at times like we instructors were trying to battle <i>an entire media-cized, mass-market-driven, anti-intellectual culture</i>, not just bad prior education. Yet in every class there were a few students who demonstrated a genuine love of learning and critical enquiry. <br><br>I believe that one purpose of education is to broaden horizons --intellectual, cultural-- and help free students from the habit of assessing information and their own habits of life from narrow, unconscious assumptions and pre-conceptions (cf the Socratic principle that inquiry can only really proceed fruitfully after first principles are examined). Many colleagues and I had to keep faith that the experience of our classes would have some kind of (minor) catalytic effect -- that was a guiding purpose, anyway. In a sense, I'm still doing the same thing, only in another field, and outside the classroom.<br><br>So I guess I am partly proving your point about the American system of education, but want to make sure the baby is not thrown out, too -- hoping readers understand that many teachers, departments, and even whole schools, <i>in</i> the system are frequently not <i>of</i> that system -- they are working to provide a real education in the face of daunting cultural headwinds. <br><br>I do look forward to your future posts on the subject.<br><br>Cheers,<br>aaf<br><br><a href=#c4220862050320705552 title="comment permalink">12/14/12, 7:33 AM</a><br><br>

I hope that these, and your discrepancies about, would give helpful for all of us: <br><br>1º) Democracy can be obsolete in the future: We don´t must forget that the concept of Democracy is based in the principle of Individual Freedom. Principle that is based in the supposition of inexistence of material limits for the activity of the individuals, supposition that will be not true in “The Long Descend” world.<br><br>2º) Socrates was illiterate: In accordance with my information Socrates, the Father of the Philosophy, didn´t knew to read. And, in those times, the books wrote by hand over parchment, was very expensive. Practically all the information that managed the Greek philosophers there would were been spoken.<br><br>3º) The Democracy crisis is caused for the crisis of the Education: The Democracy is a institution created for a industrial society (second wave civilization), and can´t work very well in a society based in the knowledge (third wave civilization ; Toffler). This is the cause of the actual crisis of the Democracy. <br>The same can be said of the actual educative institutions.<br><br>4) The stupefying of a part the American people is caused for the crisis of the educational system.<br>The stupefying of a part of the western population is consequence of the high level of specialization in the work, that provides the system with very efficient workers doing his specific job, but totally stupid in the rest of things of the life, different to consuming. The educational system has been adapted for this purpose, and the mass media cooperates in the increasing of this problem.<br><br>In various seasons of the TV series “Lost in the Tribe” you´ll can see stupid and emotionally infantilized white men living with clever and emotionally equilibrated natives, with a Paleolithic economy or Neolithic economy, depending of the season. Any of these natives never has gone to a school, and they are illiterate.<br><br>6) Respect the now called “global climate change” and before “global warming”, I think that is totally unfunded to speak over a global warming caused for the humankind. During “Medieval Climatic Optimum” the temperature was higher than now and there was no industry. An important part of the climate variations are caused for the variation of sun activity, that depends of the relative position of the big planets of the sun system. In accordance with this, in 2014 will start a small ice age (Khalibulo Abdusamatov).<br><br><a href=#c1378451043599523490 title="comment permalink">12/14/12, 8:49 AM</a><br><br>

Thus your point stands.’<br><br>I’m sorry but as a WWII nut I couldn’t let this pass! From ‘Last year of the Luftwaffe’ by Alfred Price: <br><br>It has become part of the accepted wisdom about the Luftwaffe that Hitler's decision was instrumental in preventing the large-scale deployment of the Me 262 in the fighter force. In fact his edict was not the main reason, or even a major reason, for the failure to deploy the fighter in the hoped for numbers. Not until August 1944 was the average running life of the 004 jet engine raised to 25hr; that was still a very low figure, but it meant that the design could be frozen and mass production could begin. In September Hitler rescinded his order that all new Me 262s be delivered as fighter-bombers. By then more than a hundred fighter airframes were sitting around without engines, and as soon as 004s became available these aircraft were completed and delivered to the Luftwaffe. In fact Hitler's order delayed the introduction of the Me 262 into service in the fighter role by only about three weeks. For the real reason for the failure to deploy the fighter in large numbers, we must look elsewhere.<br><br><br><a href=#c2375733042968662012 title="comment permalink">12/14/12, 9:08 AM</a><br><br>

In fact, it has deep roots. In 1642, Puritan minister John Cotton wrote "the more learned and witty you bee, the more fit to act for Satan will you bee." The roots are partly religious, partly due to Americans' suspicion of any kind of elitism, partly based on a narrow pragmatism. I question, by the way, whether the Lincoln-Douglas debates really were understood or intended for the mass of farmers and workers in Illinois or whether they were aimed instead at the educated legal and political community of Springfield, the state capital. <br><br>However, most commentators agree that anti-intellectualism and anti-rationalism have grown in the United States since the mid-20th century. The consensus is, as I would have guessed, that this is due to the displacement of text (and especially printed text) by video. Television, dominated as it is by advertising and entertainment meant for passive consumption, numbs critical-thinking skills to the point of atrophy. Celebrity culture, another by-product of TV, encourages the idea that success and value are a function of one's looks and style rather than one's mental abilities.<br><br>How can Americans be convinced to cultivate critical thinking skills as long as they are glued to their TVs?<br><br><a href=#c649318223747788432 title="comment permalink">12/14/12, 10:27 AM</a><br><br>

(First sentence, pretty much: "Puer capram amabat", illustrating the imperfect, I presume in its progressive rather than in its habitual meaning - "The boy was loving the goat." <br><br>Some time after I left Monash, Betts REWROTE the ancient book, and now it is available, surely in all big bookstores in Canada, under Betts's name. Having worked through the new, Betts-authored, "Teach Yourself Latin" a few years ago, I can report that despite its moderate pagecount it fully addresses everything needed in Latin 101, including oratio obliqua and sequence of tenses and scansion. With that book finished, one can with full confidence tackle texts, and I indeed found it useful to plod forward on the normal path, reading one full book of Caesar's "de Bello Gallico" (the one that starts by telling you Gallia is divided into three parts; in Monash second year we had had, rather, Sallust, Catullus, and one book of the Aeneid). I also found it helpful to get the big fat new Betts-and-Franklin book of 555 fully conjugated Latin verbs. <br><br>Latin is exciting in EXACTLY the same way as Morse code is: you struggle, with much crashing of static and much cursing of your own ineptitude, to get important messages from weird and distant writers.

Also, they were designed so that you had to have a perfect command of the methods and reasoning to complete the problem sets. <br><br>How to calculate the volume of a sphere, for instance, is a useful skill, but it hardly expands the mind. How to *prove logically* that one or another of the standard formulae is correct is quite another matter, and far more significant for all that makes us fully human. <br><br>One of the more profound mystical experiences of my life happened in my senior year of high school, at the moment I had finished working through and understanding one of those proofs of the volume of a sphere, as given in our textbook.<br><br>This particular proof showed that the volume of a sphere of radius R was exactly the same as: the volume of an upright cylinder of height 2R and radius R, minus the volume of two upright cones, each of height R and radius R. Any cross-section of a sphere, of course, is circular, whereas any right cross-section of a cone through its vertex is a triangle, and a similar cross-section of a cylinder is a rectangle, with straight lines for all its sides. Yet the careful combination of those triangles and rectangles comes out the same as a circle.<br><br>I still remember the awe and wonder that such a thing not only *could* be true, but *must* be true. <br><br>The poet Lew Welch pegged such an experience when he wrote of "all the wonder of all the planets striking all your only mind"!<br><br><br><br><a href=#c5302454608142644638 title="comment permalink">12/14/12, 2:07 PM</a><br><br>

The "art of persuasion" could develop in new and far more powerful ways in the '50s, once television became a fixture in nearly every household. At the time, when I was in junior high school, lots of us were reading a book by one Vance Packard, titled _The Hidden Persusaders_, predicting such a development. <br><br>But Packard's book was focused on the contents and techniques of various advertising campaigns, whether on TV or in some other medium. Hardly anyone, back in the '50s, foresaw any of the following:<br><br>(a) just how superior TV was over print or speech as a means of persuasion, <br><br>(b) how easy it would be to vary the amplitudes of light and sound ("loudness" and "brightness") rhythmically on TV so as to produce a light and somewhat addictive trance state in the viewers, <br><br>(c) that this trance state would, as a side effect, render TV viewers more suggestible than they would otherwise have been, or<br><br>(d) that this induced suggestibility lasts quite a while after the TV has been turned off, though it does eventually weaken if not reinforced. <br><br>Now, of course, these things are much better understood not only in advertising, but by many people in the on-line gaming industry. The latter industry has -- or so I have been told by one or two of my former students who now work in it -- even held a few invitational conferences to develop greater expertise along those lines. <br><br>Note that this side effect has nothing whatever to do with the particular content of any TV show or the particular scene and story of any game. The only way to avoid it, IMHO, is to do as JMG has done and refuse to have a TV set at all, no matter what shows one might watch. One can't avoid the trance-inducing effect by watching only high-toned shows on public channels.<br><br><a href=#c1270502220699702902 title="comment permalink">12/14/12, 2:37 PM</a><br><br>

His suggestion is to send young adults into the fields, into the mines, into the factories, etc... waging the war of "progress." I think he hit on something there with adult education. My wife benefited greatly from her stint with Americorps. I think that a future program could include an organized manual labor force for organic agriculture, when modern factory farming declines.

(you could just keep going on this line)<br>- How do you mix the ingredients?<br>- How long does it need to sit and why?<br>- Do you cut the pasta into spaghetti or sheets and how do you do this?<br>- What vegetables are in season to put into the topping?<br><br>It just goes on and on... A producer has to think differently than a consumer and the above example was kept simple.<br><br>The consumer has to worry about how to obtain the ready to consume product and then how to handle that product in such a way as to make it an acceptable consumption.<br><br>The education system really reflects society and as with the government, we get the system that we expect.<br><br>The more self sufficient I become here, the more I have to setup systems and then observe how they interact with myself and the world and then at that point I can maintain them, modify them, alter them, scrap them etc.<br><br>Dunno, but I reckon hungry people might get to exercise those critical thinking skills in short order?

It can however be sufficient for some technology if we look very hard at that bit of the real world while changing it. I can think of a few examples of the latter; the early breeding of corn, tomato and potato in the Americas; or the ancient development of throwing-blades on the near-glacial tundra before 20K years BP, requiring exquisite optimisation and replication. We can note also over time and in different places several of the metallurgies and ceramics and textiles. Abstraction however of logic for example to geometry did not of itself solve basic understanding of motion under the influence of gravity (Aristotle was a block on the path). Similarly, advanced logical disputation if I understand it, gave Christianity a rather odd set of dogmas historically; apparently capable of contradiction but not resolution. The Christian dogmatic cosmology, or its underlying assumptions, emerged it seems as another stumbling block.<br><br>Perhaps USA, like most places, suffers from the hangover of earlier unresolved assumptions and dogmas, whether connected by newspapers or TV or electronic pulpits? We are not actually individuals – we live according to group norms. How these norms are perceived or imagined is highly variable, and can be idiosyncratic for an individual of course, but I found this a very enjoyable canter <i>Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism</i> by Benedict Anderson. Then there are the amazing results of group think on our ‘fuzzies’; on our hopes and fears: our semi-conscious reactions to ‘prophecy’, ‘foretelling’ (not just apocalypse revealed to the very odd ego), ‘destiny’ and to other notions of who or what we might be. Whether these come via TV or through the newspaper, or ‘round the water-cooler’, we do as others do, or take sides, collectively shifting with the flock. <br><br>Education in England, (Scotland a little different) was very poor in my day and poorer in my parents’ day. It was predicated on producing an elite privileged class above a barely literate class of ‘hewers of wood and carriers of water’. The latter existence was deemed a necessary acknowledgement of the unequal distribution of faculties according to ‘nature’. Compulsory educational provision erected serious hurdles to schooling and aimed to restrict access to higher levels of knowledge (and provided for either privileged or competitive access to ‘British’ versions of ‘classical’ thinking and ‘excellence’) and saw itself much as a way to manage an empire, or an army, or an industry, or whatever; or to lend virtue to a privileged life. It was arranged that if you could jump the hurdles or show prowess of certain kinds, you would get some recognition and reward in our highly stratified society. The ‘elite’ had some strange assumptions about intelligence and ‘breeding’ and sought justification in undigested ‘bad’ science for their grouping of privilege according to ‘caste’. If this sounds a bit like a ‘leftie’ rant, I suppose it could be, but I actually lived this system and apparently survived within its rules.<br><br> I prefer to look back to the British ‘Corresponding Societies’ of the 19thC and the mutual self-help and education groups that informed our British working class in all our provincial centres. I am reminded recently of the great autodidact English writer William Cobbett in the early 19thC writing for early versions of this ‘reform-minded’ constituency. As a child and occasionally since I have caught a glimpse of the same agrarian past he described, in particular in one of his <i>Rural Rides</i>; the Valley of the Avon. It was very beautiful despite the plight of the labouring poor just before the ‘Labourer’s Revolt’ of 1830 during the painful transition to industrialisation.<br><br>best<br>Phil<br><br><a href=#c6455651775523739037 title="comment permalink">12/15/12, 5:21 AM</a><br><br>

Simply put: As you define it "democracy" is a characteristic that all governments have some quantity of and so it is a question of democracy is a quantitative rather than a qualitative inquiry, and secondly that too much democracy can be a bad thing, that there is an ideal portion where going beyond neither preserves civil liberties nor good governance.<br><br>As I understand you defining democracy from previous posts, you aren't talking so much about a form of government so much as the ability of individuals to participate in the formation of policy. The question then becomes not whether individuals have an opportunity but how much of one there is. There is less of an opportunity in North Korea than in the US for example, and we like to think there is more opportunity in the US than in Iran (but I am not convinced).<br><br>Now I should also say I have lived in a few places in the world, and so some of the news stories I can mention are ones where I know people who have been directly impacted. I have essentially lived in Ecuador for a few months, and in Indonesia for a couple of years.<br><br>One thing I have noticed is that while countries with very little democracy are very bad at doing some things, very democratic countries tend to be very bad at doing other things. More autocratic governments can more easily invest in infrastructure, because they face less backlash from raising the taxes required. This isn't to say they always do, but they often do. Compare Malaysia to Indonesia for example there. More democratic governments tend to be better at civil liberties as you say. So the biggest question is where the best ratio is, autocratic enough that things that need to get done get done, while democratic enough that the government doesn't run roughshod over everybody.<br><br><a href=#c7417813683131998387 title="comment permalink">12/15/12, 6:59 AM</a><br><br>

It all depends on what sort of self and what sort of life you are going to craft for yourself. As Theodore Szasz once wrote, "the self is not something one finds, it is something one creates." <br><br>In addition to the taste for mathematics that I mentioned in an earlier posting, I happen to have a taste for anything that has been dismissed and forgotten by our modern world, or which our modern world hates to think about -- obsolete crafts, or ancient manuscripts, or obscure languages (or magic!). So for me, it made sense to learn Latin and Greek as well as various modern languages. You may not share that antiquarian taste of mine, so modern languages may suit you far better than Greek or Latin.<br><br>However, developing a really high-level competence in a foreign language (whether living or dead) does do something important for any person that even philosophy cannot bring home to a student. The process of truly mastering any foreign language teaches one just how much the language one uses shapes the habitual contours and patterns of one's thoughts. The multilingual speaker has a somewhat different personality from one of his languages to another. In Szasz's terms, your native language constrains the sort of self you are able to craft for yourself. Of course, one can become aware of these constraints and set out to break them deliberately. And that is where a deep philosophical awareness of oneself and one's place in the universe begins. If you learn a living foreign language really well, you have not only a tool for communicating and communing with others, but also a very powerful tool for carrying out the wise old command given long ago at Delphi: "Know yourself!"<br><br><a href=#c5520954578950924038 title="comment permalink">12/15/12, 11:27 AM</a><br><br>

To make it more concrete, I suspect that one cause of emotional speech invading where reason and thought ought to prevail may be that emotional speech has been dislodged from its own territory. People have a need for emotional exchange and development, and if it's not being met, it will force its way into other sorts of exchange where it doesn't belong-- political reasoning, systems thinking, the classroom, etc. Spiritual needs likewise. Someone who has secure access to venues for talking in the emotional mode will be more likely to calm down and become receptive to critical thinking techniques.<br><br>It suggests to me the need for something along the lines of Steiner's threefolding concept. Making space for people to talk about their emotions and be heard intelligently would help ease the pressure on discussion that should be reasoned. It's arguably a necessary correlate to teaching critical thinking skills. This to me is the third factor and way out of the thinking vs. feeling binary.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c5466320830766913946 title="comment permalink">12/15/12, 3:01 PM</a><br><br>

It's impossible to prove a hypothetical like that, but the theoretical "Gore-wouldn't-have-done-that" Presidency is one of the weakest, least supportable hypotheticals I have ever heard. First of all, remember who was Gore's VP candidate -- Joe Lieberman, one of the most hawkish politicians of the Empire, who in the time since 2000 has sided with the Republicans on violence issues (as well as corporate/deregulation issues) more times than most people care to count. Doesn't _that_ tell us anything about what a Gore Adminstration would have been like? Also, as explained in <a href=http://prospect.org/article/smart-bomb rel=nofollow>this article from the left-leaning American Prospect</a>, which I recommend highly, Al Gore on Wednesday Sept. 12th (like any Democrat in that position) would have faced tremendous pressure from the Republicans to prove he was not soft on defense -- and Al has a history of caving in to such provocations. Al was often one of the most hawkish politicians supporting Clinton's "low-level bombing" and starvation campaign against Iraq anyway. If you imagine this alternate history with both the Republicans and his own VP baying like dogs for Iraqi blood, it seems ludicrous to believe Al would have picked a much different course than George. In fact, the real danger is that Al would have articulated and defended the wars much more eloquently and persuasively than Georgie did, pushing mainstream Dems further and faster down the road to becoming the "me-too-War-party" where we find them today.<br><br>To Angus Wallace -- my parents sent me to a Jesuit high school where I chose Latin as my language requirement. Not only did that result in a facility with languages where I can get the gist of what people say in four different modern Romance languages, but it also is a huge help in deciphering scientific and technical terms. It broadens my English vocabulary immensely because I can understand and remember a huge number of obscure or scholarly English words that have their roots in Latin. It's one of the things about high school that I least regret...<br><br><a href=#c7744286808540186890 title="comment permalink">12/15/12, 6:22 PM</a><br><br>

For instance, to argue that the millworkers of 1860 were better informed critical thinkers than the college-educated of 2012 is possibly true -- to my mind, almost certainly true -- but it makes the implicit argument that we need to somehow "go back" to having educated millworkers (or receptionists or WalMart greeters or whatever equivalence you want to draw.)<br><br>The problem is that an overwhelming historical process took us from being smart to being dumb. It didn't happen quickly, and it didn't happen in isolation from other social changes that reinforce and reward dumb over smart. Consequently, you can't wave a "charter school" stick at it and make it go away.<br><br>My wife recently went through some medical procedures that brought the whole system into focus for me. Let me digress briefly and come back.<br><br>The only real reason for doing business at all is the "intangibles" -- the overall improvement in individual and community quality of life. As a civilization, however, we've become obsessed with the "tangibles," specifically the money, which is the single least-important aspect of business. All business success is now measured strictly in terms of money.<br><br>That means that the best business is one which provides cheapened products at high prices; ideally no product at all yet produces large amounts of income. Hence, the financialization of the US economy.<br><br>Businesses that have been unable to transform themselves into financial scams and still must deal in hard goods have discovered that mass markets are more profitable than quirky local markets. Marketing to the masses is a bit different from marketing to the quirky locals. The mass market is almost entirely emotional, is driven by price rather than quality, thrives on misinformation, and quickly becomes unshakably brand-loyal.<br><br>This is precisely what you are describing in politics. <br><br>I don't know if you followed any of the "back-room politics" behind this last presidential campaign, but the people in the back rooms were quants, working with computer models of likely voters and how to entice them to show up for the Fire Sale they were hosting on their candidates on November 6. The 2012 election was strictly a marketing event. Coke beat out Pepsi.<br><br>The state-sponsored educational system exists to support the civilization. The primary/secondary system is itself measured in monetary costs versus test scores. The universities are profit-centers. Bothcater to the mass market rather than the quirky local market of what my father used to call "college-educated eggheads," offering cheapened product at the highest prices the market will bear..<br><br>I see this as a natural consequence of the success of our imperial aspirations. We have too much, and it all comes too easily, so there is no real need for effort -- only the need to jump through arbitrary social hoops that maintain the difference between the rich and the poor, all of which have nothing to do with critical thinking and everything to do with acquiring patronage.<br><br>If that's so, then probably the only solution is to move forward into the inevitable collapse of the imperial system that supports dumb over smart, and returns some natural advantage to those who can think clearly.<br><br>Is there any other course forward that doesn't involve collapse?

That was done by the 105th congress in 1999, controlled by Republicans after the 1994 "Republican Revolution" that recaptured both the Senate and the House, the House for the first time since 1952. Clinton's only involvement was his failure to veto the Gramm-Leach-Biley Act that repealed Glass-Steagall.<br><br>Since we're talking about critical thinking here, there IS a difference between Congress and the Presidency: and critical thinking involves (among other things) making distinctions where there is a difference.<br><br>For instance, everyone was worried about whether Romney would or wouldn't raise taxes on the rich. Newsflash: he would do neither. Congress sets the tax rates, not the President. Elect a tax-the-rich President and a tax-the-poor Congress, and the poor will get taxed.<br><br>I often see broad-brush diatribes against Republicans or Democrats based on particular events that occur under presidential administrations, that have nothing whatsoever to do with the President, and everything to do with Congress. You cannot blame legislative failures of a Democratic Congress on a Republican President. You cannot blame administrative failures of a Republican President on a Democratic Congress. At least not if you want to pretend to be engaged in critical thinking.<br><br>William Clinton had two years of honeymoon with a Democrat-controlled congress, and fought bitterly with a Republican-controlled Congress for the next six years -- which included a full impeachment trial over having engaged in (gasp) sex.<br><br>George Bush inherited a Republican-controlled Congress and sailed through six years of rubber-stamping before he faced the Democrat Overthrow in 2006, at which point his administration basically fell apart.<br><br>Barack Obama inherited a Democrat-controlled Congress and then tripped over another "Republican Revolution" two years later that gave him the Party of No, and which set as its top national priority preventing Obama from taking a second term.<br><br><a href=#c118473770666482985 title="comment permalink">12/16/12, 10:49 AM</a><br><br>

However Glass Steagal was such a vital matter that Clinton's failure to veto it was a gross deriliction of duty. <br><br>A Republican President and Democrat Congress might well be better than vice versa.<br><br>But part of the reason for the Republican Congress of 2010 was that many people were disillusioned and didn't vote. That's what gave the GOP their majority rather than a huge surge in the GOP vote.<br><br>Why were they so disillusioned? Because of Obama's failure to deliver. Obama could have used his campaign mailing list to motivate people to campaign for reforms and lobby their congresscrittur. He could have called for demonstrations down the Mall to counter the Tea Pary. Instead he caved in to the blue dog Dems rather than confront them. There was no equivalent of FDR's fireside chats. <br><br>It's a great pity that all the Federal elections don't take place at the same time once every four years. That way you would be less likely to get one party controlling Congress and the other the White House leading to gridlock. Administrations are often unpopular in midterm making it more likely that Congress will change hands. <br><br>Anyway the main point stands which is that it is by no means certain that a GOP president will always be so much worse than a blue dog Dem as to make a third party counterproductive. As long as progressives give in to Democratic blackmail and allow the Dems a monopoly of the anti GOP vote I believe it will be much harder to make significant progress.<br><br><a href=#c6042248099289407112 title="comment permalink">12/16/12, 3:17 PM</a><br><br>

(For example, observe the ideological preoccupation among educators in the inner city to "connect to their world" or "embrace street smarts" and contrast this with the rigorous highbrow acculturation and education in urban immigrant schools before WWII.)<br><br>Note how frequently the term "elitist" is used to deem any careful intellect as highly suspicious, as well as to dismiss any highbrow practice/behavior as evil. I.e.: vulgar people are implicitly told that they are already 'perfect' and that education that would corrupt this "ideal' or "authentic" condition would be quite wrong. Note also the contemporary obsession with emotional <a href=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2012/09/why-american-students-cant-write/3412/ rel=nofollow>"creativity"</a> and impulsive "originality" in favor of the traditional practice of studying precedent, structure, logic, and order.)<br><br>Basically our children aren't learning anything because they're not actually being taught anything! They're simply trained to rely on spur-of-the-moment emotion because this is supposedly "authentic." A previous commenter protested that humans are not robots and will always have an emotional element: Absolutely, but reining in emotions (acknowledging when they might begin to distort behavior and responding in kind) is something that everyone still should do (this is the old highbrow lesson of impulse control, basically, now utterly politically incorrect).<br><br><a href=#c8910730288158139842 title="comment permalink">12/16/12, 3:25 PM</a><br><br>

I meant to send the comments here.<br><br>In Vermont we may still have some of the skills needed for effective local democracy, although they are certainly atrophying a bit. Most towns in Vermont still hold an annual meeting each March. The voters of the town assemble and spend a few hours working through an agenda, approving a series of articles that center mostly on the town budget, Town officers are also elected at that time (this is done by an all-day balloting rather than by a floor vote). The Town Meetings here are still somewhat functional, although the level of discourse does sometimes descend to the level of internet blogs and unfortunately most of the big decisions that effect us get made in Montpelier or Washington or a corporate headquarters. It does, however, give us some practice at group decision-making. From these meetings I know what it's like to rise from my seat and face my neighbors and try to make a cogent argument in a short amount of time. I get practice at listening to people I disagree with. I've also learned what it's like to have my great idea voted down and yet to still work hard to be civil to my opponents, who may well support me at another time. This ancient system actually does still work and I hope we here in Vermont can find it within ourselves to keep the old system functioning.<br><br>JMG, the adult education idea sounds like a very important one and I'm looking forward to seeing what you have to say. The suggestion made in the comments to find a way to distribute the best of the old texts is a good one. Dover Books has indeed served for many decades as the prime source for many old classics in science, math, technology, and many other fields.<br><br>I'll toss out one example of a fine, not very old book that is useful for self-instruction. My vote for the best calculus is not, however a Dover Book; Sylvanus P. Thompson and Martin Gardner's Calculus Made Easy (St. Martins Press, 1998) is a revision of Thompson's old classic from 1910. Very clearly written and quite a comprehensive treatment of elementary calculus.<br><br>I would encourage those interested in this sort of revival of the texts to use, but do not depend on, the electronic media and the internet. If things go seriously awry, we're not going to be surfing any web and actual books would be incredibly valuable.<br><br><a href=#c3438069060932105591 title="comment permalink">12/16/12, 4:43 PM</a><br><br>

I know that's heresy to utter, but that's my call. <br><br>Justin, whatever the deficits of East Asian educational systems, they don't graduate people from high school who are functionally illiterate, more than functionally innumerate, completely ignorant of history, never exposed to any of the significant literature and art of their own culture, and unable to find their hometowns on a map. The US system does this quite routinely.

This system contains grammar and logic. Therefore, to truly be able to speak and understand French, one has to learn grammar. To truly understand French culture, one also has to study grammar, because the logic of grammar is the logic of the culture. French is punctual. French is intellectual. French is philosophical. France is maybe the only country where you can say with pride, if people ask you what you do for a living: "Je suis un intellectuel", whereupon many doors will open for you!<br>I used to teach French and English to young students in a Waldorf school, when we still lived in Europe (Netherlands). It was remarkable to see how dyslectic children were either fond of English (auditive) or French (logical), but hardly of the two together, because the languages required different learning skills. (And of course, some dyslectic children were not fond of languages at all, but spread out talents in math, entrepreneurship, art or architecture.)<br>In the US, I was at first impressed by the French textbook my eldest daughter needed for class. But soon, I realised it was not properly used, if used at all. I started to doubt the quality of the lessons. My daughter did French at AP-level on one of the, presumably, best high schools in Massachusetts. She brought home the final AP-exam, so that I could see what it was like. There were more than sixty mistakes in the questions formulated by the teacher, all grammatical or spelling mistakes. That is when we had proof that American top education was mythical. We also investigated universities for her, in this country, in Canada, and in Europe. We looked at internet ranking lists (biased towards American universities) and visited several, among them Berkeley in California ("Here, we will teach you everything about competitiveness and leadership"), McGill in Montréal, Dalhousie in Halifax, the University of Edinburgh, and the one my daughter would choose: the University of York, England. The level of the Environmental Science department in this modest university is remarkably high, but no big fuss is made of it. The professor stated it as follows: "At this department, we mainly potter about", which was a very British understatement for the best labs one could wish for, the highest amount of international connections and a great international student body, mainly from Europe and Asia. My daughter is specialising in soils, which must give great joy to some of the commentators here - I am thinking of Cherokee Organics in particular -.<br><br>http://www.york.ac.uk/environment/about/<br>http://www.york.ac.uk/environment/news-events/news/qs-rankings/<br><br>Both my husband and I have enjoyed our education at universities in the Netherlands. After six years of old-style French lessons in secondary school, I studied the language at university, which added three more years of profound education. We had grammar three times a week, spelling twice, and got lots of homework. Looking back on those years, it was blood, sweat and tears. But I loved it. And the result is that I am free to build whatever discourse I wish, on whichever topic, be it in writing or speech, and use the correct verb conjugations. I understand French thought and reasoning, and can even quarrel in French!<br>In this country, I have refused to teach, because I felt I had to compromise too much. I miss it, but a time will come when I can pick it up again, dust it off and do what I always loved to do, for students who appreciate it.<br><br><a href=#c6651768018046115061 title="comment permalink">12/16/12, 7:51 PM</a><br><br>

Maybe you can clarify.<br><br>I'll confess that I often read your post, then the comments, and the result is sometimes a muddle of what you and what other people have said. Let's go back to a direct quote from your post:<br><br>"That’s among the many reasons why devising a framework for adult education outside the grip of the current American education industry is one of the most pressing needs of the decade or two right ahead of us."<br><br>This is a pressing need? Why? I don't understand.<br><br>I think we're in full agreement that "this is what collapse looks like." It isn't that the educational system tripped over a rock and brought everything down. The educational system doesn't teach critical thinking because critical thinking isn't valued: there is no reward within the empire for learning this skill, and no punishment for failing to do so. If anything, the rewards and punishments are reversed. [ref: see Donald Trump.]<br><br>I don't see that changing in the next decade or two, and I don't think you've implied that it will. We're at Hubbert's Peak right now, meaning oil is plentiful. Fracking is going to happen -- combined with government subsidies overt and covert, it will keep the price of oil low for at least another decade. There will be no place within the empire to exercise critical thinking in the next decade or two: no more so than there is now, and probably much less.<br><br>So what is this preparing for? At what point in the collapse does critical thinking suddenly come back into vogue, and why is the next decade or two so important?<br><br>We could found Schools of Critical Thinking right now. I don't see where the students would come from.<br><br><a href=#c2406931433910693245 title="comment permalink">12/16/12, 8:04 PM</a><br><br>

In my experience very young children learn easily. You have to work hard to stop them, but we generally do stop them. Primary education that is effectively childcare and crowd control will do the job nicely.<br>My children learned at home for their first ten and eight years. We spent a lot of time not doing formal schoolwork. They asked a lot of questions and I tried to help them find the answers. It wasn't easy and I can't see how you could do this effectively with a class of thirty. We read a lot of books and did a lot of things together.<br>They went to (a Steiner) school later so that they could meet other children and make friends as rural Worcestershire was not full of homeschooling families. Both are now at university and working hard to achieve what they want to. Neither demonstrates any cynicism about learning, so popular in school-taught children for the reasons noted in the John Taylor Gatto book mentioned earlier.<br>Of course there is no easy answer for bulk education. I had enough money available to be able to spend time with my children. I spent a lot of time reading and researching myself, which provided a model for them. Education by conversation is very time consuming and resource intensive but I would contend that if you want adults to be life-long learners, assisting them in self-directed learning as children works very well.<br><br><a href=#c6536601606430187339 title="comment permalink">12/17/12, 1:08 AM</a><br><br>

In Europe ideologies weren't all warm/fuzzy either -- you can use "cold prickly" just as well for this. Simply tar whatever "holds back natural humanity" with the cold prickly brush.<br><br>The extreme left wing of May '68 in France set up a Rousseauish rhetoric about the repression of the natural. Nothing good could happen without dynamite to blow away the bad dead structures. It went beyond taking a good idea too far -- it became an ideocratic orthodoxy. Anything a dead white male had invented, such as thinking, and history, was seen as something shovelled on top of minds to stop them working properly.<br><br>The irony is that if you use such ideas the <i>right</i> way, they are excellent ideas. So much modern psychology confirms what JMG put forward in his series on magic -- to bring out a real person you need to bring out an identity separate from the social one. <br><br>That got warped into an attempt to inaugurate the perfect groupmind that cultivates an actualised human being automatically. A millennium. We didn't vote for communism but we felt the wind. If you were against it, you weren't committed enough. You were the problem. There's still plenty of this around here, I see it in many of the student protests about higher education ironically. Nothing like thinking you're right to halt the process of thinking.<br><br>There was real desperation in it. And it was often driven by environmental considerations -- we've screwed the world up, therefore whatever got us here was bad. Even thinking itself could be bad. <br><br>I think of Carl Rogers, who did everything right when it comes to bringing humans out of their shells and making them think about who they are in an atmosphere of trust. He was quite correct that this is a "natural" process, if it's encouraged to take place, and that such encouragement is never automatically forthcoming in a society -- you need to set aside time to develop the human.<br><br>And his ideas are extremely helpful for the kinds of thing Richard Clyde is mentioning too, the ability to have a real arena for feeling which helps thought. Somehow all that got warped into, everything we've used to built all we have <i>was just</i> an attempt to repress.<br><br>It never got quite as bad as the Chinese cultural revolution, but on a deep level I often was really distressed at this stuff without ever being able to put my finger on it. So many teachers just accepted it. Deep down it was driven by a sense that the culture had already failed, I think, and these men and women who were supposed to tell us how to live were actually washing their hands of that business and saying, you ignorant kids know more than us in your pristineness.<br><br><a href=#c519250590138248754 title="comment permalink">12/17/12, 4:59 AM</a><br><br>

In fact, civic engagement and democratic participation remains, at its core, the reason that most universities keep a general education curriculum (despite substantial pressure from vocationally-oriented students to change it). The problem with higher ed, though, is that few of these classes exist, and even fewer are sought by students willingly (I know, I teach some of them). I don't blame this entirely on higher ed, but rather the larger system that places monetary gain as sacred over all else. How am I, in a short 15 week semester, supposed to shift students' thinking about rhetoric and democracy in ways that have been ingrained in them since they were old enough to speak? Its a tough order, to say the least. <br><br>You are right about developing alternative means to educate our citizenry (especially as access to higher education becomes more and more restricted).<br><br><a href=#c6778386046096398779 title="comment permalink">12/17/12, 8:27 AM</a><br><br>

It is not too soon to start working on a "framework," I think.<br><br>Before we start devising alternate schools for adult learners, or even establishing any kind of system for such schools, in our age of ever greater deindustrialization, we should have a serious, deeply thoughtful conversation about such things as the following (in no particular order):<br><br>(1) which adults will these schools try to serve, and which adults will reject their offerings, and why? <br><br>(2) since it is impossible to serve all the varied needs and desires of would-be adult learners with finite resources, which learners should be the focus of a given school's service, and why these particular would-be learners rather than some other learners? <br><br>(3) what things should these schools teach, and what things should they refuse to teach even if there should be a strong adult demand for them, and why?<br><br>(5) is there a clear order and progression to some or all of the courses that such schools should offer (in which case the courses will form a coherent curriculum), and why or why not?<br><br>and so forth.<br><br>Who wants to start this conversation now?<br><br><a href=#c4948856233501953627 title="comment permalink">12/17/12, 3:14 PM</a><br><br>

A case in point that has come up several times: GITMO. Obama was elected to close it. He reneged. Why? <i>We don't know.</i> We will likely never know.

Of course they do - remember that information in the technical sense has nothing to do with meaning and that the maximum amount of information is actually to be found in pure noise. It's therefore just natural that the Information Age looks indistinguishably like the Age of Random Noise!<br><br>It seems clear enough that these tools affect our ability to think. One factor is the impact on attention. TV and computers easily entice the attention away from present reality and all its messiness, and building real democracy means dealing with messiness. There's also the thaumaturgy-friendly effects of multitasking.<br><br>Still, I've come to think that the modern IT tools influence not just how (or how well) we think but what we think, or can think, as well. As Owen Barfield wrote, depth and accuracy of expression are polar opposites, and by focusing exclusively on the one pole we inevitably weaken both until we end up with fuzzy thinking about nothing much. TV and computers force us to focus on accuracy (or structure) - they accept any meaning as long as it's formatted in the right way.<br><br>None of this is inevitable, of course, but countering it does require a sustained effort to engage with meaning.

The best way, I think, is an underground, secretive network of wise men and women, inclined always to subvert whatever paradigm is dominant at the moment and weaken whatever coercive institutions of consensus that our species will have built.

So here's more of the answer you asked for, as I see things -- put a little more bluntly than I usually like to do.<br><br>(1) When the going gets rough (and it's mostly been rough throughout human history) our species' instinct seems to be to band together, form a hierarchy, and obey whoever climbs to the top of the hierarchy. It's been an extremely successful instinctive strategy, as our current multi-billion population count shows. It feels safe and yields a lot of group security.<br><br>But it has its major downside, too, namely the population growth that comes from its very success -- which is what we're experiencing now. So a top priority, as I see things, is to challenge that instinct whenever it kicks in, to subvert it at its root. That kind of fundamental subversion is pretty much always a job for a network of otherwise unconnected individuals or small groups of individuals, working in secret, with stealth and subtlety. One of the most effective weapons of this sort of subversion have the ability to nurture critical thinking in others. Another is to make all kinds of non-conformity look sexy and powerful. A taste for dissensus helps a lot also.<br><br>(2) The point isn't to keep as many people alive as possible. (Neither is it to kill people.) The point is something entirely different, namely, to insist on certain things that go beyond the lives and deaths of individual people AND also thwart our natural instinct that says, "Increase and multiply" at any cost. Instead, we should be able to think hard about what we are doing whenever that instinct kicks in.<br><br>(3) As for lack of information, what we do know -- to build on your example -- is that Obama is nothing more than a human being like the rest of us, which means he is no better and no worse than most of us. (No leader ever is.) <br><br>That is enough information to think critically about (a) what Obama is up to, treason or statesmanship, and (b) what sense there is, if any, of asking whether his decision to keep GITMO open is right or wrong, wise or foolish. Questions of that sort are relatively short-range ones, and they assume (perhaps unconsciously) it will be business as usual in the US a hundred years from now, so that GITMO might somehow ultimately matter to us and our descendents. It won't, not when 95% of us and our descendants are dead without further issue, and gardening has become far more important than politicking.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c2213837392509421408 title="comment permalink">12/18/12, 1:15 PM</a><br><br>

I don't think I'll live to see the end of the Age of Oil. My children might, and my grandchildren very likely will. So long as oil reigns, our inflated standard of living will persist -- again, barring a catastrophic fold in our destiny. That will almost certainly cover the next two decades that are the subject of my question.<br><br>Anyone who actually wants an education in critical thinking right now can easily obtain one. There are plenty of excellent books, and reprints of all the classics, from Aristotle to pick-your-contemporary-logician. Go to any university and take two years of physics. Take a course in formal logic. It's all out there.<br><br>The problem is that the general culture does not value critical thinking, and the powers-that-be benefit from its absence. There are no social forces available to push people to get such an education, on their own initiative or through state compulsion.<br><br>I don't see that reversing in the next twenty years. In particular, I see no possibility of applying critical thinking to the “democracy” of the next twenty years. The vast majority of US Americans think they are currently engaged in democracy by watching one of the presidential debates and voting. They don't need no stinkin' thinkin'. The few who try to think about candidates and issues are faced with misinformation, disinformation, no information, and their numbers aren't even big enough to be called “negligible.”<br><br>Even on the local level -- especially on the local level -- a huge number of people think that “democracy” means getting involved so that you can look out for your own interests, and screw everyone else.<br><br>Once we get down the peak to where we can no longer hide the rising costs, we move into a more practical kind of living, where practical thinking takes the place of both critical and emotional thinking. It doesn't take a lot of thinking to relearn survival skills. You watch the guy next to you get blown up trying to make black powder, and you say, "Don't do that." You watch him get trampled by a horse and you say, "Don't do that either." Enough people survive this hard-knocks education to create a body of lore that is simply learned from childhood, passed right along with mythology and superstition. Again, I don't see a lot of need (or more importantly, desire) for "critical thought" in this phase.<br><br>As oil shuts down, it's going to be very hard on the US. We visited northern Spain a few years ago, and they still have all the Medieval layout and infrastructure. The towns are small, and within walking distance of each other. Outside the towns, population densities are low, with lots of land for growing and raising food. The entire landscape is littered with <i>horrios</i> which were at one time used to keep stored food from the rats. They've been retasked to store bicycles and old dressers, but they could be easily turned back into food storage. Houses provide shelter from the elements using local, renewable resources for heat, and are built do last generations. People wear wool as a matter of course, and are accustomed to walk several miles down the mountain to church on Sunday.<br><br>Here, we're facing a much more radical retooling. I don't think that's going to be as horrible as some think -- in some ways, it will be a lot of fun, though also terribly hard work, and accompanied by a lot of death -- but it will certainly absorb a huge amount of our efforts for at least a couple of generations.<br><br>No cabal of critical thinkers is going to outlive that.

I think you are right to put early experience of bullying as a seminal influence in social behaviour. Bullying was automatic in my father's elementary school circa 1910 in England: inaugural words; “What’s your name? Can you fight Harris-ee?” wallop! Some argue that behavioural or educational failure in our British schools, or even street-tribalism for children especially in our mega-cities, can be put down to the removal or abnegation of 'authority' and/or a lack of a proper understanding of 'original sin'; though I do not buy those explanations. Top-down brutal beatings by staff were the rule in 1910, and ‘public’ physical intimidation and punishment of 7 - 11 year olds was common enough even in my day circa 1950. I read just the other day that bullying, especially of and among women, is reported still to be widespread in our British armed forces. <br><br>Many areas of our British society do better than that, though, and a decline of fear of educational disadvantage (e.g. of making spelling mistakes, or of revealing our ‘improper’ dialect speech patterns and accents) and fewer 'cap doffing' requirements, have enabled many to overcome their diffidence. (Some of us used to look to Americans for examples of free and confident speaking out! I can remember agreeing with a Dutch colleague what a revelation it had been to hear American visiting scientists deliver extempore scientific papers, where we had been crippled by our lack of what in essence was appropriate social confidence.) What is still lacking for many of us though is the confidence to look for knowledge and truer versions of our predicaments. (The ‘British Empire’ was and still remains for some, a serious impediment to any relevant historical narrative. Many of us by now it seems have no narrative at all.) <br><br>We are every bit as subject to the same manipulative advertisement, public relations, moral panics and 'opinions' I guess as you in the USA; and probably just as isolated in our minimal 'phatic' bubbles as we float between school and shopping and our suburban nuclei. Even work, when we have it, where everything can be glibly justified by 'bottom-line' imperatives, seems for many to leave little room for joint thought and revision; - no ‘polis’ - and fosters more often perhaps an ill-tempered fatalism or a spell-bound consensus. (I was lucky in my work to be mentored at a critical time and in turn to be able to foster autonomous skill and knowledge-seeking in colleagues. It was that kind of work.)<br><br>Occasionally we get a break. Recently in Britain, the wonders of young athletes, including our own spectacular mixed-race woman as well as a son of an ‘asylum-seeker’ and one large and painfully modest red-haired young man, despite all the hype, in a two week break in the rotten weather this summer when the mass-transit systems worked effectively for an expanded ordinary London; these gave our British sentimentality a chance to live again and recover in our imaginations some British identity, and to discover for us perhaps something of more universal relevance. I even felt it up here in my often grumpy and dystopian old-age.<br><br>Singing in choirs, outbursts of flower-giving for dead children; sometimes the pent emotions overflow or find a new and more affirmative channel, and true innocence in the faces of elementary school children shame our rationalisations. <br><br>Best<br>Phil<br><br><br><a href=#c2322874388474094993 title="comment permalink">12/20/12, 6:03 AM</a><br><br>
