<div class=MsoNormal>
For most of a year now, my posts here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> have focused on the nature, rise, and impending fall of America’s global empire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s been a long road and, as usual, it strayed in directions I wasn’t expecting to explore when this sequence of posts began last winter. Still, as I see it, we’ve covered all the core issues except one, and that’s the question of what can and should be done as the American empire totters to its end.<br>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Regular readers will know already that this question isn’t going to be answered with some grandiose scheme for salvaging, replacing, transforming, or dismantling America’s empire, of the sort popular with activists on both sides of an increasingly irrelevant political spectrum—the sort of project that merely requires all those who hold political and economic power to hand it over meekly to some cabal of unelected ideologues, so that the latter can once again learn the hard way that people won’t behave like angels no matter what set of theories is applied to them. At the same time, there are choices still open to Americans and others in an era of imperial decline; we’re not limited, unless we choose to be, to huddling in our basements until the rubble stops bouncing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, there are at least two things welded firmly enough in place in our near future that no action of yours, mine, or anyone’s will change them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first is that America’s global empire will fall; the second is that those who rule it will not let it fall without a struggle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The US government and the loose and fractious alliance of power centers that dominate it are clearly unwilling to take Britain’s path, and accept the end of empire in exchange for a relatively untraumatic imperial unraveling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To judge by all the evidence that’s currently available, they’ll cling to the shreds of imperial power, and the wealth and privilege that goes with it, until the last of those shreds are pulled from their cold stiff hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s a common boast, but it bears remembering that the moment always comes when those shreds get pried loose from those pale and rigid fingers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
These two hard facts, the imminence of imperial downfall and the unwillingess of the existing order to accept that imminence, impose certain consequences on the decades ahead of us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Some of the most obvious of those consequences are economic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The American standard of living, as I’ve pointed out more than once, has been buoyed to its current frankly absurd level by a tribute economy that funnels much of the wealth of the world to the the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We’ve all heard the self-congratulatory nonsense that insists that this nation’s prosperity is a product of American ingenuity or what have you, but let us please be real; nothing Americans do—nothing, that is, other than maintaining garrisons in more than 140 countries and bombing the bejesus out of nations that get too far out of line—justifies the fact that the five per cent of humanity that can apply for a US passport get to use a quarter of the planet’s energy and a third of its natural resources and industrial product. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As our empire ends, that vast imbalance will go away forever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It really is as simple as that. In the future now breathing down our necks, Americans will have to get used to living, as our not so distant ancestors did, on a much more modest fraction of the world’s wealth—and they’ll have to do it, please remember, at a time when the ongoing depletion of fossil fuels and other nonrenewable resources, and the ongoing disruption of the environment, are making ever sharper inroads on the total amount of wealth that’s there to distribute in the first place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That means that everything that counts as an ordinary American lifestyle today is going to go away in the decades ahead of us. It also means that my American readers, not to mention everyone else in this country, are going to be very much poorer in the wake of empire than they are today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s a sufficiently important issue that I’ve discussed it here a number of times already, and it bears repeating. All too many of the plans currently in circulation in the green end of US alternative culture covertly assume that we’ll still be able to dispose of wealth on the same scale as we do today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The lifeboat ecovillages beloved by the prepper end of that subculture, just as much as the solar satellites and county-sized algal biodiesel farms that feature in the daydreams of their green cornucopian counterparts, presuppose that such projects can be supplied with the startup capital, the resources, the labor, and all the other requirements they need.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The end of American empire means that these things aren’t going to happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To judge by previous examples, it will take whatever global empire replaces ours some decades to really get the wealth pump running at full speed and flood its own economy with a torrent of unearned wealth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the time that happens, the decline in global wealth driven by resource depletion and environmental disruption will make the sort of grand projects Americans envisioned in our empire’s glory days a fading memory all over the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus we will not get the solar satellites or the algal biodiesel, and if the lifeboat ecovillages appear, they’ll resemble St. Benedict’s original hovel at Monte Cassino much more than the greenwashed Levittowns so often proposed these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Instead, as the natural systems that undergird industrial civilization crumble away, industrial societies will lose the capacity to accomplish anything at all beyond bare survival—and eventually that, too, will turn out to be more than they can do. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the shape of our economic future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My more attentive readers will have noticed, though, that it says little about the shape of our political future, and that latter deserves discussion. One of the lessons of history is that peoples with nearly identical economic arrangements can have radically different political institutions, affording them equally varied access to civil liberties and influence on the decisions that shape their lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus it’s reasonable and, I think, necessary to talk about the factors that will help define the political dimension of America’s post-imperial future—and in particular, the prospects for democracy in the wake of imperial collapse. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are at least two barriers to that important conversation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first is the weird but widespread notion that the word “democracy”—or, if you will, “real democracy”—stands for a political system in which people somehow don’t do the things they do in every other political system, such as using unfair advantages of various kinds to influence the political process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Let’s start with the obvious example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How often, dear reader, have you heard a pundit or protester contrasting vote fraud, say, or bribery of public officials with “real democracy”? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yet real democracy, meaning the sort of democracy that is capable of existing in the real world, is always plagued with corruption. If you give people the right to dispose of their vote however they wish, after all, a fair number of them will wish to sell that vote to the highest bidder in as direct a fashion as the local laws allow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>If you give public officials the responsibility to make decisions, a fair number of them will make those decisions for their own private benefit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you give voters the right to choose public officials, in turn, and give candidates for public office the chance to convince the public to choose them, you’ve guaranteed that a good many plausible rascals will be elected to office, because that’s who the people will choose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That can’t be avoided without abandoning democracy altogether. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course there’s a significant minority of people who react to the inherent problems of democracy by insisting that it should be abandoned altogether, and replaced with some other system portrayed in suitably rose-colored terms—usually, though not always, something along the lines referred to earlier, in which an unelected cabal of ideologues gets to tell everyone else what to do. The claim that some such project will provide better government than democracies do, though, has been put to the test more times than I care to count, and it consistently fails. Winston Churchill was thus quite correct when he said that democracy is the worst possible system of government, except for all the others; what makes democracy valuable is not that it’s so wonderful, but that every other option has proven itself, in practice, to be so much worse. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Just now, furthermore, democracy has another significant advantage: it doesn’t require the complicated infrastructure of industrial society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The current United States constitution was adopted at a time when the most technologically sophisticated factories in the country were powered by wooden water wheels, and presidents used to be inaugurated on March 4th to give them enough time to get to Washington on horseback over muddy winter roads. (The date wasn’t moved to January 20 until 1933.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>America was still anything but industrialized in the 1820s, the decade that kickstarted the boisterous transformations that sent an aristocratic republic where only the rich could vote careering toward ever more inclusive visions of citizenship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the deindustrial future, when the prevailing economic forms and standards of living may resemble those of the 1790s or 1820s much more closely than they do those of today, that same constitution will be right at home, and will arguably work better than it has since the imperial tribute economy began flooding the country with unearned wealth. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s just one problem with this otherwise appealing prospect, which is that American democracy at the moment is very nearly on its last legs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A great many people are aware of this fact, but most of them blame it on the machinations of some evil elite or other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Popular though this notion is, I’d like to suggest that it’s mistaken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Of course there are plenty of greedy and power-hungry people in positions of wealth and influence, and there always are.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By and large, people don’t get wealth and influence unless they have a desire for wealth and influence, and “having a desire for wealth and influence” is simply another way of saying “greedy and power-hungry.” Every political and economic system, especially those that claim to be motivated solely by the highest of ideals, attracts people who are greedy and power-hungry. Political systems that work, by definition, are able to cope with the perennial habit that human beings have of trying to get wealth and power they haven’t earned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The question that needs to be asked is why ours is failing to cope with that today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The answer is going to require us to duck around some of the most deeply ingrained habits of popular thought, so we’ll take it a step at a time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We can define democracy, for the sake of the current discussion, as a form of government in which ordinary citizens have significant influence over the people and policies that affect their lives. That influence—the effective ability of citizens to make their voices heard in the corridors of power—is a fluid and complex thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In most contemporary democracies, it’s exercised primarily through elections in which officials can be thrown out of office and replaced by somebody else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>When a democracy’s more or less healthy, that’s an effective check; there are always other people angling for any office, whether it’s president or town dogcatcher, and an official who wants to hold onto her office needs to glance back constantly over her shoulder to make sure that her constituents aren’t irritated enough at her to throw their support to one of her rivals. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The entire strategy of political protest depends on the threat of the next election.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Why would it matter to anybody anywhere if a bunch of activists grab signs and go marching down Main Street, or for that matter down the Mall in Washington DC?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Waving signs and chanting slogans may be good aerobic exercise, but that’s all it is; it has no effect on the political process unless it delivers a meaningful message to the politicians or the people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When protest matters, the message to the politicians is blunt:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>“This matters enough to us that we’re willing to show up and march down the street, and it should matter to you, too, if you want our votes next November.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The message to the people is less direct but equally forceful:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“All these people are concerned about this issue; if you’re already concerned about it, you’re not alone; if you aren’t, you should learn more about it”—and the result, again, is meant to show up in the polls at the next election. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You’ll notice that the strategy of protest thus only means anything if the protesters have the means, the motive, and the opportunity to follow through on these two messages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The politicians need to be given good reason to think that ignoring the protesters might indeed get them thrown out of office; the people need to be given good reason to think that the protesters speak for a significant fraction of the citizenry, and that their concerns are worth hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If these are lacking, again, it’s just aerobic exercise. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That, in turn, is why protest in America has become as toothless as it is today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Perhaps, dear reader, you went to Washington DC sometime in the last decade to join a protest march to try to pressure the US government into doing something about global warming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the president just then was a Democrat, he didn’t have to pay the least attention to the march, no matter how big and loud it was; he knew perfectly well that he could ignore all the issues that matter to you, break his campaign promises right and left, and plagiarize all the most hated policies of the previous occupant of the White House, without the least political risk to himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All he had to do come election time is wave the scary Republicans at you, and you’d vote for him anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If he was a Republican, in turn, he knew with perfect certainty that you weren’t going to vote for him no matter what he did, and so he could ignore you with equal impunity. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No matter what party he belonged to, furthermore, the president also had a very good idea how many of the protesters were going to climb into their otherwise unoccupied SUVs for the drive back home to their carbon-hungry lifestyles; he knew that if he actually wanted to make them change those lifestyles—say, by letting the price of gasoline rise to European levels—most of them would chuck their ideals in an eyeblink and turn on him with screams of indignation; and a phone call to the Secretary of Energy would remind him that any meaningful response to climate change would require such steps as letting the price of gas rise to European levels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He knew perfectly well, in other words, that most of the protesters didn’t actually want him to do what they claimed they wanted him to do; they wanted to feel good about doing something to save the Earth, but didn’t want to put up with any of the inconveniences that would be involved in any real movement in that direction, and so attending a protest march offered them an easy way to have their planet and eat it too. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s only fair to say that the same logic applies with precisely equal force on the other side of the line. If, dear reader, the protest march you attended was in support of some allegedly conservative cause—well, it wasn’t actually conservative, to begin with; the tiny minority of authentic conservatives in this country have been shut out of the political conversation for decades, but that’s an issue for another post—the man in the White House had no more reason to worry about your opinions than he had to fret about the liberal protest the week before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>If he was a Republican, he knew that he could ignore your concerns and his own campaign promises, and you’d vote for him anyway once he waved the scary Democrats at you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If he was a Democrat, he knew that you’d vote against him no matter what.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Either way, in turn, he had a very good idea how many of the people out there who were denouncing drug abuse and waving pro-life and family-values placards fell all over themselves to find excuses for Rush Limbaugh’s drug bust, and paid for abortions when they knocked up the teenage girlfriends their wives don’t know about. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Does this mean that protest marches are a waste of time?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Not at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nor does it mean that any of the other venerable means of exerting pressure on politicians are useless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The problem is not in these measures themselves; it’s the absence of something else that makes them toothless. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That something else was discussed in <a href=../../2012/08/the-degeneration-of-politics.html>an earlier post</a> in this sequence: grassroots political organization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s where political power comes from in a democratic society, and without it, all the marches and petitions and passionate rhetoric in the world are so much empty noise. Through most of American history, the standard way to put this fact to work was to get involved in an existing political party at the caucus level and start leaning on the levers that, given time and hard work, shift the country’s politics out of one trajectory and into another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>These days, both parties have been so thoroughly corrupted into instruments of top-down manipulation on the part of major power centers and veto groups that trying to return them to useful condition is almost certainly a waste of time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At the same time, the fact that US politics is not currently dominated by Federalists and Whigs shows that even a resolutely two-party political culture is now and then subject to the replacement of one party by another, if the new party on the block takes the time to learn what works, and then does it.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The point I’m trying to explore here can be made in an even more forceful way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Protest marches, like letter-writing campaigns and other means of putting pressure on politicians, have no power in and of themselves; their effect depends on the implied promise that the politicians will be held accountable to their choices come election time, and that promise depends, in turn, on the existence of grassroots political organization strong enough to make a difference in the voting booth. It’s the grassroots organization, we might as well say, that produces democracy; marches and other methods of pressuring politicians are simply means of consuming democracy—and when everyone wants to consume a product but nobody takes the time and trouble to produce it, sooner or later you get a shortage. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We have a severe and growing democracy shortage here in America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In next week’s post, I’ll talk about some of the things that will be necessary to increase the supply. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
****************</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: large">End of the World of the Week #51</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What do you do if you throw an apocalypse and nobody comes?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That was the challenge faced by the Watch Tower Tract Society, an American offshoot of Christianity, when the end of the world failed to show up on schedule in 1914.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That date had played a central role in the Society’s prophecy since 1876, when the movement’s founder Rev. Charles Taze Russell and Nelson Barbour, a former Millerite, wrote a book predicting the Second Coming for that year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As Russell’s original International Bible Students Movement morphed into the Watch Tower Tract Society, that prophecy became ever more central to the movement’s hopes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As church bells rang in the year 1915, though, it became evident even to the most devout Watch Tower follower that Christ had pulled another one of his frequent no-shows. Admitting that your prophecy was just plain wrong is rarely a good career move for an apocalyptic prophet, and the Watch Tower organization had made so much of a ballyhoo about the upcoming end that it couldn’t get away with the usual fallback strategy of ignoring the failure and announcing a new date (though this was tried).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It fell to Russell to come up with a third option, one of the most ingenious in the history of apocalypses. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Second Coming, he announced to his followers, had indeed occurred—in heaven.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Christ was now reigning in glory there, but the effects would take a little while to filter down to earth, so they just had to be patient.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>They’re still waiting patiently; in the 1930s, the movement renamed itself the Jehovah’s Witnesses, and its members are still convinced that the Second Coming took place 98 years ago and its prophesied results will be showing up any day now. </div>

Thanks for another great essay. You are one of just a handful of bloggers I go out of my way to read at every opportunity.<br><br>I do have two thoughts though. The first is that the narrative about the British empire peacefully and gracefully unravelling is very much a way for them to save face historically. In fact the British Empire resisted collapse as long as they could and the final end came when Britain joined France in declaring war on Germany and thus began the long u-boat war. It was only the combined might of the USSR, the UK, and the US that Germany and their allies were defeated and the UK took the real brunt of the u-boat war.<br><br>The grim fact is that the UK was trounced in the Battle of the Atlantic and only managed to come out on the winning side of the war due to the emergence of the United States as a superpower. That Doenitz brought the UK to the brink of defeat with a force that was, even at its height, half of what he thought would be required gives some sense as to how over-extended and fragile the British Empire had actually become.<br><br>So after WWII, with a far reduced navy, and a war-weary population the choice was between fighting more wars in the spirit of the Boer Wars, or just giving up. There wasn't much of a choice involved. The British Empire was shattered by the uboat war, and gracefully giving up was a nice way to safe face.<br><br>Secondly, the point about democracy is an interesting one. I do note however that the idea that the citizens have a voice in government is something which is not incompatible with any other form of government. By your definition, it would seem that Norway under King Hakon the Good was a democracy insofar as he could only be given legitimacy by the regional legal assemblies of free men, and that they had no problems dictating terms to him.<br><br>I like this discussion because it keeps us thinking about requirements rather than specifics. If a formally autocratic monarchy can in fact be democratic, then it means we must focus on ensuring that the people have a voice and that local assemblies are empowered rather than on the idea of a specific form of government. Thanks for that.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c7385421103876464566 title="comment permalink">12/5/12, 11:15 PM</a><br><br>

Of course Britain only surrendered its empire after the cost of hanging onto it became brutally clear; that still showed considerably more sense than, say, Spain did when its empire dissolved around it, which is an important part of why Britain didn't plunge into the same kind economic collapse and political turmoil in the wake of its empire that Spain did. <br><br>As for the Norse political tradition, that and its close Saxon equivalent was the original rough draft from which American democracy emerged: the structure of a central executive with specific prerogatives, and one or more popular assemblies tasked with holding the executive in check, comes straight from there by way of a variety of medieval and early modern variants in England and elsewhere. Constitutional monarchy is one of the standard frameworks for democracy, and can handle a wide range of variants in how much power the monarch is assigned.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c2097494846727114495 title="comment permalink">12/5/12, 11:26 PM</a><br><br>

How does same-sex marriage stress the economy? Even if you are concerned about the miniscule (in total) impact on taxation by granting a tiny fraction of the population a tax break that the majority of the population already receives, that suggests that the economic luxury is really the tax benefits afforded to all married couples (who will always be &gt;&gt;90% m/f no matter what happens to marriage law). Or are you instead suggesting that childless homosexuality itself is the economic luxury at the personal household level? Do you really mean to say that people in poverty will be compelled by financial necessity to be functional heterosexuals so they can make babies to support them in their old age? Given the fact that there have always been childless people, and roles in society for childless people, this strikes me as some peculiar reasoning.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c4181259016957200427 title="comment permalink">12/6/12, 5:46 AM</a><br><br>

Ouch!! Man, the truth hurts. Wonderfully pithy phrase, I'm surprised I don't remember you (or anyone else) using it before, maybe my memory is just faulty.<br><br>I hope I'm not hijacking the thread if I make a late comment on last week's post -- I was out of town when you posted it -- and it bears some relevance to what you're advising this week, to people such as John D. Wheeler.<br><br>I lived in Mexico for 3 years recently, so I wanted to comment on the idea of Mexicans reclaiming the southwest US. Nobody brought up a viewpoint like mine as far as I noted in skimming the 165 comments. I don't disagree with your geopolitical analysis, but I think it bears mentioning that the average Mexican at home, or who is coming across the border looking for work today, bears little resemblance to the warlord you describe who is operating a cartel or drug gang. Once you get over the language barrier -- (and Spanish is surely among the easiest languages in the world for English speakers to learn, and you can communicate complex ideas in broken Spanish just like English) -- Americans find many commonalities and admirable qualities among Latin Americans. They're Capitalist entrepreneurs to a man, overwhelmingly Christian, socially liberal and tolerant. The culture shock of such an "invasion" by our Southern neighbors may well be less than your essay insinuated, and less than many people would expect. Given the way Mexicans glom onto American pop culture and technology, and given the way Americans are becoming inured to political corruption and wealth disparity, I think "our two countries will meet in the middle and join hands," (as somebody said to James Coburn about a different empire in that classic movie _The President's Analyst_).<br><br>One of the real differences, one of the areas where a Latin takeover would make a difference to somebody like John D. Wheeler in this week's comments, is in the area of civil rights. Latin American peasants have a long history of putting up with strongmen and autocrats, so John should imagine living in someplace like Columbia where you can be "disappeared" for looking the wrong way at a bureaucrat's daughter, if John wants to know the difference between democracy and autocracy. On the other hand, the Mexicans also have a long history of populist awareness and uprisings. To my mind, the question is, as American and Latin cultures merge, can Americans uplift the Latins' expectations for civil rights and responsive governance, or will Americans sink to the typical Latin American level of tolerating autocrats and bad governance because "what else can you do"?? So far, the signs aren't at all hopeful, but we could change this.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c5680055096085398747 title="comment permalink">12/6/12, 8:56 AM</a><br><br>

And resembles our own situation so much more than we care to admit, so we avert our eyes from an understanding. As you suggest, it seems the northern Barbarians had adopted a lot of aspects of Roman culture even as they were excluded from the Empire. The Barbarians were basically invited in, towards the end, to make up for a shortage of labor, sound familiar? (in Roman times, it was a shortage of soldiers). The fall of Rome certainly had some violent episodes, but reading the accounts it strikes me that it occurred day-to-day more as a civic takeover by a foreign faction than a storm of weird foreigners killing everyone in Rome and defacing the temples. You could argue the same thing is taking place in the US. Foreign corporations and Latin immigrants are slowly taking over our finances and our culture, respectively, and changing them to something slightly different. As my friend Justin Wade often says, the Dark Ages after the fall of Rome were mainly a tragedy for the moneyed political elites, who lost fortunes, whereas the common everyday peasants continued living their lives mostly like they'd always done, and may even have experienced more freedom and less interference from the central government.<br><br>Speaking of averting our eyes to the truth, how could we get through an entire week of discussing a Mexican invasion of the US without mentioning that old 1980's Patrick Swayze movie, "Red Dawn"?? (MINOR SPOILERS) In the 1980s version, an alliance of Cubans and Nicaraguans with help from Russia, (all the boogeymen of Reagan's time), invaded the southwest US. I think it's rather telling that the 2012 remake of that movie now casts the North Koreans as the villains. In the 1980s, an invasion from Latin America was wildly improbable. The drug violence had barely begun and it was mostly in service of the US government. Today in 2012, that threat may have escalated beyond anyone's control, so it's uncomfortable for Americans to watch it in a theatre. Ergo we have to avert our eyes from the truth, and pick a different boogeyman -- the North Koreans -- one who has about zero chance of invading the US in the present day.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c2443505401862059534 title="comment permalink">12/6/12, 8:57 AM</a><br><br>

He was a leader of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). The book provides a fascinating look into the Movement in the 60’s. The author spends a lot of effort describing what the leaders were thinking, and how they went about their activities. The book shows the phases that the movement went through – from trying to work within the system, to peaceful protests, to violent protests.<br><br>SDS and the allied organizations obtained meager results from working within the system. Initially they obtained promises from politicians but the promises were not honored. The peaceful protests were more successful in bringing around the views of the population as a whole, which then brought pressure on the politicians. In addition they did a lot of grass root organizing in getting out the black vote in the south. The author believes that the willingness of the protesters to put themselves in harm’s way was effective in getting attention and making the public as a whole pay attention. Overall this was a successful campaign. <br><br>When the attention of the young people turned to the Vietnam war, the peaceful protests were not effective in changing anything, as the majority of the population still favored the war. The protests became more and more violent with little immediate result. I’m not all the way through the book yet, so I’m not sure if the eventual turning of public opinion was due to the protests, or what. I have to believe that the protests had some effect.<br><br>In any case a fascinating book with some overlap on the present discussion here.

All too many of the apocalyptic prophecies of the past amount to, "In 954 CE, St. Gundibald predicted the end for the ninety-fifth time." <br><br>Tony, funny. <br><br>CWT, as I've commented many times in the past, large-scale slavery only makes economic sense if you've got an export economy -- as the South did, for example, before the Civil War, and as the Roman agricultural regions did in their day. Lacking that, it's much more economically viable to let people farm your land and take a share of the crop in exchange. <br><br>John, exactly. That's why the point has to be made, over and over again, that passively waiting for a party to give you a good candidate is a waste of time. <br><br>Christian, York has seen a few imperial declines in its time! Many thanks for the link; from my observations, the situation is even worse than the Beeb thinks. <br><br>John, I figured I'd get that kind of argument by anecdote. It's still the case that you, personally, can say things about the government that would get you hauled off to a prison camp in China or Cuba, and suffer no consequences at all. Does that matter to you? If not, by all means ignore politics. <br><br>Jeffrey, it's going to be turned into a book. I think, though, that you're drastically underestimating how rough the road is ahead of us; it's easy to talk about how unsatisfying life is in today's America, but it will be interesting to see how much of that talk goes away when people are dying of hunger. <br><br>Bruce, I've discussed anarchism more than once here. It's one of those appealing abstractions that doesn't work in practice -- in this case, for the simple reason that the "free agreements" Kropotkin lauds aren't worth the empty wind they're written on once somebody decides to break them and seize power and wealth by force. <br><br>Macsporan, er, what rock do you live under? First, the nation-state was invented in the early 19th century and did not exist before then; since then, a baker's dozen of them have gone out of existence in various parts of the world and many more have been invented out of whole cloth; and unless you spend all your time at Tea Party rallies, you can very easily meet millions of Americans who aren't religious and don't feel particularly patriotic.

As for the fall of Rome, you might want to read Bryan Ward-Perkins' critique of the "soft decline" theory in his <i>The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization</i> -- I discuss it in some detail <a href=../../2008/04/specialization-trap.html rel=nofollow>here</a>. <br><br>SLClaire, I'll be interested in your comments. <br><br>Justin, I'm far from sure you got my point, either. I think we all agree that democracy has massive flaws; Churchill's point remains valid -- democracy may be bad but all other systems are measurably worse -- and so the issue I want to raise is whether it's possible to retain the benefits that make democracy, flawed as it is, significantly better than the alternatives. <br><br>Nano, I expect two or three decades from now to see ongoing, crippling economic contraction, spiralling political dysfunction, and a great deal of war. It's a flip of the coin whether the US will still have anything like its present system of government by then. Your kids will be growing up in a very tough world. <br><br>Joel, to revert to my metaphor, the democracy shortage isn't yet complete, and efforts to produce some can pay off.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c3514320872571173608 title="comment permalink">12/6/12, 10:37 AM</a><br><br>

I just read it now.<br><br>I take your point that the collapse of a highly specialized economy had human costs, so Rome's fall was much less "soft" than I just portrayed it. In my defense, though -- maybe I'm being too reductionist -- yours are all relevant points for the technical, economic, and energy spheres of American collapse. The kind of economic and technical/scientific/professional collapse you refer to in your 2008 article would (likely) befall America regardless whether it happened to be Mexico on our border, or Iran or Mongolia. But I was really only referring to the "cultural" sphere, and saying that Mexican/Latin culture has so many commonalities with American (especially Southwest US) culture that the collapse of our own Hadrian's Wall on our South border may feel, culturally, more like a mutual assimilation than a sharp break.<br><br>Of course my analysis there is shunting all the problems of warlord culture, autocracy vs. civil rights off into the "political" sphere, and it's probably impossible and misguided to separate the political from the cultural spheres. <br><br>I'm not saying there won't be human costs to our Empire's decline and fall -- but a lot of those are due to Peak Oil and environmental collapse, and therefore would happen regardless what culture was on our borders. Speaking strictly Culturally, the US might have a softer collapse than Rome because the "barbarians" on our borders (Canadians and Mexicans) share a lot of fundamental qualities and outlook with us. Maybe more than the Romans shared with the Picts and Gauls... far more than the modern-day Isolationist party believes that Mexicans share with us.<br><br>You once said words to the effect that Jim Kunstler fears the barbarism of the tattooed, pierced slacker generation overmuch because he hasn't spent much time among them. I'm just trying to get the same point across about Mexicans -- not necessarily to you, but to other readers of your blog who haven't had much exposure to them in their native country. Spend a little time among them and the pop-culture propaganda image of dirty wetbacks crossing the border to carry away our wealth for themselves (eerily similar to the high-school history image of Gallic barbarians) just drops away. That was my point which nobody mentioned in last week's comments.<br><br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c1755248031278135436 title="comment permalink">12/6/12, 11:37 AM</a><br><br>

It has steadily and slowly lost votes and chairs in congress, while the main left-center party is steadily and slowly winning them. A good example of this is a big candidate from the right who lost both the last presidential race and the race to mayor of the biggest city in Brazil, São Paulo (traditionally a right leaning electorate).<br><br>Another important details is, following the not-so-bright history of big media in Latin America, all of our major newspapers and virtually all TV networks decided (some openly, some covertly) that they would be the opposition, resulting in some sad episodes during elections and very biased reporting throughout the year.<br><br>Add to this situation the obscene class based hate that most of the middle and high class has of our former president Lula (and consequently of all that his party touches), which already makes discussion of political issues at best difficult, and you have an increasingly polarized political climate. When party X becomes the root of all evil, and only the ones opposing it can save us...<br><br>The changes in these last ten years had some very good consequences for us (less reliance on the American Empire being one of them), some terrible consequences for our environment and climate, but rationally discussing this with people is already hard these days.

In order to soften our environmental impacts, we need to find ways, globally, to live smaller, live closer, and drive less.” (47)<br><br>“The idea automotive strategy would be to steadily remove driving lanes while maintaining congestion at levels that drivers find vexing, thereby gibing them an ongoing incentive to embrace alternatives.” (86)<br><br>“Globally, some two-thirds of all energy that is consumed is the energy used to produce the goods and services we consume.” (119)<br><br>“The last thing the world needs is an inexpensive car that gets a hundred miles to the gallon, because once we have it there will no longer be a significant barrier, worldwide, to becoming a driver.” (141)<br><br>“More cars mean more roads, more roads mean more suburbs, and more suburbs mean more energy use and environmental damage in every category.” (141)<br><br>“from an environmental perspective cheap energy is a problem, no matter what the source…Access to cheap electricity doesn’t solve environment al problems; it amplifies them, by relieving the economic pressures that, if left in place, would force consumers to make real, lasting, environmentally beneficial reductions in consumption.” (195)<br><br>“‘Built-in obsolescence’ doesn’t come close to describing it, since most of the devices we covet today are technologically extinct even before we’ve decided we can’t live without them.” (220)<br><br>“The real problem isn’t them; it’s everyone—especially those of us who, however enlightened we may feel, are quite comfortable consuming a grotesquely disproportionate share of the world’s resources. Just how willing are we, actually, to demand and support policies that would require more from us than product substitution? And, even if we believe we are willing, how could we prevent the biggest burdens and sacrifices from falling on those who live in misery even now?’ (241)<br><br>“What’s proven impossible, at least so far, is to commit to taking steps that would actually make a large, permanent difference on a global scale.

Your article begins by asserting that democracy is a better system than all the others and ends by promising to offer a plan to restore democratic political engagement.<br><br>My point is that the only reason the assertion works is because most people associate and attribute the gains in social rights and material wealth to democracy made in Imperial America during the age of abundance. It is only within that context that democracy appears to be better than all the rest and your assumption works. If you go back before the beginning of this period, roughly the turn of the last century or WWII, the average person in this democracy would have had quite a bit different to say. <br><br>Those who were not recently slaves, serfs, women, poor children or workers, surviving natives, they would have found democratic government quite savage. About the only people engaged by your assumption would have been wealthy, land holding elites.<br><br>Your assumption and conception of how democracy works is subject to the same framework of progress that colors in the usual commentary of modern times.<br><br>I'll also note that your refusal to hear any criticism from someone unless they have a proposal that has been demonstrated to work in the real world pretty much kills any way to attempt alternatives or invention beyond what has already been tried and rendered in judgment one way or the other.

All I have to offer based on personal experience is a tepid defense of the status quo based on the emotional calculation that all things considered, this is the best there is and best that is possible, same as you.

If historical examples are anything to go by, for that matter, the next great civilization in North America will probably be born in the Rio Grande valley -- it's very common for the borderlands of one age to become the cultural heartlands of the next. Still, we've got a mess to get through first. <br><br>Raven, I come from the future. That's the way we all talk there. ;-)<br><br>Robert, too funny! <br><br>CWT, heck of a good question. Moral ideas change over time, to be sure; predicting how they'll change, though, is a real challenge. <br><br>Display, by all means start such a site if that work calls to you. <br><br>Atilio, many thanks for the update from Brazil! I don't pretend to know how your country will fare -- it could easily be one of the global powers of the post-Chinese era, it could crash and burn in any number of ways, or it could fall someplace in the middle. That's true of a lot of relatively resource-rich Third World countries, to be sure. <br><br>Macsporan, I'd encourage you to do some more research. If you want to call the dynastic states between the late Middle Ages and the early 19th century "nation-states," you've just shot holes in your own argument, because scores of those states no longer exist. Shall I list some? Burgundy, Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria, Sardinia, Hawaii, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Gran Colombia, Champa, Bohemia, the Republic of Zanzibar, the Republic of Venice -- well, I could go on until I run past the number of characters Blogger will allow me to post. All these and many more were independent nations well into post-medieval times, with their own governments, traditions, armies, ambassadors, and all the other appurtenances of sovereign states; none of them exist today. <br><br>That said, I note again that you don't seem to understand what I mean when I talk about the US empire. It has nothing to do with the current 50 states; it's defined, as I've explained at great length in earlier posts, by the military and economic arrangements that funnel a disproportionate share of the world's wealth to the US. That's the empire I'm talking about, and it can fall without the US losing a single square inch of territory. Again, you might consider reading the posts I mentioned earlier.<br><br>DW, yes, I've read it. It's not bad -- despite some annoying bits, the author has grasped the fact that trying to solve the crisis of our time without a drastic reduction in the rate at which we consume energy and raw materials is a recipe for disaster. <br><br>Justin, your argument is deeply flawed for two reasons. First, as I pointed out, democracies existed before the industrial age, and even then provided their citizens with more rights than autocracies of the same era -- again, the fact that they weren't perfect doesn't mean they weren't better; second, democracies weren't the only nations to participate in the boomtimes of the fossil fuel era, and there again, democracies during that time provided their citizens with more rights than autocracies did. The kind of criticism you direct at American democracy, for example, could land you in a prison camp in China today -- and I suggest that that's a difference worth noting. <br><br>As for your label "reactionary," er, I think you need to look up that word and think a little more about the definition. A reactionary is someone who wants to return a nation to an earlier political, economic or social system, and I'm not doing that. The phrase you want for me is "Burkean conservative" -- yes, that's a reference to Edmund Burke, who argued forcefully (and to my mind convincingly) that political and economic systems that work are evolved, not invented, and the usual result of trying to force a society to conform to somebody's bright new idea is catastrophe.

I’ve had all the pieces in my hand for many years, but the metaphor of consuming democracy (actually it’s more accurately political capital) crystallizes a unified idea wonderfully.<br><br>I have always been uncomfortable with recent protest movements, especially environmental ones. That they are ultimately feel-good exercises has been becoming more apparent over the years.<br>There is one recent environmental protest that I have been finding especially revealing, that of the XL Pipeline. John, please correct me if I’m mistaken about this, but it appears this one is unique because there is actually a bazooka that if skillfully used could (politically) reduce this thing to a smoking ruin. Instead, nothing but Neff balls seems to be used against it, like possibly destroying the Ogallala Aquifer, which few people care about. The bazooka is the fact that the purpose of the Pipeline is essentially to raise the price of gasoline in the middle of country – to get rid the gut of oil at the Oklahoma oil depot by connecting the tar sands to the world oil market. It is very interesting that this issue never seems to be raised by activists. Is it because their protests might start getting overrun with grubby red-necks who would be . . . <i> marching with them?</i><br><br>Lastly, I have some male friends who are a long term couple who got married last weekend. There is much amusement by liberal leaning people about Log Cabin Republicans – why don’t these people change parties to one that welcomes them? Yet if you think about it, Log Cabin Republicans are the probably a, if not the, major secret weapon of the Gay Rights movement and likely a significant reason the tide is turning in favor of this issue. Now if only some conservationists decided to be conservatives.

But, isn't today's situation unique in history - at least unique enough to give us pause for thought?<br><br>Never before have migration numbers exceeded 1,000,000++ per year, as in the US today.<br><br>Never before has migration been so fueled by fossil fuels, cars, trucks, and airplanes, as in the US today.<br><br>Never before has the distinction between legal AND illegal migration been so (deliberately?) muddled, and yet so important -<br><br>Because, never before have so many LEGAL migrants been so dependent on the panoply of government programs - tenuous programs perhaps, given economic changes and the realities of the collapse of Empire - but VERY important for life FOR those migrants - as in today's United States.<br><br>If you believe that the US landmass can support 400,000,000 human souls - - - And if you believe that our collapse will be slow, gentle and gradual - - - Then you might argue that today's historically UNPRECEDENTEDLY HIGH US immigration rates do not matter.<br><br>But, if you are more of a realist, as I suspect you are -<br><br>THEN, shouldn't we in the United States, do everything we can to reduce our own incoming immigration rates - while we still have the military and law enforcement power to enable us to DO this?<br><br>And shouldn't we, at the same time, encourage the "best and brightest" from other countries to STAY HOME, and do what they can in their own home countries, to prepare there for the collapse of the US Empire.<br><br>There are "grassroots" organizations working to reduce immigration into the United States.<br>Racism is not the issue.

There were plenty of monasteries and other pre-industrial communities that offered a decent life. There are already emerging communities that cost almost nothing to establish and that offer a decent standard of living. The funds required for startup are mostly the price of land and hand tools and seeds. Funds or land can also be gifted (this is happening) so the price can be zero dollars. Personally, I think the standard of living in a post-petroleum community such as the Possibility Alliance is much better than anywhere else I've been. The work is better, the food is better, the recreation is better, the human and natural connections are better. And it will only get better as more people with diverse pre-industrial craft/agrarian skills and specialties move there. There is not much need for funding, just for people with skills, or who are willing to learn skills. Funding for tools and land would accelerate things though, and there still is plenty of money and gift energy around.

That was just the argument you wanted me to make and I keep saying is beside the point of my comments. <br><br>All I am trying to do is question your assertion that democracy works better. Although you don't really define what works means, or how you quantify that, other than to assert an aphorism about it being the worst except for all the others and cite Chinese prison camps. The second problem is that you then say for anyone to challenge this, they have to present a proposal that has already been proven to work better in the real world. Your initial statement negates anything like this existing by assertion, resting upon the authority of the general concensus of historians who've been brought up in and internalized the value systems institutions of democracy.<br><br>Nothing that has not already been tried is excluded from consideration as a pipe dream, and everything that has been tried has been rendered worse by assertion. Its a neat rhetorical argument that is also known as begging the question. It is also deeply reactionary.<br><br>My point is that the consensus you are relying upon has only been formed recently under the very material conditions that are going away.

In a forthcoming book I point out that environmental activists have been assigned by society the role of fighting against progress, and losing. They have embraced that role enthusiastically, and have gotten very good at avoiding any strategy that would actually win. <br><br>Macsporan, you're hammering on a point you've already made, engaging in blatantly circular logic -- "nation states don't collapse, and so anything that collapsed must not have been a nation state" -- and arguing with points I haven't made -- where do you get the idea that I think that Dark Ages are fun? -- and none of those is useful. If you keep it up I'm simply going to delete your comments. <br><br>Progress, you might want to reread this week's post, and consider the comments I've made about the economic payoff the middle class gets by encouraging illegal immigration. You can say "we should" this and "we should" that all you want, but until you grapple with the economics of the situation, it's going to be wasted breath. <br><br>Iuval, I'm sorry, but that last comment of yours -- "the only scarcity is of imagination and will" -- shows that you haven't yet grasped the most basic realities of our predicament. Scarcity is real, limits are real, and until you come to terms with those hard facts, you're waltzing away in Cloud-Cuckooland. <br><br>You might also consider looking at the history of the Benedictine order back in the days when it took its vows of poverty seriously, and find out just how hard a life Benedict and his fellow monks embraced...<br><br>Justin, I understand what you're saying. I'm arguing that you're quite simply wrong in claiming that before the industrial revolution, democracy was no better than anything else. If you want to disagree with that, fine, but it would be helpful if you actually addressed my arguments -- and pointing out that late imperial America has a very high prison population, which of course it does (hint: China and many other autocratic countries have much smaller prison populations because they execute a very large fraction of their felons), doesn't address that point. <br><br>It's always easy to argue by anecdote, as I've just done, and insist that the US or whoever is uniquely bad (or uniquely good) because you can find some statistic to compare it negatively or positively to some other collection of countries. So? That doesn't address my point. Compare America in the first half of the 19th century, when it was still an agricultural nation, with any of the autocratic countries of the same period, and you'll find consistently that more people had more civil rights in the US and other democratic societies than in autocratic nations. Once again, that doesn't make American democracy perfect, or even good; it makes it better than the alternatives -- even in a nonindustrial setting.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c4869618714075211831 title="comment permalink">12/6/12, 10:29 PM</a><br><br>

I've defined exactly what I mean by democracy being better -- it provides more civil rights and due process to more of its citizens than other systems of government, and your chances of ending up in a prison camp here for expressing a political opinion are much smaller than in autocratic societies. If you don't think those are significant benefits, then we have a disagreement, not an argument. <br><br>As for untried systems, well, you have the same right to your opinion as I do. I note that over the last couple of centuries, we've seen time and time again what happens when a bunch of intellectuals with a bright idea convince themselves and the masses that they can build a much better society on some abstract basis. The results are consistently disastrous. The changes that have actually improved access to human rights have been a matter of adapting, through an organic process, existing institutions in the direction of greater freedom. Again, that's Burke's point; you're free to disagree with it, but that's my view, and your misstating my views and verging on abusive language is not likely to encourage me to change it, you know.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c1088841331858895843 title="comment permalink">12/6/12, 10:39 PM</a><br><br>

Any political system enacted within centers of significant population density (usually agriculturally based as opposed to horticulture) is inherently opposed to such values because the system is hierarchical. Moreover, the present expansion of civil liberties, equality and due process seems to be a product of not so much a result of Hornsborg's wealth pump (wherein enough surplus to share with the lower classes) as the aberrant time/space condition of abundantly cheap fossil fuels industry was born of and came to rely on. Without these 'enablers,' 'unalienable rights' will turn into what they always were under such systems: privileges of a limited few. After all, despite the ostensible class differences within the US, the country as a whole represents an elite 5% compared to the world at large. Abundance is a luxury; scarcity will reveal these cherished values for what they are: whimsical flights of satiated and secure persons comfortably seated in their upholstered armchairs. <br><br>To clarify, there are plenty of historical examples of empires with surpluses and gross inequalities.

I meant it in two ways:<br>1. Post and pre-industrial life does not have to be gruelling. Voluntary poverty can be fun, depending on your attitude. This is not hypothetical "Cuckooland", this is something I have experienced at the Possibility Alliance. As Gandhi said:"Renounce and enjoy". There is an abundance of human and animal energy, and work for providing our basic needs is edifying and enjoyable. You do your readers a disservice by painting it bleakly.<br>2. There is both money for tools and land, and land that could be freely shared by many who are rich in land but poor in community and real culture. Non-industrial technology does not require much capital. It is better to use the industrial resources now before they run out (or get too expensive) to build non-industrial infrastructure. Once it is built, it is self-sustaining and does not need to rely on industrial inputs anymore.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c761139670735152940 title="comment permalink">12/7/12, 5:23 AM</a><br><br>

After the inevitable crises imposed by the end of the age of abundance, it may be possible to piece something like a democratic structure back together again, and I see plenty of advantages to that. <br><br>Mr. O, yes, I noticed that. None of the people who've pigpiled this post have talked about its central point -- the rage fixates on some side issue. That's a very common thing when a discussion brushes up against one of the things One Does Not Talk About -- in this case, the role of political activism as a sop to the troubled conscience of the privileged middle class. <br><br>Brunowalshy, I'm far from convinced that you're right. If civil liberties were a product of the economy of abundance made possible by fossil fuels, then it would follow that the higher the standard of living in a country, the more civil rights its people would have on average -- and this isn't the case; there are quite a few countries just now where the standard of living is measurably lower, but access to civil rights and due process is better. (That's a function of the "democracy shortage" I mentioned in my post.) Furthermore, if you're right and democracy thrives best in small, localized communities -- well, one of the major impacts of the end of the fossil fuel age is the twilight of globalism and the refocusing of human society on small, localized communities, which suggests to me that democracy may be better off as the age of abundance ends!<br><br>Phil, fascinating! I'll see if I can find a library copy within reach. <br><br>Iuval, sorry for biting your head off. Of course you're quite correct that it's possible to have a decent and humane existence in the absence of today's absurdly extravagant lifestyles. Still, my point about Benedict stands -- the monasteries of the early Dark Ages thrived precisely because they embraced extreme poverty, and yes, the original settlement on Monte Cassino can quite accurately be described as a collection of hovels. I stress that to counter the popularity of the destructive fantasy that it'll be possible to maintain a modern middle class lifestyle on a renewable basis. <br><br>Avery, well, I'm certainly not trying to lead people to my particular (and peculiar) faith. Still, as I've commented before, religion tends to be a major growth industry in times of decline, and you've pointed at one of the reasons why.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c5555632791912898073 title="comment permalink">12/7/12, 8:12 AM</a><br><br>

There's no way around the fact that democratic governments have mixed records. Especially in the case of being imprisoned or disappeared by some proxy of the state over political factors. As far as America's concerned my grandparents were imprisoned in concentration camps and dispossessed of all their property for the simple reason of being Japanese ethnics. With a stroke of the pen a executive order decided their fate with little justifiable cause. The "re-location" might have had a political angle, but the economic dispossession of their property was just so the West Coast states could make good their Great Depression-era debts by selling their property to speculators. Hence all the property lost was legally defined as unclaimed. Considering that any concept of liberty as understood by principles influenced by John Locke established the right of property the Japanese-American internment is stark reminder at how fragile the concept of liberty and justice really is. <br><br>Similar cases can be found throughout American history. The people who legally owned and lived on land that the railroads were trying to acquire for their right-of-ways were dispossessed of the increased value of their property through similar means. Before Lincoln was president, he helped contribute to the legal rational for this theft for the Illinois Central railroad. It's for that reason that I cannot be overly sentimental about democracy. Might still makes right. Even in a democracy. Throughout history it's critics were just as brutally suppressed such as in the infamous case and trial of Socrates.<br><br>That being said, Reinhold Niebuhr has stated one of the most brilliant rhetorical defenses of democracy when he said that “Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible, but man's inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary”. He also thought that democracy wasn't perfect. It was merely the process of governing that finds proximate solutions to insoluble problems of human nature. With that in mind the lack of benevolent oligarchs and autocrats throughout history makes perfect sense.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c5738563474995661493 title="comment permalink">12/7/12, 9:54 AM</a><br><br>

If you are a human being on this planet, you are more likely to be killed or imprisoned by a democratic government than any other.

You are older than me, and the only thing I've ever been totally sure of in life is that I can remember ways I used to think that I no longer do and ways of thinking that I still hold on to, but at the time I had no idea which was which. Older people are generally ahead of the curve on this process.<br><br>I think you are misreading me as wanting to promote my pet abstract model of utopia. Its really not my aim, I maintain that your comparative analysis is very flawed in the same way that others within the narrative of progress are. My unstated point is not that I am right or will be proven right, but only that as time goes on and the system unravels and resembles the vicious democratic system of the 1800s, more people will gravitate to what I am saying based on personal experience instead of accepting your assertions about democracy being superior in terms of rights for the individual. <br><br>respectfully,<br><br>JW<br><br>Btw, can you recall a time that you've ever had your mind changed in these kinds of forums?

The local "great man", the warlord or squire or what name he has, don't care about votes and opinions directly. Maybe it's just cultural difference: here in my homeland even the liberal democracy works like feudalism, and most of the people are OK with that.

Its sad that we get the government that we deserve. Good intentions without follow through is a waste of tie. Something to be said for stability, I guess but I do have hope since it looks like the R-Party may splinter into the Militant Libertarians (original TEA party) and NeoCons/Rinos. I know quite a few who didn't vote last time because choosing between Chicago or Boston didn't seem like much of a choice. <br> <br>I am very surprised that you didn't mention the one grass roots that has been successful in the last 20 years despite being vilified in NY, Chicago and LA. Yes, I'm talking about the NRA. Peaking with the infamous Assault Weapons Ban in 1992, restrictions have been steadily rolled back to the point that they are only discussed in those three places. Its not even a subject for discussion anywhere else, other than the minute details. This change in attitudes is the result of a huge amount of grass roots activism. I remember going to Gun Shows with my Dad in the 80s and it was old white men, now they are the definition of the "Star Wars bar". Of course, 4 million active members with another 50 million watching their local representatives closely and holding them accountable is true democracy at work.

Some would say things online they would never dream of saying at a dinner party, others are just rude and inconsiderate in their real lives as well.<br><br>But the fact that some people like to be abusive does not mean it is an acceptable "form" in all online communities.

There are other factors besides energy abundance including cultural and historical influences (particularly protestantism, which posited equality before God). Even if their roots were germinating in advance, the modern democratic incarnations expanded and matured within the fossil fuel era; I suspect that the extension of rights and inclusion of larger sections of the populace could not have occurred without the abundance fossil fuels brought about. Social mobility, compression of time and space, decontextualization through technological advance and automation (itself a product of energy and unequal distribution) helped foster the standardization of rights and freedoms for everyone. Meanwhile, the elite munificence bestowed on the poor in the form of social programs and the like was a large carrot that helped quell popular dissent and maintain control while these leaders enjoyed their ostensible wealth and power. I tend to agree that democratic systems are the best forms of governance - to maintain power. And I question if it will continue to be feasible in an age of scarcity. Perhaps people will vote in a dictator for life - any demagogue promising miracles and preying on fear will suffice to turn the mechanisms of democracy into its own annihilator. It will be interesting to see. <br><br>Whether autocratic, oligarchic, despotic, democratic, or some other political form, it should be noted that they are all methods of governance, which implies hierarchy. Compartmentalizing the discussion to civilizations is limiting. Comparative anthropology with traditional/alternative ways of organization is illuminating. It is hard to see the oppression (domestication) without it.<br><br>Only with abundant energy could a democratic system operating within a civilization hope to mitigate the inherent inequality, temper the sharp edge of power, and mask the avarice of the 'big men' in such an arrangement. <br><br>Moreover, the rights and freedoms people enjoy in privileged sectors of the planet come at the expense of impoverishing the peripheral areas to ensure the continual asymmetric exchange so essential to civilizations in the first place. Exercising your rights and freedoms entails the destruction of someone else's in the same way that establishing a nature reserve means the destruction of a forest elsewhere. <br><br>I would say that future depopulation and localization will at least provide the fertile clime for a vibrant democracy to thrive. Nevertheless, culture and conditioning may prevent its fruition. People have developed their expectations in a competitive dog-eat-dog world. If pressed, I would say the maximum population density for a functioning democracy would be under 5000, optimally under 500.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c5491256680433736578 title="comment permalink">12/7/12, 6:51 PM</a><br><br>

I've been there for several 2 and 3 week visits, the last one ended a few weeks ago. I think part of the reason for their uncertainty about me though is because I push them to go beyond agriculture, building and simple domestic crafts so that they become even more independent of the industrial economy, and they would rather take their time getting there. A blacksmith just moved nearby, which is great. I wouldn't say they are heavily subsidized by the industrial economy, but yes there is still some dependence, probably least in the US, even better than the Amish in some respects.

I have seen his analysis evolve and incorporate new information, but never through the process of 'being wrong'. I put it down to infallability being an occupational hazard of archdruids and such. It's the pontifical equivalent of black lung -- hard to avoid if you work in the trade for long.<br><br>I've never suffered from it myself though, so I might be wrong.<br><br>On the substance of the disagreement, I think that with careful attention to the exact terms JMG is using, his position is accurate. For example, he is not saying democracies have no political prisoners, but is making the case that they generally have relatively few citizens incarcerated or killed for political crimes compared to autocracies. By excluding non-citizens from the tally, and taking a fairly conventional definition of which crimes are political, he is probably correct.<br><br>Of course if one includes all the non-citizens living under control of democratic nations in the calculation, and takes a slightly broader spectrum of crimes as being political in nature -- as I do -- one can reach a different conclusion about specific democracies, especially the more dysfunctional ones such as the US and Iran. <br><br>I can think of some historical examples of autocracies with relatively few political prisoners (i.e. Singapore under Lee Kuan Yew) and democracies with relatively more (i.e. Nicaragua under the Sandinistas) but these tend to appear only under unusual conditions of very low or very high stress. As a general rule, JMG's point applies: It appears that functional democratic processes are negative feedback mechanisms that act to prevent some abuses, especially those aimed at the politically relevant and enfranchised classes.<br><br>Setting aside some significant differences in analysis about democracy's current and past utility, I'm interested in seeing what tricks JMG has up his sleeve next week for getting some use out of this democracy thing in the future.<br><br>I figure it's kind of like salvaging parts from broken machinery...

I'm aiming for the middle to long term at this point. <br><br>Adrian, thanks for the reality check! Yes, that's also a way to help rebuild democratic process. <br><br>Wattson, you know, when I've already talked at length about the downside of democracy, rehashing that same issue is kind of beside the point. My Lakota ancestors could tell you some things about the behavior of American democracy, for example! Niebuhr's point, though, stands, and thank you for introducing it -- he's not someone I've read and studied yet, and clearly I'm going to have to remedy that. <br><br>Nano, exactly. Kallisti, by the way; my nose print has been mailed to the California State Department of Furniture and Bedding, if that means anything to you. <br><br>Justin, you might want to go back and reread what I wrote about dissensus. It doesn't consist of demanding that somebody else stop advocating something because you don't like it. If you'd wanted to respond in the spirit of dissensus to my post, you could have written something on the order of, "I think you're wrong, and I'm going to go do something else." That's dissensus: the principled encouragement of disagreement in order to maximize the number of options that are tried. If you want to go try something else, by all means, and I'll have some suggestions in future posts for how those who want to try something new might go about it. Still, denouncing my project in increasingly shrill terms isn't dissensus, it's the same weary logic of "how dare you disagree with me" that's played so central a role in gelding democracy here in the US. More on this later. <br><br>As for changing my mind, why, yes. I used to believe, for example, that the price of oil would keep rising indefinitely, and that the US government would never be so stupid as to monetize its debt directly -- and I aired both those views on this blog. I was wrong, and discussions with readers on this blog were among the things that helped me realize that I was wrong. On the other hand, I've aired a lot of highly unpopular views on this blog that turned out to be right, so I don't discard a thoroughly examined opinion based on research and careful thought just because somebody gets upset about it. <br><br>Retrun, democracy's a fairly new system, historically speaking, and it still has a lot of bugs that need fixing. It's still arguably the best starting point we've got. <br><br>Sleisz, I think it's definitely a matter of cultural style. One of the many vast mistakes of contemporary American thought is the notion that democracy is a culturally nonspecific system; it's not, not by a long shot. I'm by no means sure it's even a good idea outside of certain cultural settings, but that's a question for the people of other nations and cultures to decide for themselves.<br><br>Hal, it's going to be a hard fight, no question. <br><br>Nick, my take is a little different, as you'll see -- but Palmer's desiderata certainly wouldn't hurt. <br><br>Progress, I disappoint a lot of people; deal. As for the carrying capacity of the United States, I'd put it between 20 and 30 million at most -- and when it gets down to that level again, most of those 20 or 30 million will most likely speak Spanish.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c3133320362092121015 title="comment permalink">12/7/12, 10:00 PM</a><br><br>

A horse that doesn't need the lush, high sugar feeds modern horses require would be worth something in trade. I even know a talented young woman that would love to inherit such a line, me having no children of my own.<br><br>@ Nano, I imagined such a world when I was growing up in a remote lumber camp in far northern California. There was no hand writing on the wall but plenty of timber in the bunks of the logging trucks that testified to the decreasing size of logs being hauled to the saw mill. From the time I started grade school till I graduated from high school the log size decreased from three, four and five feet in diameter at the butt to eighteen inches to two feet being 'large sized.'<br><br>At that point I realized that things run out, communities collapsed and disappeared. I've no doubt the camp I grew up in is entirely forested with young timber and in another generation or two would barely be noted by any but a practiced eye. As did the mining camps scattered through out the area before us.<br><br>@ Watson, you aren't the first people on this continent to lose what you earned.

It was not legal of course to give him a gang beating, nor to lynch him as if he were black in the wrong time and place in the US.

The contrast with Canada is not something I understand, but guess it should be instructive? Perhaps we have something a lttle similar in the UK, although it does not rely so much on grass-roots activism, but on normal commercial infrastructure and advertisement. There is apparently a powerful segment of our population called 'The Motorist'.

It was to illustrate that democratic governments are just as capable of being unjust as non-democratic ones. It is the process and not the form or substance of democracy which is unassailable. With it's checks and balances on individual and collective power the democratic process is practically the only choice which has proven itself capable of restraining human nature. Which doesn't mean it necessarily will over time. That's still a far cry from Churchill's “democracy is the worst possible system of government, except for all the others”. Churchill was blithely ignoring the inherent frailty of human nature. By doing so he gave ammunition to the enemies of democracy. <br><br>It's ironic that Niebuhr wasn't defending democracy against Marxism. He considered Marxists to be among the Children of Light due to the fact they served a cause that was higher then self-interest. Though like other Children of Light the Marxists underestimated the power and lure of self-interest. As with the other issues concerning humanity their idealism was no match for the imperfection of human nature.

(Sorry, just getting used to the new order 'round here. I do live in Georgia, after all.)<br><br>After two of your books, and two years of your blog, I am finally going to have to take issue with a perception problem I've seen permeating your worldview. There aren't many, but this is one:<br><br>You aren't very friendly to permaculture. And that's really too bad. You seem to equate a legitimate nature-modeled, bio-mimicked, grass-roots movement of the people with outlandish eco-village visions. Permaculture isn't anything like that, or the green tech end of the leftist algal biodiesel farm comarades you lump them with.<br><br>I have no idea how many eco-villages there are in the industrial world today, and let us assume that there are twice that many more on the drawing board. But none of them, professing "the gospel of permaculture" or not, are, in and of themselves, permaculture.<br><br>Permaculture is simply a toolbox of principles that help any human practitioner answer questions in the way broader Nature tends to answer such questions. The vast majority of us know that future success lies in embedding ourselves in existing communities/cities/towns and providing a fluid model, again based on Nature's tactics, that will stand the test of descent, rebuilding community from within. <br><br>As such, this "nodal" adaptation spreads, via success and selection, by "chunking," in permaculture lingo - a growth of cellular division versus typical growth by gigantism - with appropriate site-specific variation of course, to create an ever-tightening "net" of emergent successful behavior in a novel environment.<br><br>I've passed out so many of your not-altogether-friendly-to-permaculture books that one might question my allegiance (altogether I love what you have to say), but I guess I assume that, one day, someone of your mental stature might see the embodiment of what you claim to be "the way" in a practice you seem to find sadly lacking. <br><br>And I humbly request that you divorce your correlation between grandiose ecovillages and permaculture as soon as you can find it reasonable to do so. Not that you use the term specifically, but I've read enough of your writing at this point to know what you mean. They aren't the same thing. <br><br>And I don't think I'm speaking just for myself when I get offended by being lumped into the "billion dollar eco-village" tract. I live in a $3000 16X20 canvas tent, in a humble hinter-community, with my wife and two children, and without electricity or running water, in the southern Appalachians - with years of terra-forming by shovel, vast amounts of planting/building/sporing, and trade-network building to go - before I really move onto a more permanent structure, before I feel like we're at that point on the Liebig factor list, so I hope you can forgive me if I don't find solidarity in such a comparison.<br><br>Otherwise, brilliant post as always!

My take on most ancestral societies judging from their scattered intact contemporaries, is that these groups maintain and transmit generationally very large knowledge and skill bases, compared with even 'educated' information-based individual moderns. Memory skills as JMG has reminded us can be very highly developed, linking images with associated knowledge. For example, I have been trying to find an old reference circa late 70s to a study in the Amazon rainforest that suggested a group's average vocabulary for plants and their associated uses habitats and growth stages was something like 2000 with one or two members always having circa 5000 names.<br>These kind of knowledge bases were maintained without the benefit of 'theory' and other useful methodologies of science. What it must be like to have one's mentation, with the full-benefit of the astonishing human capacity for accurate recognition even over decades, informed by the 'real thing' all the time, I can only dream of.

Europe in the Dark Ages also wasn't more than half desert, with the remaining fertile areas spotted with the remains of nuclear power plants and associated dead zones, as America in the postindustrial dark ages will be.<br><br>Tripp, er, I'd encourage you to revisit your assumptions. My doubts about permaculture have nothing to do with any supposed connection between that system and overpriced ecovillages; they're more a function of the lack of results I've seen so far from all the talk about permaculture this and permaculture that. If you're out there with your shovel in the mud, good; I exempt you from any and all such criticism. I've just seen way too many people take a permaculture training, or a whole series of them, and then go back to an ordinary middle class lifestyle with a grid-tied solar panel on the roof and a slightly exotic form of landscaping around their suburban McMansions.<br><br>As for ecovillages, here again, you're jumping to conclusions -- and as a favorite book of my childhood pointed out, when you jump to conclusions, you have to swim all the way back. You may not have noticed how many of the grandiose plans for ecovillages borrow the jargon of permaculture as a way to duck the very hard labor involved in supporting oneself by one's own efforts. I have long since lost track of the number of such plans I've read that natter on and on about edible tree crops and the like, as part of a claim that the inmates of the proposed ecovillage can maintain a middle class lifestyle. I've responded to those claims, in turn, because that's part of the ecovillage fantasy, not because it's somehow connected to permaculture.<br><br>By the way, I've also done the no heat, no running water, shovel in the mud thing, though this was back in the early 1980s and the hot new thing was biodynamic intensive gardening -- which is still the way I garden; I was just out this afternoon, in fact, digging dead leaves and other organic matter into the beds and getting them ready for winter. Having been there, I have the utmost respect for those who are willing to do the same.

"practice what you preach &amp; new comers are always welcome, regardless of politics". Recently, I took a Malaysian friend of mine skeet shooting. Like most Malays he is dark skinned, very polite and since he's recent college graduate, we shared my shotgun. I'm not very good at this, so I'm hardly qualified to give pointers and needless to say my friend struggled with hitting the target. One of the old timers there found out it was his first time and immediately began helping my friend with his form,stance etc. He's better skeet shot than I am now. During that afternoon spent with this older gentleman, he also noticed that my shotgun doesn't fit my friend very well and says "here try mine, it will fit you better". Keep in mind, this gentleman handed my friend, a complete stranger, his beautiful $6000 Italian shotgun to shoot. Later on, we find out he is president of the club. My friend's experience that day is a relatively common one, but in another sport it would be getting your first golf lesson from Jack Nickolas or Tiger Woods letting you use their clubs. My friend dreams of the day he can afford such a shotgun and absolutely loves skeet shooting. There is no preaching, only showing. If environmentalists really love the environment, why do so many live in dense urban areas without trees?<br><br>2. Organizationally, its really bottom up rather than top down ie local takes care of local, national takes care of national. Most local gun clubs require membership in the NRA to join, but the NRA doesn't get heavily involved in local issues unless they are hearing from their members, whether they are associated with a club or not. Semi-annually, they send out surveys "what direction do you want us to go" in both local and national issues and, yes I know its a miracle, actually follows through on through on the survey results. It also doesn't hurt matters that politicians are aware that we are regular voters, in both primary and general elections. Local gun clubs frequently host local politicians, which is where everyone starts. I met one of our senators in a room of about 50 people and none of us knew who he was. He gave a five minute speech and mingled during the following swap meet for 2 hours because he was a nobody. Everyone talked to him. We later endorsed him in our internal newsletter, the police chief of the department that uses OUR range (for free!) then endorsed him, and might have helped the police union along, etc....so he became a rep, then later a senator. Do you think he doesn't remember that swap meet? He still comes to visit us occasionally and there is no metal detector at the door, nor does there need to be...anyone who happens to be armed is only dangerous to those with bad intentions. <br> <br>This is probably more information than you wanted, but one other item that may be of interest to you particularly since it seems that you are unfamiliar with this organization in practice. The NRA instructor program would be a good model for your "Green Wizard certification." It works very well in the real world. <br> <br>Since I am quite different politically than most of your readers, I'm not surprised that Glenn Beck gave you a thumbs up. He's a little over the top since he's a TV/radio "personality", but pop culture takes offense to so many trivial things taken out of context, its hard to separate the trash from the treasure. He's a good man, and so are you. I imagine that if you were neighbors, you'd find plenty to talk about over coffee or tea.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c3112690104841666897 title="comment permalink">12/8/12, 9:43 PM</a><br><br>

I'll give you some fun facts about Australia courtesy of Dr Tim Flannery (the ecologist):<br><br>Currently there are about 22 million hectares (a hectare is about 2.5 acres) of arable land in use in Australia. Much of this land would be considered marginal agricultural land on other continents. Yet this is by far the best of all of our arable land. Already, after less than 200 years of use, 70% of that 22m hectares is degraded and in need of soil restoration programs. Much degraded land will have to be taken out of productivity if current intensive use continues.<br><br>I'll note that this equates to about a hectare of arable land per head of human population in Australia. Remember too that 70% of that land is degraded.<br><br>I would suggest, that the US has a more robust environment than Australia, however, that may counter-intuitively lead to higher rates of degradation. The US also has 14x the human population to support than here.<br><br>There is a golden rule in ecology that for long term sustainability, the human population of any given area rarely exceeds 20% to 30% of the carrying capacity of the land. I would suggest that the historical estimates of the local indigenous populations are a pretty good guide as to the numbers of humans that can be supported in either the US or Australia and this is before present land degradation is taken into account. In Australia, this equates to a human population of about 1 million people.<br><br>I would urge you to stop spending energy worrying about immigration - it is a side issue - and instead use it to establish an edible garden.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c6568396712332191460 title="comment permalink">12/9/12, 3:04 AM</a><br><br>

It's wonder of our age that I can enjoy philosophy of person living in Maryland here in Finland almost instantly after he writes it down. Difference to, lets say, Irish monks distributing classical texts during 6th century could not be more striking. Ideas travel fast right now. One commentator said that global system of order is on autopilot right now. That was truly well said; here in Europe I have had nagging feeling that nobody is controlling the plane right now. Those in power are so bound to different lobbies that they actually have no options but print more money. It hasn't solved any problems, but problems can be pushed to another day by it. No fine-tuning to specific problems at hand; moneyprinting is tool that fixes every problem. Thanks to this attitude, reading news is so repetitive nowadays that you cannot actually know from what year the news are, if you don't look date numbers; same shit is recycled on and on. Reading Pravda during Brezhnev era is closest analogy that comes to mind. Those newspapers are SO BORING there was no fear of insomnia in Russia those days, I believe. Flying with autopilot to nowhere, that is our system now. <br>Jim Brewster had some ideas about "racism" that I personally don't understand; if future belongs to crumbling central state apparatschik, what structures of social organisation are rising to supplement it? I have no doubt about it. Tribal belonging, belonging to some group defined by blood heritage is answer. In that kind of world some post-colonial upper-class angst about "crimes" of past has no place; that kind of thinking is possible only in our current industrial hyperstructure. And only upper-class persons can afford this kind of esoteric moral problems, at least here in Finland. Working class has enough problems of their own. You Americans seem to have very dim understanding of clan behaviour of extended families and kinship groups. Here in Finland serf system known as torpparijärjestelmä was totally disbanded only after world war two, so maybe future of world is not in so distant past here... Rasicsm is stupid label, and too big word for scaled-down future. Nobody has responsibility to carry any angst about Third World, that's fool's game.

Yes to sensory knowledge!<br><br>1. Re Hornborg reference and sensory vs verbal construction: <br><br>That quote seems a tad binary to me. Maybe it's not a question of sensory vs verbal construction, but sensory vs abstract, since that seems to be what the words "verbal construction" signify. <br><br>2. Re Amazon group's plant vocabulary: I don't know about the 70's reference, but Jared Diamond's <i>Collapse</i> talks about his experiences with knowledgeable villagers in New Guinea, making the same point.<br><br>3. Here in the States, if you get out among people involved in ecological restoration (many of whom are amateurs, not scientifically trained), you will find people with vast, sensory knowledge of plants, animals, hydrology and so forth, and words/names to go with. <br><br>I have learned (and continue to learn) most of what I know about plant identification and ecological associations from being out in the field with those more knowledgeable than I--folks whose knowledge, in a way, could be considered indigenous, whatever their cultural roots: they love their ecosystem and have come to understand it deeply in holistic yet specific ways and are willing, even longing to share their knowledge. <br><br>The only real way to learn this stuff is by long-term exposure and observation. And the longer you are doing that, the less generalities like "utility" or "liberty" mean. Yet concurrently, the more one observes, the more one discovers (with mentors' help) the general laws of interconnectedness that can sometimes only be expressed abstractly: by verbal constructs!<br><br>So, guidebooks and scientific, even abstract, knowledge are also useful; the hybrid of both sensory and scientific/abstract ecological knowledge, which I have encountered in a few people, is awe-inspiring.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c6243686719316932152 title="comment permalink">12/9/12, 7:34 AM</a><br><br>

I have seen the local school system program for middle school unwed mothers closed to sixth grade (11 year old) girls, due to lack of space.<br><br>I have seen laws against adultery struck down, rescinded, or more commonly ignored.<br><br>I have seen "marriage" come to mean a relationship with respect to tax laws.<br><br>I read that Christian marriage was instituted to bind the magic of the formation of a family, and the fertility of the woman, to the church and under church rules. I believe the sanctity , and magic, of fertility and of mating (forming a lifelong mated relationship) have been known since quite ancient times.<br><br>A few years back I can to the conclusion that mating, something like "marriage" today in the US, was about making babies. Respectful parents would grow into the roles of their own parents, producing progeny in a home culture that combines the rituals, traditions, celebrations, and values of their childhoods into a family, passing that home culture into the future.<br><br>In considering relationships, I think that a marriage differs from other cohabitation and sharing relationships. I think that a mated family (of whatever number of genders), forms the kernels that communities are built from. Communities open different opportunities, and hold different expectations, for mated (married) people.<br><br>Cherokee Organic's words brought home to me that mating, marriage, needn't be about spawning children, or even about passing the home culture onto the next generation. I still think that is the healthy way that people should establish a mating, and the primary reason to do so.<br><br>But a marriage must be a re-definition of the adults involved. Not just for tax and insurance aspects, but in forming a home culture from the experiences and cultural backgrounds of the principals.<br><br>Yes, I have meandered just a bit. My point is that, today, the US is fifty years past the point of "defending the family". Too many homes, too many cultures and communities don't have a use for too many of their children. Too many adults fail to invest their lives in the culture of their homes and their families. <br><br>Blame it on the Dept of Ed, with their emphasis on diverting children from the craft, lore, and culture of their family toward empowering the rentier class. Blame it on affirmative action. Blame it on denigration of religion and the cultural aspects of faith in daily life. Blame it on mass media and insidious commercial propaganda. Whatever.<br><br>As long as the basic premise of a consumer economy dictates replacing rather than repairing, from cars and air filters to numbers of unemployed (each has a name!), then I suspect abortion will continue to dispose of part of the unwanted extras.<br><br>The solution to abortion, I think, is to establish a sanctity of the home, of the cultural heritage of child from parent, of fertility, and ownership of communities for the well being, and culture, of it's families. Barring that, I expect abortion will continue to appear an aberrant affectation of the affluent.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c1063651130054970841 title="comment permalink">12/9/12, 9:00 AM</a><br><br>

Other factors will have played a much greater role in the process. <br><br>We already have a massively multi-lingual population. In my own city in New England (Providence, RI), there are more than 80 -- that's *eighty*! -- different primary home languages represented in the public schools. New York City would easily exceed that number of primary home languages, as would Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay area.<br><br>The linguistic development of multi-lingual populations follows its own set of trajectories. The most common of these trajectories passes through three stages over many generations. The first stage is multi-lingualism, where everyone uses one of the previous languages as his primary language at home, but as needed can communicate, can "get by," more or less competently in one or a few of the other languages. [Sometimes, if (as in Europe) there is a school system that teaches some of these languages systematically, the level of competence is very high indeed. Then you have bilingual or multi-lingual individuals as well as communities.]<br><br>In the second stage this process of informally "getting by" becomes regularized in any given community to the point where there arises a common way of communicating across different home languages within that community. In other words, there arises a additional new language with its own common (unwritten) rules of grammar and vocabulary. It is no one's home language, but it has its own unwritten grammar and vocabulary. New languages of this sort are called "pidgin" languages by linguists. In this stage the child still learns a home language growing up, and then also learns the local pidgin as a second language when he moves out from his home into his wider community.<br><br>In the third stage, when more and more people marry (as they inevitably will) across language boundaries, the current pidgin becomes the only home language in many families, and many children grow up speaking that pidgin as their first (and sometimes only) language. A former pidgin that has come to be widely used as community's first or home language is called a "creole" language by linguists. [There are excellent reasons to think that many of the great language families of Europe passed through a process of "creolization" (as linguists call it) at some point in their prehistories.]<br><br>At this point the former home languages become school subjects only in that community (like Latin is now), or they die out. <br><br>Any competent linguist can write a complete grammar and compile a full dictionary of a creole language, and its speakers will have the full range of linguistic competence as speakers of any of the former language ever did.<br><br>[All this is a somewhat simplified explanation of well-established results in the theory of human language development. It is no more controversial among linguists than is biological evolution among biologists.]<br><br>As our nation becomes a third-world one, and the public school systems of the several states become ever more impoverished, this process of "creolization" will undoubtedly occur in communities where there is more than one widely used home language. And so we will end up with new spoken languages, not always the same in different parts of the former United States. <br> <br>[to be continued]<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c2191659757024415585 title="comment permalink">12/9/12, 10:13 AM</a><br><br>

If the state school systems break down, it is only a matter of a century or so until new creole languages arise from those pidgins, and the old languages (English and Spanish) die out in those communities, or become mere school subjects like Latin is now.

Thanks again!<br><br>@Progress and Conserve,<br><br>The support of legal immigration in the US is rooted almost entirely in economic considerations, with little regard given to the moral considerations. High finance likes to see 3% growth year on year. Immigration is one such lever with effects both direct (more customers; more labor) and indirect (cheaper, pliant labor; a social distraction to take economic pressure off the ruling class; a release of pressure on capital expenditure to increase productivity) that support economic growth. The social impacts are often glibly and uncritically dismissed as adjustment pains which will work themselves out with no guidance.<br><br>Another such lever, by way of example, is the often unequal distribution of reproductive self-determination, as famously applied in the Third Reich and in US mental institutions.<br><br>@Cherokee Organics,<br><br>Is there any reason that the social norm of acceptance of racial, behavioral, or religious non-conformity, carrying as it does significant implications for economic policy including the distribution of wealth and income, is <i>not</i> among the norms enabled by surplus and growth, and would not likely be among those to be deprecated for poor ROI under descent conditions? Why do you not think humans would claim and mark turf for their group, just as they and other primates do now, and maintain tight control over access to said turf and the rest of the group's resources, just as they do now? Primates in particular tend to be social and tribalist, and tend to establish observable norms for in-group identification e.g. skin/hair/eye color, natural/modified/adorned body shape, worship of deity, and/or a secret gesture.

Most of the sources I know of that used it back in the day, though, had it begin in 476 with the end of the Western Roman Empire and end right around the beginning of the First Crusade in 1096, the point at which Europe was no longer getting pounded by invaders and was ready to do some invading of its own. <br><br>Juhana, "flying on autopilot" is to my mind a very good metaphor for the current situation.

As a very broad rule with plenty of individual exceptions, Spanish speaking people in North America today are more likely to know how to get by in conditions of extreme poverty than English speakers. "Most," of course, means 51% on up; I'd expect large English speaking areas east of the Mississippi, but that's only a third of the country. <br><br>Progress, thank you! The word is "thaumaturgy" -- a thaumaturge is a person who practices thaumaturgy. I don't know of a more common word for it, which I suppose is not surprising, since free discussion of the mechanics of theumaturgy is not exactly in the best interests of a magician state like ours.

The "birds" are clay disks tossed through the air. Think of it as aerial target practice. <br><br>In general though, we did inherit this passion from you. Your country and the rest of Europe, has a very long history of the shooting sports, however as you noted, it was primarily an aristocratic pursuit. The punishment of "poaching" and estate ownership of wildlife in your country contributed directly to the idea most American hunters have on wildlife, it belongs to all of us and not just the landowner. After all, deer really aren't concerned whose property they are on. My understanding is that the states is unique in this regard, with the rest of the world's laws being similar to yours, at least in Africa where I have looked, not surprisingly. I may be wrong on this though. As with many things, the seeds of resentment in the old country sprouted wonderful fruit here. Coupled with Tedy Roosevelt's foresight in game management, its turned out rather well as of now. <br><br>A great many Americans (of all colors) survived the last depression by hunting everything from squirrels to elk. A lot of hill-billy grandmothers in those days still knew how to make black powder from chicken litter if shells were unaffordable. This was also the reason that a lot of WWII GIs (ie Sgt York types) were such good shots, because a lot of 10 year old boys were handed a 22 with literally 1 or 2 bullets and told to provide dinner for the family. An empty stomach is a very good incentive to shoot well. Today, out here in flyover country (Oklahoma for me), it is still very common to fill the freezer with all sorts of game since its higher quality than what you can buy at the grocery store, at any price. This is one of the reasons I took up hunting, relatively inexpensive source of truly organic meat. The closest in an organic grocery store is buffalo, and its $10/lb and only half as good. Hunters, Foodies and Vegetarians\Vegans have alot of common ground in opposition to factory farms. I like to know exactly where my food comes from. But I must admit, I don't normally talk to the Vs....typically because they are militant and why waste the time? Another reason, and this is a big one, there is nothing that compares with the intense satisfaction of it...a successful hunt is a very primal experience. JMG or others more educated on Jungian psychology than I may be able to explain it in better terms, but it will literally touch your spiritual core. I'm not the only one who feels this way, my wife who was militantly anti-hunting, thought it was romantic the first time I brought home venison, and then the quality of the meat made her gasp. Ethics are pretty simple, I won't kill something I'm not eating and do it right. Trophy hunters, frequently scorned, usually donate the meat to needy families..google Hunters against Hunger if you are interested. Doing it right means a clean shot with no suffering. Of course, the Hollywood idea is that you go out with an Uzi, spray for an hour, and drag home half the forest leaving a barren wasteland. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is one of the most challenging things you can do and one of the most rewarding. There's a reason the aristocrats reserved it for themselves in the old world.<br><br>FYI, hunting is on the rise again, in no small part due to reasons I stated. Ironically though, despite the reputation of being an old white man's sport, the fastest growing group of new shooters and hunters is single mothers of all colors...the face of the NRA will be changing soon and it will shock a lot of people who haven't been paying attention. "Ladies night" isn't limited to the pubs anymore. :-) Emily Miller of the Washington Times is making a career out of chronicling this sea change.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c1335273505187452804 title="comment permalink">12/9/12, 8:46 PM</a><br><br>

A lot of people attribute it to inbreeding from the herds being reduced so criminally. I tend to believe its because they're too smart for most people.

By pinning the blame on human nature democracies still receive credit for what they can accomplish. While avoiding any of the blame for what follows in the wake of their demise. This point serves to deny anti-democratic forces some of the weapons that will be used against democracies in their struggle for power. Those anti-democratic forces will be at their strongest when enough individuals do not feel like they benefit from the results that democratic governments produce. <br><br>As far as Churchill is concerned, he might have very well been more insightful then I give him credit for. It's really hard seeing him as friend of democracy though. Considering he was also the person who viciously attacked the form of democracy when he said that “the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter”. At a time when democracy was very much under threat that is hardly a ringing endorsement. His imperialist and racist views can be put aside.

It would be nice to be able to communicate intelligently over language, cultural and probably political barrier, so let's try. From my point of view, relying to your own kin is not an ideology; it has no ideological drive behind it. Calling it xenophobic is lie because of this underlying factor. Trusting your own and distrusting the Others is just the oldest and most proven survival tactic in the world. Even in your country, if I have understood it right, those southern immigrants belonging to criminal underworld already behave like this. They define their territory and loyalties by blood ties. Tribalism is not race specific, it is just fact of life when you live in insecure society. Tribal thinking also seeds those warbands JMG is talking about, they are not armies but loose gangs based on common heritage. Want a model for warband commanders in your country? Look at prison gang leaders, there is model for future American warband leaders, I believe. Tribalism is predicament, not a solvable problem. It is just the natural way to do things, if you are poor and live in insecure world. Only those in cosy positions within imperial machinery can afford grandiose dreams of working, global multiculture. I myself have risen from being a welder and technician in heavy steel industry to college educated man, and during my steel worker career worked a lot with Poles and Great Russians, updating gargantuan and decayed corpses of Soviet industry with Finnish quality. Common to all these countries was that my working class comrades whom I worked with, nice guys most of them, lived in grassroot world of tribalism thriving under dysfunctioning state apparatchik. Everything was done through unofficial contacts and connections. You had to be a man of trust, somebody who had identifiable place in social tapestry. Outsiders were not welcomed, if they didn't bring something valuable to community. I have this feeling that this shadow world of tribal and clannish connections shall long outlive monstrous edifice of political correctness and delusional dreams known as European Union. But this has no ideological drive behind it; it is just the way world is. <br>You have to stand with your own kin, not with some silly dreams about utopian world. Those dreams are side product of wealth so great that you can turn your back to your own nation and hug some dreams about better world instead. When everything goes poorer again, those dreams go away. You know Brewster, I am not talking about how I want world to be, but how it just is, based on my personal experience. Different points of view are valued though, I am no visionary, just a common man from small and largely insignificant county from extreme north.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c5600909398052222276 title="comment permalink">12/10/12, 1:02 AM</a><br><br>

It is interesting to me, what the recurring theme is in the topics that really heat up the comment thread: the hypothesis that the world will not "end" suddenly, it will change dramatically but over a long time frame; the notion that the current system of government is not utterly irredeemable and need not be overthrown wholesale and replaced with a radical new system; the idea that we are not likely to nuke ourselves into oblivion. What seems to unify these topics that make blood boil is the general theme of punctuated gradualism rather than catastrophic upheaval.<br><br>So I have to wonder; how much of this is driven by the simple impatience of wanting the change to happen NOW (for good or for ill), rather than with frustrating slowness over the generations? Perhaps people don't like the idea that even if they live a long time, they will not see anything close to a "resolution" of all these issues, and will in fact just see more of the slide deeper into the troubles that the issues create?

Usually it is due to either money issues (i.e. there is money to be "made" or controlled) or people are not sufficiently able to connect to each other due to sheer size, resulting in cliques.<br> I have often thought that depending on the focus, groups of 30-100 can be on the same page or work things out, and much above that things start to get hairy.

Poke that with a stick, and you get top of the lungs yelling every time. <br><br>Johan, that's an intriguing point. A case could indeed be made that current media make it easier to flood the collective conversation with noise and thus prevent the reasoned debate that makes democracy work best. <br><br>Nano, you get not a gold star but a Golden Apple.

I will train to explain better my anterior comment.<br>Our idea of democracy is based in fundamental beliefs of our Occidental Civilization, partially based in the idea of unlimited world resources.<br>Is not necessary to remember that our idea of democracy comes of the 18 century, in a moment in which the resources of the world seemed infinite. It is an inheritance of the Christian idea of the equality of all the men in front of God. <br>In the “Long descend” world, the idea of infinite resources will be inapplicable, and thus probably the idea of improve our democracy too will be inapplicable.<br>I’ll try to show it with an example, based in our ideal of Liberty, fundamental for our concept of Democracy , one of the consequences of the ideal of liberty is the principle of the individual freedom. In a world of limited resources, in which there is not possibility of economic growth. The idea of competence for natural resources, necessarily will be replaced for the idea of cooperation in the use of these. It means that the principle of individual freedom will be total or partially restricted for the idea of self or imposed limitation. Concretizing the example: couples that only can raise a limited number of children (as it’s happening now in China).<br>If a society is forced, for the scarcity of resources, to impose a measure so tremendous to the people, and besides to impose another measures equally brutal, will be difficult to speak about democracy in the way that we are speaking now. <br>As an example of society with no economic expansion, I remember some of the ideas outlined by Socrates in the book “The dialogs” wrote by Plato. In the utopist society described in some of these dialogs, people had a Spartan way of life: Virtually a vegetarian diet, nudism in summer, no furniture, intentional scarcity of medical cares, birth control, eugenics, absence of individual freedom, religion designed for reinforce this model of society (and, in consequence, limitation of the free thinking),…..Socrates said that it was the only way for to avoid that the economic growth of the state-city would exceed the capacity for providing the resources of its territory, causing famines and wars of expansion with the surrounding cities. <br>The change of paradigm consequence of the impossibility of the economic expansion , implies that we will have to embrace new principles, and forgot others that have been fundamental in the building of our present civilization. There is a possibility that these new beliefs wouldn´t support our idea about democracy.<br>I dare that there are similar reasons to the exposed that must be applied to the rest of fundamental beliefs of our civilization, making necessary their replacement for different beliefs that will be the fundaments of the build of a new civilization, that will replace our Occidental or Christian Civilization in the same way that it replaced, after the collapse of the Roman Empire, the Hellenic Civilization. <br><br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c3532375265119812930 title="comment permalink">12/10/12, 10:35 AM</a><br><br>

If the tribal norm is self destructive and destructive of the supporting environment then clearly it is dysfunctional. Jared Diamonds book "Collapse" is full of examples of societies that failed to change course. I'm sure those societies prided themselves on conformity and social norms, despite evidence that such things were ultimately self destructive. The Greenland norse for example starved rather than eat fish (which were a social taboo) even though the fish were in good supply.<br><br>Hi Brad K,<br><br>Quote: "Cherokee Organic's words brought home to me that mating, marriage, needn't be about spawning children, or even about passing the home culture onto the next generation."<br><br>Ha!

However, I had no idea that people equated marriage and children until only recently! hehe! Why did people keep asking me, "so, when are you going to have some children?"<br><br>Hi Leo,<br><br>Yes, you are correct. They do make a difference. I gather plants from all over the place to grow here. Basic tools are also a real advantage.<br><br>I've read numbers between 6m and 15m. Still, I'm not sure what it would look like. You know I often wonder why we build urban environments over some of our best soils. Doncaster and Templestowe used to be massive orchard areas. Cranbourne and Werribee South still are market gardens, but they are slowly being sold and built up. I feel for the farmers as there is not much money in market gardens and orchards and developers come knocking on their door and it gives them a retirement fund.

(I think you said this in a comment, but I can't now find the comment so apologies if I'm misrepresenting you)<br>My feeling is that this is the wrong way around. If things continue as they currently are, without any military action or similar discontinuity, I think that the Chinese (and other developing nations) will slowly outbid and displace US consumption of resources. I think that the US will need to take China down to maintain access to the resources it's currently using. <br>This is basically what your recent narrative is saying too -- the US was attempting to use its military might to displace China from a "colony" to secure the US's access to the colony's resources. <br>A relatively minor point, but worth making explicitly I think, as a lot of Westerners seem to feel very threatened by China, whereas in reality the Chinese are so far below parity (in terms of access to resources) that it is very fair that they increase their access. It's good to be aware that China probably wants to continue business-as-usual for as long as possible (a point I know you have repeatedly made, JMG)<br><br>On topic for this week, and with regard to the number of irate posts you're receiving. Your comment about grid-tied PV on the roof, and a slightly unusual garden around the McMansion touched a bit of a nerve with me. Although we try to drive relatively little (5000 km over two years), we still consume too much and our lifestyle is unsustainable. I guess we (collectively) are masters at self-deception, and it's natural to demonise the person who shows us our shortcomings (eg. Socrates). I really appreciate your candour and bravery in saying the things you do in this blog.<br><br>Something that would be helpful to me is an illustration of what a sustainable lifestyle would look like. I know you advocate that people "collapse now and avoid the rush", but it would be interesting to sketch a lifestyle that would be sustainable globally _if_ we were an ecotechnic society (ie. weren't in a dark age). eg: a bicycle per family, vegetable plot, roast dinner once a month, 0.5 kWh/day electricity per family, etc. (those are just very vague/rough guesses -- what do you think?)<br><br>Thanks for your outstanding essays.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c8526445933736109148 title="comment permalink">12/10/12, 3:58 PM</a><br><br>

I have to admit my knee-jerk reaction to this is "oh bother, meetings and process and all that stuff, yawn..."<br><br>But then I think about my life here in a small town in a rural county. I see the city and county mayors around town, at the Mall*Wart, etc., and can always chat with them. Same for the Sheriff. When it comes time to vote in local elections, I personally know a good number of the names on the ballot (often well enough to know NOT vote for them), and I have friends who know everyone on the ballot to fill in the gaps. One of our four city councilmen works out at the same gym that my mother and I go to; whenever I see him there we get to have a long talk about all the inside dirt, the workings, who the obstructionists and theocrats are, and what is being done to circumvent or dislodge them. <br><br>So, without ever going to a meeting at the Grange (which actually burned down a few years ago, dangit) I realize I am pretty well connected to local politics and an active participant in the efforts to make local government more responsive to the real concerns and needs of the community. The fact that all local elections are non-partisan probably helps; I think many of my close allies in local politics probably align with a party I have never been much attached to at the higher levels, but when it comes to local issues we are definitely working side by side. <br><br>So what is the point? Not sure; I guess that when you actually do have a local community of people who know each other and have real connections to each other, "grass-roots" politics take root as just another aspect of community life.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c5932022327887163315 title="comment permalink">12/10/12, 5:07 PM</a><br><br>

If my understanding is correct a technocracy is a system in which technological experts such as scientists or engineers comprise the government rather than politicians, lawyers or economists with no formal scientific or technical training. I would assume that such a system could either consist of popularly elected technocrats or technocrats chosen by undemocratic means. If officials are not elected by popular vote then this system could be condemned as another form of authoritarianism but if people could vote, but all candidates had to have scientific or technical training, could such a system be better than democracy?<br><br>Alternatively, a system somewhere between a democracy and a technocracy could be conceived whereby candidates for office would have to demonstrate a baseline level of knowledge and expertise in some important field before being deemed eligible to run for office. This might work like the imperial Chinese system where people would have to pass gruelling imperial examinations before becoming state bureaucrats except there would be the added step of having to be democratically elected.

I've been involved with firearms and the shooting sports for nearly 50 years, now (I’m 57.) - and I find nothing in Bob's analysis with which to significantly disagree.<br><br>I will add a couple of points, though. The NRA found its original backers among existing US industry, specifically the civilian firearms and ammunition industries. Thus, there was never a question that there was a (commercial) REASON for the NRA to exist, because there was an existing PROFIT to be protected or amplified.<br><br>This stands in contrast to the "Green Movement." For good or ill, the Greens never represented a profit center to much of ANY existing industry to be found in America. In fact, it's easy to find industries where the original Greens represented a threat. (Oil, coal, or infant formula - the list of industries threatened by the early Green movement is MASSIVE.)<br><br>Furthermore, as Bob pointed out with some eloquence, the NRA helped to coalesce the shooting sports and their preexisting commercial backbone around a FEW simple concepts, which could then be used to transcend race, religion, creed, or political party. <br><br>The Green Movement never had anything like this unity of purpose. And the Greens split, early on, over a question that is destined to vex all of humanity, sooner or later - that question being, "Which is more important, humans, or the environment that keeps them alive."<br><br>I don’t believe that there was any question among the early Greens in the United States that the environment was considered by them to be more important than the needs or desires of humans. The echoes of Malthus could be heard loudly in “Silent Spring,” and many other opinion shaping publications of those days. Appropriate tech, energy conservation and the Zero Population Growth movement FOR THE United States were all considered something close to Sacred, among some Greens. (Including this one, to some large extent.)<br><br>But the Green movement in the United States bifurcated (in a terrible way, in my opinion) over the question of population growth INSIDE the United States. The best example, for those readers who are unaware, is to take a look at how a single donor David Gelbaum, apparently forced the Sierra Club to change their stance on US population growth due to immigration, in 1996.<br><br>Commercial interests (National Chamber of Commerce, anyone?) and big donor money shift important debates. Well funded organizations speak of "immigrant rights" and "open borders," in such a way that those opposed to these concepts are easily labeled as "racists," by the unwary or uncaring.<br><br>And here we are, in a country with 313,000,000 million inhabitants - growing at a current rate of 1% per year, mostly due to new immigrants and their children.<br><br>And we are on a website run by a Druid who confidently predicts that the population of the US will have to collapse TENFOLD, to 30 million OR LESS. <br><br>@Cherokee - How is is possible that you can consider this a "side issue?" It's going to be life or death for literally millions of my countrymen.

I've also belonged to a number of environmental groups and been an environmental activist in some form or another for most of my adult life. You certainly don't have to tell me that the NRA, et al., have been a lot more successful than the green groups. But I hardly think the comparisons being made are helpful.<br><br>What the green groups have been trying to do, indeed are required to do if they are to be in any way successful, is nothing less than to convince average people to completely overturn the comforts and habits of a lifetime, no, generations of lifetimes, and to accept some level of privation and discomfort. Or at least to support policies that can easily be portrayed that way. We see what that same suggestion by JMG often elicits even in this rather select community. All that for benefits that will probably never be obvious to them during their lifetimes, and against the current of a multi-billion dollar propaganda industry and associated political allies working hard to convince them that they can have it all.<br><br>Now, the environmental groups have often done a poor job of communicating what is really needed, and many have gone down the chute of pushing a "green-light" agenda which also tries to promise everyone can have their comforts along with a clean, green world. And the leaders have usually been AWOL when it came to walking the talk.<br><br>But seriously, there is no comparison to the onus shouldered by the gun-rights groups. All they had to do was corral a strong, motivated interest group, funded, as pointed out by P&amp;C, by an equally motivated industry. The statement that they have transcended partisanship has me gobsmacked. The NRA, while slightly less partisan than GOA and a few other groups, has essentially become a working organ of the GOP. That's pretty much the reason I quit.<br><br>All of which is to say that I'm not so sure the comparison is very useful. We can all wish the job of educating the public on green or energy issues were as simple as the one performed quite ably by the gun rights lobby. But trying to shoehorn the successes of the latter into the needs of the former will probably not yield much results.<br><br>I love my guns, and wish stupid politicians would stop trying to accomplish the impossible and remake US society along the lines of Europe. But the gravity of that issue compared with the broad range of environmental issues is quite trivial. Unfortunately, that's a very hard sell.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c7718252862483935483 title="comment permalink">12/11/12, 4:53 PM</a><br><br>

We are in no better situation here. You however, are focused on a single issue (immigration) when you would perhaps do well to look at the big picture.<br><br>The problem is though, that if you acknowledge the big picture, you unfortunately have to address your own activities and this poses far more difficulty for you than simply ranting about other peoples actions? <br><br>It may actually be that newcomers to an area will have higher rates of survival in any downturn because they don't adhere to the local dogma. <br><br>People can be pretty dogmatic. The convicts that were settled here in 1788 almost starved because they were too reluctant to eat fish. They had to be resupplied from Cape Town of all places. <br><br>I walk the talk and live a life of voluntary poverty and accept the limitations imposed on me by nature and this location. <br><br>Spare me your moral outrage too.

Do I have that correct? By emphasizing enforcement, you are acknowledging that the incentives for immigration will still exist, therefore just changing quotas will turn legal into illegal. There are all kinds of reasons why it's better to "go with the flow" and sanction immigration at a relatively high level. Illegal immigrants (or undocumented if you prefer) have fewer rights and are more easily exploited. Their presence tends to drive down wages and opportunities for the "legal" working class (both immigrant and native-born)--as JMG has pointed out this benefits the upper and middle class, but only in the short term. And the uncertainty of their status does little to help build stable communities. You would counter with calls for more enforcement as if that doesn't have its own frightful costs and unintended consequences. If you're so concerned about the USA's carrying capacity, don't forget that some of the biggest threats, sea level rise and erratic weather among them, don't stop at any borders. The carrying capacity of the USA is merely a dependent subset that cannot be separated from the carrying capacity of the planet.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c2976893666366683102 title="comment permalink">12/12/12, 10:20 AM</a><br><br>

Capitalism was a response to real economic growth, and does not work without it. Mother nature never heard of 10% interest.<br><br>Growth requires more materials, more energy, more labour and more customers. Hence, our democratic _capitalist_ government encourages immigration, legal or otherwise, to continue the growth. What JMG said about illegal immigration keeping wages down applies too.<br><br>Now, we are in an age of declining resources, so attempting economic growth is logically unproductive.

I'll tell you, Chris, if JMG posts on the situation in the Congo, then I'll express some moral outrage. But he posted on immigration last week and democracy this week - so I prefer to address that. <br><br>JMG tells us that the population of the US landmass is destined to drop to 30 million. We add 3 million people a year, here in the US. What I try to express (apparently not all that well, in your opinion) is not anything like moral outrage - it is, rather, a projection of abject fear that 10's or 100's of millions of my countrymen are going to suffer and die. Exacerbating that fear is the idea that the more people in the US, the worse the suffering is going to be, and the higher the death rate is going to climb.<br><br>And we haven't even yet mentioned the increased damage that the growing US population does to global ecosystems. Plus the fact -- mentioned by several posters this week, already - that growth in US population really benefits our wealthy middle class and big corporations and therefore mostly enables our continued overseas military force projection.<br><br>You state that new immigrants may survive collapse better than our native born population. I don't know about that - especially for those who immigrated here from infancy until about age 12, or so.<br><br>American culture is such a dominating force. A few years of watching TV, living in air conditioning, eating fast food, and driving instead of walking will turn a fit young immigrant into, quite frankly, an out-of-shape "American Consumer" who is hardly more likely to survive collapse than most of the rest of us.<br><br>And Cherokee, you advocate voluntary poverty. That's admirable, truly. To my knowledge, though, the percentages of immigrants who come into the US with the express goal of living in "voluntary poverty," approaches statistical zero. Among their children and grandchildren, the percentage is likely to be lower still. <br><br>Many US immigrants leave the simple life that you strive for for yourself - sustainable agriculture, walkable communities, and close-knit groups of friends and family, only to move into the US. Once IN the US though, they become inexorably dependent on Big Ag and fossil fuel transportation, and they sadly find their friends and kin groups spread all across planet Earth.<br><br><a href=consuming-democracy.html#c4730194983147097993 title="comment permalink">12/12/12, 6:45 PM</a><br><br>

My sympathies are more with the illegal ones, to be honest. In the popular narrative, at least, our illegal immigrants walked up and then waded the Rio Grande. That gives them the option of walking back home, if things get bad enough in the US - and that could be a very nice option to have, if JMG is correct with his numbers.<br> <br>The legal immigrants mostly arrive by airplanes and other fossil fuel devices. Their options are going to be far more limited, post-collapse. Europe is its own unique situation. I won't offer advice to you about that, because I'm not European. I will say that I would be concerned with too much change, too fast. In the event of collapse and hunger on the Continent I fear that you may find that modern multiculturalism only worked while floating on a pool of abundant oil.

The fact is that there are many immigrants joined in your army, etc. that are making work your country, that thing is not specially difficult because they have the same fundamental beliefs than the Americans, due that they belong to the Occidental Civilization (Tonybee).

The pizza and the hot dogs haven brought introduced in US for immigrants from Italy and Germany respectively, that in their moment were considered intruders for some Americans; sons or grandsons of inmigrants. <br>For to avoid crowd movements caused for the coming famine, the solution is to improve dramatically the agricultural production in all the world, thinking in to reduce the spectacular descend of productitity foreseeing with the oil scarcity.<br>In the North Korean famine caused for oil scarcity in that country, after of the collapse of Rusia, the problem was the transport of the grain from the fields to the cities, because there was scarcity of fuel for the trucks.<br>In Cuba the response for the same trouble consisted in urban fields.<br>The problem with the immigrant people is when the receiver country don´t integrates them.<br>The History shows us some examples of migratory problems that finally, are “solved” by the war: Mexico with north American immigrants in Texas.

Most towns in Vermont still hold an annual meeting each March. The voters of the town assemble and spend a few hours working through an agenda, approving a series of articles that center mostly on the town budget, Town officers are also elected at that time (this is done by an all-day balloting rather than by a floor vote). The Town Meetings here are still somewhat functional, although the level of discourse does sometimes descend to the level of internet blogs and unfortunately most of the big decisions that effect us get made in Montpelier or Washington or a corporate headquarters. It does, however, give us some practice at group decision-making. From these meetings I know what it's like to rise from my seat and face my neighbors and try to make a cogent argument in a short amount of time. I get practice at listening to people I disagree with. I've also learned what it's like to have my great idea voted down and yet to still work hard to be civil to my opponents, who may well support me at another time. This ancient system actually does still work and I hope we here in Vermont can find it within ourselves to keep the old system functioning.<br><br>JMG, the adult education idea sounds like a very important one and I'm looking forward to seeing what you have to say. The suggestion made in the comments to find a way to distribute the best of the old texts is a good one. Dover Books has indeed served for many decades as the prime source for many old classics in science, math, technology, and many other fields. My vote for the best calculus text for self-instruction is not, however a Dover Book; Sylvanus P. Thompson and Martin Gardner's Calculus Made Easy (St. Martins Press, 1998) is a revision of Thompson's old classic from 1910. Very clearly written and quite a comprehensive treatment of elementary calculus.<br><br>I would encourage those interested in this sort of revival of the texts to use, but do not depend on, the electronic media and the internet.
