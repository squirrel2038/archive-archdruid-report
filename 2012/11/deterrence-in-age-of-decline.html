There are times, and this is one of them, when I wonder if somewhere in the last few weeks we all somehow got teleported into an alternate universe where nothing works quite the same way as were used to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That feeling may be a bit easier to understand when I mention that I’ve just been praised <a href=http://www.glennbeck.com/2012/11/12/glenn-live-like-people-determined-to-be-free>on the air by Glenn Beck</a>. Yes, <i>that</i> Glenn Beck. He was commenting on an interview I did not long ago with Chris Martenson on <a href=http://www.peakprosperity.com/podcast/80011/john-michael-greer>his Peak Prosperity podcast</a>, which is not a thing I’d normally expect someone like Beck to find congenial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Oh, and Beck noted in the same broadcast that of course there are hard limits on energy and resources.<br>
<br>
If that hasn’t set your brain spinning, dear reader, consider this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the midst of all the handwaving about a new age of US energy independence, the Atlantic Monthly has published an article pointing out that <a href=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-wont-energy-independent-even-154500330.html>the United States won’t be energy independent</a> even if we do end up producing more oil than Saudi Arabia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now of course anyone who’s run the numbers knows this already; for several years now, Saudi Arabia has been the second largest petroleum producer in the world, right behind Russia, and #3 has long been—drumroll, please—the United States. It’s a measure of the sheer wasteful extravagance with which we use petroleum in this country that the world’s third largest petroleum producer still has to import around 2/3 of the oil it consumes each year. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Again, this isn’t news, or it wouldn’t be if Americans were by and large interested in dealing with the real world. It’s not even out of character for the Atlantic Monthly to run an article so unsympathetic to our national delusion du jour. What makes this startling, at least to me, is that the article in question has<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>been splashed all over the internet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s almost as though people are actually starting to grapple with the hard reality of the predicament facing industrial society—and that does rather suggest that we’ve arrived in a universe very different from the one we’ve inhabited for the last three decades. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That being the case, I’m going to take the risk of discussing a few topics that I would normally leave alone, even though they have a great deal of relevance to the overall project of this blog and to the specific project of the last year or so of posts here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, the end of America’s age of empire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This isn’t because I have nothing to say about them; quite the contrary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s because they are the sort of hot-button topics that reliably make otherwise sane people go barking mad. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You’ll understand this a little beter when I mention that the first of these topics, the one I mean to discuss this week, is the role of nuclear weapons in the decline and fall of America’s empire, and more generally in the twilight years of industrial civilization. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those who doubt that this is a subject that inspires raving lunacy need only recall those thrilling days of yesteryear, when crude oil was spewing from a wrecked wellhead deep under the Gulf of Mexico and the words “Deepwater Horizon” were on everyone’s lips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On an astonishing number of internet forums, people were loudly insisting that the only way to solve the problem was to use a nuclear weapon on the well. I don’t recall anyone explaining exactly what good would be done by vaporizing the last impediments to the flow of oil and sending a fifty foot high tsunami of oily, radioactive water crashing into the shores of the Gulf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For that matter, I don’t recall many cases in which anyone even brought up those far from minor points. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s remarkable how many people seem to forget that a nuclear weapon is simply an explosive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s a very powerful explosive, and one that produces some dangerous residues when it blows up, but it’s still just an explosive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It doesn’t, say, open a rift in the fabric of reality, through which inconvenient or unwanted things can be thrust out into the primal void; all it can do is blow things to smithereens, and unless your problem can be solved by blowing something to smithereens—or, please note, threatening to do so—a nuclear weapon will do you no good at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You’d have a hard time figuring that out from the way nuclear weapons get discussed in this country, though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By and large, once the prospect of using a nuclear weapon enters the discussion, even the most basic sort of rational thought waves goodbye and sends back a forwarding address from another state. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now it’s only fair to say that not all the dubious reasoning that goes on around nuclear weapons is quite so florid as the example I’ve just given. For examples of the less colorful sort of nuclear folly, I’m going to pick on two recent commenters on this blog. One of them, partway through last month’s narrative fiction about the fall of America, argued that a US president facing a Chinese military response like the one I outlined in the second episode would simply order a first strike on China’s nuclear arsenal, destroy it on the ground, and proceed to deal with the crisis in a stronger position. The other, commenting on the finished narrative, insisted that I should have left out all the military stuff since we are, she claimed, evolving beyond war; in the discussion that followed, she noted plaintively that nobody wants a nuclear war and yet we’ve got nuclear weapons, and isn’t that crazy?</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Well, no, it’s not, since clearly some people—my first commenter is an example—do think that nuclear war can be a good idea. (A successful first strike with nuclear warheads on someone else’s arsenal is still a nuclear war.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, let’s start with the first commenter’s suggestion, because it provides a useful example of one kind of nuclear irrationality that’s fairly common these days. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s suppose that a US president, faced with a military crisis overseas, does in fact order a nuclear first strike on China’s strategic nuclear arsenal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Let’s also suppose that, ignoring all the rules of strategy from Sun Tsu on down, the Chinese haven’t anticipated the possibility, don’t have their arsenal ready to launch, and haven’t informed the US that the bombs will go up and the boom will come down the moment an American missile crosses into Chinese airspace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We’ll say that the US strike is enormously, unrealistically effective; of the 175 or so Chinese nuclear weapons, 174 of them are vaporized on the ground along with their launch systems, and only one missile, with a single 100-kiloton warhead on the business end,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>arcs through the ionosphere and explodes in a low air burst over San Francisco. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The result? The United States has just suffered the greatest disaster in its history. The death toll from that one warhead would likely exceed the 600,000 military deaths in the Civil War, our nation’s bloodiest conflict to date.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Hundreds of billions of dollars of immediate damage would deliver a body blow to the nation’s economy, and a galaxy of long-term costs could well raise the final cost by an order of magnitude or more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The impact of Hurricane Sandy on the east coast, or Katrina on New Orleans?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A puny fraction of what we’re discussing here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now ask yourself this:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>what has the United States gained in exchange for those huge losses?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the narrative under discussion, a better military position vis-a-vis the Chinese and, if all goes well, a drop in the price of oil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That is to say, not much compared to the cost. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the rarely discussed logic behind nuclear deterrence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>None of the concrete gains a nation can achieve by launching a nuclear strike on another nation comes anywhere near the scale of the costs that would be inflicted by even the feeblest nuclear response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the US first strike just described does not quite turn out to be quite so improbably flawless, in turn, the costs go up accordingly; ten mushroom clouds over large American cities would leave the US economy as crippled as the economies of Europe were after the Second World War, with no Marshall Plan in sight; the impact of the full Chinese arsenal, small as it is by American or Russian standards, would likely mean the end of the United States as a functioning First World nation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sure, much of China would be pounded into radioactive rubble; what imaginable advantage would this give to whatever was left of the United States? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is why, in turn, the Peoples Republic of China contents itself with so small a nuclear arsenal. It doesn’t need anything bigger; all that’s necessary is that any other nuclear power that might think of launching a strike on China be faced with utterly unacceptable losses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s why Israel clings so tightly to its nuclear weapons, why India and Pakistan have been so much more polite to each other since both became nuclear powers, and why Iran will inevitably join the nuclear club in the next few years—and the harder the US backs Iran into a corner, by the way, the more overwhelming the pressure on Iran’s leadership will be to assemble and test a warhead, and so provide itself with the one truly effective way of telling hostile countries to back off. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The mistake made by both my commenters can be summed up very simply;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>they think that nuclear weapons exist to fight nuclear wars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That was true of the first two fission bombs ever made, Little Boy and Fat Man, but it hasn’t been true of any nuclear weapon since that time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They exist not to fight but to threaten. Those people who speculate about when and if nuclear weapons will be used are missing the point; they’re used all the time, with great effectiveness, by everyone who has them, to guarantee national survival and draw hard lines that other nations, and even other nuclear powers, will not cross.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A common objection probably needs to be dealt with at this point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is the insistence that such logic may be all very well for ordinary leaders and ordinary countries, but what if nuclear weapons get into the hands of a mad dictator?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One commenter several posts back, in fact, insisted that the ultimate argument against my logic was contained in the words “George W. Bush.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was probably impolite of me to point out to him that Bush had control of the world’s most advanced nuclear arsenal for eight years, and somehow we’re still here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve already discussed, in <a href=../../2009/01/pornography-of-political-fear.html>a post four years ago</a>, the destructive role that the pornography of political fear and hatred spread by both sides of the partisan spectrum plays in our current society, and it didn’t sink in then, either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, there’s an even more precise point that can be made here, and that’s the simple fact that nuclear weapons have already fallen into the hands of mad dictators. Josef Stalin and Mao Zedong can hardly be described in any other terms; both were homicidal megalomaniacs who were directly responsible for annihilating tens of millions of the people they ruled, and both of them had nuclear weapons. Once again, we’re still here. </div>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, let’s look at the mad dictator who comes first in almost everyone’s list, Adolf Hitler.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Hitler didn’t have nuclear weapons, but he did have the next best thing, massive stockpiles of three different, highly lethal nerve gases, and delivery systems that could readily have landed decent quantities of them on London and a variety of other military and civilian targets. He never used them, even when the Wehrmacht’s last battalions were fighting Russian troops in the suburbs of Berlin and his own death was staring him in the face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Why?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because the Allies also had them, and could be counted on to retaliate in kind; the military benefits of gassing London, or even the D-Day beaches, paled in contrast to the military impact of Allied nerve gas attacks, say,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>against German armies on the Eastern Front.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That is to say, like most mad dictators, Hitler may have been crazy but he wasn’t stupid. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same logic, by the way, applies to all weapons of mass destruction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unless you’re the only nation in a given conflict that has the power to annihilate huge numbers of people with a single weapon, it’s never worth your while to use your weapons of mass destruction, because the retaliation will cost you at least as much as, and usually more than, the use of the weapon will gain you. That’s why the plans to equip infantry divisions with truck-launched nuke-tipped rockets that filled the dreams of US military planners in the 1950s went the way of the Ford Nucleon, a 1957 concept car that was expected to be powered by a pint-sized nuclear reactor, and why the huge multimegaton bombs of the same era were quietly disassembled and replaced by much smaller warheads in the following decades.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s very likely, in fact, that in the decade or two before us, an American president will earn a Nobel peace prize—as opposed to being handed one more or less at random, like the current incumbent—by completing the process, and signing a treaty with Russia scrapping most of both sides’ arsenals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>250 warheads each, say, would be more than enough to provide a deterrent against all comers, and the savings in money and resources will be considerable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That latter may turn into a major issue in the decades to come, as the age of cheap abundant energy comes to an end. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One thing about nuclear weapons that’s too rarely remembered is that they are surprisingly delicate devices, and don’t store well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Certain components of hydrogen warheads, for example, have to be replaced every six months or so because the radioactive material in them undergoes normal decay, and enough of it changes into another element that it stops working. Other components have to be remachined at regular intervals, because plutonium is a relatively soft metal and won’t stay within the necessary ultrafine tolerances indefinitely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The missiles and other delivery systems have maintenance issues of their own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The science fiction cliché of abandoned nuclear missiles in forgotten silos, ready to launch far into the future, thus deserves decent burial. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As the industrial age stumbles to its end, in turn, the costs in energy, raw materials, and labor to keep existing nuclear arsenals functioning will be an increasingly large burden. To return yet again to the central theme of this blog, the Long Descent ahead of us will be driven primarily by the inability of political, social, and economic systems created during an age of cheap abundant energy to remain viable during an age of energy and resource scarcity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As resource depletion proceeds, systems dependent on scarce supplies will be forced to compete with one another for what’s left, some will inevitably lose, and each loss marks the disintegration of some part of business as usual in the industrial world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The elaborate arrangement that keeps nuclear weapons and their delivery systems ready for use at any moment is simply one energy- and resource-dependent system among many.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s one of the reasons why I confidently expect the treaty mentioned above to be signed at some point in the next couple of decades.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Applied more generally, though, the same logic makes nuclear war one of the least likely ways the industrial age could end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As costs mount and industrial infrastructure comes apart, the challenge of maintaining a nuclear arsenal in usable condition will be balanced by the need to maintain the appearance of a credible nuclear threat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The most likely outcome?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A strengthening of the logic of deterrence. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Think of it this way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s a safe bet that as technological capabilities and access to resources decline, nations that have nuclear weapons will continue to claim that they are ready, willing, and able to blow their adversaries to kingdom come.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s an equally safe bet in an age of continuing decline that, given the increasingly harsh limits on resources and technology, the ability of any given nation to make good on those threats will fail to keep up with the appearances it projects to the rest of the world. The problem is that, barring a really spectacular intelligence failure, nobody will know just how wide the gap has become in any given case.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Sixty years from now, as a result, the United States (or whatever successor nations inherit a share of its nuclear weapons) will doubtless still appear to have a substantial nuclear arsenal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just how many of its missiles and bombs can still be counted on to follow gravity’s rainbow and ignite a second sun over an overseas target, though, will be one of the most closely guarded of the nation’s secrets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The same will be true of every other nuclear power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the industrial age winds down, it’s very likely that we will reach a point when no nation on Earth still has the effective means to wage nuclear war, but every significant power still claims that capacity, and nobody can be quite sure that everyone else is bluffing—after all, what if the other side has managed to maintain a small arsenal in working order? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course it’s entirely possible that a few nuclear weapons will end up being used over the decades ahead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There’s always the risk that terrorists will seize or manufacture one and blow it up somewhere—though it’s only fair to note that most terrorist organizations depend on covert support from nation-states, who are generally not interested in supporting any operation for which the blowback arrives on the business end of an ICBM. (If the people responsible for the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US had used a stolen nuclear weapon rather than hijacked aircraft, for example, there’s a significant chance that the blowback might have included the instant thermonuclear annihilation of the city of Kabul; this was presumably not a risk the Taliban would have wanted to run.)</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s also possible that some conventional war or political crisis might trigger a series of miscalculations that could go nuclear, as (for example) a hypothetical Sino-Japanese war did in one of my earlier bits of <a href=../../2007/06/adams-story-nanmin-voyages.html>post-peak oil fiction</a>. Accidents happen and mistakes are made. Still, that doesn’t justify the repeated insistence in various corners of the internet that a nuclear war has to happen sometime soon—an insistence driven, once you get past the surface layer of rationalization, by the same logic that leads so many true believers to insist that history must shortly end via the catastrophe of their choice. </div>

<span style="font-size: large">End of the World of the Week #48</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What could be more convincing than a book giving 88 different reasons why the world is going to come to an end on your preferred date?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s apparently what Edgar Whisenant thought when he published <i>88 Reasons Why The Rapture Will Be In 1988</i>, which was briefly one of the hottest sellers in the evangelical Christian book field. Whisenant was a retired NASA engineer and a longtime bible student, and insisted that only if the Bible was wrong would the world continue to exist after September 13, 1988. It’s ironic, to use no stronger word, that he failed to take his own logic seriously; when 1988 came and went without benefit of Rapture, Whisenant went on to issue further books, making Rapture predictions for 1989 and 1993, and then predicting global catastrophe via nuclear war in 1994. </div>

I generally haven't much feared nuclear war as it just always seemed quite unlikely to me. I think part of that was an understanding of what you describe here, the role of nuclear arms used as deterrence rather than, uh, used. But I suppose it was also just a belief that humanity wouldn't quite be that stupid, despite how much evidence there seems to be to the contrary. However, I never thought out the issue as in depth as you described here, so it's nice to see a more straightforward and logical recitation of my gut instincts. I'll be curious to see how others react.<br><br>On another note, I want to thank the commenters here for a rather stimulating and fascinating conversation in last week's post. I didn't chime in myself, but I read it all and enjoyed it greatly--it left me with much to think about. Much of that thought was rooted in my own obsession with politics from roughly 2000-2009, at which point I started farming, started getting a better engagement with the real world, and began to realize how much of a joke federal politics have become in this country.<br><br>I <a href=http://ofthehands.com/2012/11/12/our-national-blood-sport/ rel=nofollow>wrote a post</a> about that history and my reaction to this year's election, which admittedly involved me getting a bit sucked back into the game and daring to cheer on Election Day despite knowing better. I'd just like to note that some of the reflection in that post I wrote--which I found immensely helpful on a personal level--was inspired both by your writing on politics, JMG, and on the thoughts of your readers. Hence my thanks for last week's comments in particular.<br><br>Continuing on that note, it was fascinating to go back and read "The Pornography of Political Fear" post of yours you linked to. How apropos it still is for our current times. Political pornography is raging right now amongst conservative circles, in nearly the exact way it was raging amongst liberal circles back in 2004 after Bush's reelection. I remember that time well--I was a bit heartbroken, immersed in political blogs, and pretty distraught about Bush's pending second term. (Little did I know just how badly he was about to destroy his second term with a long string of high-visibility incompetencies.) I managed to avoid becoming too crazy in my own concerns, thankfully. I never bought into the idea of Bush ending all future elections, declaring martial law, imprisoning his political opponents and so on. But I was worried, and I remember the paranoia of that time. It's very fascinating to see it reflected so well today by conservatives.<br><br>Meanwhile, the thing that should most be feared--the complete inability to confront, talk about, and attempt to deal with our many truly pressing problems as a nation--goes mostly unremarked upon. But I suppose that's not nearly so hot as the fear porn of concentration camps and martial law and stolen guns and UN control over America.<br><br>Oh well. I can't get too high on my horse. I've been in the thick of it in reverse. I'm just glad I know better now--and that I worked my way into a connected enough life as to see how pointless and deleterious such frantic paranoias are.<br><br><a href=#c5044255625867877932 title="comment permalink">11/14/12, 9:37 PM</a><br><br>

He was actually a Brit, but given that he knew what a dismantled nuclear warhead was supposed to look like, he got asked to "tag along" with a bunch of political and military folks to look in on Russian silos... and then to tag along on the Russians' visits to American launch sites. <br><br>I can still hear his voice, sometime around 1990 or 1993, during a Thanksgiving dinner when I was home from college, regaling my parents and the other guests with an absolutely gruesome story: of Russian silos filled with water, missiles in utterly unlaunchable states of disrepair, core components battered out of shape, and launch crews completely untrained in how to launch their missiles — even assuming that the launch systems were capable of functioning. The breakdown of the nuclear arsenal that they were there to assure had been dismantled, had been largely completed in the ten years prior to their official visits by lack of parts and neglect. <br><br>Meanwhile, the shock and horror of the Russian visitors to American silos was complete. Given how much trouble the Russians went to, to keep even a few atomics functioning, the Slavic inspectors to these shores expected to find most American silos in a similar state of disrepair, and equally-disreputable troops standing guard over missiles that could never launch with warheads that would never explode.<br><br>Instead, said my parents' friend, the Russians were aghast to discover that the Americans were genuinely dismantling <i>fully functional warheads and missiles</i> as part of our peace treaty arrangements. Had the call gone out for an American launch, the deterrence you describe — one or two missiles, rather than "the whole Russian nuclear arsenal!" — would have been the likely result. Star Wars and laser-based defense systems and anti-ICBM missile systems... bah. <br><br>The downgrade to smaller weapons was inevitable, and likewise the downgrade to a smaller number of smaller weapons is equally inevitable. Even a 'top-notch' industrial superpower cannot afford to maintain such weapons forever... and both Russians and Americans learned that in the course of their disarmament talks.

The only use of nuclear weapons that is political tenable for any leader (democratically elected or otherwise, as JMG has so clearly illustrated) is in response to another nation's nuclear attack. A nuclear first strike would transform the country that executed it into an international pariah, isolated to a degree similar to that of, say, North Korea.<br><br>JMG, this post does an excellent job of explaining how nuclear weapons are not a military weapon in any useful sense of the word, but a political tool.<br><br>A few years ago, there was an article in the Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute that explained the logic of deterrence in regards to chemical weapons, and which argued that it was foolish for the U.S. to destroy its chemical weapons stockpile because then there would nothing to deter enemies of the U.S. from using them against U.S. forces, thus dramatically increasing the risk for future U.S. military operations. If I recall correctly, one of the arguments also used was that nuclear weapons were not an effective deterrence against use of chemical weapons because the response would be seen as wildly disproportionate, and thus would be a non-starter politically.<br><br><a href=#c5121909298629850597 title="comment permalink">11/14/12, 10:03 PM</a><br><br>

It is excellent; well worth the wait. The logic you have put forward seems perfectly cogent to me. I would like to ask you about this issue in relation to Iran though. <br><br>As you would know there is opposition to Iran acquiring a nuclear capability by certain nations. The argument against Iran acquiring weapons is that their leaders may not be deterred because they have apocalyptic religious fantasies. I understand there is scepticism about this notion with the counterargument being that Iranian rulers are rational, value their self-preservation and can therefore be deterred (and that opposition is really about regional dominance). However, let’s think about this argument a little more.<br><br>Perhaps the current Iranian leaders are rational. Regardless, we know that there are people who are not rational and who would welcome nuclear apocalypse. There are people willing to die for their beliefs no matter how delusional. Are we to assume that such people could never gain power over a nation or its nuclear arsenal? Are we assuming a certain level of reason or a baseline level of sanity in people in positions of power? Are we assuming that the weight of the situation would be such that a ruler, no matter how unhinged and how desperate, would not use nuclear weapons if they could? <br><br>You cite Hitler, Mao and Stalin as examples of evil dictators who were not stupid. Is it not possible to have a ruler who is stupid; someone who would use nuclear weapons not caring about or really comprehending the consequences? Or as I said above, is it not possible to have a religious zealot in charge that really believes the hype and is in such a dire situation that they truly believe there is no other way? Or perhaps someone who is exceedingly spiteful and misanthropic? <br><br><br><a href=#c5145556801190367373 title="comment permalink">11/15/12, 1:52 AM</a><br><br>

(I also heard the interview you gave that he referred to; it was excellent). I do not really think Glenn Beck truly understands what you are saying. When interpreting your words he made a distinction between “conservation” and “life”. So although you were mainly talking about limited resources (fossil fuels, rare earth metals etc.) his point was that people as individuals do not have limitless energy (physical, emotional etc.) and resources (money etc.). He also made an odd remark about you probably believing in the “electronic winter tree” (still trying to figure out what that actually is). However, it is certainly interesting that what you said resonated with him. The problem is that I find him extremely unclear so I don’t really know what he got out of what you were saying. To me he seems hyperpartisan and very comfortable using fear and conspiracy theories to communicate with his audience.

If somebody were to launch a nuclear first strike, it's not necessarily just the target nation you have to worry about... I'm really not sure that Russia, India, and Pakistan would just stand idly by and watch as the missiles fell on China. In fact, I'm not entirely sure that they'd wait for the telemetry needed to determine the actual target before launching retaliation. I don't know anything about the details of such things, but I would assume that there must be a window of time between the point where it's known that a first strike has been launched, and the point where it's certain who the target is.

What possessing nuclear weapons actually creates is a climate of fear of the enemy that allows the leaders of these countries to control their own populations. <br><br>Our fear of the Soviets attacking and their fear of us attacking was a great boon to those powers in both countries who wished to maintain the status quo. It was a great boon to the defense industries in both countries and their respective military command hierarchies.

I think a lot of Americans view nuclear weapons as some sort of totem of power. Much of our apocalyptic mythology in pop culture is wrapped up in them, and I think a lot of people assume them to be much more of a supernatural force than simply a very large, very toxic explosive. What came to mind for me during the "nuke the gulf oil well" phase was the old adage: If the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. <br><br>It's all related to the religion of progress, though; any problem can be solved by throwing the right technology at it. In the case of the macondo well, people were far enough out of their technological element that they went all Godwin and invoked the nukes.

I hope it encourages more people to join the discussions here.<br><br>Like Brian, I am also not surprised that Beck expressed support and agreement with what you said. I don't really like him myself, but most of Beck's critics are people who don't realize that, unlike some other prominent pundits, he is not a paid shill for the Republican Party or the Koch Brothers. He might be wrong about things - or sometimes in the grips of a florid bout of mania - but he seems to tell it as he sees it. If Limbaugh, Olbermann, Hannity or Maddow goes on the air and agrees with your ideas - THAT will be shocking.<br><br>Secondly, how likely do you think it is that a nuclear power over the next century will prove their willingness to use nuclear weapons by striking a country they know is without them? I expect to see more nuclear 'tests' (aka: proving it) like those of the 50's and 60's on the downslope of industrial civilization. But I think it is also possible that a ruthless nation in the future might feel that striking a country such as Yemen or Sudan or Indonesia will make their larger enemies more fearful of them. With global trade on the decline, the power of the U.N. and other countries to deter actions like that through shame and blockades will be less effective.<br><br><a href=#c1381108276792068185 title="comment permalink">11/15/12, 8:37 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c622202285290741998></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/12451689362536912674 rel=nofollow>Nestorian</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I am one of the two previous posters who was singled out for mention at the start of this week's posts, and I would like to offer some brief observations in reply to this post:<br><br>1) I did not say that I morally approve of a potential nuclear first strike; I most certainly do not. But one must be aware that the viability of a nuclear first strike against both Russia and China has been seriously contemplated in recent years in US elite circles. See, for example, Keir Lieber and Daryl Press's article on US nuclear primacy in the March/April 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs, the leading elite outlet for public discussion of such matters. One must reckon that this type of thing is discussed a great deal also in private.<br><br>2) It is not merely a matter of having the weapons themselves, but of intercontinental delivery systems (usually spoken of as a "triad" involving nuclear submarines, strategic bombing aircraft, and InterContinental Ballistic Missiles). In the case of the US, these have greatly improved in recent decades in terms of accuracy and reliability, whereas in the case of especially Russia, these have greatly decayed in recent decades for the very kinds of maintenance-related reasons JMG mentioned. The Yeltsin era of the 1990s was devastating for Russia in this regard.<br>In China's case, they effectively did not have a credible intercontinental delivery system 6 or 7 years ago at all, though this may have changed recently given China's announcement that it is launching its first nuclear submarine. We don't know whether or not the US has the capability of tracking all of this sub's international stealth movements (e.g. to just off the coast from San Francisco), but I would not be too quick to rule out the possibility that the US does have this constant tracking capability. If so, then this Chinese sub is also an easily neutralized threat.<br><br>3) In the case of the US, the Department of Energy, I believe, is the agency principally tasked with these nuclear arsenal-related maintenance tasks; in the grand scheme of things, this maintenance probably amounts to a few tens of billions of dollars a year. In relation to an overall US defense budget approaching a trillion per year, such sums will be pocket change for years and probably decades to come. Moreover, many further tens of billions likely get spent on an annual basis in not merely maintaining, but in improving both the accuracy and reliability of the US arsenal. Many other further tens of billions undoubtedly get spent on intelligence that carefully tracks progress that Russia and China may be making with their arsenals.<br><br>4) Even if the choice to launch a first strike is a foolish one from a risk/benefit standpoint, that doesn't mean that it won't get made in the future if the US position on the world stage is sufficiently desperate. There was ample reason to believe ahead of time that the Iraq invasion of 2003 was foolish also from a risk/benefit standpoint, yet it was made nevertheless.<br><br>Perhaps I will say more later, once I have fielded some replies to this post.<br><br><a href=#c622202285290741998 title="comment permalink">11/15/12, 9:04 AM</a><br><br>

The risk is nearly zero. <br><br>If two states in enmity both possess nuclear arms so that state A is capable of destroying state B and vice versa, neither of them will use their bomb, knowing that if they did, they would bring their own annihilation on themselves.<br><br>US and Israeli propaganda has claimed that Iran is a suicidal nation. The rulers of the Islamic Republic the argument goes, would gladly give up their lives along with that of their nation for the joy of genocide. This nonsense is based on a flagrant disregard for the most obvious fact of Iranian society since 1979 namely that the millionaire mullahs do everything possible to hang on to power and capital. Martyrdom is not for them. Heaven they might believe in but no empirically discernable policies exist that indicate a willingness to sacrifice power, capital or earthly existence for higher ideological or religious goals. In this regard they are as rational as any other ruling class on earth.<br><br>Even if the mullahs were driven by religious fervour and considered the extermination of the Jewish state as their theological duty the third holiest site of Islam, the Al-Aqsa mosque, would perish with Israel in any successful nuclear strike, as would a major segment of the Palestinian Muslim people. <br><br>Equally absurd is the idea that the centres of power in Iran, arranged around Al-Faqih, would allow nuclear warheads to fall into the hands of terrorist organisations outside the mullahs' control.<br> <br>The Iranian threat so worrying to Israel and to the US must be another. And that threat is the levelling of the imbalance of terror in the Middle East. Israel will not tolerate a situation of Mutual Assured Destruction. The strategic deadlock MAD tends to foster, the inhibitions against adventurous aggression it imposes on military planners, that is what the State of Israel fears.<br><br>There is a deep fear for the existence of Israel as a Zionist state founded on the continuous expulsion of the Palestinian people. Peres declared in July 1998 that Israel built "a nuclear option not in order to have a Hiroshima but an Oslo" In translation this means that Israel amassed the world's fourth or fifth largest arsenal of the deadliest weapons of mass destruction to ensure a balance of force in the region that enables Israel to put the occupation of Palestine on a permanent footing.<br><br>With another nuclear power in the Middle East Israel would not be able to act as ruthlessly as it has in the last half century. How could it denigrate states backing the Palestinians as unworthy of consideration when drawing up borders or dictating "peace accords" if one of them has a nuclear option? How could it casually let off missiles in Syria's direction if its ally Iran had a nuclear bomb? To have such restraint foisted on Israel would seriously undermine its military dominance of the region.<br><br><a href=#c9171845526228908478 title="comment permalink">11/15/12, 10:10 AM</a><br><br>

I've wanted to comment here, because I've been really surprised, but I could only speak from my limited vantage point. Just in the couple weeks since Sandy, people I know who, just a few years ago would NEVER have thought of buying a generator, have told me that they're going to get generators. Now all of a sudden, I've heard a lot of people (who I know have never even heard of peak oil) are talking about buying them! I'm floored. It's actually become a quite common conversation topic here. But I guess you don't have to understand how to world works to make a practical response to it (not that I think generators are a great solution--they contributed to the gas shortages here, which were very real to those of us who have to make a living here).<br><br>Further, just in the last two weeks I've been able to talk openly to friends about peak oil. People who never would listen to me before! The same people who wouldn't listen to my "crazy" ideas before now. So that's a silver lining of this event. Everybody's heaping equal blame on climate change (my apologies to Bill Pulliam), but they're also open to peak oil.

That was true of the first two fission bombs ever made, Little Boy and Fat Man, but it hasn’t been true of any nuclear weapon since that time. They exist not to fight but to threaten."<br><br>I don't think those two bombs were used to 'fight' exactly, at least not in the way advertised. As Gar Alperovitz pointed out in great detail in his seminal work "The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb and the Architecture of an American Myth", the dropping of the bomb was all about intimidating and gaining leverage against the Soviet Union (given the talks concurrently underway about how to partition Germany), and ending the Pacific War as quickly as possible, in the hope that The Soviet Union would not acquire territorial concessions in the region. That plan failed of course, as the Soviets did in fact seize islands off of Hokkaido after the fact. <br><br>The US was well aware that Japan was thoroughly beaten by the spring of 1945, and had achieved complete air and Naval superiority over Japan in the months before the bombs were dropped. Japanese troops were thereby trapped in Manchuria and would not have been able to return to Japan to defend the homeland, most residents of which were enduring starvation. By June of 1945 the US Strategic command had largely run out of things to bomb in Japan. <br><br>The cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima were left alone by the conventional bombing campaigns, partly because there were no significant military targets in those cities, but much more for the reason that dropping the A-Bombs on already-bombed out wastelands, like Tokyo and Osaka, would not have been as dramatic a demonstration of the A-bomb's potency. <br><br>There is also the political factor of the $2 billion dollar investment in the development of the devices, and those certain pressures to make the program 'pay off'.<br><br>Also not sure about your connection between the attacks of 9-11 and the Taliban. Not even remotely convinced such a connection exists.<br><br>Excellent post otherwise, and the point about the 'Pornography of Fear' is a good one, as is the maintenance cost of the atomic weapon stockpile.

If we assume a slow winding down of this industrial age there will be time a plenty to develop such things. so I believe, unfortunately, some form of nukes will be around for centuries.<br><br>Secondly nuclear weapons are useful against industrialised societies (where the nations resources are concentrated in big cities) but against rural societies they are pretty useless.<br> <br>As de-industrialisation takes hold our societies will become more rural. (nukes may cease to be relevant in anything other than a doomsday use)<br><br>Regards your mad leaders Stalin wasn't neither was Mao (if they had been mad in the sense you mean they would never have occupied the positions they did). Hitler was but, and I can't believe no one has stated this, he was gassed in WW1 he knew exactly how those weapons worked and I suspect that was the reason they were never used. (the whole thing feels a bit strawman)<br><br>Finally for nestorian a nuclear first strike option is not an option. <br>A state does not need nuclear weapons to retaliate. A howitzer aimed at a spent fuel pool in many respects would be more damaging than a nuclear strike. and that's before we consider bioweapons etc., etc. <br>once you go down the MAD route there are many, many ways to get even.

Nuclear weapons are much like the aircraft in a failing airline operation. In a failing airline business, it is more than likely that maintenance is either postponed or avoided in order to save costs and avoid going into administration. <br><br>Just a comment for everyone in general - think about that, the next time you decide to take a cheap flight somewhere!<br><br>A good example of this is the collapse of the Ansett Australia business in 2001 (search the Wikipedia article under "maintenance irregularities"):<br><br><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansett_Australia rel=nofollow>Ansett Australia</a><br><br>Nuclear weapons are exactly the same dilemma for their operators (ie. the government). As military budgets are cut, maintenance is something that is either done as a bare minimum or skipped in the hope that in the future, the operators can catch up. Large militaries are a luxury item and often it is the visual deterrent rather than the physical capabilities that is deemed to be important. Keep up the pretence! Nuclear power stations anyone?<br><br>This is simply human nature and I see people make these same decisions with their own stuff: houses, cars - all sorts of stuff really. To invest in maintenance literally means making a decision to forego short term gains for longer term benefits. <br><br>As an interesting side note, is anyone out there aware of another Australian Airline which is struggling to make money and has been systematically cutting back on local maintenance and shipping it off to lower labour cost destinations?<br><br>People are generally reasonably poor at long term planning. Many years ago I had control of a business that was for all sorts of reasons not run on a sustainable basis. So I spent lots of personal energy sorting out its problems and even negotiating with the customers to get the business on a sustainable footing. It even produced a small surplus, then one day, much later, the owner of the business took actions to extract even more funds from the business, thus putting it back into the situation where it all began.<br><br>I learned some good lessons from this experience, but the one that I'll share here is that the economists are 100% correct in that human demands will always exceed supply (resources). This describes the basic economic problem and it is true.<br><br>Thanks for taking the time to myth-bust nuclear weapons.<br><br>I see comments concerned about issues such as nuclear war, slavery and robots (what is the singularity? Is this a space lizard people thing?). Those comments are deflection tactics for the real game in town which is: resource depletion and pollution. But this is hard for people to generally consider because it asks them to question their own resource usage, decisions and relationship with nature and they don't end up looking too good. It is much easier to worry about space lizards or slavery or some such matter.<br><br>I spent all of yesterday distributing rock quarry dust (great minerals) and compost about the orchard by hand and wheelbarrow and I'm feeling it today. It is amazing to me that some things which society considers a waste product are actually some of the most valuable! Who'd have thought it?<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c6513107262006120472 title="comment permalink">11/15/12, 2:46 PM</a><br><br>

To understand why, it is only necessary to look at the studies of Arab opinion conducted by U.S. polling agencies. Though barely reported, they are certainly known to planners. They reveal that by overwhelming majorities, Arabs regard the U.S. and Israel as the major threats they face: the U.S. is so regarded by 90% of Egyptians, in the region generally by over 75%. Some Arabs regard Iran as a threat: 10%. <b>Opposition to U.S. policy is so strong that a majority believes that security would be improved if Iran had nuclear weapons — in Egypt, 80%</b>. http://theoldspeakjournal.wordpress.com/tag/geo-politics<br><br> The Iranian Threat http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20100702.htm<br><br>Mister Roboto, China overtook Iran when the sanctions kicked in.

Normally I agree with your evaluations, but my educational background lends me some insight here. It would be relatively easy to use such a device and perhaps not even be detected. There's a good possibility we wouldn't learn the identity of our attacker for some time, if ever. Only about 2% of the shipping containers arriving in this country are searched. A little lead concealment and the west coast is living in a nightmare. Equally simplistic, a private sailboat arriving unannounced in Chesapeake bay and the nation's primary intelligence and operational centers would be little more than radioactive fly ash. Many 2nd rate powers have diesel submarines which could land a weapon ashore, which could then readily be trucked just about anywhere in the country. Perhaps worst of all would be a low altitude detonation resulting in an EMP outage across most of the country. It could even be launched from the back of a truck over the border in Mexico or Canada. We don't possess nearly enough spare transformers for the grid- No refrigeration, no trucking = no food for hungry people, most of whom have made about zero resiliency preparations. 3 days into it we'd be tearing our selves apart, with nary a foreign foot set ashore. Such a weapon only needs to reach altitude, not be precisely targeted. Then there are small aircraft from private air strips. We have far softer an underbelly than most people realize, and I know you can appreciate that.<br><br><a href=#c4253082338968631651 title="comment permalink">11/15/12, 6:28 PM</a><br><br>

I agree that nuclear deterrence works. Human beings have a strong survival instinct, which is shared even by evil dictators like Stalin. Self preservation is a strong motivator. However deterrence is not infallible. There were a number of occasions during the cold war when deterrence nearly failed and we came close to a nuclear war. Cuba is the most obvious example. It is easy to forget that both Kennedy and Khrushchev were under a lot of pressure to take actions that could have resulted in all out war. The instinct for self preservation managed to get us through that crisis. However there was also an element of luck. There were quite a few things that could easily have gone wrong and led to a nuclear war.<br>The fact that we got through the cold war without a nuclear exchange could make us complacent about nuclear deterrence and lead us to think that it is somehow infallible. This could be a dangerous way of thinking. If there is confrontation between the major powers over resources during the next 20 to 30 years, then there could be a higher risk of a nuclear war, than there was during the cold war. The Cuban crisis took place in a world were resources were cheap and plentiful and yet we came close to a nuclear war. However in a post peak oil world when we are fighting over scarce resources, any confrontation is likely to be much more desperate. The risk of a nuclear war whether due to miscalculation or accident could be higher.<br>Obviously as you say, resource depletion will eventually make our nuclear arsenals unusable. However we could go through a dangerous period before that happens. I still think that the scenario that you have laid out this week is the most likely outcome. But it would be danger to become complacent and think that just because nuclear deterrence worked in the past, it will work in the future. <br>Look forward to your next blog<br><br><br><a href=#c6481795775665374628 title="comment permalink">11/16/12, 12:52 AM</a><br><br>

However, they have all been screened by the logic of the power system they serve. That system is comprised by people who have bought into its logic. The best example is not GW, but Nixon, who ended up stark raving mad and agitating for nuclear weopons. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Vietnam's_dikes" rel=nofollow>Cue the tape:</a><br><i>President: See, the attack in the North that we have in mind, power plants, whatever's left - POL [petroleum], the docks.

The economic logic is straightforward, use nuclear energy, export oil, use the proceeds of sale to develop the economy while their is still time in the industrial age.

The logic of deterrence is straightforward, but, as this post points out, there are costs, which cuts into the economic argument spelled out above. I'd guess they will once they get the domestic tech figured out, but to date, the findings of our intelligence and the IAE monitors have found no evidence of a covert weapons program. It may also be the case that whatever the benefits of nuclear weapons, the costs at present time do not justify going forward.

But when things like this happen, it pulls back the curtain on the raging chaos behind the carefully-scripted performance that we all paid our taxes to see.<br><br>It doesn't matter whether we're talking about 9/11, or JFK, or the assassination of Giuliano de' Medici, or the court intrigues among the Roman imperials. There's always the public show, and then there is what is REALLY going on when the curtains close between scenes. These are only tenuously related. It's why historians can still write about the Romans, or the French Revolution, or the Fourth Papal Inquisition -- they can expose some more of the mechanics of the Real Story underlying the Official Story.<br><br>This disconnect between the public story and the real story is part of why history is interesting (and unpredictable), and also an inherent danger in analyses like the one you've provided regarding nuclear war.<br><br>In the public story, nuclear war is impossible because America is strong and good and would never do such a thing, and all other nations are at moderately-to-very evil and might do such a thing, but they will be deterred by our superior American Military Might. A lot of people believe this story, and it's why those people keep calling for bottomless defense spending.<br><br>That's a very shallow story, of course. When you pull back that gauze curtain, you see the face of Realpolitik, which you're describing. Balance of powers. The Game of Thrones. Tactics and strategy. But that also isn't the Truth.<br><br>Underneath the rational game are irrational humans, driven by fears and appetites, tempered to some extent by a collective and unifying in-group mythology.<br><br>What happened on 9/11 was a collective decision by some in-group -- whether in Washington, Jerusalem, Kabul, or some combination -- that convinced itself that the attack was a good idea. It surprised the heck out of some other groups, and it ripped back the curtain on the Official Story, as well as the Realpolitik curtain, and probably several other curtains. For a very brief moment, all of us saw the world as it really is: chaotic, with NO ONE in control. That was the true terror of 9/11.<br><br>The Official Story of 9/11 is artless: a tale told by an idiot. That's why the truthers are still out there.

Most of the alleged hijackers held Saudi passports and the planning took place mostly in Germany. <br><br>The Taliban did offer to hand bin Laden over, provided the US was forthcoming with evidence that bin Laden was implicated. Colin Powell's promise to reveal this evidence is still, to this day, unfulfilled and the FBI's several year investigation turned up "No hard evidence" that bin Laden planned the attacks, which hasn't stopped Obama recently repeating this unproven claim during his election campaign. <br><br>Contrary to your 'view from the grassy knoll' article, I'm not someone who asserts that George W planned the 9/11 attacks. Such a thing didn't take place because it didn't have to. The ambiguous relationships between the CIA, US client states such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia (where most of the funding came from) and the existence of heavily penetrated, disparate groups of 'al Qaeda' fanatics, born out of the CIA backed Islamic Brigades/Mujahedeen from the Soviet/Afghan conflict of the 1980's were more than enough to get the job done.<br><br>The presence of two of Osama bin Laden's brothers in Falls Church, Virginia (just around the corner from CIA hq) where they were raising money for terrorist groups using legitimate fronts, subsequently protected from investigation by the Bush Administration, is one of many little clues that reveal how these things actually get done. <br><br>Off topic, I know.<br><br>On topic, it is in theory possible to have a limited Nuclear Exchange and such an scenario is to my mind the most likely one. A US drama "Last Resort" which has aired here in the UK recently has a scenario where the US attacks Pakistan. This as you've indicated would be unlikely since Pakistan, itself Nuclear armed, could at least do some major damage to say - Diego Garcia or other US military targets in the region. Far more likely that a Nuclear power would attack a non-nuclear power (as was the case with Japan) which is why I find the constant sabre-rattling against Iran so worrying, since Israel has them and Iran doesn't. <br><br>Hopefully, even Israel isn't 'crazy' enough to use it's Nukes. Still, I once had an email exchange with Noam Chomsky in which he pointed out that "Israel does conceive of itself as a "crazy state," tribal in character, which might decide to bring down the temple walls if crossed."<br><br><a href=#c3203633163919130036 title="comment permalink">11/16/12, 10:48 AM</a><br><br>

I would be very interested in seeing an updated version of this argument attempted that takes into account the developments since 2006 that I am simply not in a position to evaluate factually. <br><br>As it happens, I had lunch with one of the authors of the 2006 Foreign Affairs article a year ago (October 2011), and he still maintained then that his thesis from 2006 about US nuclear primacy was fundamentally true. He also noted that people he knew within the US military and intelligence apparatus who had access to relevant classified information to which he himself was not privy, largely agreed with him. At the same time, I had the sense that he hadn’t been keeping up with the latest relevant developments (such as the new generation Chinese ICBMs JMG mentioned) as assiduously as he had in the period leading up to the publication of the original article. <br><br>Actually, some of what I just related is also relevant to Proposition 2). It implies that Proposition 1) remains widely believed in US military and foreign policy circles, particularly among those with access to pertinent classified information. The more this remains the case going forward, the more it is likely that Proposition 2) will possibly remain true, even if Proposition 1) is false. Other things that suggest the possible truth of Proposition 2) include the subsidiary argument, also advanced in the 2006 article, that placing the US in the position of unchallenged nuclear primacy had been a long-term objective of US military strategy all along. <br><br>In addition, Proposition 2) is supported by the fact that this article was part of a larger literature appearing in recent years that argues for the viability of limited nuclear war using what are referred to as tactical, rather than strategic, nuclear weapons. In essence, tactical nukes are relatively limited in their destructive potential, but are developed and deployed to be just as reliable and accurate - if not more so - than strategic nuclear weapons whose sole purpose is to promote deterrence via the classic MAD doctrine.<br><br>Last but not least (with reference to Proposition 2, if not Proposition 1), how is one best to understand the ongoing encirclement of both China and Russia with close-in military bases in Eastern Europe and Central Asia? I submit that it is best understood as reflective of the ongoing commitment by US elites to maintaining the posture of primacy that they believe they have. Decisions concerning the future exercise of this primacy will be based much less on whether this primacy is real or illusory than on whether this primacy is BELIEVED to be real by key decision makers and their underlings.<br><br><a href=#c4752964108734311921 title="comment permalink">11/16/12, 11:36 AM</a><br><br>

Did it not occur to you that perhaps some people genuinely abhor the idea of nuclear war but are simply more pessimistic about humanity's chances of avoiding it? I cannot speak for everyone but personally I accept peak oil, I accept that there will be continued economic contraction, that the internet may very well be transient and that global population will eventually decrease quite significantly as per capita energy decreases. However, I am less optimistic about humanity's chances of avoiding nuclear war. Taken together, that is inconsistent with your hypothesis. I appreciate John's arguments and feel they are very logical. With that said, though, John's conclusions are more optimistic than mine happen to be. This is because I am taking into account different factors and/or weighting various factors differently. I am not saying I am right but I am not going to just wholly accept a set of arguments simply for the sake of comforting myself. At the end of the day these are extremely complex issues and who really knows how it is all going to turn out. <br><br>If I might speculate as to some of the resistance that is taking place here the emotional charge that you are sensing could be a frustration that so much has to go right, so many assumptions need to be met and that so many people (often objectionable) have to be relied upon to ensure that nuclear war is avoided. This gives rise to a sense of helplessness and a lack of control in turn causing anger. Perhaps this anger clouds people's judgment, perhaps it skews their arguments. My point is that this is one mechanism which could give rise to opposition to the notion that nuclear deterrence is as guaranteed as some might think instead of postulating that deep down these people long for a nuclear apocalypse (which I think was your insinuation). Please don't profess to understand other people's motives better than they do with such certainty.<br><br><a href=#c403805307422609394 title="comment permalink">11/16/12, 8:50 PM</a><br><br>

My take is that what drives the "truthers" is an attempt to deny the fact that the most technically advanced nation on Earth can be given a major black eye by a handful of imaginative men who are not afraid of death. Our national psyche is obsessed with the fiction of our own omnipotence, and the 9/11 attacks pointed up that fiction with great clarity. <br><br>Orwellian, I referenced the Taliban because (a) they provided bin Laden's people with a modest amount of support, as old allies in the Jihadi business, and (b) they were a much more politically viable target than, say, the Wahabi groups in Saudi Arabia that likely provided a lot more of the support. As for a limited nuclear war, given adequate political justification -- not necessarily an easy thing to get, since the fallout clouds would reach India -- the US could probably nuke Pakistan without any nuclear response, since Pakistani launch vehicles can't reach Diego Garcia -- it's more than 3500 km from southern Pakistan, and their longest range IRBMs only reach around 2500 km. That probably does a lot to shape current Pakistani policy toward the US. <br><br>Nestorian, I read the continuing US involvement in the Great Game in central Asia as part of an increasingly desperate struggle by the US to avoid the strategic nightmare that Halford Mackinder sketched out all those years ago -- one nation or alliance of nations having control of the Eurasian core and ready access to the world's oceans. There's a rich irony in that, since it was US stupidity in dealing with post-Soviet Russia that set that process in motion. More on this in an upcoming post. <br><br>Bill, what can I say? People love their apocalyptic fantasies!<br><br>Amy, fascinating. I may make <i>An Inconvenient Book</i> the book of his that I pick up one of these days. As for nuclear weapons as potential reactor fuel, that's a very likely option as things run short -- and it's entirely possible that nobody will admit that that's what's going on, even as most of the world's warheads get used up to keep the lights on a little longer.<br><br><a href=#c2785180133863571564 title="comment permalink">11/16/12, 8:56 PM</a><br><br>

I simply note that people appear to be reluctant to release their fear of nuclear war; it is a LONG way from there to saying that people actually like the idea of it! You may protest too much, methinks. The psychology and sociology of apocalyptic beliefs has been the subject of many, many, many posts on this blog (and untold thousands of comments). The schism between utopian versus apocalyptic beliefs (with very few people in the middle) has been one of the major themes here for years. Not even gonna begin to try to summarize all of that discussion. <br><br>Personally I absolutely hated spending my entire childhood and a big chunk of my early adulthood under that fear, and was extremely relieved to cast that yoke off in the late 1980s, a time when many people for some reason seemed to feel the shadow lift (for no readily apparent reason). It's been nearly 70 years now, whole lifetimes have passed since the last use of a nuclear weapon as an act of war (and a fusion bomb has *never* been used). Sure nothing is impossible and no one knows the future. That applies to EVERYTHING.<br><br>Unrelated aside, but who is this "John" character to whom many of these comments are addressed?

Seems like the mead is a bit of a success and it is almost idiot proof to make, I recommend it to all. Vodka is a future activity, but next week I'm off to the home brew shop to pick up more supplies for more mead.<br><br>The only thing I'm wondering about is the yeast as my kitchen is probably infested with bakers yeast and I've never heard of anyone using the local wild yeasts. I used champagne yeast so the mead probably had an alcohol % of &gt; 10%, but this is only a guess. I'm aware that many vegetables and fruits have their own yeasts on them, but I am still to learn about such things. So much to do and I've only just sorted the income front out after the unfortunate events of about a year ago (just before the Borders bookshops went under too for you).

Ironically it is you that has not addressed my comments adequately. For example, I suggested a possible psychological mechanism accounting for some people's concerns that nuclear deterrence between nations might not be as solid as others might think which you completely ignored. Therefore, I conclude that it is you who is not addressing the relevant arguments which looks a lot like projection to me. I haven't the slightest desire to continue this discussion with you either.<br><br>Cherokee, "self-interest, greed and laziness" can just as easily be used as an argument against the effectiveness of nuclear deterrence. Since your argument is vague I can only infer what you are trying to argue. "Self-interest, greed and laziness" were not enough to stop World War 1 and 2, Hiroshima or Nagasaki so citing these alleged universal foibles is simply not enough. More broadly, I totally reject the notion that "self-interest, greed and laziness" are the "primary drivers" of all people. This applies to some people, in different combinations and to different degrees, but there are plenty of people out there who are good, diligent and act selflessly for the greater good or for the benefit of others often and reliably. Of course these people have their flaws but their "primary drivers" are much more positive and constructive than your argument suggests. Individual differences and societal influences cannot be dismissed. Misanthropic notions of humanity are like a self-fulfilling prophecy spurring humanity towards its darker potentialities. It is more accurate to say that humanity is malleable and is in large part as good or bad, selfish or unselfish, productive or destructive, as the society and culture in which it exists at a given point in time.<br><br><a href=#c8432960119302390142 title="comment permalink">11/18/12, 3:52 PM</a><br><br>

I may have mentioned it a few times before, but I've been contemplating the relationships between limits (particularly ecological ones) and freedom, and slowly working on some essays related to this, since I think there needs to be more literature on this subject. <br><br>The prevalent concept of freedom in our society denies limits of all kinds (or as Chris aptly says, it is "freedom from the consequences of our actions"). However, I find the process of recognizing a limit in the natural world, and internalizing such knowledge with limits in my own life, is actually a major source of freedom in my life.<br><br>For example, two years ago, I decided not to fly again, at least not for any travel on this continent, where alternative (although slower) transportation is an easy-enough option. I understand that people's circumstances and life contexts are different, and this is an easier decision for some to make than others. But, at least in my life context, I felt I could make that decision easily enough, so I felt I should. What pushed me to make that decision was a recognition of limits (limited amount of oil and other resources, limits to amounts of greenhouse gases that can be emitted to atmosphere without harmful effects, &amp; other ecological limits). I then voluntarily imposed a limit on my own life. To many others, they may see my decision not to fly as absurd--I'm greatly restricting the "freedom" in my life. However, I feel my decision not to fly has actually made me feel freer! I'm trying to explore this new and exciting feeling of freedom, and find words to describe it, because it's such a different notion of what freedom means in our society.<br><br>This is just a personal example, but I think it can expanded to the societal level too.<br><br>I find that when I sometimes question the popular notion of "freedom" in our society, some people, without attempting to explore more deeply into what I'm thinking, jump on me and falsely think I'm advocating some totalitarian society, as if there are only two binary options to choose from.<br><br>What's ironic is that our society's concept of freedom that denies limits will ultimately take away even that kind of freedom. Our denial of the limited supply of oil and other resources, and the prevalent cultural belief that we should be "free" to consume anything and as much as we want, will destroy the freedom to consume what we want in the long run.<br><br>I sometimes wonder what cultural historians and others several centuries in the future will say about the concept of "freedom" prevalent during the fossil fuel age of human history.<br><br><a href=#c689810061254377595 title="comment permalink">11/18/12, 8:59 PM</a><br><br>

In my field, high-performance computing, one of the major drivers of development over the last decade or so has been the need to test nuclear bombs without actually setting them off.

I was fascinated how the practical needs such as sanitation and ventilation would be met in these shelters, and I remember that our family's preparations would have been woefully inadequate in those respects. I do remember seeing some plans with fairly elaborate ventilation systems to filter out tthe radioactive dust. I also remember thinking about how boring it would be just sitting in this shelter waiting until we could come out, and what kind of world we would <br>come out to. Upon reflection now, it seems that perhaps the governments message was more that we could survive a nuclear attack and that we should trust that the USA would prevail. Even so, there was a deep fear that no one would talk about much. I know that my own father, a proud WW2 vet never talked about it. Perhaps he still had a deep faith in the governments proclamations.

Standardized cultures are an industrial product. If you do fermentation or breadmaking in the same facility, selecting for the batches that show the desired results, you populate the area with the spores of the microbes you want and they will colonize any suitable culture medium (e.g. bread dough, fruit juice, warm milk, etc.) you expose to it. There are also wild yeasts that naturally live on the surfaces of fruit which are adapted to metabolize the sugars and starches of that particular type of fruit; if you don't pasteurize your culture it will be inoculated by them. I've heard folks talking about how in order to make your own (intentional) vinegar from wine at home you have to spend money to get a "mother," the scum of acetobacter that grows on top of the wine and does the ethanol - acetate conversion. Well, actually, if you leave your wine uncovered for even a short while, the vinegar flies will find it and inoculate it with the abundance of acetobacter that live on their feet (the bacteria's natural dispersal mechanism). Only if you live in someplace like Antarctica where there are no vinegar flies will this method not work. Give it a little time, and you will find your own homegrown mother spreading over your wine. Select a mother that gives results you especially like, and use that one to inoculate future batches without having to enlist the help of the flies any more. <br><br>Like so many things, these technologies are ancient, prehistoric even. Industrialization has attempted to hijack them and make them specialized techniques for which money must be paid, but this is an aberration, not the norm. The reason that cheeses, wines, etc. are named after places is that they are the products of microbes that were originally domesticated in these places in the preindustrial era, working on the plant and animal crops produced in those region, adapted to that particular combination of environment and agricultural practices. <br><br>There are literally hundreds of thousands of species of microbes (perhaps millions) within a few meters of where you sit, waiting for you to give them the right food and environment to produce just the biochemical transformations you desire. <br><br>I am not speaking just from theory here; I have fermented juice with wild yeast, and made vinegar with wild mother generously provided by wild vinegar flies. It works! You have to keep a sharp and ruthless nose for something "off" (meaning the microbes might not be catalyzing the reactions you want), but this is going to be true of just about everything in coming centuries, as it was for eons before now.<br><br><a href=#c1694437443689646247 title="comment permalink">11/19/12, 8:24 PM</a><br><br>

The fact that we are not and that I think we'll keep insisting right up until the end that things will shortly return to 'normal' means a high likelihood of ignoring that particular problem until it becomes impossible to ignore.<br><br><a href=#c5217607942756791686 title="comment permalink">11/20/12, 8:07 PM</a><br><br>

According to the February 2012 issue of IEEE Spectrum (a professional journal for Electrical and Electronics Engineers), there's a 1/100 chance each year of a solar flare which would burn out many of the high-voltage transmission line transformers of the world. (The simple way to prevent damage is to open the circuit breakers first, but that takes an alert system operator with the fortitude to initiate a regional blackout "just in case".) After a week without grid power, the backup generators run out of fuel, the water circulating pumps shut down, and both reactor cores and spent-fuel pools overheat. Worst case: Fukushima x 400.<br><br><a href=#c119473684118505954 title="comment permalink">11/21/12, 5:27 PM</a><br><br>

Based on intelligence available *early* in 1945, the operational assumptions included the following (from the Wiki article):<br><br> "That operations in this area will be opposed not only by the available organized military forces of the Empire, but also by a fanatically hostile population."<br> "That approximately three (3) hostile divisions will be disposed in Southern Kyushu and an additional three (3) in Northern Kyushu at initiation of the OLYMPIC operation."<br> "That total hostile forces committed against Kyushu operations will not exceed eight (8) to ten (10) divisions and that this level will be speedily attained."<br> "That approximately twenty-one (21) hostile divisions, including depot divisions, will be on Honshu at initiation of [Coronet] and that fourteen (14) of these divisions may be employed in the KANTO PLAIN area."<br> "That the enemy may withdraw his land-based air forces to the Asiatic Mainland for protection from our neutralizing attacks. That under such circumstances he can possibly amass from 2,000 to 2,500 planes in that area by exercise of rigid economy, and that this force can operate against Kyushu landings by staging through homeland fields."<br><br>The problem with all those above planning assumptions, and the casualties associated to them, was that the US gained Naval control of the waters around Japan by spring of that year, and thus all those estimates of Japanese homeland troop reinforcements from mainland China were inapplicable. The US's own Strategic Assessment of land invasion casualties, taken in early summer of 1945, according to Alperovitz's research, was on the order of 35,000~45,000 casualties. Hardly the "millions" that gets quoted with frequency as a justification for dropping those weapons. <br><br>Truman's own speaking tour after the war had ended, as Alperovitz notes, stated initially with mentions of a casualty estimate of "50,000" and he gradually increased the number over the ensuing months to 100,000, then 250,000, then "half a million lives". Nothing theoretical - the record speaks for itself. <br><br>I would encourage you to read Alperovitz's work to see how theoretical it is - it's grounded in hard research over a 40 year period.<br><br><a href=#c5678148171240657773 title="comment permalink">11/23/12, 4:33 PM</a><br><br>
