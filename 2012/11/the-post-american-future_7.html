One of the things I’ve learned repeatedly over six and a half years of writing <i>Archdruid Report</i> posts is that it’s a waste of time to try to predict which posts will appeal to my readers and which ones won’t. Last month’s narrative is a case in point. My original plan was to devote one post to a very brief scenario of American imperial collapse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the time I got the thing written, even after a great deal of trimming, it was the size of five regular posts; I decided to run it anyway over five weeks, since it did a good job of illustrating the themes I’ve been developing since February of this year, but I figured that it would be just another ordinary month for the blog.<br>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Somehow that didn’t happen. Last month, <i>The Archdruid Report</i> had the second highest page view count of any month in its history; the first episode in the narrative is this blog’s most-viewed page ever, and the others are climbing rapidly to comparable positions. It’s interesting to reflect on the reasons why that happened, but I suspect that the most significant of those reasons is also the simplest: the narrative that I sketched out presented the decline and fall of the United States not as the end of the world, nor as an excuse for yet another wearily unthrilling Tom Clancyesque thriller, but as an ordinary historical event. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d like to expand on that a little, because—as regular readers of this blog already know—history is the primary resource I use to guide what’s posted on this blog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The core hypothesis shaping my view of the future is the proposal that our time differs from the past only in the way that one past era differs from another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The notion that the present epoch is utterly unique in history, popular as that is, fails to convince me, and the habit of using that notion as an excuse to project an assortment of utopian and apocalyptic fantasies on the inkblot patterns of the future strikes me as frankly delusional. It makes more sense, I think, to recognize that imperial overstretch is imperial overstretch no matter what technologies the empire in question happens to use, and that trying to make sense of the future on the basis of historical parallels is a more useful strategy than insisting that the future must conform to our desires, our fears, or both at once. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus I’d like to walk through some of the historical events I used as models for the trajectory of decline and fall in “How It Could Happen,” and talk a little about why those models are relevant. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The overall scenario of failed military adventurism leading to a crisis of legitimacy and the collapse of a government?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That was modeled on the Falklands War of 1982, though I could have used any number of other examples.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the case of the Falklands crisis, the government of Argentina, facing a rising spiral of economic and political problems, gambled that it could improve its situation by seizing a set of bleak little islands in the south Atlantic, then as now owned by Britain and claimed by Argentina, on the assumption that Britain would be neither willing nor able to mount an effective military response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It was a disastrous miscalculation; by the time the smoke cleared, Britain had retaken the islands by main force, the Argentine military had suffered a humiliating defeat, and the crisis of legitimacy that followed promptly toppled the Argentine government. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s worth noting that if the war had gone the other way—say, if Argentina had been armed with a hundred Exocet antiship missiles, rather than the five they had, and sent most of the British fleet to the bottom—Margaret Thatcher’s government would likely have fallen in short order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The difference, of course, is that the transfer of power in Britain would have followed the normal rules of British politics; there would have been a vote of no confidence in the House of Commons, somebody else would have moved into No. 10 Downing Street, and that would have been that. In Argentina, things were not so simple, because there was no straightforward way to get rid of an incompetent leadership and its policies without taking down an entire system of government and replacing it with something else. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the points of the narrative, in turn, is that the United States just now is a great deal closer to the Argentine situation than to the British one. Here in America, we’ve just spent a year seeing which of two interrchangeable candidates will take the presidential oath of office this coming January. Those of my readers who are Republicans, and downcast by Obama’s victory last night, should take heart; the policies we’ll see for the next four years will be exactly the same as the ones that we would have had if your candidate had won, and now you have the freedom to criticize them, while the Democrats have to put up with another four years of pretending that the man they helped put into office isn’t betraying every principle they claim their party stands for. The blustering and violent pursuit of the same failed foreign policy, the eager pursuit of national bankruptcy in the name of global security, the tacit refusal to prosecute even the most egregious financial crimes, the whittling away of civil liberties, the gargantuan giveaways to corrupt but influential industries, and the rest of it:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>the whole package that’s been welded in place since the days of George W. Bush was guaranteed to continue whoever won. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Previous posts here have discussed the reasons why the policymaking machinery of the US government has jammed up, leaving this particular set of failed policies to play over and over again like a broken record. Sooner or later that process will end, if only because a government that fails often enough goes out of existence sooner or later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The scenario I traced out in the narrative suggests one way in which the jam could be broken; there are plenty of others, but most of them involve the end, in one way or another, of the particular form of constitutional government we have in America today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s move on. The constitutional convention that spun out of control, and suddenly made the unthinkable a political fact?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That was based on the opening act of the French Revolution. The conflict between the states and the federal government in the narrative was a deliberate echo of the conflict between the French aristocracy and the king in the years before 1789. The aristocracy, struggling to reclaim its lost privileges, managed to pressure Louis XVI into calling the Estates-General, the rarely summoned national parliament of France, which had very nearly the same powers as an American constitutional convention. Once the delegates met, the crisis of legitimacy that had been been building in France for decades exploded; attempts to keep the meeting focused on its official purpose—solving the nation’s budget crisis—were overwhelmed by events, and over the weeks<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>that followed, a system of government that had endured for centuries came apart forever. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The rush toward extremism on the part of the American people in the months before the constitutional convention?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That was the United States of America before, during, and immediately after the 1860 presidential election.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It took not much more than a year for secession in most Southern states, and violent opposition to slavery and disunion in most Northern ones, to make their respective transitions from minority ideologies to popular causes for which hundreds of thousands of people would fight and die. “The story of 1860,” wrote historian Bruce Catton in
<i>The Coming Fury</i>, “is the story of a great nation, marching to the wild music of bands, with flaring torches and with banners and with enthusiastic shouts, moving down a steep place into the sea.” (Catton’s book, by the way, should be required reading for all those convinced that the American political process is incapable of drastic change; for that matter, it’s one heck of a good read, and the two subsequent volumes, <i>Terrible Swift Sword</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>and <i>Never Call Retreat</i>, are just as good.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The dissolution of the United States via a never-used provision of the Constitution? That was inspired by the fall of the Soviet Union.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On paper, each of the republics that made up the Soviet Union had the right to secede from the union at any time. In practice—well, would you have wanted to try doing that when Stalin was in office?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Under Gorbachev, though, Boris Yeltsin could and did invoke that clause of the Soviet constitution without risking sudden removal from office via a pistol shot and an unmarked grave, and a Soviet system that was already in crisis came apart in days. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The failure of the military and of intelligence agencies to stop the collapse of the government by force? That was based on events across most of the Eastern Bloc right after the Berlin Wall came down. The Warsaw Pact nations each had, in theory, more than enough soldiers and secret police to prop up a troubled government by rounding up protesters and shooting them, say, or doing the other things that embattled governments routinely do to their people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In practice, the final crisis of each regime saw military personnel standing aside or actively siding with the insurgents, and left commanders looking nervously at their own troops, uncomfortably aware that ordering them to attack civilians could quickly lead to civil war or, on a more personal level, to a bullet in the back of the head or a hand grenade tossed into a conference room, courtesy of their own soldiers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
More generally, that’s the great weakness of every government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The notion that the leaders of a nation exercise power is a convenient but misleading shorthand for a much more complex process, in which power is actually wielded by thousands of ordinary soldiers, police officers, minor officials, and the like, in obedience to dictates that come cascading down the chain of command through any number of intermediaries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If anything happens to the willingness of those thousands to follow orders, or to the ability or willingness of the chain of command to function, the apparent power of the leadership can evaporate like frost on a sunny morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Whenever a government collapses, if it’s not simply thrown out by some other nation’s invading troops, that’s far more often than not the way that it goes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Some of my readers will doubtless be objecting by this point that it would have been just as possible for me to put together a different set of historical analogies and tell a different story of the way that America’s global empire, and America itself, went to pieces. That’s exactly the point I hoped to make. The narrative presented in October’s posts, as I explained at the time, is not my idea of the way that the American empire
<i>will</i> fall; it’s simply an account of one way that the American empire <i>could</i> fall, and its details were chosen to outline some of the most serious fault lines running through that empire and the society that the empire supports. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of course the end of America’s global empire could happen in some other way. The utter failure of the political process might bring about a collapse of constitutional government at the hands of some charismatic demagogue or other; we could see a sustained insurgency break out in any of half a dozen parts of the country, shredding the economy and forcing the government to bring the troops home from overseas; a military failure of the sort I’ve outlined, instead of triggering the rush to dissolution, could usher in a long era of national retrenchment and reassessment, in which America’s once-traditional isolationism reasserts itself and George Washington’s advice about avoiding foreign entanglements once again becomes the centerpiece of the nation’s policy. I chose a relatively untraumatic option, in large part because so many people seem to find it impossible to remember that plenty of large, heavily armed nation-states down through the years have collapsed in one way or another without dissolving into civil war or assaulting the rest of the planet; still, there’s no guarantee that this will be the way that things work out. There are many options as we approach the post-American future.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The one thing that isn’t an option at this point, I would argue, is a continuation of American global dominance for more than a short time to come.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like the British empire a century ago, the American empire is visibly cracking at the seams as the costs of maintaining a global imperial presence soar and the profits of the imperial wealth pump slump.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Funds the nation can no longer afford to spend are being poured into military technologies that presuppose a way of war that’s rapidly approaching its pull date, while rising powers less burdened by the legacies of the past circle around, waiting for the first signs of weakness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Which of those rising powers will turn out to be the next generation of global hegemons is a good question; China certainly seems like the most likely candidate just now, but then Germany looked like the most likely candidate for Britain’s replacement in 1912, and we know what happened thereafter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What does a post-American future look like?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To begin with, here in America, it’s a future in which the vast majority of us will be much less wealthy than we are today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The American standard of living has been propped up since 1945 by the systemic imbalances that gave a quarter of the world’s energy resources and a third of its raw materials and industrial product to the five per cent of humanity that lives in the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Everything we consider normal in American life today is a function of that flow of imperial tribute, and as that goes away, most of what we consider normal in American life is going to change. The economic troubles that have been ongoing since 2008 are the foreshocks of that seismic shift, which will see most American incomes drop to Third World levels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who are incensed by the extreme disparity in wealth between the rich and the rest in this country should remember that most of that disparity consists of paper wealth, much of it of very questionable value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Trillions of dollars worth of dubious derivatives, asset-backed securities backed by wholly insecure assets, loans that will never be paid back, and equally hallucinatory stores of wealth currently pad the notional net worth of America’s rich; in any imaginable post-American future, all that will be reassessed at its real value, which in most cases amounts to zero.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Just as the Great Depression saw huge income and net worth disparities in American society drop like a rock as vast amounts of paper wealth turned into mere paper, the Greater Depression that will follow the end of American empire will almost certainly see the same phenomenon on an even larger scale. One moral to this story is that any of my readers who have their wealth tied up in paper assets of any kind might be wise to think, hard, about how long they want to leave it there.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Outside the United States, circumstances will no doubt vary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those nations that have linked their welfare or their survival too closely to American empire will be dragged down in their turn; those who align themselves with one or another contender for America’s replacement will rise or fall with their choice, while those that have the good sense to step back into neutrality until the smoke clears, and then make arrangements with the new hegemon, will doubtless do well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I suspect, though, that Japan and western Europe in particular will be in for a rough awakening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>For decades now, they’ve reaped the benefits of having their national defense backstopped by gargantuan US defense budgets, and the end of that cozy arrangement will force them to choose between spending a great deal more money on their own militaries, accepting a new overlord who may be a good deal less congenial than the one they have now, or accepting a position of extreme vulnerability in an epoch where that may turn out to be an exceptionally risky thing to do. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, all these concerns are secondary to the most crucial factor, which is that the post-American future will still have to deal with the head-on collision between a global economic system that requires perpetual growth, on the one hand, and hard planetary limits on the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The end of America’s empire does not mean the end of industrial civilization; nor, for that matter, will it solve the twin problems sketched out decades ago in the prescient and thus profoundly unfashionable pages of <i>The Limits to Growth</i>: the exhaustion of necessary but nonrenewable resources, particularly fossil fuels, and the buildup in the biosphere of ecologically and economically damaging pollutants, particularly carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those forces are still the dominant fact of our time, and the end of America’s empire—traumatic as it may well be, and not only for Americans—is simply one more roadbump along the route of the Long Descent.<br>

Regular readers of <i>The Archdruid Report</i>
will be interested to know that the anthology of post-peak oil science fiction stories that came out of last year’s contest here is now available in print and e-book formats. <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/ >After Oil: SF Visions of a Post-Petroleum World</a> features twelve stories set in futures of the kind we are most likely to encounter, in the largely unexplored territory off beyond today's tired fantasies of limitless progress and sudden apocalypse. Many thanks to all the contributors, and to Shaun Kilgore of Founders House Publishing, who made this project possible!</div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: large">End of the World of the Week #47</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If your last name is Prophet, you have certain advantages in setting up shop as a New Age teacher, and the redoubtable Elizabeth Clare Prophet took advantage of those advantages in a big way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All through the 1970s and 1980s, her books could be found in every New Age bookstore worth the name, and her organizations—the Summit Lighthouse and the Church Universal and Triumphant—were significant presences across the New Age scene of the time, and remain active today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A detailed account of Prophet’s writings, teachings, and activities would fill plenty of pages. Her place here in the End of the World of the Week rests, though, on one detail of her teaching—her repeated insistence that the end would come via nuclear war on April 23, 1990. She apparently received this information from the Ascended Masters, advanced spiritual beings who also dictated her many books. Still, the Masters apparently weren’t ascended enough to get their dates right, and April 23, 1990 passed without incident, like so many other purported doomsdays before and since. </div>

Of course that was implicit in the narrative, as the core of the conflict between the U.S. and China was controlling energy resources. But I think there is a great tendency to believe that when we decline, some other power will just expand exactly as we did over the last two centuries, and build another empire very much like ours. And so on. But the various shuffling empires of the industrial age have all been subsets of one hyper-empire (industrial civilization built by cheap fossil fuels) that envelops them all. As this envelop shrinks, the space available for a nascent empire to expand in to is reduced. <br><br>This leaves me wondering whether there really is another global empire to follow us, or whether the decline of energy resources will derail the growth of the asian empire before it really expands globally, much as a vigorous corn field falters, stunts, then whithers when a drought hits before the grain sets. In my head I also entertain a scenario of the end of American Empire in which we just gradually pull back from our global commitments because we simply can't maintain them (think Rome fading away in Britain), and domestically a federal government that is increasingly incapable of providing the functions or maintaining the control that States are accustomed to. States would have to step in, where they could, when the Feds fizzled, and when States also come up lacking it will fall to local communities or individual households to provide for themselves. Not with a bang or a collapse, just with a slow, sad fading away. There might never be a well-defined end to the federal government or the USA, just an increasing irrelevance of it. In your Learyville series, you seemed to portray something more like this; though eventually word does come of the end of the USA, it is coming from a far away land, like news of the death of a relative who has had no real presence in your life for many years, and has no tangible effect on daily life for the characters in the story.<br><br><a href=#c4916376584222289249 title="comment permalink">11/7/12, 7:59 PM</a><br><br>

China just doesn't seem to me to fit the part in the way that Britain and the U.S. did. It has innumerable problems, can't feed itself and has a hard enough time just controlling China, let alone much of the rest of the world. It lacks "soft power," which the U.S. still has to a large degree - no one wants to move to China, but many people will still likely want to move to the U.S. in spite of all its worsening problems.<br><br>And China is arriving just as the party is winding down. So who knows what sort of multipolar or nonpolar world is in store for us? Certainly not me.

As for gender issues and the like, that's another big question for which we have no sure answers. My sense, and it's not much more than a gut feeling, is that something basic has changed in gender and sexual roles here in the US -- whether that's true elsewhere is a question I'm not qualified to answer -- and the end of the age of abundance may not change that as much as, say, Jim Kunstler thinks. <br><br>Bill, no argument there.

The comment is that international relationships of various sorts would need to change when the good 'ol US of A fell of it's perch. Political structures like the League of Nations (between 'the great war' and the following war which forced its renaming) and the U.N. (post great war version 2) or Bretton Woods and it's successors the IMF, WTO, etc. would have to change in interesting ways. For example: China holds one of the six vetoes on the U.N. Security Council because it bet on the winning horse in WWII, but after Mao's revolution the 'Chinese government' was in a little place we call Taiwan and they held the veto power from 1949-1971.<br><br> That segues nicely to the question. If a group of states from the former union start using the original constitution and the original flag and even the original name maybe? Then what else can they expect to inherit? The U.N. veto? The global hostility to an oppressive hegemon? The popular contempt for a last ditch effort to hold on to BAU? I ask because I've heard before that the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy nor Roman nor an empire. The Holy Roman Empire chose that name to stake claims to those legacies and the implied power and grandeur therein. But the Holy Roman Empire came long after the fall of Rome and the birth of Christianity, the new USA would not have the same temporal distance from it's namesake to diminish all the negative associations. Having grown up in the American west only 35 years ago I don't have any perspective for what it means to reorganize national names and boarders.<br><br> I realize that the question is broad and poorly defined but if you have anything to say on the matter I would love to hear it.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br><a href=#c13565581608198940 title="comment permalink">11/7/12, 11:01 PM</a><br><br>

In Australia for example the media cannot stop talking about America’s “pivot” to the Asian Pacific region in order to maintain “peace, security and prosperity” and to ensure that trade in international waters remains stable. As a part of this “pivot” the Australian government recently approved a larger presence of American marines on Australian soil (2500 additional marines). This has absolute bipartisan support.<br><br>All of the media thaumaturgy reminds me of the concept of the double bind you spoke of in your book, “The Blood of the Earth”. For readers who do not know what a double bind is (and to make sure I’m correct) this refers to a situation where what a child is allowed to discuss in a family unit is inconsistent with what he or she actually experiences. This dissociation can give rise to mental illness. This concept can be applied to societies with the idea being that if people’s experiences and intuitions are divorced from societal narratives they can develop delusional and maladaptive tendencies. Well with all this talk about the “Asian century” on the one hand (a new political slogan being hammered into the Australian public) and America’s “pivot” towards Asia as the ever present, benevolent but declining hegemon on the other hand I think we have a double bind on our hands. No wonder people are confused; plans are made and propaganda disseminated based upon faulty assumptions and then all of this is hammered into the public constantly. It is truly mind bending. <br><br>Another example of this is the notion that Australia can become richer and more prosperous by pandering to the burgeoning Asian middle class by selling them large amounts of food, resources and services without even thinking for a moment whether there is actually enough energy and ecological elasticity to support this growth. Or the other example being that there is a bipartisan rush towards proclaiming that Australia will never have to choose between America and China in the event of conflict conveniently forgetting that by allowing an increased American presence on its shores Australia has already chosen. This is one reason why people are cynical, confused and frustrated; because the media and politicians make a sport and business out of lying to the public. All of this breeds mental illness. It reminds me of Erich Fromm’s concept of the insane society. The idea is that psychology usually defines sanity as being able to adjust to a given society (i.e. the “well-adjusted individual”) with the implicit assumption being that the society is sane. However, Fromm proposes that a society can be pathological meaning that a perfectly sane person ends up psychologically and emotionally unwell under the sheer weight of societal insanity. <br><br><br><a href=#c5499874925487127919 title="comment permalink">11/7/12, 11:15 PM</a><br><br>

If that phrase entails ever more distractions and shinier toys and faster cars and trivial time-wasting video games and the ripoff of endless software "upgrades" and the pestilence of leaf blowers and brain cancer-promoting cell phones, then I agree. But what the phrase also brings to my mind, beyond the sci-fi dreams of Arthur C. Clarke - which personally I'd be up for, if I thought they were going to happen - is progress in the sense of a world where six billion people don't have to die faster than they otherwise would so that the survivors can get along all right, except that they have shorter more miserable lives because they're so much poorer: lives in large part marked by hunger, disease, loss of mobility, relative lack of education, and other things associated with civilizational collapse and the curtailment of possibility which it can be counted on to produce. Good as all this may be for other species and the biosphere generally, it's not going to be fun for many people. <br><br>I don't believe in the vision of the future that you've sketched out because it fills me with joy.

You know, I have no idea either. My most financially lucrative article was about insulation of all things! The most read article that I've written was about poo and the most commented on article was one where I let the Internet trolls wind themselves out venting their collective spleens whilst I set about squashing them one by one. I found the squashing to be a bit of a waste of time and energy and I've since learned not to engage crazy on the Internet (a useful life lesson too!). Writing on the Internet was a new activity for me at the time and having only read your blog I was a bit taken aback by the lack of civilised discourse elsewhere.<br><br>Don't be lured by the sounds of the Internet sirens into writing your last 5 posts into a full length fictional novel. The market for fiction is saturated and it is exceedingly fickle. I mean who'd have thought that "Shades of Grey" which by the way is sitting here on loan from my partners friend waiting to be read, would be a best seller (at first glance a rescue fantasy, anyone?)? A lot of authors write fiction and they are driven by the demands of their egos or as Gordon Ramsay the potty mouthed UK chef might say, it's because it makes their thingee big! hehe! Does it pay the bills though? Sometimes yes, but most times no. It's a gamble.<br><br>I'm not trying to influence you, I'm just getting a different point of view in to most of the commenters here. If you can make it work then - respect, and it'll be worth every minute that you put into it and then some. I’m outing myself also and stating that fiction writing is not my forte so I may have a skewed point of view?<br><br>As an off topic note, I kept ferreting away at the thoughts I was having last week about the news media and I think I may have come to some sort of resolution, but I don't like it at all.<br><br>The gist of it, is that we, as a society, have structured our society in a similar fashion to a factory.<br><br>I've been wondering about this for a long while now as I've been wondering why there is such strong conformity in our society. The pressures to conform are quite strong and it is only when you attempt anything outside the norm that you are even faced with those pressures. I have first-hand experience in these matters and it is a reasonably constant struggle, which I do my best to insulate myself from.<br><br>The reason I mention the analogy with the factory is because the majority of people are funnelled into well-trod paths, just like a factory line, and therein lies the source for the simplification of viewpoints and the heat which you may encounter should you ever be foolish enough to challenge societies preconceived ideas. Just like a factory line, what spits out at the other end is exceedingly homogenous and ready to accept the narrow viewpoints that are dished up to them.<br><br>Dunno, I could be wrong, but I'm troubled by the lack of diversity in lives and opinions in our society.

I find it hard to believe that the people who are wealthy by the manipulation of derivatives-of-derivatives don't see the shallowness and lack of true value of those things they construct. In a quasi-related thought chain, my company's board met with several employees this week to find out from them what they, the board, can do to return the company to growth. As we are a victim of a LBO saddled with debt six times our earnings it's hard to envision a way to grow out of the hole we were chunked in. But, it appears, to an employee who attended that meeting I queried, that the board truely believes we CAN grow out of the hole. The employee and I agreed that these people seemed to employ a anti-reality filter. I don't think you get to being board members of large companies without some level of intellegence and the same things goes for the president and his cohort. I keep wondering if our president and those around him have a similar anti-reality filter regarding resource limitations and the eventual demise of perpetual growth.

Is this why China wants a navy? Africa can use the engineers, and China can use the raw material.

Fiction may not pay the bills in our system of economic resource reallocation, but it does move people. Daniel Quinn, in one of his books, commented that what makes humans human is storytelling; arguable if taken as THE definition of human, but certainly an oft-overlooked point about humanity.<br><br>On voting as a ritual act, it's the only real reason I vote any more. It sustains the illusion that this is "my" government and "my" country, as opposed to the government I happen to be living under, and the country I happen to be living in. I seriously considered not-voting this year, and wrote about it on my own blog. It was a little surprising to me how much inner and outer resistance that engendered.<br><br>This time around, it was a pure gedankenexperiment: I did vote, and only pretended to not-vote. But even the pretend not-vote shifted my unconscious beliefs quite a bit: it promoted a disconnect from the whole whoop-de-doo. Disillusionment, with its consequent sadness and grief -- no illusion leaves easily. But also a deep sense of relief.<br><br>The idea that this is "my" government means that I have to do something about everything that's wrong with it. When doing something about it is effectively impossible (another statement which incenses people) all I get is heartburn and anxiety.<br><br>I see a different kind of disconnect being taken in these comments, the disconnect of "the candidates are effectively identical."<br><br>I have to disagree with that statement. Prior to Bush II, I'd have agreed, but the Bush administration and the Republican Congress of 1996-2006 did a whole lot of damage in a big hurry. It surprised me how much, and how quickly. We may be going over the cliff, but there's a difference between paddling furiously with the current to gain suicidal speed, or paddling against the current in the hopes of finding a portage down the cliff.<br><br>Apart from this disagreement, one important effect of the "candidates are identical" statement is to disconnect from the anxiety produced by investment in the system. It externalizes it. When you don't vote, it's a choice; it could be the wrong choice. When you have no vote because the candidates are identical, it's fate.<br><br><a href=#c3082171007137879304 title="comment permalink">11/8/12, 8:03 AM</a><br><br>

I complimented on the writing, but it really did offer up an insight that I don't think a lot of people really understand...<br><br>That life goes on, even without you. That no matter how important someone thinks something is, it's a human construction that will falter and vanish with time, only valued because those who are a part of the construction give it value.<br><br>When one gets down to thinking about it, I personally think that human beings aren't that different in any age. We're still driven by base ideas of survival, looking for that power to ensure one has better resources than another and then using it to ensure that one gets their 'fifteen minutes of fame'. The United States, even if they manage to somehow avert another economic disaster, will be constrained by limited resources, as you've stated. Something will give and, eventually, that'll be that. Globalization ends messy.<br><br>Who knows though? China might not be the next empire, because of the inherent problems they have now. Their single child policy is already coming back to bite them, they own trillions in American debt and the government there is resisting change that a lot more people desperately want. There's a distinct possibility that when the US goes down, it takes China with it because of how intertwined they are. Thus, I personally believe that it'll be the countries that don't have as many ties to the States that could end up as an empire. Russia could manage despite a heavy hit from a collapsing Chinese economy. Brazil could become a power. India could do it. It's hard to tell, but I can't see China surviving the US fall very easily at all. However, such things are just guesses. Can't know the future, after all.<br><br>All the same, though, the very idea of a world without the United States as it is now is more or less impossible to think of for most Western individuals in the same way that most of us have never seen a world changing natural disaster that has killed millions, despite that it could happen later today or tomorrow and we'd never see it coming. There is an inherent ability to deny that anything is wrong and that change is this scary thing that nobody can really understand because they don't want to. People will step on each other, kill and follow blindly so long as change is made into this less scary thing.<br><br>You offered a lot of insight in five posts and I can't say enough that it was an amazing read. You managed to make a situation that would terrify people and give it a little bit of hope by its completion. Because life always goes on, even as the constructions we make and thrive on crumble around us, we can always make something new and different.<br><br><a href=#c2745523575943948067 title="comment permalink">11/8/12, 9:57 AM</a><br><br>

Practically everything Bush the Younger did was a continuation of policies begun in Reagan's or Clinton's administrations. <br><br>This year was the first year I didn't vote in a presidential election, and I voted for Carter in 1976 just to give you perspective on how long I've been voting age.

Suez was a turning point for my young self, but actually was well after the event; that is after 'the end of the empire’. Many Brits though had still 'not got it' by 1956 and the Suez Canal had long been a critical key feature of the empire. We had occupied Egypt for 70 years; temporarily it was always said, just to 'look after it'. General Eisenhower needed to administer a large dose of cold reality to correct the British continuing illusion.<br><br>Writing entirely as an outsider, I tend to agree with Joseph that the candidates were not just 'the same'.

If we'd made the necessary changes back in the 1970s, that might just have been possible, though it would have required abandoning the idea of perpetual progress -- and of course that was the stumbling block all along.

Yes, it'll involve some short-term hardship, which could be made a lot less onerous by any number of steps that won't be taken (such as meaningful debt relief); that hardship is going to come one way or another, though. <br><br>Phil, the disastrous state of the French royal finances was a subject of endless talk for decades before 1789, yes.

We'll be talking about that in an upcoming post. <br><br>Matthew, the Chinese are already all over Africa, precisely because it has the raw materials they need, and they have the industrial products and trained specialists that African nations want. That's one of the reasons I put the war there in my scenario. <br><br>JP, well, you're entitled to your opinion. Obviously, I disagree. <br><br>Jetfire, that's also an option, of course. <br><br>Justin, that book someone recommended to you wasn't, by any chance, <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> by Robert Pirsig? If so, whoever recommended it was pulling your leg!<br><br>Joseph, I didn't say that all presidential candidates are identical. I said that the two major party candidates in Tuesday's election were. <br><br>Rashakor, all quite true. The lower Colorado and Rio Grande valleys have a complex history ahead of them; one of these days, I need to talk about that. <br><br>Robert, of course not. I think it may mean the end of global empires -- the Spanish empire was a special case, since the technology that made it possible was only available to Europe at that time. If China, India, the Aztecs, etc. had had fleets equipped with equivalent cannon and the like, there would have been large regional empires rather than one big global one -- and the regional empires are what I would expect to see in the future. <br><br>Glenn, thanks for the tip!<br><br><a href=#c5622826834827443994 title="comment permalink">11/8/12, 12:03 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, this sounds like bad science fiction, but technological trends are pointing in that direction. Economically and militarily, the machines are taking over. I envision a scenario not like Terminator, where the machines spontaneously become intelligent and start exterminating humans, but more like Lord of the Rings where Saruman built an orc army and sought power. Techno-sorcerers with self-replicating robotic armies will, in the not too distant future, be able to create wealth and conquer territory with little need for human beings. These machines will have different requirements for survival than humans, so many of the peak resource problems you talk about may be solvable. In this scenario, I expect few humans to survive, and the robots to radically transform the planet so as to optimize their efficiency and power. This would represent a evolutionary phase change for life on this planet that hasn’t happened in hundreds of millions of years, if ever.<br><br>Again, I know all of this probably sounds ridiculous to many of you, but there are exponential trends and technological arms races that are pointing in this direction. Unless civilization crashes fairly quickly, I’m not sure what will prevent this kind of “technological Singularity”.<br><br><a href=#c3940250806932713344 title="comment permalink">11/8/12, 12:39 PM</a><br><br>

It is always good to see the underlying thought structure, even if we don't agree with some or all the points ( I still think your plot had far less ramifications than a RL situation would have, that China was very benign in the peace deal, that the convention result was received with excessive pragmatism by the bigwigs compared with historic examples.... and that the USSR constitution example was not really appliable to the US because you simply don't have a state that has the internal weight of Russia in the USSR ( like I told you before ;) ). But, alas, that is my opinion ;) ). I just wanted to muse on 2 things:<br><br>-First of all, my scenario ( in a sketchy form :D ) Being myself a portuguese and knowing my own history of imperial decline from a empire of bases situation based in a very flexible naval force, I think it is highly likely that no one will face the US frontally for a big while and that the empire of bases will crumble of simple economical stress one base at the time for a while ... that until the people around make the math and think that a local confrontation with the US ( where they would have local superiority ) outweights the status quo in terms of cost/benefit. Most likely the US will win the first couple of engagements ( at a great expense ), but sooner or later they will be caught with too much crisis at the same time to handle and something will give. <br><br>I do find interesting the handling of US war vets in that situation ( since the political angle is more flashy, thus people tend to only look at that ). I can definitely see some bases commanders going native and/or carving little kingdoms to themselves, but the vast majority will surely be repratriated. Getting back a bunch of war vets home is not a easy thing to handle even when you have the resources to "bribe" them with a state sponsored job or lands ( see Zimbabwe ), and thus I pretty much see a strong possiblity of the US developing their version of the German Freikorps, with all that brings behind ...<br><br>( end of pt 1 )<br><br><a href=#c8144704489846686615 title="comment permalink">11/8/12, 2:50 PM</a><br><br>

First of all, tht is definitely not true at popular level ( as far as I can tell, there is no Euro country where the american presence is more than tolerated by the common people. In here, atleast that is the case ) and, even at the politic arena, the general atmosphere is more the sentiment that the americans themselves do not want to leave, so better use them as they are here than anything else ( BTW I think that a lot of americans never asked themselves why the political bigwigs are so eager to push a big portion of the US Army out of the country at all costs ... )<br><br>There is also the point that in a lot of cases the Americans do not pay more than token gifts for the use of the bases ( with the coutnry where the base is pays up the majority if not all of maintenance bills without direct benefit ). <br><br>For a example, publicly the US has in Portugal 1 direct asset, the use of the Lajes airbase ( technically it is a portuguese airbase partly leased to the USAF ), and 2 NATO assets: the currently named JFC Lisbon ( a Portuguese XVII century fort that was reffited beyond recognition that has, among other things , a big underground bunker ( I live nearby and I know quite well the general underground layout from hearsay in spite of not public ) and the so-called "Radar station Nº1", a big Radar station in the SW tip of Portugal that was made to monitor the sea movements in the entry of the Med.<br><br> The maintenace of the first is paid in full by the Portuguese with the Americans obliged to give "scientifical and military cooperation" as pay ... that last time was a couple of 70´s decade destroyers that were in so bad shape that the best use our governement found to them was to sink them to create refuges for baby fish :D The Radar station is nominally under the portuguese airforce command ( and funding ), but the fact that our governement was forced to make another station a couple of km from there for it's use says it all about how much control we have of it ... and JFC Lisbon will be cut down in the next year because the "alliance" ( read: US ) funds for it were scrapped and the Portuguese can not sustain the gargantuous ( think between a quarter to a third of the Baghdad Green Zone in terms of surface size, not even counting on the underground levels ) structure by itself...<br><br>Well, sorry for the lenghty description, but this is pretty much to say that, as far as I know ( and based in my personal experience and knowledge ) the US Army does not spend much more than the army maintenance for the US forces in Europe ( thus not paying much more ( and in some cases even less ) than it would pay for the same troops stationed in the US soil ) and that the Europeans in general ( and even in political levels, but obviously not in public in most cases ) do not want the Americans troops in Europe and would most likely cheer the day they would leave, since they don't see any reason for the americans being here ( well, maybe besides the people that border Russia ... ). At best, and as the americans are here and don't seem to want to go away, the thinking heads see them as a existing asset, but that is far from the perception that a lot of americans have that we actually want american boots in here doing our "defense". We want that as much as the Americans want the Russian army "protecting" them ...<br><br><a href=#c5254310054806315232 title="comment permalink">11/8/12, 2:59 PM</a><br><br>

It's amazing how much cheap fantasy passes for thinking these days. <br><br>Ricardo, I don't doubt for a moment that people across much of Europe would cheer the departure of US troops. My point is that they're fooling themselves if they think that, after that happens, they can keep tiny military budgets and not fall under the control of some potentially much more demanding overlord. In the case of Portugal, with its very convenient location on the Atlantic, the choice might well be between paying for a real navy and air force, on the one hand, and becoming a Chinese client state on terms even more burdensome than the ones the US imposes, on the other. Either way, the costs would not be pretty. <br><br>Pictures, that seems quite possible.

Illich of course wrote about this at some length. There are some processes which do lend themselves to the factory method -- such as the manufacture of completely consistent, identical objects. And there are other processes for which it seems to work very badly indeed, such as all the human tasks of caring and nurturing: agriculture (including animal husbandry), health care, education, "corrections" (prison) etc., and anything to do with living systems, which are complex and location-specific, not generic and uniform. Attempts to impose the generic and uniform onto the local and specific abound. Almost all of them become futile and/or pathogenic.<br><br>We have modelled our schools, our farms, our prisons, and our hospitals on the factory (and mining) metaphor, and they have become demonstrably dysfunctional. Actually it is hard to say quite how/when this all began: did the Pantechnicon prison concept predate the manufactory? to what extent did the disciplined and ostensibly standardised life of the monastery and/or the military (both long predating the factory) contribute to this cultural obsession? what about corvee labour, which treats people as "standard" substitutable worker-units in the implementation of huge projects, and dates back to the beginning of grain-hoarding agricultural empires?<br><br>Anyhoo... I could not agree more that the obsession with uniformity, conformity, "efficiency" and (most important of all) Control [at all costs] is a major element of the collective mental illness of our times.

The way it works, as you probably know, is that you are presented with two items. One is a "known," the other is an "unknown."

At first the text was always the "known" and the number image was always the "unknown," hence the text pieces might have been easier on average. Now it seems like sometimes the number is the "known" so we are getting the really blurry smudgy pieces of text as the "unknowns" again. <br><br>Of course, so long as you get the "known" right your input is accepted.

Well done, I wish you well and keep my fingers crossed for you hoping that it all pans out. Generally speaking though, hard work trumps luck in most situations and you are a consistent author.<br><br>I've put a bit more thought into the factory analogy and come up with some further parallels:<br><br>Specialisation is a common theme in factories as it promotes labour efficiency. Individuals in society have taken specialisation to such an extent that I consider it to be a pretty risky strategy. Historically, yeah people were specialised, but they were also experienced in many other facets of not just their particular trade (vertical integration if required was a possibility), but also many other general aspects of life. People nowadays tend to outsource these general aspects of life to other people (specialists) and as such they are pretty clueless about those activities - yet an economist may argue that this is an efficient use of scarce labour resources, just like in a factory.<br><br>Disconnect from inputs. I have worked in a factory (on a production line floor in my youth and later as a professional involved in an aspect of management for a few years and then in shutting down that factory). Factories are like sponges in that they tender for resources, but aren't particularly concerned about where those resources come from as long as they meet the quantity and quality requirements. It is all treated as a supply side issue (just like Reganomics) and not in the holistic sense that long term thinking (or sustainability) would require. Society is pretty much the same. I've read about fuel shortages in NY after Sandy and noted that people tended to seek more fuel rather than learn to live without it in an environment in which they chose to live in (people say it is dangerous living where I do because of natural events!).<br><br>Disconnect from nature. A factory is a simplified system, unlike the natural world which is mind-bogglingly complex. Factories are generally insulated from the natural world and have simple inputs and outputs. People in Industrial countries tend to live lives that are also insulated from the natural world when in fact we are all very much of the natural world. The disconnect means that both factories and people don't think that their actions have any consequence on the natural world, when they do.<br><br>You know, it is probably a case of chicken and egg, are factories a product of our society or is our current society a product of the Industrial Revolution? Dunno, although I do know that once you lose sight and contact with nature, you sell your soul.<br><br>Regards.<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c3817107042088816266 title="comment permalink">11/9/12, 3:10 AM</a><br><br>

I will name three that come to mind.<br><br>First, a scenario similar to the one you have outlined in this past month, in my estimation is much less likely to occur under an Obama administration. I for one, will rest much easier for the next four years having Mr. Obama as commander in chief. He has demonstrated some wisdom and savvy with regards to wielding both the soft and hard power of our nation. Last time we had a Republican in charge, some fairly poor decisions were made, and it is my sense, Romney might have been as clueless and rash in this regard as was the younger Bush.<br><br>Second is the future make up of the supreme court. Mr. Obama is not likely to nominate another Scalia or Thomas. What happens at the supreme court is often pivotal, as we have learned repeatedly, and most recently with the citizens united decision.<br><br>Third is marriage equality. When President Obama stood up and publically declared his support for gay marriage, that made a difference not just to those directly affected, but also to the cultural conversation, which impacts all of us. I am glad to have this man continue in office as a leader and to not have Romney who does not seem to share the same values on this issue.<br><br>And while the great sweep of history will continue in its own direction, regardless of the outcome of this particular election, everyday life still happens in smaller chunks of time. The next four years will still be tough, due to all the factors discussed in this blog, but I am much more optimistic in the short term, with Mr. Obama as our President.<br><br><a href=#c7375912448071144302 title="comment permalink">11/9/12, 5:35 AM</a><br><br>

(Disclaimer: in my opinion the differences are certainly <b>not</b> tertiary to women, nonwhite people, the LGBT community, nonchristians, and so on, all of whom would be feeling a real difference - at the practical, objective level of governmental behavior - in the course of their lives had the election gone otherwise. That is, however, not my point.)<br><br>There is one important area - the silent dog in this discussion - in which Obama and Romney seem to be worlds apart: thaumaturgy.<br><br>Roughly, Obama represents a future in which existing structures of white, patriarchal, Christian, and Confederate privilege are going to crumble away. Romney's thaumaturgical message is that every effort must be made to preserve and bolster those structures. These two thaumaturgical incantations have hugely different consequence.<br><br>Yes, Obama's 2008 thaumaturgy of Hope And Change rang hollow when he began solicitously serving the financial interests first, expanding dictatorial government powers, and abdicating unearned political clout to the Republicans with both hands. But the subtext remains, and that subtext seems highly consequential.<br><br>Of course, the financial interests are adaptable and will do whatever they must in order to sustain their position and their many wealth pumps. But it does seem that with Obama's election, those financiers are somewhat restricted purely through the social force of thaumaturgy. Romney's old, authoritarian power structures, violence-prone and feeling existential threat, would make a much readier instrument for enhanced authoritarian rule. Iraq's Baath party is a real example of such a development, and history is full of others. But thaumaturgy has deligitimized them somewhat, hasn't it?<br><br>So yes, at a policy level, the sitting President of the US can't do much other than react to situations. But that president's "mandate", which gets so much attention from the policy-shapers, percolates down into all reaches of society, and casts influence over state and local governments. The mandate matters immensely.<br><br>And what is a mandate, really, except our consensus about the outcome of a thaumaturgical contest?<br><br><a href=#c3759483104467869373 title="comment permalink">11/9/12, 6:14 AM</a><br><br>

It tends to revolve around getting way, way ahead of facts and our capacity for understanding them, both on the part of science fanatics and their romantic rivals.<br><br>i.e., it is basically true that (at the scale of history) this tims is different because the particular causal components of this time *are* different and the exact arrangement they will form is difficult to predict in a precise way.<br><br>But it is also true that this time isn't different, in the sense that the sorts of things involved are basically of the same sort. So, while we may not be able to delineate the precise forms they will take, we can outline the general pattern of forces at play. <br><br>Which makes the 'scientific' application of history to *political* situations a not-so-smart choice. The generalities are of fairly minimal help to a politician in the welter of specifics. Knowing which way he or she is going helps, but only in a limited sort of way. <br><br>It's also why the talk of 'geoengineering' by our technocrats makes me very, very nervous. It seems like precisely the mismatch between generality and fact that defined the Soviet Marxist experiment. Except, you know, carried out directly on the ecosystem itself. <br><br>I'm with good ol' Otto Neurath on this sort of thing--best not try to rebuild the whole boat at once, unless you like drowning in the ocean.<br><br>And, then, well, there is Hegel's point about history not being one monolithic thing. A lot of history is (rightfully) not particularly scientific at all, it's just a people pulling together the stories that define them as a people. <br><br>I think some of the 'this time is different' is just people trying to lay hold of that more communal history, the sort through which they can find comraderie. The idea that history is 'really' the scientific stuff makes them feel adrift and lonely, just an atom in a process (which they also are, but not *just*). It's different this time because it is us, intimately and personally us. It may be like Rome, but I'm not, we're not, in Rome (with all apologies to Philip K. Dick).<br><br>The last round of fiction was nice in that it imagines that personal and intimate us, which may be one reason why it's been popular. It clearly shows that there is an 'us' in this.<br><br>Rediscovering a vibrant appreciation for that kind of history seems like something pretty important, though maybe we won't really see that until the contractions really drive things apart and people are forced to pull together again more tightly, to really be an us.<br><br>Well, okay, to be fair, plenty of folks still have that appreciation, but more will surely need it! And, wow, a sense for those being something you need to educate people with....anyway, I'll stop before I really get to rambling.

The first one is, I don't want the US to break apart! It's looking a little frayed now, in large part due to the political exploitation of regional differences for partisan purposes, plus the real internal economic exploitation that goes on. It's made me think of ways we can be sewn back up together - internal cultural exchange programs, perhaps? I'm interested in any ideas your readers might have.<br><br>Secondly, the discussion got me thinking of presidential elections that DID offer a real choice, at least in retrospect. The two that come to mind post WWII are 1980, to some extent, and 2000, as other readers have noted. Let me explain: President Carter saw dependency on Middle Eastern oil as a national security issue, and realized that continued consumption increases were unsustainable, and so tried mightily to reduce our dependence via conservation and alternatives. Even so, the revolution in Iran showed how deeply dependent we already were, and forced his hand towards a [further] militarization of US policy towards the Middle East. With the election of Reagan, though, any attempt at energy autarky was abandoned, and the military option was embraced whole-heartedly. <br><br>I see the election of 2000 as even more decisive, though, since it led to a war of choice in Iraq. Now, one thing to remember is that the no-fly zone and the hostile regime in Bhagdad was not exactly a sustainable situation, so I think even a President Gore would have done something about Iraq. But there were a bunch of other options, such as supporting a coup, a Libya-style air war, or even an invasion, arrest of Saddam, and installation of new rulers whilst keeping the Iraqi army and civil service intact - anything other than the tar baby occupation conducted by gross incompetents we found ourselves attached to.<br><br>As a side note, it seems transparent to me that the strategy of the attack was to do something so heinous that the US would be tempted to get into a quagmire of a war, a strategy that worked. The attackers took the measure of our leaders and found them wanting. It still amazes me that our leaders were so arrogant to fall for the strategy hook, line, and sinker.<br><br><a href=#c6918711629331156322 title="comment permalink">11/9/12, 7:55 AM</a><br><br>

What happened on Tuesday was a straightforward contest to see which candidate could piece together the largest assortment of veto groups and captive constituencies, and it's a contest Obama won. Both sides spent most of the election feeding the same thaumaturgical narrative about recovery, growth, jobs, limitless American power, blah blah blah, and the demographic shifts that have made the GOP's historical constituency a minority aren't changing that -- nor, I think, is there any basis for your claim that the financial industry will somehow be restrained by an Obama presidency.

Those are bottom up pushes, not top down pulls. Recent history shows that the President's position on these is generally set by the prevailing mood of the country, regardless of party. Bush II ended the ban on HIV+ people entering the US, a ban that stood through 8 years of Clinton. Obama ended don't-ask-don't-tell, for sure, but again that was a Clinton policy in the first place. He flipped on same-sex marriage when the public opinion polls flipped. Romney has extensively demonstrated his deeply entrenched "market-based politics," and he would go wherever the market demanded. That's a requirement for becoming president. Sure there is some symbolic value to having the Man (still, always a man...) at the Top agreeing with your position, but these fights really happen in state and local elections, not national ones. When enough States lead, the Feds will follow.<br><br><a href=#c3184269245679879660 title="comment permalink">11/9/12, 8:44 AM</a><br><br>

( I am not even sure how I found it. Did somebody here mention the stories of Don DeLillo?)<br> The author of this thesis has studied DeLillo’s works, quote: “as expressive of the process of financialization which emerged in response to the 1970s capitalist crisis in the United States and gave rise to a specific social materiality and peculiar ‘structure of feeling’ grounded in finance capital.” This 'structure of feeling' takes Chris’ ‘factory’ sensibility a stage further. We move from the internalised ‘industrial model’ into the modern era represented in the novels, which as the PhD puts it, “depict a specifically finance-driven US hegemony”.<br><br>Certainly, peculiar is the right word for this ‘structure of feeling! The PhD thesis itself reads a bit like a SF story; written in the future and looking back to our strange times.

And you also must not forget that the military "Keyesnism" also has fans in this side of the pond ...<br><br>It is true that some decades ago there were people serious in using the Americans as meat shield for Europe ( and willing to pay for it ), but at this time I think that everyone around here is sharpening the blades in secret and just waiting for the aparently inevitable at long term American departure to solve those old feuds that everyone in Europe has with someone and maybe get a crumb of Africa back ( see how eager the French and the British were of messing up in Lybia ). So ,as you can imagine, there is a lot of people eager to see the americans go away to have free reign. I'm not saying that it will end well for anyone in here ( it won't ), but at this point it is almost certain that most of the European governements see the american presence far less as a asset than a burden and it will surely come the time that they will be fully willing to try to pay the price of having a defense that does not rely in the big bad american army boogieman. As a half-joke, I am 100% sure that the Greek goverment at this point would kill for the option of having a nice little war with Turkey :p They would definitely lose, but then they could blame the turks for all of their miseries, instead of the state ruinous management :D<br><br>On Portugal, to be honest, the Chinese moves have been extensively publicized, but there has been some very bitter bidding wars between brazilian and chinese companies for state assets and EMBRAER ( the Brazilian military planes builder ) is actually at this point hiring personnel to open a factory of military transport planes in here next year. Still, the German investements are king for the time being ( the Volkswagen factory they have here alone makes up for 3-6% of the GDP ), but Germany is not what it used to be in terms of liberal distribution of "investements" ;), so I assume that is a matter of time before someone passes them ... but anyway, I do see Portugal as being probably too far for a real Chinese lordship. OTOH I would not exclude a Brazilian future ...<br><br><a href=#c6475310287217057177 title="comment permalink">11/9/12, 10:22 AM</a><br><br>

That's second only to the US, and about 1.3 times the spending of China. For that, they get a military with the second highest number of active personnel in the world (after China and before the USA), the second most combat aircraft (after the USA and before China), and the most warships. France and the UK also have small but not insignificant nuclear arsenals. If the US were to pull all its troops out today, the EU would have no trouble standing alone.<br><br>(Wikipedia has some good information on this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_the_European_Union)<br><br>In the future, things may be somewhat different. Granted, much of the EU's military power is accounted for by the UK, France and Germany, and an EU breakup could leave poorer member states vulnerable. But while the Euro is looking shaky at the moment, the series of pacts and alliances that make up the Union go back a lot further, and are quite a bit deeper than the currency. Personally I would give the EU at least even odds of outlasting the USA, in some form or other. It might end up looking somewhat more imperial, with the UK, France and Germany becoming more obvious local hegemons, but I doubt that it would lose the ability to dissuade other major global players from projecting military power into Europe.<br><br>For the Portuguese scenario you mention to Ricardo, I could easily see China exerting political and financial influence over Portugal. But I do not see China being able to back that up with military threats from literally the other side of the globe, and within the sphere of influence of what will likely be an equal or near-equal nuclear equipped military. <br><br>Japan, although it only spends 1% of its GDP on defence, is still in the top 10 for absolute spending. Given its precarious geographical location in respect to China (and for that matter Russia), it would certainly need to up that in the event of the US disappearing, but the JSDF is nothing to sneeze at.<br><br>What I take exception to is the idea that the USA is paying for the sovereign defence of Europe. That may have been true during the Cold War, when there were Soviet troops poised for invasion, but right now there just isn't a strategic military threat for the EU to defend against. I think both that idea, and others backing the massive rise in US defence spending since 2000, are part of the Neocon mythos. What I can accept is that the US military is protecting European imperial interests, and that a Europe in a future world, standing without the US, would lose more remote proxy wars with, say China, than it would win, but I give it reasonably good odds of maintaining its local sphere of influence for at least as long as global powers continue to exist (maybe another century?). <br><br>(Barring, of course, civil wars, seismic socio-political shifts like another wave of fascism, a third world war, etc).<br><br><a href=#c3737462852153491085 title="comment permalink">11/9/12, 10:28 AM</a><br><br>

The author, a think-tank director turned motorcycle mechanic, argues that the modern revolution in "knowledge work" is much akin to the advent of the assembly line. The assembly line took the skill of a single craftsman and distilled it into a process which could be carried out by cheap, unskilled, easily replaceable workers, with correspondingly disastrous effects for the manual crafts. Crawford argues that the "knowledge economy" has done much the same to the intellectual crafts, with individual creative and intellectual ability largely replaced by computerised processes set up once by a designer, making "knowledge workers" little more than clerks, and just as cheap, unskilled and replaceable as assembly line workers. At the same time, universities have moved from being centres of learning of the craft of academia into degree factories, churning out clerical workers for the cubicled assembly line. <br><br>I don't know if this is exactly what you were driving at, but I think it is related.

You're also quite correct that some presidential contests do feature a definite choice, usually between bad and worse. <br><br>Richard, sure, and the blue states would have been talking secession if Romney had won. It's going to take a while longer, and much more stress, before the meme gets so deeply implanted that it's not just a rhetorical strategy for sore losers. <br><br>Bill, precisely. <br><br>Ricardo, fascinating. I've wondered for a while whether the end of the American presence in Europe would eventually bring on the next round of European wars -- the nations of Europe always start off invading countries elsewhere, and end up invading each other. As for Portugal as a Brazilian client state, yes, that's also a very likely outcome, as Brazil approaches great power status. <br><br>Kieran, the US presence in Europe has been on the wane since the end of the cold war, to be sure, and that's one useful marker of American imperial decline. That presence, as I see it, was always as much an army of occupation as it was a matter of defending Europe -- you'll notice that the two Axis powers that mattered, and the other Allied power that mattered, all ended up occupied by very large US forces for decades after the war ended. Still, I'm far from sure that European nations can be as secure in their own homelands as you think; the EU strikes me as a very ramshackle arrangement, closer to the old Concert of Europe than to a viable supranational government, and once it gives way the major threats to each European country will be its neighbors, as in the past. <br><br>5keptical, 25 years is a good figure -- that's about how long I think we have before technological regression becomes a massive issue, because the energy and raw materials to create and maintain computer technology will no longer be readily available, and human labor will be much, much cheaper. <br><br>Zach, yes, I've seen the same assumption at work.

I've also been watching politics long enough to recognize that the mainstream of the GOP isn't serious about restricting abortion -- they use that rhetoric to play to one of their captive constituencies, with exactly the same degree of cynicism that the Dems use environmental rhetoric -- and so the quadrennial yelling about the Supreme Court is also a scrap. <br><br>The real work in both cases is being done on the state and local levels -- for example, in the state where I live, which just passed legislation allowing gay marriages after a lot of hard work to which Obama contributed nothing worth mentioning. <br><br>Darth, if all you can hear in what I'm saying is liberal platitudes, you're not listening. <br><br>Cam, thanks for the book tip!

During an interview I heard you say there are not the resources to sustain this and that makes sense to me. However, imagine if we did have the energy and resources to do this. I do not doubt that it would have happened. <br><br>Or the possibility that reproduction becomes even more detached from nature than it already has. I saw a book the other day talking fondly of a future where babies are manufactured using artificial eggs and wombs making men redundant. This would be a logical extension of what has already happened and with more energy it would have happened, at least for a time.<br><br>I am not saying all of these possibilities could have happened with more energy. For example, I do not think consciousness can be uploaded onto a computer. This to me seems to take the brain as hardware, mind as software, analogy too far. However, some of these possibilities could and in my view would have happened in a world of greater energy and therefore are more than wacky science fiction.<br><br>You might say, well yes, but we live on a finite planet so why entertain these “possibilities”. True, but there are some plausible circumstances under which some of this becomes possible. For example, the planet could have been larger with more oil or we could have perfected nuclear fusion. There would still be limits and eventual collapse but imagine how much more damage would occur before then. We could conceivably have these robotic monsters mentioned above, more war not less as a result, and a much higher peak in global population before the collapse (perhaps 10 to 20 billion). <br><br>What I am saying is peak oil as it actually is may have saved us from ourselves, our own hubris and the madness of "progress" as it has been defined and operationalized over the past three centuries. Perhaps a focus on this will help to keep us sane during the coming hardships. <br><br><br><a href=#c3065501457442676113 title="comment permalink">11/9/12, 5:27 PM</a><br><br>

Now I think I understand your point. <br><br>So it raises a different question. We do seem to have settled into a gridlock similar to 1860 and 1932. And we certainly recognize both Lincoln and FDR as exceptional presidents who brought us through those crises and changed the nature of the gridlock, and the direction of the nation.<br><br>To what extent were they created by their circumstance?<br><br>You outline two coming crises, but they are not, in fact, on top of us.<br><br>In the 1860 crisis we had states clamoring for secession, and armies forming to enforce it. In the 1932 crisis, we had armed insurrection forming in the rural areas and communism sweeping the cities, and Washington insiders were calling for suspension of the Constitution under martial law and a full fascist reorganization of government.<br><br>Nothing like that has yet happened in our current gridlock. We've had a foreshock in the 2008 recession. Nothing more.<br><br>In keeping with the principle of historical patterns you argue here, it seems to me that the resolution of the past crises was not so much that Lincoln and FDR were overwhelmingly superior beings, but that they were the ones who happened to be there when it all went down, and they had ENOUGH character to rise to the occasion.<br><br>That would imply that whoever is in the White House when the current crises come to a head will <i>become</i> the next president to stand beside Lincoln and FDR -- provided that this person is not too weak (or ideologically rigid) to rise to the occasion.<br><br>My question is whether you think this person can be smoked out in advance of the crisis.<br><br>My inclination would be to say he -- or she -- cannot. If the crisis strikes while Obama is in the White House, he may rise to the occasion and become a Great President, or he may not. In principle, the same could be said of Romney, had he been elected. Or even Sarah Palin. We won't know until the crisis comes, and we'll see how the person in the hot seat jumps.<br><br>If you disagree -- if you think the person who could rise to the occasion can be determined, or even intuited, before the crisis comes -- what would be the characteristics you believe would be essential to taking us through that crisis into the beginning of the next cycle?<br><br><a href=#c7908728634150443558 title="comment permalink">11/9/12, 6:49 PM</a><br><br>

I don't propose to rehash all that here, and the other argument doesn't interest me. <br><br>Kurt, one of the things that underlies the narrative is a sense that we're not quite there yet. Your process of continued polarization is precisely what I see happening around us. <br><br>CGP, that's certainly one way to look at the situation. <br><br>Joseph, I certainly wouldn't claim the ability to guess in advance whether any given politician can rise to greatness. I'd point out, though -- as I did in that earlier post -- that Lincoln and FDR both had huge advantages that any future president in the same situation won't have, notably a very rich natural resource base that allowed many aspects of their respective crises to be mitigated. <br><br>That said, it's not too hard to imagine a variant on my scenario in which, let's say, Pete Bridgeport was Jameson Weed's vice president, and didn't make the mistakes Gurney did, which latter were wyat pushed the crisis of legitimacy to the point of explosion. In that alternate scenario, it wouldn't be too hard to see the constitutional convention fulfilling its original purpose, reining in the federal government and transferring some authority back to the states, and kickstarting the long period of national reassessment I mentioned in this week's blog post. No doubt, in that future, President Bridgeport would end up with a memorial somewhere along the Mall, or perhaps in the new capital that will have to be built once sea level starts rising in earnest.<br><br><a href=#c5746201316955534499 title="comment permalink">11/9/12, 7:30 PM</a><br><br>

That is, of course, the essence of a factory: to turn raw materials into manufactured goods -- one thing into another. We have become very, very good at it, and are so impressed with our cleverness that, like the proverbial man with a hammer who sees everything as a nail, we unconsciously try and apply those ideas everywhere.<br>He pointed out, for example, how we treat children like machine components on an assembly-line during the course of their "education" and the diminishing return associated with higher education in that model. Thus we do not value a child entering school because he or she has not yet been turned into a 'valuable' university graduate yet.<br>We treat farms like factories, expecting them to run like machinery, as a means of producing food, without regard to integrated biological issues, hence monoculture, ground-killing fertilizers, pesticides, and tractors. Our market economics has no way of evaluating the "value" of healthy topsoil, air or water, even though we intuitively know it should be greater than zero, apart from evaluating the price of crops produced by that soil. Our factory mentality cannot evaluate the worth of a standing forest, even though we know it has intrinsic biological worth. We can only evaluate it after it has been turned into lumber, raw material for industry.<br>In the same way the news business has slowly morphed from providing information and context into a news factory, to output the largest number of facts that grab our attention, but without any discernment as to relative value ('infotainment'), and stripped of context or narrative to make sense of them. Dan Rather once remarked back in the late 1980s, that America is a nation where people know everything that happened in the last 24 hours, but cannot remember what happened last week. News is now fragmented and disconnected collection of recent events, and it is left to a diligent reader (with a good memory and a lot of time) to try and tease out which bits of information are important and thus produce a signal and which are mere background noise and then to connect those fragments together into some sort of coherent narrative about what is happening in our world. This began when corporations began to require that all divisions turn a profit, including the news bureaus, which meant that they had to entertain as much as they informed and so, here we are, 40 years later.<br>It is why there is so little coverage of issues like huge unemployment rates and the real significance of the "jobless recovery" and so much coverage of, say, the Kardashians and other trivia. The latter titillates, the former requires us to see the world in a way we don't like. It allows 48% of the population who actually went out to vote to choose a blatant liar like Gov. Romney because his narrative appeals to them and they like his 'facts'. Pres. Obama is not being straight, either, because he is cherry-picking his facts and weaving an equally unrealistic narrative, but at least the facts he chooses are verifiably true, if distorted. There are other reasons, of course, explored here in previous posts, but that is why this past fiction series which draws from real, disparate, but significant news events and pulls them together into a coherent, probable narrative is so powerful.<br><br><a href=#c5811700732202202759 title="comment permalink">11/10/12, 10:48 AM</a><br><br>

I'm aware the history of the world thus far has been a kaleidoscopic eternal round of conflicts and wars. But humans are capable of evolution in non-material ways. I think the great significance of technology, ironically, has been the beginning of the elevation of half the human race, women, to equal status. This is an unprecedented change, of even more significance than other completely new things, like the concept of human rights, or the unprecedented connectedness of the species through the internet. It is not just in material, "Limits to Growth" ways that we face a new situation. More influential will be consciousness changes whereby the whole dominance/submission imperative need no longer be primary. I think the drama of humans killing each other for various domineering reasons will be replaced with other less primitive dramas. Of course the full half measure of evil will always obtain in human nature, alas; but that's what makes us interesting. I doubt it's going to be just more of the same.

True, China will certainly become more prominent, but I think Geography and Peak Everything will trump and we will end up with a kind of 1984 style scenario with a few major regional power blocs pushing against each other without ever really getting anywhere in terms of expansion. Perhaps with a tacit understanding between them to keep the 'war' going in order to cotnrol their respective domestic populations as Orwell may have been implying. <br><br>The obvious immediate target for Chinese regional dominance is of course Japan, who I think are pretty much owned by China already and not to mention Taiwan of course. But my view is that it would take decades for China to create the size of military that would be able to enforce a global presence and by that time it will no longer be possible in terms of resources. <br><br>It's clear that those large scale economic unions are beginning to break down. The EU has already begun collapse and the US will surely follow, first economically then actually at some point. Here in the UK, it already looks likely that Scotland will break away from the Union which will certainly have economic consequences as well as social ones. <br><br>I do have concern about those countries in the 'backyard' of the major powers however, who will become greater targets as the ability to wage war overseas diminishes.<br><br><a href=#c2445009169957116098 title="comment permalink">11/10/12, 2:41 PM</a><br><br>

Switch Bridgeport for Gurney, however, and the story writes itself.<br><br>I think this is perhaps the nub of the important difference between presidential candidates. It's the perception of "character." Though I hate to say that -- I've always considered the "character" argument to be a rationalization for "He has good hair."<br><br>This suggests a potential way to evaluate presidential candidates for the next few election cycles. It isn't a question of who promises what, or who keeps those promises, or one ideology or another.<br><br>The question should be, who can make an unorthodox decision when the time comes?

There are some evolutionary predilections - kin-based bias, correlation confused as causation, etc. I lean toward socially contingent. Diamond, Godesky and others have their views. Anthropology is an important discipline in this area. Eventually, there will no longer be enough resource stores left to support further expansion rendering the concern moot. Nevertheless, the choices many in this species have made (notably agriculture) have led to a serious deterioration of the planet.

He'll come of age in a nation and a civilization that's clearly in decline, and that condition will thus seem natural and normal for him. That alone will spare him quite a bit of the trauma that your generation and mine will have to pass through. <br><br>Renaissance, that's certainly a useful approach to the question -- as I'd expect, coming from Wendell Berry. <br><br>Pictures, links are fine. Have you read the comments to that article, by the way? The sheer volume of bluster and swagger from American readers is dizzying. <br><br>Susan, in this week's post, I said, "The notion that the present epoch is utterly unique in history, popular as that is, fails to convince me, and the habit of using that notion as an excuse to project an assortment of utopian and apocalyptic fantasies on the inkblot patterns of the future strikes me as frankly delusional." Did you read that? You probably should have, because I was talking about you. <br><br>No, not you personally, and not you alone, but the sort of future fantasy you've proposed here. Like so many people nowadays, you've bought into the mistaken notion that the word "evolution" means that whatever you don't like about the world (e.g., war) is going to go away sooner or later. I'd encourage you to read a few books about evolution by Stephen Jay Gould, or someone else who knows what the word means. Evolution is not progress, and progress is not a law of nature; it's simply an ideology used by people in the modern industrial world to one-up the rest of our species. <br><br>You might also want to look up, by the way, how many times in the last few centuries people have insisted that humanity was about to "outgrow" war. (It's a very large number.) This generally happens in the run-up to a very big war -- for example, there was a lot of that rhetoric in the US in the decades leading up to the Civil War, and even more of it in Europe in the decades right before 1914. If the prevalence of future fantasies like yours is any guide, therefore, my choice of a military framework for my narrative is likely to be right on target. <br><br>Doctor W., thank you! Definitely grist for the mill. <br><br>Orwellian, I'd remind you that Spain and Britain both built world empires at a time when high tech transportation consisted of wooden sailing ships. We have a long way to decline before that technology becomes unavailable again!<br><br>Joseph, you get tonight's gold star for a good historical comparison. This is why, as I've tried to point out, I'm not suggesting that every presidential contest is a competition between interchangeable figures -- just that this most recent one was. <br><br>Brwalse, "enough for everyone" was only true, at any point in history or prehistory, for a very low value of "everyone." That said, I wouldn't worry too much about human nature in the abstract, since nobody can demonstrate what it is or isn't.<br><br><a href=#c5359466560642893513 title="comment permalink">11/10/12, 6:10 PM</a><br><br>

I'll have to see if I can do some of the ones I wish later, but for the moment, just one point:<br><br>Knowing which countries will be future hegemons (or strong regional powers) is probably more difficult then simply looking at rising powers today and extrapolating them to the future. A lot of local situations need to be examined, and also their interplay with one another. I'll talk about the case with Brazil, which I know best.<br><br>Brazil has some very good advantages. It is largely self-sufficient in food production, it has most of the resources needed to maintain viable industry in the near future and it doesn't face any serious population crisis in the near future. Due to a lack of local coal and abudant rivers, about two thirds of our energy production is from water dams, and while this means that the country faces some hard constraints to expand it's energy production, it is also in a very good position to maintain it's current level of production for the next several decades without too many problems, which might end up being VERY important if most of the world will be facing decline.<br><br>It also has a surprising amount of "soft power" and I would expect this to increase. Unlike most of today's big powers, or the projected future ones, brazilians are widely regarded as "harmless" or even a force for good in the world stage, or so I gather from the reception that brazilians usually get overseas.<br><br>OTOH, we suffer from a massive case of clay feet. There's a lack of investing capital (which atm is usually compesated by influx of external capital). The education level of the population is very low and the reform of the educational system has been very difficult. There's also a lot of problems with bureacracy and the political side of things, etc. These could be solved, granted, and also it is possible to become a regional power even with some of these problems. But there is one big issue that most people outside of here (and even most that live here) have no clue about: Brazil has almost no military to speak of.<br><br>Oh, granted, we have a semi-decent land army, with some very good units here and there (some of our "jungle infantry" is scary, specially the batallions that recruit heavily into the remaining indigenous population), but the country has no means of projecting power. The airforce is a joke. Even smallish european countries have far more efficient air-forces. We currently operate about 100 jet figthers, mostly very obsolete F-5E's (that's right), with UNGUIDED rockets and cannon as main armament. The Navy has recently sunk most of it's budget buying an old french carrier and has been toying with it, but the sheer expense of maintaing the thing means we don't even have the money to replace our current aging frigates, much less getting anything useful like, let's say, a fleet of modern diesel subs. We also have a pathetic logistic arm, which is what it's truly needed to sustain projection of power.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c1208620486439725638 title="comment permalink">11/10/12, 8:01 PM</a><br><br>

There's a lot of talk about BECOMING a regional power, even hot air about a permanent chair at the UN security council, but no one actually wants to pay for the military means to do it. Partially, that's because south america is an unusually calm part of the world, if you don't count civil wars or insurections and coups. The last major armed conflit predates the US Civil War, and since then none of the countries has been involved in any major wars (aside from Argentina and the Falklands). Brazil is also so much bigger and richer then it's spanish-speaking neighboors that it has never needed to invest in a military force. The continent has been historically under the influence (and the business end of the wealth pump) of the leading Atlantic power. First, the iberian nations that colonized it, then Britain, and lastly the US. <br><br>The current situation, in which we are finally getting away from this situation, is totally new, and I fear that it won't last. Brazil COULD end up a regional power, if it managed to secure both shores of the south atlantic, become the major trading partner of the rest of the south american countries and exert convincing military power to cast an umbrella into the region and prevent an outside power from muscling in. Pòssibly forming some sort of NATO/Warsaw Pact with the other south american counties. I just don't think it will.<br><br>More likely, we will either end up being back under the thumb of a local atlantic hegemon (my money would be this being the rump USA-UK coalition once it is kicked out of the indian and pacific oceans, or else a german-led europe), or at best playing a regional power in the north atlantic against China for advantage, which has the downside of making us a possible ground for proxy wars. <br><br>I can see similar issues with some of the other supposed powers, so my money is actually in a very multipolar world where the main players are a german-led EU, Russia, China and whatever remains of the USA-UK.

If you think women can't wage war, I'd suggest having a chat with Condoleeza Rice, Hillary Clinton, and the ghosts of Margaret Thatcher and Elizabeth I. Or some of the women soldiers in the Abu Grab photos, for that matter. Been no shortage of female suicide bombers in the last decade either.

US defence spending is 3.5% of GDP, down from 4.7% in 2011."<br><br>and<br><br>"US officials and former officials, speaking on a background basis, have said they suspect Australia is taking advantage of the US Marine deployment to Darwin (Northern Australia) to reduce its spending."<br><br>and<br><br>"They have said that, with the new level of assurance of US military commitment, Australia is "freeloading" on the American taxpayer."<br><br>I could be wrong, but I never understood that the 2,500 troops in Darwin were a choice thing. There was also talk recently about setting up a US naval base in Perth (Southern Western Australia) recently, although I reckon US budget cuts finished that idea off. The government here was a bit miffed because the US powers that be forgot to check with the government here first before the announcement!<br><br>By the way, did the Citizens United decision actually make any difference to the election outcome at all? It would be a fascinating PhD thesis only because the volumes of money spent on campaigning were huge! Seems to me like a case of conspicuous consumption rather than a useful investment of resources.<br><br>PS: The Africa setting in the story was a great idea, because after Australia, Africa has the highest grade accessible ore deposits left on the planet. There is quite a lot of iron ore about the planet (including in China itself), but it is of very low quality which makes it very expensive and energy intensive to turn into steel.

While I agree with your reading of the common present ideology of “human progress”, it seems to me that the way the term 'evolution' is popularly used (here by Susan) confuses genetic / heritable evolution with evolving cultural forms. This was a discussion I remember in my youth, led by Julian Huxley (brother and descendent of other famous Huxleys who knew about 'evolution of the species). J. Huxley's book "Old wine in new bottles" attempted the distinction, and I see via google, influenced UNESCO among others. <br><br>The ‘thought’ experiment that transports a Palaeolithic infant for adoption in say, present Cumberland USA, would see two decades later a well-adjusted young American. Vice versa would work just as well, though the result would not be American.<br><br>Human history has recently filled up the path-dependent event-space provided by organised access to fossil fuels with complex toys and tools - and some extraordinary insights into both Nature and Human History (including an Arch Druid's archive: thank you!).<br><br>The sorrow when periods of hope and achieved tranquillity pass, is painful to contemplate, in the past as now. I think of early Christian Ireland, never part of the Roman Empire, but relatively culturally benign, especially with the Christian interpretation of fate and the world. (Try the ‘beehive’ hermitages on ‘The Skerries’). The later Viking raiding and partial occupation, however, milked Ireland and parts of coastal Britain for that most valuable and tradable commodity, slaves. I learned recently these went via the Viking trading routes into Asia etc., on a scale comparable with Africans hauled later to the New World. Much that was beautiful in human minds and relationships perished painfully. The 20thC equally provides some examples of the horrors of the collapse of what appear our best values.

My favorite manual is Clyde Clason's <i>Delights of the Slide Rule</i>, which I was able to get fairly cheap via the used book market. <br><br>Avery, exactly. There's also a large and active secession movement in Vermont, so it comes from both ends of the spectrum. <br><br>Guilherme, you've just described the military condition of the United States in 1880: a small army mostly used to patrolling frontier regions, all other military branches laughably obsolete, and no interest anywhere in changing that fact. Twenty years later the US was a major world power. Brazil has a large and competent weapons industry, and Embraer makes very good planes; all it would take is the same sort of shift in the political climate that launched the US on its trajectory to global power, and Brazil could quickly follow the same track. Will it? Heck of a good question. <br><br>Rabtter, of course not. It's not primarily a health care plan, after all -- it's an indirect Federal subsidy to the already bloated medical and pharmaceutical industries, meant to force people who can't afford health insurance to buy it anyway. The House won't touch it because they want their corporate, er, donations. <br><br>Cherokee, fascinating. As for Africa, it's the last really rich source of a lot of resources, and can expect to be the pivot of a lot of bare-knuckle politics in the years to come. <br><br>5keptical, I don't expect to see slavery as such, outside of a few trades such as forced prostitution, for a good long time. Why bother with coercion, when anybody who can provide three square meals a day and a few other basic necessities will have people frantically lining up to work? Slavery as an institution only becomes viable when there's a labor shortage, and for the next century or two, until population levels finish dropping, the world is going to have an immense labor surplus. <br><br>Phil, Susan's definition of "evolution" confuses much more than the biological and sociological spheres; it also imports a not very well hidden teleology into a nonteleological phenomenon. I'd point out that neither biological evolution nor its social quasi-equivalent move in any predetermined direction or toward any predetermined goal. <br><br>5keptical, no, you've misread my statement. Not evolution, but "progress," is the ideology that's used by people in the industrial world to put down everyone else. Central to the ideology of progress is the notion that it moves in a single direction, i.e., toward us, and then through us to a future that will be like us, but even more so; that's why you hear contemporary hunter-gatherers being dismissed as "still in the Stone Age" and, say, Muslims as "still in the Middle Ages" -- the underlying fantasy is that all human societies can be put on a single linear scale that leads to today's industrial societies and beyond them, into whatever Utopian fantasy the speaker happens to be retailing at that moment.<br><br><a href=#c2192803407240613984 title="comment permalink">11/11/12, 4:24 AM</a><br><br>

The core issue driving it was not labor shortage, but labor surplus -- not enough work to go around.<br><br>As industrial society breaks down, the machine culture will die with it -- the first casualty will be repair parts for the machinery, I think, rather than oil/power. Yet the machines <i>must</i> keep working to sustain the high standard of living and the illusion of progress for the clueless upper class. Obvious solution: replace machinery with cheap human labor. Obvious problem: getting people to work cheaply enough.<br><br>It takes time for a culture of starvation and desperation to take hold, and the loss of machinery will be, I think, pretty sudden once the supply chain for parts starts to unravel -- meaning a brief interim period with a lot of formerly-privileged people out of work, and the standard-of-living plummeting. The obvious outcome of that is civil unrest.<br><br>In the story, this comes during another consumer debt bubble, far bigger than the one in 2007. That we'll have such bubbles seems almost certain, given that the only asset that can continue to provide exponential ROI even now is extending credit to the masses. So as our machine culture crashes, and with it most of the make-work jobs that most people do, debt-default goes through the roof: people simply stop paying their mortgages and credit-card bills. This (again) threatens banking collapse, but direct "government bailouts" have fallen out-of-favor.<br><br>The solution in the story is to rescind bankruptcy protection laws, and replace them with felonization of "excessive" debt. It works like this: the government steps in to pay off the debt, seizes and liquidates the felon's assets to partially recover costs, and the felon then serves a labor-sentence to pay back any remaining debt (plus interest, of course) at a fixed "wage." <br><br>The abuses in this system pretty much write themselves. <br><br>There are lots of historical precedents for pieces of this, ranging from government labor in the CCC and WPA in the 1930's, forced-labor camps in the Soviet Union and (of course) Germany, debtors' prisons in England, indentured servitude in the American colonies, the seizure of assets in the American witch trials and in earlier inquisitions in Europe. The "morality" of this fits very nicely with the current Republican/Libertarian ideas of Randian individualism and social Darwinism. I'd be curious if your more extensive reading has turned up actual examples of anything like this in history.<br><br>Dystopic as this is, it's definitely a short-term transition. You can view it generically as a way to effectively eliminate much of the population without the politically painful step of shooting them all, and without immediately giving up the perqs to which the well-off have become accustomed. This situation will be followed shortly by a rapid drop in actual population, and then the system will fall apart.<br><br><a href=#c2344190575085753687 title="comment permalink">11/11/12, 10:37 AM</a><br><br>

That's basically why I said I could see a little brazilian imperialism in the south atlantic, I just doubted it.

If the US is knocked down seriously enough so it can't even rule the atlantic anymore, and Europe doesn't step in ASAP, there's going to be a lot of chaos and probably enough time for us to go into a crash-program of military build up and seize whatever we can get our hands on before someone else comes sniffing for valuable stuff in the region.<br><br>Frankly, I don't know if I would be happy about that.

The historical pattern may hold, but it may not, and I think it's probably too early to tell how it's going to play out.<br><br>The basis of my argument is simple. The function of technology, as it has been applied thus far, has been to push back the natural limits that would otherwise constrain our numbers and activities. (This leads to the myth of progress, as people believe that these limits have in fact been overcome; in reality, they have simply been pushed into the temporal and geographic distance.) In other words, technology enables overshoot. Nothing new there.<br><br>My assertion is that the dynamics of collapse are going to be very much a function of <i>how far</i> in overshoot we are when we hit various ecological and logistical limits. If you're thrown into the ocean and told to swim, it makes a big difference whether you are 1 mile from shore, or 10, or 100.<br><br>The punctuated, stairstep collapse model that you seem to favor is certainly one way for this to play out: We hit a limit, the system contracts, pain is experienced, and our level of overshoot decreases a bit (i.e. we move "closer to shore").<br><br>The thing that worries me is that both society in general and our elites are in such deep denial about the situation, that we are (at the moment, at least) committed to doing everything we can to ignore and mask the effects of the collapse limits. This means that, rather than responding to limits by contracting, we push harder on the ecological limits - putting ourselves further into overshoot. <br>You can see this happening now in the oil and gas industry: fracking, "enhanced recovery", oil sands and efforts to develop kerogen shales, are all examples of this denial mechanism at work.<br><br>It is entirely plausible that we will continue this trend until, for example, we're making all our gasoline out of coal. (The EROEI sucks, but it's high enough to keep things ticking over, as long as the majority of the population believes that "it's the only way".) It's also plausible that people will at some point rebel, say "enough", and start dealing with the reality of fossil energy decline before we actually dig up all the coal.<br><br>To me, these look like qualitatively different collapse scenarios. In one case, you've got a difficult but manageably semi-hard landing. In the other case, you've got a society that is so overextended that it's got nothing to fall back on.<br><br>There's a range of severity here: does collapse look like the British Empire, the Roman Empire, or Easter Island? I'd say that we could wind up landing anywhere along that spectrum, depending on the decisions we make in the next ~2 decades. And I would argue that an Eastern Island-style collapse should be seen as qualitatively different from a British Empire-style collapse.<br><br><a href=#c4566181480009083216 title="comment permalink">11/11/12, 4:49 PM</a><br><br>

Right now, you may something with the word "evolve" in it and a lot of people will drive all sorts of conclusions that have nothing to do with the word as you MEANT to be used, because "evolution" and "evolved" are concepts that, as you rightly pointed out, have acquired a popular meaning that's quite different then the original, biological term.<br><br>This doesn't just goes for the kind of terms that are misused by the dominant worldview of progress, too.

I would add that good metal shafts, bearing and gearing, some building methods, refrigeration (for food, not air-con, of course) and many others are too.

The end of the American empire is not the end of industrial civilization. What I've been talking about for most of this year is the former, not the latter, and the processes involved are emphatically not the same. <br><br>It happens now and again that the fall of an empire is also the fall of a civilization -- Rome's the obvious example -- but that's far from normal; more than a dozen previous empires rose and fell in what became the Roman world before the civilization of the classical Mediterranean went down. In the same way, there have been quite a few empires of various sizes since the first stirrings of industrial society, and America's is simply one of those; to my way of thinking, it's not likely to be the last, though we don't have that many more before industrial society comes apart. <br><br>If I had to suggest my idea of a close historical comparison, it would be the situation in, say, Tikal on the brink of what archeologists call the Terminal Classic period of Mayan civilization. Tikal was one of the great powers of the Mayan world, and it underwent an imperial decline and fall; meanwhile the entire Mayan civilization was also running headlong into a crisis with close parallels to ours. Tikal could fall without ending the Mayan civilization -- Copal or Palenque could just as well have replaced it -- and the historical processes that ended Tikal's ascendancy were not the same as those which, not long thereafter, ended Mayan civilization as a whole. Does that clarify things a little? <br><br>Guilherme, that's very good to hear. You're right about gearing -- the specific form of gears invented by medieval clockmakers turned out to have possibilities that the older Greco-Roman version did not, and preserving that technology would be a major gift to the future.<br><br><a href=#c3081798250195720166 title="comment permalink">11/11/12, 9:36 PM</a><br><br>

Agree there's a teleological implication in my use of the word "evolution" as regards societal consciousness; but the outcome is not specifically predetermined, only going towards a general broadening of horizons. Thomas Kuhn covers this in "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions." Once a genie is out of a bottle, hard to get it back in. Although we can forget a social inheritance, like Roman technology was forgotten. But the consciousness, the Greco-Roman-Judaic mind-set of authoritarian dominance stayed. Yes, occasionally privileged women engaged in war, participating in the general dominance/submission cultural ethos. I think we can grow out of that impulse. Agree the idea of "progress" can be delusional and manipulated. See Ken Wilber on "the paradox of progress," whereby hard-won spiritual "enlightenment" only leads to more sophisticated forms of evil. Still what makes us unique is our ability to learn. We accumulate knowledge over many generations; and frames of reference change. Humans can transcend biology --this is what frees women from perpetual child-rearing.

My understanding is that the former is the theory that some of the Earth’s landforms were shaped through major catastrophes. The latter, on the other hand, is the theory that the same gradual processes that are at work today have shaped this planet’s landforms and that catastrophes played no role. Uniformitarianism was the dominant idea in the natural sciences until evidence of major catastrophes like the meteor that drove the dinosaurs into extinction was discovered. This evidence gave rise to the "New Catastrophism" which looks like an amalgamation between catastrophism and uniformitarianism i.e. the idea that landforms were shaped both by gradual processes and, in some cases, major catastrophes.<br><br>If you want to transpose the thinking underpinning the natural sciences onto history then I assume you would have to think in terms of the New Catastrophism. Is this correct? If that is the case then history should be understood primarily in terms of processes that are common across different periods but at the same time “major catastrophes” need to be taken into account. A broader interpretation leads me to conclude that this would mean historical periods can be understood in terms of common factors but the possibility that certain periods also have additional factors that are distinct and idiosyncratic in significant ways cannot be ruled out. Hence, if one wants to think in terms of the natural sciences and the New Catastrophism it is entirely possible for a given historical period (and the collapse of the civilisation defining that period) to give rise to something unprecedented. Does this thinking not support arguments that industrial civilisation might be different from all past civilisations in some (not all and not most) respects making it precarious to extrapolate from past historical periods when making predictions about the future without also considering what is qualitatively distinct about the current period?<br><br><a href=#c2991541013162474329 title="comment permalink">11/12/12, 2:45 AM</a><br><br>

You can take any exponential curve, adjust the scale, and lay the expanded (or contracted) curve directly on top of the old one. They are qualitatively identical at any point in the curve. What changes -- and it's a dramatic change -- is when the incremental change reaches the "scale of importance."<br><br>Martenson uses the example of filling a baseball stadium with water, starting with one drop on the pitcher's mound, then two, then four, then eight. The geometric progression never changes, only the scale of it. What makes the dramatic difference to us -- as humans, who exist on the "you are here" scale of gallons, not micromilliliters or cubic miles -- is when the scale gets large enough that the incremental changes are noticeable. As Martenson correctly points out, once the incremental changes become noticeable, your goose is already well and truly cooked.<br><br>What's happening now is that the scale of exponential (human) population growth has become noticeable at the global level -- as has the scale of resource depletion, carbon emissions, etc. <br><br>Apart from the overshoot question, which is separate, there is a qualitative dividing line that occurs when incremental change approaches the scale of importance. It applies to any scale-invariant process, but with continued exponential growth, you're guaranteed that the incremental changes will eventually reach the scale of importance.<br><br>We've reached certain qualitative dividing lines in the past in isolated communities -- island nations, the aforementioned Mayan territories, the Anasazi -- such as when population exceeded resources. We can draw analogies to the current situation, but it isn't exactly the same, because the scale of the incremental changes is vastly larger relative to the human scale. It's now become noticeable on the global scale, which was never true of the Anasazi or the Mayans.<br><br>In perhaps more evocative terms, the Mayans could pray for rain, but the matter was never in their hands.

The same thing is true of evolution, which is simply adaptation to changing circumstances; some organisms evolve in ways that expand their possibilities, some evolve in ways that specialize them and therefore narrow their possibilities. <br><br>A thorough response to the sort of thinking you've proposed here would require more than a comment -- in fact, more than a single post, and it may be worth developing into a series of posts down the road a bit. Just as an appetizer, I'd point out that alongside teleology -- the notion that evolution moves toward a specific end -- stands teleonomy -- the notion that evolution moves in a particular direction, and both are fundamentally flawed, in ways that can be shown relatively easily. <br><br>Here's an example. You've argued that war is "primitive" and "biological" and therefore can and will be outgrown. It would be at least as easy to argue that war is in fact <i>not</i> primitive, but a sign of evolutionary progress, and therefore further evolution will make us more warlike, not less. After all, most animals do not engage in war, that is, in organized intraspecific violence; the few that do, such as chimpanzees, are at the upper end of animal social complexity. Among humans, war becomes more pervasive and complex as societies develop in complexity and richness, and technological development leads to increasing investment in war. QED!<br><br>CGP, the great difference between the New Catastrophism and the old version is that the catastrophes being discussed now are not interventions of God; they're the workings of ordinary, natural phenomena, that on occasion yield spectacular results. The theory of catabolic collapse I've been proposing all along is closely parallel to the New Catastrophism; it argues that there are going to be a lot of relatively sudden discontinuities as we proceed, but that an understanding of the past remains a key resource for understanding the future. <br><br>Phil, interesting. Thanks for the resource. <br><br>Susan, you're welcome. <br><br>John, I saw that!<br><br>Bill, I'd suggest rather that <i>recent</i> history shows a trend of increasing civil rights. Go back more than a few centuries and that trend vanishes. Before then, as far as I can see, things tended to cycle between something like feudalism -- where everyone has legally defined rights, but there is no equality -- and something like centralized autocracy -- where equality is common, but nobody has any rights that can be enforced against the holders of absolute power.<br><br><a href=#c2357245039593715203 title="comment permalink">11/12/12, 12:32 PM</a><br><br>

He says such "progress," by for example meditation adepts, is paradoxical because they only develop more sophisticated forms of evil, deceit, hatred and the like; they don't transcend or rise above it, as they expect. This leads me to the idea that cultural evolution (and biological too --we are more than an amoeba) is an amoral teleology, leading not to better things but merely to higher and higher levels of organization, a tendency which is the opposite of entropy. Life and entropy are in dynamic equilibrium. Neither can permanently trump the other, or we wouldn't be here. Nor will we be here forever. My point about the strange need to suppress half the human race is not about individual gender biology --technology can make that pretty much irrelevant. The point is about what I see as a species-wide pathology. Once the weird need to dominate women fades, as the species gains maturity (which is not "better" as an an adult is not "better" than a child), so will the imperative for the dominance/submission meme in general fade, which is the basis for war.

Plus, of course, the "fade away" scenario in which the central government gradually loses its ability to provide services or enforce laws, and ceases to make much difference even if it still exists. All are very different things.

I can't think of a figure whose work has been more over-cited, under-read, and thereby placed all out of context. Kuhn's work is one voice in a very interesting field, and he surely meant for it to be understood within that community of fellow historian-philosophers of science.<br><br>Fwiw, Susan is right about Kuhn saying that science tends toward broader horizons, though wrong in her application of that. He meant that to be one of the proper qualities of scientific thought and theory *within* a research paradigm, not a general property of society (definitely not of an individual's cognitive process, yeesh!). <br><br>I.e., a scientific paradigm achieves its paradigmatic status by extending its predictions ever more broadly, finding more and more phenomena to which they apply. <br><br>It's worth emphasizing: a paradigm doesn't evolve, it develops and improves in reference to a set of concerns contained in its research agenda. The crisis of a paradigm is the crisis of a *research agenda*, not necessarily the crisis of its results. <br><br>i.e., ptolemaic astronomy's predictions about well-studied bodies like planets and constellations often held up just fine (sometimes even better than early Galilean astronomy's rival models), just as Newton's physics still gets applied every day in the modern world despite having no real influence on, say, quantum physicists' research agendas. <br><br>The crisis is that the models fail to predict *new* phenomena that interest researchers. If what you deal with isn't deeply bound up with those new phenomena, 'old' paradigms will often serve you just fine (and sometimes even better than 'new' paradigms).<br><br>I know, these are fine distinctions, but I think they're important. A less fine distinction misrepresents what is going with Kuhn's work and contributes to the general misunderstanding of his work and field.<br><br><a href=#c6532575665270273359 title="comment permalink">11/13/12, 9:35 AM</a><br><br>

Thus China's GDP economic growth is believed to have been 10% per year for the last decade or more. That has meant it has doubled in the recent 7 years (10 x 7 =70). Even if growth is now dropped to 7% per year, GDP would be due to double again by the time of the change in leadership 10 years from now. I understand the 1400M population now has an economy about the size of the 400M EU. However, it seems very unlikely to me that we will actually see double the present Chinese economy. Resource implications will be approaching twice what we have seen this last 10 years. <br><br>On the other hand, China saw the exponential population problem decades ago and reduced the fertility rate to below the replacement rate.

There is no teleology in evolution, moral or otherwise; some organisms move toward higher levels of organization as they evolve, others head the other direction.

Current rural infrastructure (deteriorating) makes it extremely difficult to support a year-round workforce to harvests that require hand-picking (fruit crops, for instance). This year, despite a bumper crop of apples, Eastern WA state farmers couldn't get enough workers, even though they were willing to pay upwards of $800 per week. Time was, rural towns were well populated to have part time workers in the form of teens and college students, but no more. Migrant workers aren't even as available, and ads for seasonal jobs are largely not allowed in unemployment offices.<br><br>One solution suggested by the urban areas is that prison labor can be used, rather than help make rural areas more sustainable year-round. Many in cities see this as a solution to their ever-increasing prison population. Let's say that the rural folks are not too thrilled with this, but their opinions generally don't count, as their numbers are shinking and thus they are outvoted by the urban folks who know much better about how agriculture should be run than those stupid hicks anyway, right? &lt;--sarcasm<br><br>Which makes me think that the rural riots/rebellion you spoke of earlier may well have its form today in the Tea Partiers, whose demographic has a higher number of rural folks in it than any other political group.

What went on before 1650 or so wasn't a matter of people trying to practice modern science and failing; they were trying to do some things that were very different, with the same mix of success and failure you get in any human intellectual adventure. We don't value their achievements nowadays because, again, the paradigm has changed.<br><br><a href=#c3094837607671823423 title="comment permalink">11/13/12, 6:29 PM</a><br><br>

I will provide a link below to a video of a "progressive" online news program condemning the secessionists as being treasonous, traitorous and parasitic. The argument is that these people are disgruntled Republicans who would never think to demand secession under a Republican president. The host also talks about how much money these states get back from the federal government compared to what they contribute and deems most of these states "takers" as they receive a federal subsidy. The idea seems to be that if these states seceded they would end up worse off but the country as a whole would actually be better off. If you read some of the comments there are people (presumably "liberal" or "progressive") who say they would be happy to see these red states secede. John, if you watch the video please let us know what you think. <br><br>Stephen, I had a look at the video you posted. Ron Paul was arguing that secession is not treasonous and is rather an American constitutional principle. Interestingly, he also argues that it is when the dollar crashes and the federal government can no longer deliver that secession will really start to be seriously considered, consistent with John's fictional narrative. Regarding Ron Paul, he does have a following but he was never close to winning the Republican nomination. He is too far away from the establishment to have received the party support required to win. His ideas may become more palatable to the mainstream in the future though. Only time will tell.<br><br>PS: How do you embed links into a comment so they appear as blue hyperlinks with a description of your choice?<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRgFW7f_lyU&amp;list=UU1yBKRuGpC1tSM73A0ZjYjQ&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plcp <br><br><br><a href=#c7665551548603763810 title="comment permalink">11/13/12, 10:26 PM</a><br><br>

But there are some additional points regarding a post-America world and the fault lines here which I think I should mention just briefly.<br><br>The first is that one major aspect of American prosperity was caused not only by the post-WWII hegemony by the US, but also by the fact that WWII and the GI bill created a huge downward transfer of wealth, creating the modern Middle Class as we know it today. As traditionalist approaches to life and to the family have been eroded, more and more of family wealth has moved into paper forms, housing bubble prices and the like. I would suggest googling Elizabeth Warren's lecture "The Coming Collapse of the Middle Class." This is also true in the UK where medical costs have been better contained than they are here, but housing prices have picked up whatever those savings were.<br><br><br>Housing prices in the US are not sustainable and I think we are seeing a hidden deflation there. In the 8 years we have had our adjustable rate mortgage we have seen rates drop by about 30%. While most people probably welcome the extra money in their pockets, that scares me because it suggests that in terms of monthly housing payments, we are in outright deflation currently. People don't decide what they can afford as far as a sticker price on the house. They decide what they can pay monthly, and a steady drop in that rate since 2004 is an indication that we are merely masking deflation by dropping interest rates.<br><br>Our economy is teetering on the edge, and the Great Depression Jr that we have been going through is just the beginning. By the most important metric, namely supply vs demand, we are already past peak oil (we passed peak production vs demand in the early 1970's, and we passed peak reserves in 1982), and so we can look forward to continuing rises in energy prices, and continuing talk of recovery without a lot of benefit for the little guy.<br><br>I also don't think that most Americans have any clue as to how much our illusion of a rule of law, how much our complex system of government, etc. is propped up by the energy surplus.<br><br>Finally, brief question for JMG: Have you listened to Joseph Tainter speak or read his book "The Collapse of Complex Societies?" I would be interested in your thoughts on this.<br><br><a href=#c8373748097125603009 title="comment permalink">11/18/12, 4:25 PM</a><br><br>

In the last decade I become interested in the Peak Oil and Oil Crash subject, and more recently (four years ago) a group of colleagues and myself started to do outreach about the Peak Oil problem and the future related to it. We founded and association: the Oil Crash Observatory (oilcrash.net). I also started to write a blog in Catalan, focused in the local problems related to the Oil Crisis, to allow the people of my country be more aware of the real problem that we are facing. In all these years I read some of your books in the different subjects you write and I found all of them very interesting and inspiring. Now I'm writing you after reading your very interesting october posts about the possible collapse of US. Here, in Catalonia, we started a political movement of secessionism from Spain and, related to that, I wrote two posts on this subject concentrating in the energy crisis and the independentist growing phenomena in Catalonia (http://despres-de-tot.blogspot.com.es/2012/10/independencia-i-collapse.html and http://despres-de-tot.blogspot.com.es/2012/11/bau-independencia-i-collapse.html ). My main hypotheses is that this new movement is caused mainly by two reasons that, together, group a lot of people: economy and national feeling, which curiosly, you give as a possible causes for the secession of southern states in US.<br>Then, after thinking about the coincidences of the movement I explained before and your posts, I was wondering if you feel that I can republish your october posts (translated to catalan and rigorously acknowledged and referenced) in my blog: http://despres-de-tot.blogspot.com.es. I think that your posts are extremely interesting, but here (in Catalonia and Spain) most part of the people have problems to understand english. Because of such tongue limitations I hope that translating your recent posts will help a little to give more visibility in my country to the precious work that you are doing. Thank you for your attention.<br>Sincerely yours,<br>Jordi Solé<br><br><a href=#c8983323945717672815 title="comment permalink">11/26/12, 6:14 AM</a><br><br>

It simply takes more energy to run a free political system than it does to run a despotic one.<br><br>As energy gets harder and harder to obtain, this is what the Elites will do to maintain power:<br><br>1. They will use debt to enslave the masses. It's tried and true- this was how the denizens of the Roman Empire went from Citizens of Rome to feudal medieval serfs.<br><br>2. They will use technology. Microprocessor technology takes less energy than almost any other industrial sector, to manufacture and to maintain. Sure, some heavy industry must be maintained to make computer stuff, but not all that much. Take sulfuric acid. China is the big producer today, and the US is way down the list. We don't have to.<br><br>Anyway, tracking and control, key aspects of the burgeoning totalitarian state, will be buttressed with microprocessor technology, even as the rest of the industrial machine grinds to a halt.<br><br>3. Straight up totalitarian central command and control of the economy. Did I mention we will all be slaves? Did I mention that slavery will be maintained by a surveillance and control grid that will tell you how much you can eat, where you can live, Whether or not you can travel, etc, etc.<br><br>It's already in place. It just doesn't have to be put into lockdown mode yet. <br><br>Of course, all this is mere prelude to the ultimate collapse- such a fascist system obviously can't last forever. But I suspect it can last long enough. <br><br>Now's the time to dust off those spiritual resistance skills, and start to create an attitude of welcoming the challenges of whatever form of misrule comes our way.<br><br>Thanks for getting the thoughts out there!

The masses of people are already getting higher mortality from the bad food and all kinds of pollution. He's correct in saying a lot of the systems are already in place --things like employee drug testing, zoning laws, and passports. Legislation is all that's needed to turn these type of things into a police state. They already want to spy on drivers with a black box in all new cars and trucks recording speed, times of use, mileage, seat belt use, your radio choices, where you go, that type of thing. A nice tool for more than just driver safety, as advertised. Yes, get ready to accept the necessity of resistance, as least inwardly. Maybe won't be as fun as conscientious objection, and making the "revolution" was back in the day. Heh, heh. But some kind of revolution is inevitable because of changing conditions on earth. The internet allows radical, low energy democracy. Think Arab Spring. Check out BetterMeans.org.
