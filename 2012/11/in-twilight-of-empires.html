<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week’s post on the logic of nuclear deterrence in an age of decline got what was, all things considered, a much less irrational response than discussions of nuclear war generally field.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’m not sure whether or not that counts as evidence for my theory that we’ve all somehow slipped into an alternate reality, the kind of eerie parallel universe where right-wing shock jocks quote archdruids approvingly and delusional claims about limitless shale oil get critiqued in the media.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, it’s emboldened me to go on to the second of the hot button topics I have in mind—perhaps the hottest of hot button topics these days, in fact, one that routinely attracts top-of-the-lungs bellowing from both ends of a hopelessly polarized debate. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yes, it’s time to talk about Israel. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By this I don’t mean that we need to go through yet another round of who-did-what-to-whom rhetoric in the shrill tones of moral absolutism that pervade the subject these days. There’s a point to discussing ethical issues surrounding the origins, conduct, and future of the nation-state of Israel, to be sure, but that discussion is already happening elsewhere, or more precisely would be happening if most of the potential participants weren’t too busy shouting past each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What gets misplaced in all the noise, though, is that this is not the only discussion worth having.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In particular, the central theme of this series of posts—the decline and fall of America’s global empire—has aspects that are easiest to see from the perspective of one of America’s more vulnerable client states.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those aspects are not particularly moral in nature, and the stridently self-righteous arguments that fill most current discussions of Israel’s fate have nothing to contribute here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For the moment, then, I’d like to set aside squabbles about whether the nation-state of Israel as currently constituted
<i>should</i> survive, and ask instead whether, in the post-American world of the not too distant future, it <i>can</i>
survive. That’s a much simpler question, and the answer is equally simple:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>no. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To explain that answer, I’d like to tell a story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once upon a time—isn’t that how stories are supposed to begin?—there was a group of people who believed that their god had promised them a particular corner of the Middle East, and decided to take him up on the offer. It so happened that conditions just then were propitious for their project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The cultural politics of the major Western powers of the time favored it, and not merely in an abstract sense:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>money and weapons could be had for the attempt, and a great deal more could be made available if the project succeeded in establishing a foothold. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even more crucial was the state of the Middle East at that time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The history of that region has a regular rhythm of systole and diastole that can be traced back very nearly to the earliest clay-tablet records: periods of centralization, in which a single major Middle Eastern power dominates as large a fraction of the world as the current transport technology will allow, alternate with periods of disintegration, in which the region fragments and turns into a chessboard on which powers from outside the region play their own power games.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At the time we’re discussing, the Middle East was in one of its diastole phases, fractured into small quarrelling states, and the sudden seizure of a strategically important part of the region drew only a local and ineffective response. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So a new state came into being, surrounded by hostile neighbors, and a great deal of the shrill self-justifying rhetoric already described came from both sides of the new frontiers. Several of the major Western powers supported the new state with significant financial and military aid; of at least equal importance, members of the religious community responsible for creating the new state, who remained back in those same Western nations, engaged in vigorous fundraising efforts to support the new state, and equally vigorous political efforts to get existing governmental support maintained or increased. The resources thus made available to the new state gave it a substantial military edge against its hostile neighbors, and its existence became enough of a fait accompli that some of its neighbors backed away from a wholly confrontational stance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, the state’s survival depended on three things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first, and by far the most crucial, was the ongoing flow of support from the Western powers to pay for a military establishment far larger than the economic and natural resources of the territory in question would permit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The second was the continued fragmentation and relative weakness of the surrounding states.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The third was the maintenance of internal peace within the state and of collective assent to a clear sense of priorities, so that it could respond with its full force to threats from outside instead of squandering its limited resources on civil strife or popular projects that contributed nothing to its survival. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the long run, none of these three conditions could be met indefinitely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Shifts in cultural politics and, more importantly, in the economic stability of the Western powers of the time turned the large subsidies supporting the state into a political liability that eventually lost out in the struggle for available wealth. Meanwhile, in the Middle East, the power struggles between competing statelets began to give way to a new era of centralization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Finally, the internal cohesion of the state broke down in power struggles between different factions, and too many resources had been committed to politically necessary but practically useless projects such as the support of large religious communities that did nothing but pray and study the scriptures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The arrogant certainty that the state could always overcome its enemies and that the Western powers owed it the subsidies that paid for its survival put bitter icing on an already overbaked cake, and all but guaranteed the final disaster. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And that, dear reader, was why the Crusader kingdom of Jerusalem fell to the armies of Saladin in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>1187, and why the last scraps of the kingdoms of Outremer, as the Crusaders called the land now known as Israel, were mopped up by Muslim armies over the century that followed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now I’m quite aware that comparing the current state of Israel to the Crusader states of Outremer is waving a red flag at some already overexcited bulls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Any of my readers who are ready to leap up and insist that Israel either can or can’t be compared to the Crusaders on moral grounds are encouraged to stop, and remember that that’s not what we’re talking about. The relative moral standing of Crusaders and Israelis is irrelevant to the issues this post is trying to discuss; what’s relevant is that, in the purely pragmatic realms of politics and war, there are a great many parallels between the two examples. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To begin with, Israel, as Outremer did in its time, depends for its survival on very large subsidies from the major Western powers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the case of Israel, those mostly come from the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The US government spends many billions of dollars a year on direct and indirect aid to Israel, while America’s large and relatively wealthy Jewish community—which comprises the largest number of Jews in any single nation on Earth—engages in a great deal of fundraising for Israel on its own behalf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many synagogues and other Jewish community instititions in America serve just as effectively to channel resources to Israel as, say, the European properties and chapter houses of the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller did to keep wealth and weapons flowing to the kingdoms of Outremer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Without that aid, governmental and private, the large and well-equipped Israeli military would be far too great a burden on the economy of what is, after all, a very small and resource-poor country, and the balance of power in the region would shift dramatically to Israel’s disadvantage. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Equally, the continued fragmentation of the Middle East is a crucial factor in Israel’s survival. The last two centuries or so have seen the long rhythm of Middle Eastern history enter a diastole period, splintering the once-powerful Ottoman Empire into more than two dozen small, quarrelsome, and vulnerable nations that were generally unable to counter incursions from Europe and America. To a real extent, the current condition of the Middle East is one of waiting for the next Saladin, with Iran, Turkey, or a future Islamic Republic of Arabia likely contenders for the center around which the next Middle Eastern superstate will coalesce. Of course it’s a core principle of Israeli diplomacy and military strategy to prevent the emergence of a single center of power capable of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>mobilizing any large fraction of the resources of the Arab world; still, it bears remembering that this was an equally central principle of the strategy of Outremer, and the Crusaders’ efforts in this direction eventually failed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I don’t propose to pass judgment on the current state of Israeli politics and culture, even to the extent of deciding whether current trends toward political factionalism and the support of Orthodox communities at state expense do or don’t mirror the vicious political infighting of the Kingdom of Jerusalem’s final decades and the economic burden of Christian monasteries and nunneries that played so large a role in weakening Outremer. The crucial point just now, it seems to me, is Israel’s dependence on a constant inflow of funds from the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If that goes away, the military balance of power shifts irrevocably, and so does the Israeli government’s capacity to afford the unproductive but politically necessary payoffs that maintain such social cohesion as there is; these shifts, in turn, promise an outcome as unwelcome to Israel, at least as currently constituted, as the equivalent was to Outremer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the central consequences of the trajectory of imperial decline we’ve been discussing over the course of the past year, in turn, is that the capacity of the United States government to afford lavish subsidies to client states overseas, as well as the capacity of any significant group of American citizens to carry out large-scale fundraising projects on their own, will not last indefinitely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The United States has the ample wealth that allows it to support Israel because of the imperial wealth pump, that is to say, the systematic patterns of unbalanced exchange that funnel an oversized share of the world’s wealth into American hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As those patterns break down—and they are breaking down already—the subsidies that keep the Israeli economy afloat and make its current rate of military expenditure possible<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>will inevitably slow to a trickle and then stop. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>When that happens, Israel will find itself backed into a corner with no readily available means of escape. Finding another nation willing to take over the American role as sugar daddy is easier said than done; much of the support Israel gets from the US comes out of the fact that the American Jewish community is one of the better organized veto groups in American politics just now, with the votes and funding to swing a close election, while none of the rising powers likely to take over America’s role in the world has either a large enough Jewish minority or a political system sufficiently gridlocked to allow the same sort of pressure to be applied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Given a choice between funding Israel and placating the petroleum-rich nations and ample export markets of the Arab world, it’s not hard to see where, for example, China’s obvious interest lies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Lacking outside support, in turn, Israel faces a future in which it can no longer dominate its region and may not be able to ward off military threats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its military depends, like most modern militaries, on large and reliable inputs of petroleum products, and petroleum is one of the many resources that Israel lacks; its ability to import as much gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and so on as it needs depends, like so much else, on the subsidies it gets from the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The ability to field a large and technically advanced military machine also depends on those direct and indirect subsidies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Lacking them, Israel’s military potential is not much greater than, say, Lebanon’s or Jordan’s—not enough, in other words, to sustain anything like its current dominance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its nuclear arsenal gives it a temporary edge, but one that will last only until a rival power in the region equips itself with its own stockpile of warheads and delivery systems.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably necessary at this point to put paid to one of the widely repeated fantasies of our time, the notion that Israel might set out to guarantee its survival by threatening the rest of the world with nuclear war, or might simply start flinging warheads around in the event of its imminent demise. That’s one of those theories that seems to make sense as long as no one asks what happens next. The downside to any such action on Israel’s part, of course, is that the nations threatened or attacked would be able to respond with far more compelling threats and far more devastating reprisals. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To begin with, Israel is a very small country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Any nation with a significant nuclear arsenal could turn the whole of it into incandescent ash, along with its entire population, and still have bombs left over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The threat to wreck a city or two has very little clout when the cost of following through on that threat could quite easily amount to immediate national annihilation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Furthermore, many of the nations that might plausibly be threatened with a bomb or two can respond at least as effectively by means of conventional warfare. Let’s imagine, for example, that Israel were to threaten Russia, among other countries, with nuclear bombs—we’ll assume, borrowing one of the common tropes, that the bombs in question have been smuggled into Saint Petersburg and Moscow—unless something is done to stop an otherwise unstoppable Arab advance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Anyone who thinks Russia would respond in a manner favorable to Israel knows nothing of Russian culture or history, but then that’s a common mistake on this side of the Atlantic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We’ll assume, for the moment, that for some reason the Russian government decides not to inform the Israelis calmly that thirty minutes after either bomb goes off, a MIRV-tipped missile or two will return the favor to Tel Aviv with several hundred kilotons of interest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The obvious alternative is to inform the Israelis with equal sang-froid that if either bomb goes off, Russia will declare war on Israel, and twenty or thirty Russian divisions with air support and all the other desiderata of modern warfare will join the Arab forces assaulting Israel. We don’t even need to talk about what additional threats the Russian government might quietly make concerning, for example, Russia’s remaining Jewish population. The same logic applies to other countries facing some comparable threat, since the only nation that would face assured destruction in a nuclear exchange with Israel, after all, is Israel. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The existence of Israel’s nuclear arsenal, mind you, makes it unlikely that the sort of final Arab assault beloved of American fundamentalist apocalypse-mongers will happen at any point in the near to middle future. A far more likely scenario, as America’s empire enters its twilight, would see economic and political crisis in Israel spiraling out of control as moderate and extremist factions scramble for control of a dwindling stock of wealth and resources, and everyone who has the resources and common sense to flee the country gets out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How the endgame would play out is anyone’s guess at this point, and it’s not impossible that a few mushroom clouds may have a part in it one way or another. As I mentioned in last week’s post, the next few decades may well see a few nuclear weapons being used, and it’s exactly in situations like Israel’s that this seems most likely. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The western shores of the Pacific Ocean include another flashpoint of the same kind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Taiwan is another American client state that has everything to lose as America’s global empire goes down, and it’s also a likely focus of the old and bitter geopolitical rivalry between China and Japan. It’s a core requirement of Chinese policy to regain control of Taiwan in order to secure the Chinese coast against any hostile power; Ir’s an equally core requirement of Japanese policy to keep China from regaining control of Taiwan, in order to secure the sea lanes that carry Japan’s fuel and food supplies against Chinese interdiction. It’s hard to think of a more perfect zero-sum game in the post-American world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Japan’s position is by far the weaker, and it will face the difficult choice between submitting to Chinese suzerainty, and going to war as it did in 1941 against a rising superpower with vastly greater resources. Either way, it’s not going to be pretty. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the sort of thing that happens routinely in the twilight of empires, when client states that have staked everything on support from an imperial patron find themselves twisting in the wind. In empires that expand by annexing territory, it’s the frontier provinces that get clobbered first and hardest when decline sets in; in empires that prefer to expand by building a network of client states, it’s the client states closest to major hostile powers that generally pay the heaviest price when the empire falters. Israel is wedged tightly into such a position; and its fate will be the result of the hard realities of history, not of any set of ethical considerations—nor, it probably has to be said, of which side in the current debates claims the moral high ground most loudly. </div>

<span style="font-size: large">End of the World of the Week #49</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What could be more colorful than a rogue planet crashing into the Earth, or at least sweeping by close enough to send the poles topsy-turvy and wipe out most of humanity?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Whether or not that’s what motivated New Age writer and self-proclaimed extraterrestrial abductee Nancy Lieder to announce, in 1995,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the imminent and Earth-wrecking arrival of the planet Nibiru, her proclamation quickly became a cause c<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">élè</span>bre in New Age circles. The name of the planet came from the ancient-astronaut theories of Zechariah Sitchin, who got it from ancient Babylonian astrology texts via his own dubious translations, but Sitchin’s notions were quickly swallowed up by the apocalypse meme once Lieder got hold of it—or, as she described the situation, was warned of it by the little gray aliens from Zeta Reticuli who talk to her via a mysterious implant in her brain. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Lieder’s original prediction was that Nibiru would come zooming past Earth on May 27, 2003, causing the Earth to stop rotating for 5.9 days and then undergo a pole shift. When that didn’t happen, she stopped giving specific dates, but still insists that Nibiru’s arrival will happen very, very soon. Fortunately for connoisseurs of absurdity, others are not so squeamish, and this June, the Weekly World News <a href=http://weeklyworldnews.com/aliens/42896/earth-to-collide-with-nibiru-on-november-21-2012/ >loudly announced</a> that Nibiru’s long-awaited collision with the Earth would take place on November 21, 2012. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yes, that’s today. So, dear reader, if you’re sitting at your computer reading this, and haven’t been scattered into interplanetary dust by a vagrant planet, the long list of failed apocalyptic predictions has just gained another entry...</div>

In much the same way that I expect an enlightened world to provide a safe haven for the Jews that were so heavily persecuted in WWII and before. And in much the same way I expect an enlightened world to end what looks like apartheid in what was the mandate of Palestine.<br><br> Needless to say my notions of modernity have no effect on reality; there is no book store in Los Alamos.<br><br><a href=#c7219778426640106599 title="comment permalink">11/21/12, 10:23 PM</a><br><br>

I do think that Israel could safely launch a retaliatory strike in the case of an actual nuclear attack but that raises the problem you mention which is that they are a small country.<br><br>But for a first strike there is a major problem. Israel depends for its survival on two things: US aid and EU trade. The first is in danger if Israel uses a nuclear weapon first. The second one would surely disappear overnight in the event of such a strike. Israel has already had major run-ins with the EU over conflicts with neighbors and the EU wins every time it decides to actually take action and, say, stop buying Israeli products.<br><br>The second point has to do with the Asian flashpoint. Japan is starting to remilitarize, but economically they are still in tough shape. Taiwan I think is more of a simple gain for China than something aimed at Japan. The real flash point between China and Japan though is Korea and the US policy there is to maintain division for fear of a unified Chinese-allied Korea threatening Japan. If Korea unifies, keep in mind that South Korea's largest trading partner is China. This has the potential to really heat up a conflict between China and Japan.<br><br><a href=#c8179594514793330800 title="comment permalink">11/22/12, 1:41 AM</a><br><br>

I am not sure that would help in Taiwan's situation but I believe it would help Israel's.<br><br>If your theory is holding out for another Saladin we can just as easily throw a David reborn into the mix as well. While the money and arms have certainly helped Israel they are not the only advantage the IDF has and a reduction in Israel's support would be matched by similar reductions in the other player's support as well from other countries. Not the least of which would be arm imports.<br><br>Yes Israel and the US along with others like to keep the Middle East in factions and squabbling with each other but it isn't like it takes some miracle of underhanded diplomacy to do it. The various tribes have done a very good job of that themselves over the centuries. Finally it would take more than a Saladin reborn to make a real fighting force out of the armies those Muslim countries would field. It would require years of defeat and embarrassing losses before the Arab states would be willing to unify their own factions and accept a Saladin to begin with.<br><br>In the end Israel would fall more than likely but it would take a very long time and many chapters before the end. The decline of the American empire and it's support would only be the first chapter of that story.<br><br><a href=#c7186157966786867769 title="comment permalink">11/22/12, 1:43 AM</a><br><br>

The extent to which Jewish diaspora wealth and substantial influence over the media and host politics can/will be maintained through a US Empire decline.<br>2.

Our UK PM says things like "I want to put the military at the centre of our national life"; fatigue-clad soldiers mingle with the Olympic crowds and nary a whisper of dissent) item 2 takes on particular significance.

About 25 years ago, when I was at University in London, I met a Jewish student (and we still e-mail to each other on occasion). We more or less agreed that beyond the moral issues, it was clear then that without US support, Israel would be faced with an intractable situation. <br><br>I was of the opinion (and still is) that one way out would be to cut a deal with the Palestinians as soon as possible whilst Israel was still in a dominant position to ensure a lasting peace so that Arabs and Jews could live together in peace, justice and harmony! (Well we all have some degree of naivety!) <br><br>Furthermore, as time goes by and the US empire begins to crack it seems to me that the ONLY WAY to guarantee that Israel, in some form or shape survives, is actually to do what morality dictates: make peace with one's neighbours and reciprocally. An interesting case of morality and politics re-enforcing each other! <br><br>I even ventured to say that an Israeli-Palestinian Federation would be a great idea. And yes I am sober! <br><br>Your account of Middle East History in terms of systolic and diastolic phases is really good and I agree that sooner or later a regional power will coalesce other countries into a larger political entity. As soon as US power wanes seriously, this new regional power will begin making serious moves. The current phase of political trouble there is conducive to the nucleus of such a new regional power. Needless to say, China will do every thing it possibly can do assist its birth and beyond. <br><br>For what's it's worth, my best bet for the next regional power would be the coalescence of parts of Iraq, Syria and Lebanon because of its large population base, large agricultural areas, large rivers, oil and gas, fairly well educated population, a common language and history, overlapping cultures, religions and a tradition of some tolerance towards minorities! <br><br>Well that's my contribution!<br><br><a href=#c1515184181221692704 title="comment permalink">11/22/12, 2:15 AM</a><br><br>

Israel currently exports about 80% of its wheat (mostly from the US) through two main ports, both of which are within missile-range from Lebanon and Gaza. Israel also has one of the highest birthrates of any Western country, and nobody is talking about trying to reduce it. COuple that with the effects global warming will likely have on the region. The population will have to shrink somehow - the way I see it happening is that most wealthy and secular Jews will leave the country, thus crippling it economically (today over 50% of the state budget comes from taxing the top 10%). That will probably leave the Arabs and a traditional and mostly ideological Jewish population. I actually think that if this were the case, it would be easier for the Israelis and Palestinians to actually work something out together. It's easier for a religion to respect and understand another religion than it is to understand the current form of secularized, materialized Western society.<br>Also, there is the possibilty that once Iran has a nuclear weapon, it will actually become more moderate (either through ground-up revolutions, or by the government becoming more even-headed once it realizes the power they have in its hands), and it could form an alliance with Israel.<br><br><a href=#c2736190101715859879 title="comment permalink">11/22/12, 2:15 AM</a><br><br>

(In a dark-age you do not have even the resources you had before the flowering of the said civilisation.)On the other hand Greer's discussion of the collapse of empires suggests from historical comparisons (comparison based on scale-free factors) that collapse is often swift, where the hegemon's core region fractures into ‘statelets’, and a new hegemon arises elsewhere whose reach depends on transport technology and resources available at the time.

I am not talking about anthrax or something similar. Rather superweapons like ebolapox.<br>I believe the desire of Israelis to survive and the amount of effort they are willing to spare in order to insure that are extremely underestimated.<br>No Superstate will be born in the Middle East on the corpse of Israel. Because a MENA area as we know it today would not exist any more.<br>Not one or two cities would turn to ash. All of them would.<br>Very interesting and spectacular evolutions in store it seems. <br><br>Western World would still have decades of prosperity ahead if the take over of Eurasia would have been successful(meaning former USSR).

Russian strategic forces would have eliminated all western cities.

And from the area also.<br>The amount of destruction Israelis would bring on the head of an existential enemy is beyond anything tat might be gained.<br>I see accommodation in the future.<br>The future Israeli semi theocracy will find a modus vivendi with whomever will be the dominant power in the area. <br>There is no reason for example why a future Persian Empire ( in a very loose form as it always was) would not accept to cooperate with a sort of semi vassal/enemy Israeli theocracy. <br>A Turkish one would be more dangerous.

Using the example of the Crusaders kingdom as an historical parallel for the situation with Israel was a good stroke. As for Taiwan, their best option would be to follow the example of Hong Kong which was handed back to China by the UK in 1997. If I remember correctly, the UK had a treaty in 1898 which gave it a lease of 99 years over the new territories. The UK would still retain sovereignty over Hong Kong Island, but this would not have been much of a viable entity once the new territories were handed over. Therefore the Thatcher government negotiated a treaty to hand over Hong Kong in 1997, with an agreement to allow it to have its own special status and form of government for the next 50 years. So far the Chinese have kept to their agreement. Taiwan would be better off negotiating an agreement with China now, while they still have American support and can get a good deal. If they leave it until American power collapses,then China will be able to make their own terms through the barrel of a gun. The same principle applies to Israel. They would be much better off reaching a peace deal now, while they are backed up by American power. If they don’t then they could be left in a precarious position. <br>Probably the most important attitude America and it client states are going to need is Pragmatism. Pragmatism is something that Britain was fairly good at during its period of empire and the subsequent imperial decline. Of course, like all empires the British were capable of cruelty, arrogance and pride. Those periods when British policy was driven by arrogance, pride and an attitude of exceptionalism usually ended badly. The most obvious example was the period leading up to the American Revolution in 1776. With the exception of Suez in 1956, British policy after the Second World War was largely pragmatic, which enabled it to come out of the process of imperial decline intact and relatively unscathed. This is a lesson that America and its client states are going to have to learn if they want to do the same.<br><br><br><a href=#c7218594983867166562 title="comment permalink">11/22/12, 5:38 AM</a><br><br>

Insane alliances are made and military victories are won when losing means annihilation of whole thousands-of-years old bloodline... Or when fighters believe that is going to happen. Same thing for them, anyway. What I am trying to say, I see same things happening as you in Canaan during near future: escalation, dehumanization of the enemy and war, but who wins... Nobody knows. Given the ABSOLUTELY insane political claustrophobia here in the Old World right now, I don't even rule out some kind of European relief force getting involved. To whose side, I have no idea. Europe is going to see big political upheaval during following years. All bets are off right now. People just don't believe any more what rulers are saying in here, and surprisingly many don't believe in core principles of our system anymore. I just fear that identity politics here in the Old World will be copied from Ulster during Troubles, not from liberals fairy tale book. Who knows if this will benefit somebody in Canaan?

I think Israel is actually in a better strategic position than you say -- better than the crusaders and certainly better than the Hellenistic client states that existed for a thousand years before the Islamic conquest. Israel is much less dependent on US aid than it was even 15 years ago: some numbers would have helped that part of your argument. Several of its neighbors, notably Egypt, are more dependent on Western subsidies than Israel is. Its neighbors all hate and fear each other more than any of them dislikes Israel. And even a declining USA would likely be able to project power in the Mediterranean littoral for some time to come, even if the Pacific rim were to fall out of its control. But no need to argue details. A noble effort. <br><br>More generally, I noticed in this post a rhetorical strategy that I've seen before in this blog, an approach that might be summarized as "Give it up, boys; the dream is dead."

The fall of the north coast is a first step; then comes movement by boat around the coasts to both sides, first to raid, then to settle. The whole process could well take about as long as the fall of Celtic Britain to the Anglo-Saxons did, with Tasmania quite possibly filling the role of Wales. <br><br>Chris, I don't recall bringing up an Israeli retaliatory strike at all. As I mentioned last week, the logic of mutually assured destruction makes it very hard to use nuclear weapons at all unless the other side doesn't have any way to retaliate, and once some of the other regional powers have their own nukes, that door's shut -- once the bombs go up, both sides lose. <br><br>Preppy, not so. First of all, the collapse of the US empire opens the door for someone else to expand, and as things go, that's probably China, which has every reason to funnel wealth to Iran and other petroleum-rich countries hostile to Israel. As long as those hostile countries have oil to trade, they've got a conduit for military aid that Israel doesn't have. Again, Israel's a small, resource-poor country, and without massive aid, it couldn't support much more of a military than, say, Lebanon. <br><br>Phil, that doesn't surprise me. On this side of the pond, Israel generally gets a sort of vague support, simply because a lot of Americans distrust and fear the Muslim world; there's also a large, or at least loud, anti-Israel scene on both ends of the political spectrum. Still, I've heard a lot of people wish that the Israelis and their enemies would all just go away.<br><br><a href=#c4408135546925442924 title="comment permalink">11/22/12, 1:01 PM</a><br><br>

They have significant issues with political transitions and with corruption, and their heavily state subsidized economy may be more of a house of cards than our own.

(Lack of support for social security is just as lethal for an American political career as lack of support for Israel, and for parallel reasons.) That will change when the gridlock in DC finally breaks, and some party or personality is able to get a sufficiently large following to ignore the veto groups and enact drastic change; as I've commented in previous posts, that's part of the normal cycle of American politics, and last happened in 1933-1940. <br><br>Karim, well, one can hope!<br><br>Cracked, how much of that population increase is in the Jewish population of Israel, and how much is in the Muslim? That has a huge influence on what will happen. <br><br>Phil H., no need to apologize. It's a good summary of what I've been trying to say. <br><br>Phil K., of course! A century or two from now, I'd expect to see a large Jewish population in that province of the next Middle Eastern superstate, and a large diaspora population whose ancestors lived in Israel while it existed and fled before and during the collapse. That is to say, not much different from the situation over most of the last 2500 years or so. <br><br>Hypnos, one of the lessons of history is that an entire nation can very easily shrug off its best chance for survival, and go merrily down the road to its own destruction, insisting that it's doing what's right. In its own way, the US did that with the coming of the Reagan years. <br><br>Mustard, that's a fascinating story, with much to recommend it as a source of useful comparisons. <br><br>Bill, no argument there. <br><br>Teo, er, you need to read fewer cheap thrillers. First, Israel's arsenal of 200-odd nuclear weapons isn't even enough to nuke the entire Middle East, much less the world -- you do know, don't you, that a single Trident submarine has more nuclear warheads on board and ready to launch than the entire nation of Israel owns? As for biological warfare, again, that's for cheap thrillers; any nation smaller than a superpower that tried to use such things could count on taking a nuclear first strike, and you may be sure that the people in charge in Tel Aviv know that as well as anyone. <br><br>Diotima, I hope the more intransigent groups in Israel start paying attention to points like that. <br><br>Daughter, thanks for the links!

As for your comment, yes, sometimes that happens, as in Finland; sometimes the factional splits are hard enough that even invasion won't heal them. After the Jews revolted against Rome in 66 CE, for example, factions within the Jewish community played a major role in the Roman victory; toward the end, when Jerusalem was under siege, the city was divided between two sets of Jewish defenders who fought each other as much as the Romans. The question that remains to be answered is which of these models will apply to Israel as it nears the end of its history. <br><br>Sage, thank you. <br><br>Sue, good.

There are quite a few other groups in the same position; I've referred to them as "veto groups" or "veto blocs" in past posts, because such groups can reliably block any attempt to take away funding from whatever their core issue is (for example, social security and Medicare benefits for the retiree lobby, or funding for Israel for the Jewish lobby).

I'll take the War Nerd's word for most things, but will want to check into this. <br><br>Raymond, thank you! Fortunately, most US client states don't have nuclear weapons -- Britain and Israel are the only two that do; France is not quite a client state, though if you want to include it, that makes three.

It's the same logic that leads US politicians to refuse to put a means test on social security or Medicare when doing that would be the single largest and least traumatic way to balance the budget: the senior lobby would turn on any candidate who supported such a project.

You can tell this from Israel's performance in the 2006 July War against Hizbollah in Lebanon. The IDF had total air supremacy and was able to pound Lebanon at will but their ground troops weren't able to make progress against Hizbollah which defeated the Israelis on the tactical battlefield. They were only facing a few thousand Hizbollah fighters but could neither control the territory they were attempting to occupy nor get as far as the Litani River.<br><br>Look at how the Israelis fought at Bint Jbeil. They went in and retreated. Went in and retreated. Went in and retreated. They could not take the place in 33 days even though they practically flattened it. A Russian Airborne regiment would have gone in, taken the necessary losses and captured the place in 24 hours tops. So would a Chechen force. Or even the British army. But the Israelis?<br><br>The so-called "elite" Golani Brigade could not do that. This is not an impressive performance. I think Israeli culture has changed fudamentally over the decades and this is no longer the nation of warrior farmers who achieved their great victories back in 1948, 1967 and 1973.<br><br>They never seriously attempted to invade Gaza during Operation Cast Lead and now in this latest episode they have failed once more to confront Hamas on the ground. This will have the effect of strengthening Hamas's morale and their standing among their own people. If you are hated it is not a good idea to give your enemy the impression that you are also cowardly.<br><br>The Achilles heel of the IDF is that they are very reluctant to take casualties. Of course, all armies try to minimise losses, but when the one overriding motive of an army is to avoid military losses at all costs, then that is obviously a huge disadvantage. I've heard Israelis try to spin this as the usual 'we love life, while the Arabs love death' nonsense, but really what it means is that the Israelis have become so pampared by decades of overwhelming military superiority that they have lost much of the old fighting spirit.<br><br>Unfortunately it is a sad fact that air power is not enough to win wars against a determined enemy as Vietnam and Afghanistan demonstrate.<br><br>Of course the Lebanese and Gaza conflicts are not necessarily a guide to how the IDF would peform if they were fighting to defend themselves against invasion of their own territory. Nonetheless it doesn't bode well for Israel.<br><br><a href=#c592580098023241744 title="comment permalink">11/22/12, 7:41 PM</a><br><br>

They have a small range of boats used by illegal immigrants to get to Australia. The cutest and by the smallest was one called the 'Sama Saja'. It was built from crude timber slabs and is 5 metres long. The mast is held up with galvanized fence wire. (No motor of course). <br><br>It was sailed to Australia in 1986 from the closest Indonesian Island, about 300 km of open ocean. It had a crew of 6 men, one of whom had made the crossing twice previously in dug-out canoes. So I hardly think that the distance and circumstances are a major barrier.<br><br>As for the habitability of the north. There are many areas along the coastal fringe which would be eminently habitable, with a relatively reliable (summer) rainfall and suitable for all sorts of crops. Afterall, a small part of it was heading towards being a major rice growing region until the geese started getting in on the act, and became impossible to control. So not so good for broadscale mechanized agriculture, but great for the high intensity man powered gardening found in many parts of Asia and Indonesia. And as for area, I suspect there would be more good useable agricultural land along the fringe than the entire area of England.<br><br>Of course the latter might become an ecological nightmare, but I doubt that would worry many in the circumstances. <br><br>Andrew<br><br><a href=#c1361212544893844519 title="comment permalink">11/22/12, 7:54 PM</a><br><br>

Currently Pakistan is deeply involved in its own racial/ethnic/religious war. But what i think(please don't laugh understand Pakistanis too well)is Pakistan might try to take over Saudi Arabia once US power goes down. Up to this time, Pakistani politicians have shown their subservient nature because of political situations but it may change color rapidly when US starts closing down its own military bases in south Asia. Pakistan TPTB doesn't overly likes religious fanatics but they use them to wage war against foreign nations(like india,china,USA,UK).If the prize is right(the right to head empire, oil),Pakistan might quickly coalesce into power center and might easily take over neighboring Muslim nations( like uzbekistan,tajikistan,afghanistan,Nigeria,yemen,oman,UAE).Iran will be difficult country to attack and conquer but Sunni Shia conflict were always bloody. The question of legitimacy throne of Sultan might come up but Pakistan have many Royal bloodlines still active in politics and government. Muslim Empires were always held loosely, they appointed feudal lords over a area and collected taxes(and bribes)what are your thoughts on this?<br><br><br><a href=#c3739081092704107784 title="comment permalink">11/22/12, 11:39 PM</a><br><br>

There's not much evidence of careful thinking around the Middle East in Sweden, either. (When I'm in a less optimistic mood, I don't see much careful thinking around anything, of course. An example would be our security and defense policy, which all capable observers regard as a bad joke, but hey, eternal Pax Americana is here so why worry? Back to the subject.)<br><br>I read an analysis by a Swedish military commentator that said Israel's actions right now are driven by the rapidly worsening strategic situation. The logic would be that the Israelis really want to take out or set back Iran's nuclear program so that they can focus on their borders, and to do that, they need to keep their most volatile borders quiet in the short term. <br><br>Thus, they focused on taking out Hamas' heavy rocketry and called off the ground offensive when it turned out it wasn't needed. Now the "southern front" will be quiet enough for the next three to six months (until a new arsenal can be built up), and if the Israelis can (temporarily) pacify the "northern front" (Hizbollah) next, they'll have a chance to "do something" about the Iranian bomb.<br><br>After that, they'd focus again on their own borders.<br><br>We'll see how things turn out. If the analysis above is right, this was just the beginning.<br><br>As an aside, appararently the Iron Dome anti-rocket and anti-grenade system was a tactical success, taking out most of the 1500 rockets thrown at it. From the cost estimates I've seen, both for the system and for individual missiles, it looks like it's proving some of JMG's point in earlier posts.<br><br><a href=#c3164887060987862294 title="comment permalink">11/23/12, 1:02 AM</a><br><br>

They were quite few and going back to Normandy or whatever was not a catastrophic decision.<br>I believe we need to add some last stand of the Warsaw ghetto into the mix to get a more accurate picture.<br>Some secular Israelis would bail out in case of defeat. I can't give a proportion though I had worked with them.<br>But the traditional and a part of the seculars - won't be many by then - will sink with the ship. Or they rather won't. In case of an imperial collapse and major disruptions of the commercial flows a very impoverished religious ghetto is a probable outcome. It is not something new.<br>It happened before and the economic needs of such a structure are not very expensive.<br>Compare with the amount of resources which have to go into Gaza in order to insure survival.<br><br>And yes a poor ghetto as the one I described - no resemblance with the Crusader states any more by now - can not be eliminated by use of nukes or conventional forces. It needs are small. Social control is absolute.<br>Futures Elazars will be much harder to eliminate by their opponents. <br>On the other hand such a religious/tribal ghetto as I see in the future during the long descent is something very easy to live with. What they need and want - rabbis want - is to be left to themselves. Like it was before moderns states brought them to the mainstream and religious establishment lost the grip on the Jewish community. Communities led by the likes of Rabbi Ovadia lived quite nicely along gentile political powers.<br>Just that the pogrom/genocide part will have to be avoided this time. <br>It is preferable to let Ovadia keep his ghetto then to receive the meager 1-200 nukes he and his colleagues have on the head of your tribe and your children. <br>In conclusion I'd say you are right. Israel will not survive. The one which exists now. But it is not going to survive anyway in this form. A huge religious movement is already sweeping the country, and the demographic wave has just begun.<br>But something which will be called Israel is going to exist in the future. It might have some resemblances with Gaza, but it will be a religious version of it rather then the secular one with strong traditional values that exists there.<br><br><a href=#c5930364014785174364 title="comment permalink">11/23/12, 2:33 AM</a><br><br>

It is just not an issue that ever comes up here. <br><br>I have heard the shouting that you mentioned only very recently from an Israeli journalist who was interviewed on an Australian radio current affairs program and the interviewer was a bit taken aback. Saying things a second or third time at ever higher volumes is no way to get a point across.<br><br>It is hard to be sympathetic for a people that fail to get along with their neighbours regardless as to whether they like them or not. It is not even a question of morals, it is basic human nature. I mentioned recently that I read Jared Diamonds book "Collapse" where he wrote about Rwanda and the civil strife. It was generally framed as a tribal issue, but researchers later found that even in villages where a single tribe predominated, they still had the same percentage of killings. When investigated further, they found that the killings were generally motivated by land grabs, family disputes and/or settlement of old scores. Human nature, anyone? I don’t know whether anyone is familiar with the experiment of rats in the box?<br><br><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_sink rel=nofollow>Behavioral Sink</a><br><br>I think this is the correct reference, could someone please correct me if wrong.<br><br>Perhaps it could be argued that the Israeli's have used their subsidies for the wrong purposes?<br><br>Anyway, a society (or even a family) built on subsidies is bound to fail sooner or later.<br><br>By the way, I'm with Leo on the Northern Australia invasion by Indonesia and I've travelled a lot of the country. <br><br>They have been trying agriculture in that area for upwards of 50 years and it is a failure and continues to be. There is even a dam that holds 27x the volume of water in Sydney Harbour (in fresh water of course) and it had the worst fruit and vegetables that I experienced. In some parts, the thin strip of land around the coast can sustain a very small population. The soils are too poor, the rain is too intermittent and the cyclones are too intense. Organic matter is simply lost. Inland from the coast, the country is arid land, the deserts are much further south again and they are impenetrable on foot for the inexperienced.<br><br>The rivers that have not had crocodile traps installed and maintained are really dangerous.<br><br>I dunno, but 3 days without water and 3 weeks without food comes along pretty quickly. There’s a reason that most of the population lives along a strip of coast along the south-east of the continent. Water is a problem, even in my location and I do everything I can to store the rainfall that I receive in the ground. There has been no significant rain here for the past four weeks now, who knows what summer will be like? I can’t tell and I’ve lived with the place for years now. This is the front line of climate weirding, it simply cannot support a bigger human population – let alone the current population on a sustainable basis.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c3408746521499066237 title="comment permalink">11/23/12, 4:03 AM</a><br><br>

The idea that the final weapon was reached in 1945 and that we still play the dissuasory game by the rules of 1965. I am a plant molecular biologist, I have nothing to do with viruses, but from my position I can see the advances made on that field, thanks to all the knowledge got from HIV research. Nowadays is perfectly possible to make a biology weapon that, killing fiend and foe, would be as retaliatory as a nuclear war. And by a diminute fraction to its cost. Even in the scientific literature one finds such weapon has been created by mistake when looking for something else. There are no limitations to this club, just discretion is needed. I find that this is like giving all the attention to nuclear weapons and nothing to the biologic possibility, this will dissapear. If I do not see it, it does not exist. Of course there is no dissuassion from something that is unknown. But in this new game timing and selective knowledge could be important. The influenza scares of the last years could have had economic reasons, but also were a test of the possible answers. From my viewpoint this is a hidden factor in geostrategy, even when it could sound like out of an old 007 movie.

The saltwater crocodile even swims out to sea, regularly. The beaches are no safe haven.

Remember that large scale agriculture has been tried and failed for many decades up north. The climate can be quite variable up north (just like down south) too and this impacts the types of crops grown. Also, Indonesia only has such a large population because they inhabit volcanoes and have outstanding (and very new and regularly maintained) soil. This is not the case up the north of Australia which has very old and very poor soils and rice would strip the soil within a few seasons at most - and then everyone would starve. <br><br>It is instructive that the saltwater crocodile can convert 97% of the food that they eat into a useable resource for them.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c1245799299658957147 title="comment permalink">11/23/12, 1:53 PM</a><br><br>

Of course, this is textbook conspiracy theory from the HIV/AIDS epidemic, but it doesn’t mean it’s not possible. This could work in various ways, where the desired trait either is the target or the immunity (traits could be for black/white skin, eye folds, or any other distinctive gene). The persons designing/releasing the agent would have to believe that the collateral damage to their home population was acceptable, the risk of it mutating before it was brought under control was minimal, and that they would not be found out in time for it to matter.

I actually expect the North coast to become Indonesian (and/or New Guinean). They didn't settle here then because the enviroment wasn't habitable for their style of agriculture and they couldn't bring in some of the neccesary animals/crops. That pictures changed in that they have better crops (e.g. imports from South America such as potatoes) and that pigs, horses and other animals are now there and don't need to be brought. This changes it from not settlable to probably being able to sustain a quarter to a half of the population currently there. <br>To extend Cherokee Organics argument on growing food there, Industrial agriculture is far more able to ignore or alter the local enviroment (say by fertilizers and pesticides) than organic agriculture can. If its failed to work for 50 years, chances are the local enviroment just isn't suitable (And what else would the Indonesians use other than organic)<br>Also even if the total arable land was more than england's, its more marginal land than england's.<br><br>As for the boats, while the Sama Saja is impressive, its not the sort of ship used for mass migration or settling. That takes more than moving as many people as possible, you need cargo space for food, seeds, clothes, animals, tools etc. That takes a different design, organisation and building skills (parts are similar but not all). The original white settlements here almost starved because they couldn't bring enough food to bridge the gap between landing and growing food.

Every time, that "vast potential" turns out to be, shall we say, half-vast at best, and then believers in limitless petroleum go running after the next supposed source. All the while, the huge fields that provide most of our actual oil production are rapidly depleting, and frantic efforts to bring new production on line barely keep up. <br><br>Cherokee, my point is that they have the same big Asian saltwater crocodiles in Indonesia, and seem to have no problem dealing with them. It's a common mistake of people in industrial countries to forget that people in nonindustrial countries are often much more skilled at making a living on what, to us, looks like harsh territory than we are. <br><br>Bill, Hawaii doesn't have to worry about it at all.

When I thought about the "successful" startups in the "sustainability" realm, I noted that just about all of them depended on a big chunk of start-up cash acquired through the usual industrial/commercial/financial economy. And their cash flow is also derived almost entirely from this "unsustainable" economy as well. This left me wondering if there was ANYONE who was really contemplating what a true sustainable society here would look like in the absence of the suburbs, investment portfolios, retirement funds, and inheritances that are currently supporting all these activities. I think all the "green" movements might just be marching us just as far into unsustainability, just in different directions. I realize I am surely too harsh, but those were the thoughts I had. <br><br>So envisioning your hypothetical future with an asian successor to the American empire, it became very clear that most of the present-day area of the U.S. will be the impoverished sources for the new wealth pump, not the strategic sinks or the wealthy homeland (which we are now, of course). And if my own ponderings panned out that there might not even be another successor empire, at least not one that would extend its reach this far, then we are really on our own here. It's hillbilly dirt farming that might make the aftermath of the Civil War seem luxurious and leisurely by comparison; at least then there was a global market for exported corn whiskey; now we've got depleted and eroded soils that will no longer grow 100 gallons per acre without either industrial methods or a century or two of careful soil management (and let's not even talk about climate change...). <br><br>This is not a future that anyone seems to want to envision; which means no one is preparing for it or seriously considering how to ameliorate it.

I also liked the historical comparison and it was so apt, that I didn’t even realise that it was a historical comparison until your disclosure.<br><br>Resource depletion is a massive issue in the Middle East. I've been reading about their aquifers for a few years now and it doesn't sound good and the situation is coming to a head pretty quickly. Still, oil exports buy food imports. I wonder what the Israeli's will eat though?<br><br>The saltwater crocodiles have been mostly eaten in Asia, which confirms your comment. The people are more than up for the task. However, the crocodile visitors the Asians get are largely from Australian rivers and it is something of a surprise for the locals.<br><br>By the way, I've eaten crocodile meat and it is quite good, I'd recommend it to all. I've also eaten kangaroo, wallaby, emu, possum, camel, guinea pig, alpaca meat amongst many others. Mostly vegetarian, doesn't mean totally vegetarian! hehe!<br><br>As to the Indonesians, they'll head east first into Papua New Guinea. My reasoning for this is that the climate, soils, crops are much more familiar to their population than northern Australia. Let's face it, they've already annexed West Papua. <br><br>Papua New Guinea has also supported small scale market gardens for more millennia than most locations on the planet. Unfortunately for the Indonesians, they may also cause massive environmental destruction and top soil loss should they decide not to follow the example of the locals. It is an area that is subject to excessive erosion and top soil loss if only annual crops are planted. <br><br>The saltwater crocodiles are a side issue.<br><br>The main issue is really human population overshoot and resource depletion.<br><br>This is an issue that few people concern themselves with, hoping that something will come along. The Israeli's are no different. If I were them, I'd be making peace with their neighbours. There seems to be little point in surviving a siege in a castle if you can't feed yourself because eventually you can’t eat fortifications. <br><br>I've been thinking about beneath's comment late last week and that person is on the money. Few people want to accept limitations on their activities. I'm unsure of what most people think when talking about freedom, but it is actually very freeing to accept limitations.<br><br>Mind you, a subsidised monastery sounds like a bad idea as it would be a drain on the resources of an agricultural economy. As the zen saying goes, "before enlightenment, chop wood, fetch water. After enlightenment, chop wood, fetch water." Wise words indeed!

Please notice that your answer for biological warfare fits into exactly the same problem that nuclear warfare during the cold war, asured mutual destruction. However while biological warfare is discarded because of this reason, nuclear warfare is not. Why is this so?

This is what I've been trying to talk about all along -- the eighty per cent pay cut that comes with the end of our empire affects everyone, including those who think their green startups are exempt from the laws of economics. Here in America, we are all going to be very poor for a long time in the wake of our failed empire; any plan for the future that doesn't take that into account is wasted breath. <br><br>Cherokee, subsidies for monasteries are a luxury of comfortable times. Monastic traditions, in most places and times, embrace voluntary poverty -- and remember that this is poverty even by the standards of, say, the Dark Ages -- because they don't have subsidies, and have to produce everything they need themselves. <br><br>As for your strange experience -- hmm. Were both of them trying to convince you of the same thing, or of similar things? I saw a lot of that when our housing bubble was about to pop -- people who normally had some integrity pitching the most delusional nonsense about how home prices were going to keep going up forever, and they could get me in on a marvelous investment opportunity, etc. <br><br>Anagnosto, I think it's largely that you can't scale down a biological weapon reliably -- once your superplague is out, it's all but impossible to control where it will and won't spread. Nuclear weapons are a lot less random, since you know more or less how much real estate is going to get incinerated and where the fallout plume will drift.<br><br><a href=#c8948358176769527540 title="comment permalink">11/24/12, 10:13 AM</a><br><br>

When I lived in the Melbourne suburb of Glen Waverly in 90-91-92 it was white bread ozzie, when I returned for a working visit last year its Asianisation was absolute. Mainly Chinese. Finding a decent steak was a challenge, but TomYum and Hundred Year old eggs were everywhere. I watched Eastwood in Sydney go the same way from 93 to 98. I can see the beginings of a gradual change in the regional area of Tasmania but the cultural mix is Indian, Asian, African in about equal proportions.<br><br>Yes, Indonesia is across the water, but the reasons NW Australia has not been extensively colonised ever have not changed. Very poor soil, Unreliable rainfall, extreme temperatures are impossible to alter in an age of depleting energy, and the rising(for now) population in Asia will be subject to the same constraints of resource depletion as everyone else.<br>The more probable route to Asianisation of Australia lies in a gradual, largely peaceful movement by the means of marriage, migration, and commerce. <br>A client of mine who is a crusty Aussie farmer/engineer and who looks as redneck as any, was the other day singing the praises of his Vietnamese daughter in law, and his other son is about to marry her sister.

It wouldn't be a weapon to threaten with, but a weapon to weaken the oppressor's ability to oppress, or maybe just a satisfying degree of revenge.

I don't see a problem because I don't see that the water between Indonesia and Australia constitutes much of a barrier. One can cross that stretch of water in anything from a canoe up. The peak in illegal boat people currently was 5500 in around the 2001 'boat season'. This happened with 89 more or less disposable boats, at the end of their life and with deterrent measures in place in Australia. (eg jail for the crew, years in detention centres etc) Imagine the numbers possible with good boats with no deterrent and with a lure of good open land. And there would not be much to stop boats from following the coast further south anyway.<br><br>However I doubt that there will be a sudden huge influx of millions of Indonesians. I was thinking more of a slow but steady and increasing migration over decades or a century. <br><br>When considering agricultural production all reports I have read consider agriculture that has significant fossil fuel inputs (eg fuel and fertilizer) but have been about production for export (from the farm to distant markets - usually to southern cities or other countries). I would have thought a more appropriate model would be the sort of locallized manual subsistence farming where most production ends up back in the same plot of land, practiced in many places , often tropical or semi-tropical areas with poor quality soil (Dare I mention permaculture). Admittedly some of the current practices and crops of potential migrants may not be suitable but I bet it wouldn't take long to work out a reasonable system. And if it really didn't work out then there would always be the overland migration to southern climes.<br><br>As for a lack of immigration in past centuries there was never the population pressure as there is now.

What your forgetting is that success on ocean voyages also depends on where your going e.g. Viking raids could only continue while coastal defences were weak in Europe even if the Vikings became better sailors. As for continuing on to the South, there is a reason that the Austronesians island hopped in their expansions (which was driven by population growth and pressures). The First Fleet stopped at numerous ports on its journey for similar reasons, ships carrying passengers for settlement don't have enough cargo space for essential supplies (like fresh fruit to fight scurvy) and the equipment neccesary for settling when long journeys are needed. The Austronesians got partly around this by not having large colony forces (at most a couple hundred at a time) and most of the passengers were also the crew. For this sort of migration a way station is mandatory since the numbers are in their thousands (at a minimium). <br><br>And as for more local and intensive agriculture, the Indonesians who used to land in Australia would have tried often with their version of intensive agriculture (very similar to todays). A lot of those tropical islands have various soil renewal mechanism (dust coming from Asia is one) while Australian soils generally don't and ours can often lack organic matter while tropical islands don't. It can be similar to rainforests (they are tropical after all) in that the soils are incredible poor but everythings locked up in all the living things there (thats why its cycled on the same plot in those tropical Islands, mimicking the natural cycle). Also since they're going North-South, climate and other factors affecting gardening changes quickly, hampering and slowing adaption. That barrier has been partly solved but it still dosen't change the picture much, after collapse the dominate lifestyle is going to be hunter-gatherer (or a hybrid) with some gardeners around, this limits population densities quite a bit. <br><br>What we're more likely to see is a slow migration, similar to whats been going on since the original gold rushes with the Chinese. Note that Chinese only makes up about 4.3% of our population, the cultural influences are greater and its more adding variation rather than replacing chunks of our population. Its still migration just a different kind.<br><br>the lure of good open land only happened in America and here because about 90% of the natives were wiped out by diesease, not an event thats going to occur here since their diseases are tropical and don't travel North-South well.<br><br>Also why would we stop having deterrents, yes they don't stop illegal immigration but they put a herd ceiling on its throughput which is pretty good. <br><br>And my main contention with "The main problem with figuring out..." is that you can't simply take a historical example from another continent and place it on another without big changes and uncertainty because the enviroments and context differ by a lot.<br><br><a href=#c6384288004595116984 title="comment permalink">11/24/12, 9:26 PM</a><br><br>

They were a small number of white rulers without support surrounded by alot of native africans and wisely thought twice about their odds of survival.<br> I hope that the powers that be in Israel realize that without support, they are surrounded by hostile neighbors, and their chances of survival as a country are slim.

I took until the centralizing of power bit to understand you were not talking about current day Israel :D But yes, the pattern of people coming from elsewhere and carve a small kingdom in the Med coast of the Middle east just to be eaten away when some warbent state gets critical mass and starts eating everything in their path is there atleast since the Sea people times and it will most likely not go away so soon ...<br><br>I do think your analysis of Israel position is basically correct: they got too many enemies nearby to deal with without massive external support and they clinged to much to the USA to be capable of making a U turn and start licking other power hands. In fact that is a stark diference of most of the fringe of the current US client states, that, with few exceptions ( Taiwan and Japan are exceptions that others already explained above ), are preparing B plans fast. See, for example, South Korea, that only has not got so far in a agreement with their northern counterpart because of heavy US pressure , or even the UK ( England has no permantent friends, just permanent interests, isn't it ? ;) ).<br><br>BTW, as a side dish on client states, I would like to give a update on the US bases in here ( Portugal ). Two weeks ago I mentioned the current US assets in portuguese soil, including the pivotal Lajes airbase ( for those that don't remember, it was where Bush and co officially delivered their ultimatum to Saddam Hussein in 2003 and is of prime importance for refueling anything of the USAF that flies across the North Atlantic ... it is still considered the #8 more important US base outside of their soil to the point that even Google Maps at a point simply had a black ink blot in the spot where the base is in map ). This week the USAF announced that they would fire 300 portuguese workers of the base ( USAF is obliged by contract to hire "native" personnel ,unlike it happens in other bases they have outside the US )due to budget cuts . The Portuguese foreign affairs minister ( that is a strong supporter of a US-UK alignement and that was the Defense minister at the time Bush came here to basically declare a undeclared war against Iraq in 2003 ) said almost literally this in response: our alliance with the US has a pivotal point in the USAF use of the Lajes airstrip and the contratual obligations that come from that ... and if the USAF does not honor their part, the <i>alliance with the USA</i> ( italic for emphasis ) will need to be reevaluated.<br><br>TBH, I do think it is a poach of hot air and grandstanding, but the issue is seeing a staunch defender of the so called "atlanticism" ( basically the doctrine that Portugal needs to allign with whoever controls the North Atlantic or else and that at this time it the US that has it ) saying this kind of harsh words, that were simply unthinkable even as hot air a decade ago. Not that I'm expecting a public bid for the use of the Lajes airstrip in the short future, but I've seen stranger things happening ...<br><br>( cont )<br><br><a href=#c5083581016772986825 title="comment permalink">11/25/12, 1:19 PM</a><br><br>

And , as you point, there will a increased need to show that you still have a operational nuke , so I would not exclude that there will be a increase of nuke usage as the decline comes, but on non threatning targets ... This BTW excludes the Israeli "Samson option" as a viable option for Israel ( not that threatning people with nukes will do a lot for a continued goodwill relation ... ) as you point out: if a nuke concert is done ( and TBH we are already unofficially in it, otherwise there would be far less histrionic speech about more countries getting nukes or not ), the pariahs <i>must</i> be crushed even if as a example. The post-Napoleonic Europe is probably a good template of what would come of that situation: sworn enemies with zero reason to cooperate joining efforts to crush any defiance of the status quo ...<br><br><a href=#c2362166920403330499 title="comment permalink">11/25/12, 1:21 PM</a><br><br>

When I hear it now, I substitute the phrase, "maintaining the status quo" in my head. This seems to work well for me in providing deeper meaning whilst interpreting people’s statements.<br><br>As to imagining, well for a start, all those people commenting this week about bio-weapons should perhaps think about alternative medicines and herbal lore. Many plants and foods have anti-bacterial, anti-parasitical, anti-fungal and/or anti-viral properties. Perhaps not as good as modern western medicine in some respects, but they may be of help plus the lore (and sources of knowledge and plant materials) behind them is sustainable in the correct sense of the word. We have access to a world of plants that our forebears could only have dreamed about and yet we are praised for growing mono-cultures…<br><br>The reason I mention this is because without modern industrially sourced medicines many people would begin to fall back into the cycles of the ecosystem.<br><br>Take away industrially grown and produced foods, plus readily available energy sources and even more people come face to face with the limits of the ecosystem. Truly, we don’t need bio-weapons, nature is pretty raw.<br><br>By the way, I had an interesting experience a couple of weekends ago at my favourite local hippy market which lead me to ponder whether the benefits of germ theory would last more than a generation or two. I didn't get sick or anything, but it was an observation on food handling for some cherries which I purchased – mind you, I still ate them.<br><br>I ran out of bottled (I think you call them canned) fruit two months early this year which surprised me.<br><br>Also, healthy organic soils can be fast-tracked if you raid materials from other areas. Most of these materials are treated as waste products here which always amuses me. Also try to capture every bit of organic material that comes onto your property. Most people in Industrial countries bring organic matter onto their properties and then dispose of it again. In most cases this ends up in land-fills or the ocean thus contributing to the continuing acidification.<br><br>Interesting stuff and there are so many opportunities for change. Unfortunately people spend too much time envisioning and too little practising (I mean this as a sweeping generalisation and this comment is not directed at yourself whom I believe to be an enlightened and educated individual from your comments).<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c2652029576455935751 title="comment permalink">11/26/12, 3:06 AM</a><br><br>

From tactical use to strategic ones - not there yet.<br>Tactical ballistic missiles, land/air launched cruise ones, medium distance ballistic ones, probably already working on arty nukes etc.<br>They are really preparing to contest the US ownership of the Gulf. <br>What Pakistan needs to survive is energy and capital. Both are plentiful in the Gulf but US and its vassals take all. <br>Of course behind the gigantic Paki nuclear complex is China. Pat of the needed capital comes from Saudi.<br>I do not believe that Paki will take over Saudi or attempt to. Just become a bodyguard for the Saud family. By the way the Saudis already took over practically all the smaller oil producing countries of the area. Now the Saud domain is quite too big for Paki to have a go at swallowing it.<br>And Indians are also there. Huge capital flows towards India from the Gulf. And lots of Indians going into the other direction. Same needs as Pakistan.The Saudis will not become too dependent on anyone.<br>Of course the big beneficiary is China. Paki and Indian shares are just crumbs in the best of cases. Enough for them to live another day but that is all. The replacement of the Western consumers is China. They need the energy.<br>But the most important actor for now is Paki. All depends on their nuclear umbrella.<br>Even Iran in trying to squeeze itself under it. And Pakis didn't even give an opening date.<br>( Can check the speed with which Iran is building a big gas duct towards Pakistan on its own money and trying to convince Pakis to accept the Persian tribute for a funny reading.)<br>I see there an unfolding scenario about a possible collapse of Pax Americana, much closer then the one given by JMG as a case study. <br>About Paki you can find details here :<br>http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/nuclear-notebook-pakistans-nuclear-forces-2011<br><br>or http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/91.full.pdf+html<br><br>In general the analysis made for this particular case - deterrence etc - by JMG are great. But in some particular cases I think people will behave a little bit differently. They will not go down gently into the night. <br>And Pakistan is preparing to fight for its people to have a chance to live another day. This means receiving a droplet of the huge energy and capital of the Gulf from the Saudis. Just have to push aside the US. And a large and sophisticated nuclear arsenal is enough to interdict US military options in that area. Just like a large and sophisticated nuclear arsenal eliminated all US military options - except some small scale operations like the Salafi/Chechen groups or the Georgian attack - in Eurasia. <br>Nothing predictable it seems.<br>Of course I agree with the assessment that Japan can only suffocate. And eliminating their nuclear complex makes me think that others had the same ideas.<br>Starving people might have funny ideas if armed. And the only weapons which matters in this case are nukes. <br>No nukes means Japanese will starve quietly and will not bother others.<br>Quite hmmm interesting to observe that Germany also has to dismantle its nuclear complex. Of course they both do it because of Fukushima. Or because no one want to see how a nuclear Japan or Germany might behave after the big energy descent starts to happen.<br><br>By the way, if you want to read the bureaucratic version of the begining of the long descent - more pleasat reading at JMG - with a lot of data and charts can find it here, courtesy of German army:<br>http://peakoil.com/publicpolicy/german-military-analysis-of-peak-oil-now-available/ <br><br><br><br><a href=#c3503796737284810994 title="comment permalink">11/26/12, 3:36 AM</a><br><br>

The alternative? The sort of high-tariff policy the US had from 1861 to the end of the 19th century, which kept most US wealth at home at the cost of hard restrictions on all kinds of foreign trade. <br><br>Ian, that's another plausible scenario, to be sure. I had to pick one out of a target-rich environment...<br><br><a href=#c8845817434352199929 title="comment permalink">11/26/12, 7:58 PM</a><br><br>

The Noble Houses still exist, here's details on one of them: http://www.hutchison-whampoa.com/en/about/directors_details.php The Chinese are ultra-capitalists, they're not about to destroy any golden-egg laying geese to make some sort of ideological point. Incidentally, Macau, across from Hong Kong, is on a similar plan, with "a high degree of autonomy in all areas except in defence and foreign affairs.[9] Macau officials, rather than PRC officials, run Macau through the exercise of separate executive, legislative, and judicial powers, as well as the right to final adjudication.[44] Macau maintains its own separate currency, customs territory, immigration and border controls, and police force.[45][46]" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau<br><br>As for Israel, there are quite a few groups of people interested in cooperating with the Palestinians and mutual aid efforts do exist: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab-Israeli_peace_projects The grassroots movements will be of greater importance in the long run, IMHO.<br><br>I think as soon as US aid begins to decline, the Israeli government will shift from the Likud and its ideological allies towards a more moderate approach with the goal of giving Palestinians more and more of a stake in Israeli society until full parity/political equality is reached. The settlements in the West Bank will be removed, probably with force, by the IDF under new command structure. The "This land is Ours" people won't like it one bit and they'll resist with violence, but they'll find out precisely what it means to be outgunned...

Tritium deuteride only lasts about six months before replacement is needed, and conventional weapons can be used to deform nukes sufficiently so that they can't be used, because the uranium or plutonium in the warhead must be stored in inert gas or vacuum. Plutonium exposed to air spontaneously ignites - then its use as a warhead is done for.<br><br><a href=#c7312360173817492690 title="comment permalink">11/26/12, 10:30 PM</a><br><br>

At first, the soldiers of the empire and the client state show determination and ferocity and tenacity in battle. They are organized, motivated and disciplined. The local tribes are disorganized, disjointed, and fractious. The empire and client-state soldiers overcome them and they become demoralized.<br>Over time, the surrounding tribes absorb the ethic and culture of cooperation and organization until they are psychologically able to accept the idea of submission to a single leader. Meanwhile the troops of the client state, militarily supported by the empire, gradually become less motivated, more concerned with personal survival, less determined to conquer, with less willingness to sacrifice for the common future.<br>Eventually, beyond the mere costliness that you sketched out to run and maintain, the imbalance in qualiity of troops shifts, so that the result becomes inevitable.<br>The early Roman camps had wide gates, so the legionaries could easily sortie and reclaim the initiative in battle. Late Roman forts had narrow doors: the troops preferred to stay inside where they felt safe, leaving the besiegers with the ultimate victory.<br>The Goths coalesced behind Theodoric, copying the Roman organization, the Mongols under Chingis organized like the Chinese, just as the Arabs followed Saladin becoming united, like the Crusaders had been a generation before.<br><br><a href=#c2771588870549012618 title="comment permalink">11/27/12, 4:59 AM</a><br><br>

It looked really nice, but the problem is that the underlying business never made enough profit to be able to pay back the investment. You have to sell a lot of coffee to recoup the money spent in that renovation and the margins aren't that great to begin with.<br><br>The margins on agricultural produce are also low so they'd possibly never be able to recoup their initial investment. I'm probably wrong, but maybe this one has the smell of a ponzi scheme about it. I'd love for someone to make something like this work, but we'd perhaps have to all start paying more for our fruit and vegetables. Perhaps we may well, who knows?
