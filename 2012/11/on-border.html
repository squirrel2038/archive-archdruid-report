The topic of last week’s post, the likely fate of Israel in the twilight years of American empire, makes a good example of more than one common theme.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As I commented in that earlier discussion, Israel is one of several American client states for whom the end of our empire will also be the end of the line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At the same time, it also highlights a major source of international tension that bids fair to bring in a bumper crop of conflict in the decades before us.
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The word “irredentism” doesn’t get a lot of play in the media just now, but my readers may wish to keep it in mind; there’s every reason to think they will hear it fairly often in the future. It’s the conviction, on the part of a group of people, that they ought to regain possession of some piece of real estate that their ancestors owned at some point in the past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s an understandably popular notion, and its only drawback is the awkward detail that every corner of the planet, with the exception of Antarctica and a few barren island chains here and there, is subject to more than one such claim. The corner of the Middle East currently occupied by the state of Israel has a remarkable number of irredentist claims on it, but there are parts of Europe and Asia that could match it readily—and of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>course it only takes one such claim on someone else’s territory to set serious trouble in motion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s common enough for Americans, if they think of irredentism at all, to think of it as somebody else’s problem. Airily superior articles in the New York Times and the like talk about Argentina’s claim to the Falklands or Bolivia’s demand for its long-lost corridor to the sea, for example, as though nothing of the sort could possibly spill out of other countries to touch the lives of Americans. I can’t think of a better example of this country’s selective blindness to its own history, because the great-grandmother of irredentist crises is taking shape right here in North America, and there’s every reason to think it will blow sky-high in the not too distant future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the third and last of the hot button topics I want to discuss as we close in on the end of the current sequence of posts on the end of American empire, and yes, I’m talking about the southern border of the United States. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Many Americans barely remember that the southwestern quarter of the United States used to be the northern half of Mexico. Most of them never learned that the Mexican War, the conflict that made that happen, was a straightforward act of piracy. (As far as I know, nobody pretended otherwise at the time—the United States in those days had not yet fallen into the habit of dressing up its acts of realpolitik in moralizing cant.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>North of the Rio Grande, if the Mexican War comes to mind at all, it’s usually brushed aside with bland insouciance: we won, you lost, get over it. South of the Rio Grande? Every man, woman and child knows all the details of that war, and they have not gotten over it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That might not matter much on this side of the border, except for two things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first, which I’ve discussed here several times, is the dominant fact of 21st century North American geopolitics, the failure of US settlement in the dryland West.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the heyday of American expansion, flush with ample wealth from undepleted resources and unexhausted topsoil, the United States flung a pattern of human ecology nurtured on the well-watered soils of the Ohio and upper Mississippi valleys straight across the continent, dotting the Great Plains and the dry lands between the mountains with farms and farm towns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The dream was that these would follow the same trajectory as their predecessors further east, and turn into a permanently settled agricultural hinterland feeding wealth into newborn cities.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Dust Bowl of the 1930s was the first sign that this grand fantasy was not going to be fulfilled. Behind the catastrophic impact of farming techniques poorly suited to the fragile western soils was a deeper, natural cycle of drought, one that the native peoples of the West knew well but white settlers<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>were by and large too arrogant to learn. Since then, as the vulnerability of agriculture on the southern Plains to cyclical drought and other ecological challenges has become more and more clear, the usual response—throw more money and technology at it—has solved problems in the near term by turning them into insoluble predicaments in the longer term.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, for example, farmers faced with drought turned to irrigation using water from underground aquifers that date from the Ice Age and haven’t been replenished since then, gaining temporary prosperity at the cost of permanent ruin later on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The details vary from region to region but the effect is the same. Across the dryland West, from the Great Plains to the Cascade and Sierra Nevada ranges, a new kind of ghost town is emerging alongside the old breed from the days of the gold and silver rushes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Homes, churches, schools, city halls sit empty as tumbleweeds roll down the streets; with the decline of the old agricultural economy, all the townsfolk, or all but a few stubborn retirees, have gone elsewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are county-sized areas in several of the Plains states these days that once again fit the old definition of frontier: fewer than two non-Native American people per square mile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In response, the vacuum is being filled by the nearest nation that has enough spare people and cultural vitality for the job. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I encourage those of my readers who doubt this claim to book a long bus trip through any of the major agricultural regions of the United States west of the Mississippi valley. You’ll want the run that stops at every other two-bit farm town along the way, because that’s where you’re going to see a significant part of America’s future: the towns that are Mexican by every standard except for a few lines on a map. It’s not just that the signs are all in Spanish; the movie posters in the video shop windows are for Mexican movies, the snacks in the gas stations are Mexican brands, the radio announcers are talking excitedly about Mexican sports teams and the people on the street are wearing Mexican fashions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Such towns aren’t limited these days to the quarter of the United States that used to be half of Mexico; they can be found in most of the country’s agricultural regions, and increasingly beyond them as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the United States, this isn’t something you talk about. There’s plenty of rhetoric about immigration from Mexico, to be sure, but nearly all of it focuses on the modest fraction of those immigrants who cross into the US illegally. Behind that focus is another thing people in the United States don’t talk about, which is the bitter class warfare between America’s middle class and its working class. Illegal immigration is good for the middle class, because illegal immigrants—who have effectively no rights and thus can be paid starvation wages for unskilled and semiskilled labor—drive down the cost of labor, and thus decrease the prices of goods and services that middle class people want. By the same token, illegal immigration is bad for the working class, because the same process leaves working class Americans with shrinking paychecks and fewer job opportunities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nobody in the middle class wants to admit that it’s in their economic interest to consign the American working class to misery and impoverishment; nobody in the working class wants to use the language of class warfare, for fear of handing rhetorical weapons to the next class down; so both sides bicker about a convenient side issue, which in this case happens to be illegal immigration, and they bicker about it in the shrill moral language that afflicts discussions of most issues in today’s America, so that the straightforward political and economic issues don’t come up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Meanwhile, the demographic shift continues, and redefines the future history and cultural landscape of the North American continent. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Students of history will recognize in the failure of US settlement in the dryland West a familiar pattern, one that is also under way on the other side of the Pacific—the Russian settlement of Siberia is turning into a dead end of the same kind, and immigrants from China and other Asian countries are flooding northwards there, quite probably laying the foundations for a Greater China that may someday extend west to the Urals and north to the Arctic Ocean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, there’s another pattern at work in North America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To make sense of it, a glance at one of the core sources of inspiration for this blog—the writings of Arnold Toynbee—will be helpful. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Central to Toynbee’s project, and to the sprawling 12-volume work <i>A Study of History</i> that came out of it, was the idea of putting corresponding stages in the rise and fall of civilizations side by side, and seeing what common factors could be drawn from the comparison. Simple in theory, that proved to be a gargantuan undertaking in practice, which is why nearly all of Toynbee’s career as a writer of history was devoted to that one project. The result is a core resource for the kind of work I’m trying to do in this blog: the attempt to gauge the shape of our future by paying attention to the ways similar patterns have worked out in the historic past. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One pattern that has plenty of examples on offer is the evolution of borderland regions caught between an imperial power and a much poorer and less technologically complex society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Imperial China and central Asia, the Roman world and the Germanic barbarians, the Toltecs of ancient Mexico and their Chichimec neighbors to the north—well, the list goes on. It’s a very common feature of history, and it unfolds in a remarkably precise and stereotyped way.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first phase of that unfoldment begins with the rise and successful expansion of the imperial power. That expansion quite often involves the conquest of lands previously owned by less wealthy and powerful nations next door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For some time thereafter, neighboring societies that are not absorbed in this way are drawn into the imperial power’s orbit and copy its political and cultural habits—German tribal chieftains mint their own pseudo-Roman coins and drape themselves in togas, people very far from America copy the institutions of representative democracy and don blue jeans, and so on. A successful empire has a charisma that inspires imitation, and while it retains its ascendancy, that charisma makes the continued domination of its borderlands easy to maintain. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s when the ascendancy fails and the charisma crumbles that things start to get difficult. Toynbee uses a neat if untranslatable Latin pun to denote the difference: the charisma of a successful imperial power makes its borderlands a <i>limen</i> or doorway, while the weakening of its power and the collapse of its charisma compels it to replace the
<i>limen</i> with a <i>limes</i>, a defensive wall. Very often, in fact, it’s when a physical wall goes up along the border that the imperial power, in effect, serves notice to its historians that its days are numbered. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Once the wall goes up, literally or figuratively, the focus shifts to the lands immediately outside it, and those lands go through a series of utterly predictable stages. As economic and political stresses mount along the boundary, social order collapses and institutions disintegrate, leaving power in the hands of a distinctive social form, the warband—a body of mostly young men whose sole trade is violence, and who are bound by personal loyalties to a charismatic warlord.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At first, nascent warbands strive mostly with one another and with the crumbling institutions of their own countries, but before long their attention turns to the much richer pickings to be found on the other side of the wall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Raids and counter-raids plunge the region into a rising spiral of violence that the warbands can afford much more easily than the imperial government. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The final stages of the process depend on the broader pattern of decline. In Toynbee’s analysis, a civilization in decline always divides into a dominant minority, which maintains its power by increasingly coercive means, and an internal proletariat—that is, the bulk of the population, who are formally part of the civilization but receive an ever smaller share of its benefits and become ever more alienated from its values and institutions. This condition applies to the imperial state and its inner circle of allies; outside that core lies the world of the external proletariat—in the terms used in earlier posts here, these are the peoples subjected to the business end of the imperial wealth pump, whose wealth flows inward to support the imperial core but who receive few benefits in exchange. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The rise of warband culture drives the collapse of that arrangement. As warbands rise, coalesce, and begin probing across the border, the machinery that concentrates wealth in the hands of the dominant minority begins to break apart; tax revenues plunge as wealth turns into warband plunder, and the imperial state’s capacity to enforce its will dwindles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The end comes when the internal proletariat, pushed to the breaking point by increasingly frantic demands from the dominant minority, throws its support to the external proletariat—or, more to the point, to the successful leadership of one or more of the external proletariat’s biggest warbands—and the empire begins its final collapse into a congeries of protofeudal statelets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Much more often than not, that’s how the final crisis of a civilization unfolds; it’s also one standard way that common or garden variety empires fall, even when they don’t take a civilization down with them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As the United States faces the end of its overseas empire and the drastic contraction of an economy long inflated by imperial tribute, in other words, it faces a massive difficulty much closer to home:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>a proud and populous nation on its southern border, with a vibrant culture but disintegrating political institutions, emergent warbands of the classic type, a large and growing demographic presence inside US borders, and a burning sense of resentment directed squarely at the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is not a recipe for a peaceful imperial decline. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nor is there much hope that the classic pattern can be evaded:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the wall has already gone up, in the most literal sense, and the usual consequences are following.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The warbands?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The US media calls them “drug gangs,” since their involvement in drug smuggling across the border makes good copy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>They haven’t yet completed the trajectory that will make them the heirs of the Huns and Visigoths, and in particular, the rock-star charisma that surrounds great warlords in an age of imperial collapse has only just begun to flicker around the most successful leaders of the nascent Mexican warbands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Give it time; the glorification of the gangster life that pervades popular culture toward the bottom of the socioeconomic pyramid these days shows that the seeds of that change have long since been planted. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Can anything be done to prevent this from proceeding all the way to its normal completion?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At this stage in the game, probably not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>An empire in the days of its power can sometimes stop the spiral by conquering the entire region—not merely the border area, but all the way out to the nearest major geographical barrier—and absorbing it fully into the imperial system; that’s why Gaul, which had been a source of constant raids against Roman interests early on, didn’t produce many warbands of its own in the years of decline until it was conquered and settled by Germanic tribes from points further east. Had the United States conquered all of Mexico in the 1870s, admitted its states into the Union, and integrated Mexican society fully into the American project,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>that might have worked, but it’s far too late in the day for that; the polarization of the borderlands is already a fact, so is the bitterness of a dispossessed people, and so is the ongoing unraveling of American power. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The other endpoint of the process—the
<i>only</i> other endpoint of the process that can be found anywhere in recorded history—is the collapse of the imperial power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The United States has prepared plenty of other disasters for itself, by way of its unusually clueless choices in recent decades, and some of them are likely to hit well before the defense of the southern border becomes its most pressing and insoluble security problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, I would encourage those of my readers who live in the dryland West, especially those within a state or so of the southern border, to keep an eye open for the first tentative raids, and perhaps to read up on what happened to those parts of the Roman Empire most directly exposed to warband incursions in the twilight years of Roman rule. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I would also like to ask any of my readers who are incensed by the above to stop, take a deep breath, and pay attention to what is and is not being said here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Again, the shrill rhetoric of moral judgment that treats every political question as an opportunity for self-righteous indignation, popular as it is, has no particular value in this context.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More than a century and a half ago, American politicians decided to go to war with Mexico; over the next century or so, as a result of that decision and its cascading consequences, the social order basic to any viable society will most likely be shredded over a sizable part of what is now the United States, and stay that way for a good long time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s simply one of the things that can happen when an empire falls, and it’s something many of us can expect to see here in America in the years ahead. </div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: large">End of the World of the Week #50</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As previous entries in this series have shown, predicting the end of the world is a chancy business, and your likelihood of being proved wrong and made to eat crow is very high. There’s at least one way to avoid that awkward detail, though—make sure you don’t survive to see the failure of the prophecy—and a certain number of apocalyptic true believers have used that escape hatch. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Orderof the Solar Temple—l’Ordre du Temple Solaire, for purists—was one of those. It emerged out of the New Age scene in the late 1980s, attracting a wealthy clientele in Quebec and a variety of European countries with a free mix of New Age philosophy and rituals borrowed from a range of occult traditions. Its founders, Luc Jouret and Joseph Di Mambro, started with a set of utopian fantasies of the usual sort, but as time passed and a New Age of peace and brotherhood unaccountably failed to dawn, they strayed further and further into the apocalyptic flip side of those fantasies. By the early 1990s the Solar Temple was preaching that the middle of that decade would see vast environmental catastrophes that would exterminate most if not all of the human race. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Most prophets of doom prefer to wait around, like Harold Camping, to see the end arrive, but Jouret, Di Mambro, and many of their followers were made of sterner stuff. That’s why they killed themselves en masse over a period of a few days late in November, 1994. The vast environmental catastrophes failed to arrive, of course, but that was no longer anything Jouret or Di Mambro had to worry about. </div>

Three points immediately jump out at me:<br>1 - In 'the Nine Nations of North America' Joel Garreau (sp?) pointed out that the LA and Houston anchor the northern end of what he termed "Mexamerica." He pointed out that many ethnically Mexican families have deep roots in the area dating back to before the Mexican War, and that many of them had somewhat assimilated into the broader US culture. I wonder what their fate will be as the empire breaks apart?<br>2 - In 2004, when the current round of border fence nonsense began, I was a senior in college. I had majored in Russian and noted the similarities between the Russian Far East and the US Southwest. Climate change might back the Russian Far East more viable for human settlement in the coming centuries, but I'm not so sure the same can be said for the already water-stressed US Southwest.<br>3 - On my way to work yesterday I heard a report on NPR about the effects the 'drug war' in Mexico is having on the mental health of Mexican youth (children earning money as drug mules, imitating gang behavior at school). It seems that this trend is what happened in the inner cities in the 1980s thanks to the crack epidemic and in many rural white areas in the 1990s thanks to the meth epidemic. Do you think the warband culture will have appeal across ethnic groups, or will different ethnic groups adopt their own 'brand' of warband culture as the violence and chaos escalates?<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c8347363087320715782 title="comment permalink">11/28/12, 8:13 PM</a><br><br>

It makes perfect sense in that context that as the ability to project American military power declines, the client states are left twisting in the wind first.

I had to look up "irredentist", because my previous understanding of it's meaning had to do with the desire of a population to move its part of a country to become part of the neighboring country, perhaps because I had first used it associated with Northern Ireland. (For me, it's an interesting diagnostic of my pattern of learning new words mostly from context, rather than actually looking them up.)<br><br>But my vocabulary failure actually brings up a related question: Whether parts of the country may actually <i> prefer </i> to become part of the neighboring land. If Mexico does descend into the kind of gang barbarism that you describe, all bets are off. But if that country gets its act together during the initial stages of our imperial decline, I could see many of the remaining residents of California (as well as those of other border states) calmly pledging allegiance in Spanish. <br><br><br><br><a href=on-border.html#c1652321748943488184 title="comment permalink">11/28/12, 8:42 PM</a><br><br>

(And this comment is <i>not</i> intended as an endorsement of one political party or another, but just as an observation of the trend.)<br><br>With the governorships of Deukmejian in the 80's and particularly those of Pete Wilson in the '90's, the Republicans were able to dominate state politics by becoming increasingly vitriolic and open with their racism. It worked for a while, as less educated white voters (and particularly older ones) became increasingly frightened of the demographic changes in the state, and voted at very high rates for that party.<br><br>But at the same time, every immigrant or immigrant's child I knew (even from places like Denmark and India) registered to vote and began to vote regularly. And the new 18-22 year olds started to vote at higher rates and with more allegiance to the (then) opposition party.<br><br>In the latest election, the transition is complete, with Democrats even winning a veto-proof supermajority in both houses of the state legislature. <br><br>In the last few years, Arizona has moved from its Deukmejian decade to its Wilson decade, but the writing is on the wall.

And indeed the language back there is Spanish, especially west of the Mississippi. There's a small English-speaking crew in the office, and a much larger Spanish-speaking crew doing the work and loading your truck. If you can't at least count (up through the thousands, not just "uno, dos, tres,...") and understand rudimentary directions and terminology in Spanish, you are at a distinct disadvantage. You will get along better in a Mexican Mall*Wart without Spanish than in a warehouse in the northern U.S. plains almost within sight of the Canadian border. Same is true for construction crews, restaurant workers, etc. all across the U.S., north to south. I commented a decade ago to some of our middle class Anglo friends in Colorado that the U.S. was inevitably going to become a part of Latin America, and they thought I was delusional. When I described my experiences in the places where the real work happens, they said "I've not seen that at all."

That's why I suggest keeping an eye out for the first signs that cross-border raids are beginning. <br><br>Ben, to go by previous examples, the warbands will be ethnically determined at first, but not for long. By the time of the great invasions, the warbands will be as multiethnic as any liberal could ask -- I think of Attila, whose name we don't know ("Attila" is a bit of Visigothic slang meaning "Daddy"), who had a Greek secretary named Orestes, and whose army was a jumble of every ethnic group in eastern Europe. <br><br>Orestes the secretary had another claim to fame, btw. His son, while still a child, ended up being made Emperor under the name Romulus Augustulus, and in 476 CE he was deposed by another mixed crew of barbarians who for some reason didn't bother to name anybody else to the throne. That's how the Roman Empire in the West ended -- and if you think about the kind of social convulsions that would put the son of Attila the Hun's secretary on the imperial throne, you might get some sense of the way imperial societies get fed into the blender in an age of collapse. <br><br>Steve, your image of Texas is certainly one possibility, though it's as possible that the US might lose a fight, not by being slowly worn down, but all at once. As for sources on Rome's border regions, I'm partial to John Morris' <i>The Age of Arthur</i> -- no longer wholly up to date, but its portrayal of a Roman province dissolving into chaos remains vivid and worth study. <br><br>Godozo, I've seen the same thing in a good many states. <br><br>Jose, an interesting idea. As for Arizona, I was worried not too long ago that it would become the flashpoint for open violence along the border; whether it follows the same trajectory as California is, to my mind, an open question. <br><br>Bill, the sky is black with chickens coming home to roost, but the middle class gringos insist that everything's fine because their big plasma screens show no such thing. <br><br>Jeffrey, I can certainly see being ashamed of suits and ties -- to my knowledge, no other human culture has ever had garments as awkward and ugly. As for your broader point, a lot depends on complex issues involving culture and power -- some cultures enthusiastically adopt foreign models, others borrow bits and pieces here and there and fit them all anyhow into existing cultural matrices. <br><br>Castus, "barbarous" is the right word. That's standard warband behavior -- you'll find plenty of similar stories from the twilight of the Roman world. Sheer brutal frightfulness is one of the core qualities of a successful warband. You're not being irrational, either; as I commented to Bill, the sky is black with chickens coming home to roost.<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c8787610910040307612 title="comment permalink">11/28/12, 9:48 PM</a><br><br>

I would ask if you've read Joseph Tainter's "The Collapse of Complex Societies" because his case against being able to prevent collapse is simpler: imperial powers can not prevent collapse, only delay it, because imperial power itself sows the very seeds of its own collapse through purely economic costs. The very solutions to impending collapse are the causes that create the collapse down the road. Your discussion of the dust bowl and the failure of agriculture in the Western US struck me as exactly what he was talking about.<br><br>I would like, however, to make one point about the Goths. According to the works of Peter Heather and Herwig Wolfram, the Visigoths and Ostrogoths really arose as cultural entities inside the Roman Empire. This makes them very different from the Huns, Franks, Vandels, and the like. Both authors above spend a lot of space tracing the movements of the Goths inside the Empire for centuries before they finally took over Italy and Iberia.<br><br>So one thing not quite discussed here is the question of internal warbands and cultural separatism tearing the nation apart.<br><br>Wolfram btw, in "The Roman Empire and Its Germanic Peoples" also points out that the Western Empire failed much faster because it had a much greater disparity of wealth than the Eastern Empire, and this meant that they couldn't raise enough money in taxes to maintain a sufficiently strong military. This raises an aspect I haven't seen you address in depth yet which is how the rising disparity of wealth threatens the tax base and hence the military spending on which the empire rests.<br><br><br><br><a href=on-border.html#c4202471766963795697 title="comment permalink">11/29/12, 12:36 AM</a><br><br>

This is the first post in which I have some direct experience because I have lived in Texas for the last 40 years. I'm also a licensed professional engineer who gets paid for strategic analysis (10-30+ year time frame).<br><br>Rather than disagree with your analysis I'll probe with a few strategic questions and comments that you may choose to address in future posts.<br><br>1. The internet and drone strikes give the dominant power much more knowledge and the ability to surgically act on that knowledge when compared to empires of the past.<br><br>If you can kill the smart leaders on a fairly regular basis does this mean that the warband will have a much more difficult time organizing beyond the small warband stage?<br><br>2. Darwinian selection: People with brains, risk tolerance, and/or a great work ethic leave Mexico to go work in the USA. Are we slowly but surely creating a Gaza strip on our southern border? Without good leadership, discipline, and a work ethic it is difficult for a gang to do more than annoy the empire.<br><br>3. Food security. Ultimately doesn't everything revolve around keeping the masses fed and relatively happy? As long as we have the Mississippi river system and good rail transport we can move food around. As long as we have enough energy to farm (natural gas) we can feed our people. Well fed people do not revolt. Read Stratfors analysis of the importance of rivers and geography for more info.<br><br>4. Energy: as long as we have electricity we can survive with style (see Jerry Pournelle). It is both technically and economically feasible to provide electricity to the entire grid by simply placing a Navy Nuclear power plant on every army base and attaching it into the grid. The US Navy knows how to safely operate reactors. We have enough fisionables to last for a few centuries. Politically difficult, but when the middle class is hit with rolling blackouts they quit complaining. Plus many Army bases are mostly in the middle of nowhere and the locals love the Army so you avoid NIMBY.<br><br>Jim Coffey<br>My views are my own and have nothing to do with my employer past, present, or future.<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c8174481649643648949 title="comment permalink">11/29/12, 7:52 AM</a><br><br>

I don't think there will be any obstacle there. <br><br>News, that's the same middle class-working class conflict I outlined in the post, with the middle class encouraging massive immigration for its own economic benefit. If I lived in Europe, I'd be watching the Arab world, and watching it very nervously. <br><br>Ray, best of luck! <br><br>Cherokee, historically speaking, your chances of negotiating with warbands go up over time. In the first phase of semirandom raids, all they care about is plunder and the most brutal kinds of "fun"; later on, successful warlords start to rein things in, and purveyors of goods and services that warband members want can do quite well. Aspiring rap poets take note: warband members in all previous historical periods have a limitless appetite for lively poems praising their exploits. <br><br>NoHype, I see Texas most likely going down fighting, but going down. California's another matter, since it's likely to evolve into a hybrid Mexican-Asian culture, far from supportive of the dysfunctional gringocracy currently in charge. <br><br>Steve, this is all I got. Perhaps you can give it another try. <br><br>Chris, I've discussed Tainter's work repeatedly here -- yes, I've read him! As for disparities of wealth, there's an apples-and-oranges issue there; the late Roman elite in the West had control of actual wealth, in the form of real estate and other concrete assets, while the vast majority of wealth owned by the rich in today's America consists of hallucinations (that is, derivatives, asset-backed securities, and other paper that would be worth a fraction of its face value if anyone ever tried to cash it in). My guess, which I've also raised here more than once, is that the apparent disparities will go away in a hurry as the rickety structure of economic make-believe propping it up comes apart. <br><br>Taraxacum, I hadn't heard about that. Okay, that's a warning sign that should be attended to. <br><br>Phil, I'm familiar with the book -- it got discussed at some length in <a href=../../2008/04/specialization-trap.html rel=nofollow>this 2008 post</a>.

Here in the Delta region of Mississippi, anyone who has irrigable land would be a fool not to make the investment, and we get a lot more annual rainfall than they do. The difference in farm rent for irrigated vs non-irrigated is something like $40/acre. But the fear about aquifers running dry is largely overdone.<br><br>Most of the Midwest aquifers are in alluvial or porous sedimentary bedrock formations that get regular recharge from surface water sources. There is a very real concern about the rate of withdrawals from industrial agriculture, which has caused water table declines, and therefore greater expense and energy use in pumping. But if irrigation were to decline for any period of time, you would see the water tables recover pretty rapidly.<br><br>What this means, in the context of this blog, is that business as usual is probably unsustainable. It does not mean that groundwater will cease to be a resource in the region as aquifers are depleted.<br><br>The worrisome stories you hear are about the bigger prehistoric aquifers of the plains and mid-southwest, generally lumped into the Ogalala (probably misspelled that.) While the age of those aquifers isn't a whole lot different than the Midwest, they are located in arid regions where there is no sufficient source of recharge and at depths where recharge from the meager sources (e.g., the Rocky Mountain front range) is too slow to be significant.<br><br>There are also areas here and there like the San Joaquin Valley of California where the nature of the aquifer-bearing substrate will not allow recharge due to structural collapse after drainage. These aquifers are essentially lost after depletion.<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c2290748142011974219 title="comment permalink">11/29/12, 7:55 AM</a><br><br>

The articles there describe aspects of what I've seen during my own visits to the country, as well as what I've read in books like <i>In the Shadow of the Giant</i> by Joseph Contreras: namely, that Mexico is undergoing cultural and demographic shifts nearly as dramatic as those in the USA.<br><br>Mexican families are producing far fewer children -- an average of 2.4 children per family, as opposed to more than six children per family in the 1970s and more than four in the 1980s. Immigration to the U.S. from Mexico is now equal to the numbers of Mexicans returning home from the U.S. (1.4 million in each direction, per the Pew Hispanic Center). And as the influence of the Catholic church continues to diminish, Mexicans' social attitudes are changing (the D.F. -- Mexico City, basically -- has legalized same-sex marriage, for example, with those marriage recognized nationwide with no huge backlash), with a more globalized outlook and U.S.-oriented consumerism to match. After 12 years out of power, a president from the once-long-ruling PRI party takes office this Saturday, and unlike his predecessors, he's not expected to be able to rely on anti-U.S. scapegoating to win votes and popularity.<br><br>All this is to say that, while I agree that the U.S. Southwest will only become increasingly "Mexicanized," Mexico itself is becoming less inward-looking and, thanks in large part to smaller family sizes, less impoverished. <br><br>That isn't to say that modern-day Mexico-Visigoths won't arrive in desperate, marauding numbers deep into the age of peak oil, but I do think we'll have and be our own barbarians by then anyway.<br><br>Incidentally, I feel that these facts often get lost in rhetoric about U.S.-Mexico history: At the time of the U.S. land grab in 1848, Mexico had only been an independent country for less than three decades, and the vast swathes of territory that were its north were, apart from wholly indigenous people and scattered Spanish missions and ranches, unpopulated. It's quite obvious but also somehow forgotten that Spanish is no more "native" to a place like Mexico than English is to the U.S.; both are the languages of colonizers.<br><br>The other half of the statement "The U.S. stole land from Mexico" is that Spain had no more "right" to be in the Americas than Britain did. We're all of us on both sides of the border reaping the benefits of centuries-old colonialism. What is now the U.S. West and Southwest was a big bunch of land that could only be considered "Spanish" in a short-term, colonial sense. It was claimed by one colonizing power before another colonizing power made a grab for it.<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c8414002705072378473 title="comment permalink">11/29/12, 8:23 AM</a><br><br>

We watch American movies, TV shows, have nearly identical business models, and are, to a large degree, indistinguishable in our daily lives. Of course, having the same base-stock of immigrants, the same European political antecedents, very similar geography and extrordinarily close political ties made this very easy, despite the "open border" is closing in recent years. The current decline is already showing cracks and strains in our politics and society at all levels. But we're now trying to become a client state of the next expected hegemon and that is going to be very rough on a lot of people, but no threat to the U.S.<br>I subscribe to a daily economic financial report mostly because I'm curious to observe the mis-match between what the banks and financial institutions and officaldom is reporting on paper and what people are experiencing and reporting from daily life.<br>The reports are replete with numbers and statistics about growth and new home starts and sales and everything is couched in terms relating to growth as Good and Necessary cause for joy whereas contraction ("negative growth") is dismissed as a temporary "weakness". One thing I have noticed is the numbers keep getting smaller, but the language remains the same.

I checked out your assertions very quickly. The 9th ward is 99% re-built, with pretty new homes and smart neighbourhoods, with only the odd vacant lot or unrepaired building to recall the devastation. At odds with the claim that New Orleans is still wrecked.<br>Then I selected, at random, three smaller towns in the surrounding area and saw just what you described: devastation and decripitude. The downtown cores gutted with buildings never reconstructed after Katrina, shops and businesses closed and shuttered.<br>But it's not just Katrina or Sandy.<br>I visited Kansas City four years ago, and took the opportunity to travel through Gary, Chicago, St. Louis (or is it Sanloo? ;-] ), Sisanadi... ahem... OK... what I observed was vast areas of decripitude and decay. Buildings, manufacturies, warehouses: empty and falling apart, broken windows, faded signs from long-defunct businesses. Not an odd building here and there, mind, you, but whole areas and neighbourhoods visible from the highway.<br>Along the Allegheny river (the 'scenic' route) from Pittsburgh through Jamestown and Buffalo, the Allegheny National Forest was beautiful. Warren PA has some exquisite 19th century mansions throughout the core, but the rest was... not the U.S.A. as advertised.<br>After reading this post, selecting a few random towns across the midwest (Las Vegas, NM has an exquisite town square BTW), and you're right. It doesn't take but a couple of moments to find third-world poverty and archeological sites in small towns across the midwest.<br>I am, quite frankly, at a loss to find where in Sam Hill the "world's greatest economy", in the worlds richest nation, that consumes 30% of the worlds resources actually is. As far as I can determine, it exists only on paper or in small enclaves.<br>Oh, and one final aside of interest, the President of Mexico wants to rename his country to... "Mexico". It seems it was originally, and offcially still is, named the United States of Mexico in emulation of the United States of America. But they now have a different view of the situation.

In many ways the sort of people coming here to work hard and make a life for themselves are the exact opposite of the drug gangs, may in fact be fleeing from them as would we all.

One of my pet subjects is the decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire (the Eastern Empire didn’t fall for another 1000 years of course). I guess one of the points you were alluding to at the end of the article is how different parts of the Empire “fell”. Britain retained practically no traces of the Roman project. The Anglo-Saxon and Celtic successor states did not have a Roman based language or culture. Conversely Gaul, even though it was taken over by ‘German’ war bands, retained a latin language, legal structure and bureaucracy.<br><br>Another point not to be missed is that in the Late Roman empire many of these ‘barbarian war bands’ were also part of the regular Roman Army, in fact some were both army regulars and raiders. Alaric and his Visigoths famous for the first sack of Rome were previously gainfully employed by the Roman state, and even after this were settled in Gaul to ‘keep the peace’. So when these ‘barbarians’ took over it might not have been quite the shock it now seems (for a wonderful book on contemporary Roman reactions to this change in the power structure see Ralph W. Mathisen - Roman Aristocrats in Barbarian Gaul: Strategies for Survival in an Age of Transition). I fear I can envisage a time when maybe individual states (or indeed central government) might start recruiting ‘foreign muscle’ when the indigenous population gets restless.. and not only in the US…<br><br>Two recent books on all the above that I would recommend are Matthew Innes - Introduction to Early Medieval Western Europe, 300-900: The Sword, the Plough and the Book, and Guy Halsall - Barbarian Migrations and the Roman West, 376-568<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c9116905505649381860 title="comment permalink">11/29/12, 9:24 AM</a><br><br>

It's one of the many bits of the future I wish I could stay around to see. <br><br>Rabtter, the war on drugs is a system of price supports for organized crime. I sometimes think that's its intended purpose -- the end of Prohibition clobbered the old syndicates, you know. <br><br>Jason, some books are recommended by posters further down. As for Charles Martel, you're one to two centuries too early, in all probability. <br><br>William, bingo.

I grew up in the Southwest, I agree that something like what you say is happening and no moral outrage is going to stop it. Back a few years ago, George Friedman was mocked as a fool when he asserted the possibility that one day the relative power polarity between New York and Mexico City might shift in favor of the latter, but it seemed to me an idea worth considering. It still does. <br><br>However, this post raises some concerns. <br><br>The first is geopolitical. Mexico lost all that land in the 19th century not just because the US was more rapacious than the Mexicans. The Mexicans had a large, well-trained army and they knew how to use it. Their problem was that the dryland west of North America was really far from Mexico City, beyond mountains and deserts: hard to settle, and hard to manage if it were settled. They tried hard to settle it for 300 years, but in the end were reduced to inviting in Anglos (e.g. Texas) and you see what happened. That geographic problem remains: Mexican civilization might come to dominate the dryland west, but geographical barriers are likely to make it so politically fragmented that the eastern third of North America would still be in a highly dominant position, just as it is now.<br><br>My second concern is more theoretical. Is the Anglo civilization of Western North America failing because of resource depletion, or because of some kind of inevitable logic of the decline and fall of empire? You've read Toynbee so you know he says very little about resource depletion or pollution -- only a few scattered comments very late in the project, and in later works of the 1970s. But it was never central to his argument. For Toynbee, it doesn't matter whether resources are limited or infinite: empires and civilizations rise and fall according to the natural progression of their life processes. Toynbee is nothing if not "organic" in his thinking. <br><br>Do civilizations fail and fall because of resource depletion, or because of some innate logic of growth and decline? Shouldn't it be one or the other?<br><br>Anyway, another great blog post, provoking and insightful.

I'm not from the area and moved here recently, so I'm looking at the community with outsider's eyes.<br>The area is beautiful but the inhabitants have been beaten down by history. This town fell on very hard times as local manufacturing fled the US in the 1970s and 80s. Much of the downtown area has been 'revitalized' and does not look like it did even 30 years ago (if old photographs can be trusted :-P ). That same downtown is fairly bereft of activity after the bank HQ shuts down at 5pm. All the economic 'activity' happens in the strip mall up in North Warren. There is still some local manufacturing, though I'm not sure if its the kind that might matter to locals after the oil age decline really sets in.<br>To the topic of the Mexican border, Mexican immigrants work some of the farms up here.

As for the other points, er, no -- drones and the internet are as easily used against the US as for it, the rise of warband culture along the border may chase out people with a work ethic but it's going to attract people who are good at fighting and leading, and current pie-in-the-sky estimates of natural gas are the products of a speculative bubble now in the process of losing air, and should be taken in the same sense as those claims a few years ago that housing prices could keep on climbing forever.<br><br>Mike, as with most irredentist claims, the political impact is a function of popular opinion rather than any more objective factor. As for Mexico's transformations, all true, though <i>The Economist</i> did its usual job of cherrypicking stats to back up its preferred narrative of progress via free markets; the areas that matter, in terms of the analysis in my post, are the northern tier of states, where warband formation is well under way.

As such I do not see them as vast reservoirs of poor immigrants, or out of control failed states. That is not to say that the arab world doesn't have problems but Egypt, Saudi and Yemen are a long way away, the equivalent of Venezuela or Peru to the US. The journey from there to europe is not as easy as crossing the rio grande and southern Russia is probably emptier and closer.

It is far more common that the ex-empire denizerns get their act together atleast in part of the borderlands and hold the fort against both the empire and the invaders ;) Even the West Rome fall had some cases of rebel governors holding the fort ( sometimes literally ) against the "barbarians" with temporary alliances on both sides constantly shifting ( Just read the story of Gerontius ( on Honorius days ) and his constant manouvering of the Franks vs the Visigoths while rebelling against Honorius for a colourful example ;) ). I would probably be more surprised by a complete breakdown of the American west via more or less armed Mexicanization than with the forming of some Americanized border statelets ( with a mirror image on the Mexican side ) with both locked in perpetual low grade warfare with eachother and with any remaining would be reuniter of the former glory Empire ( not that I'm expecting that the "border" between both is anywhere near the current one :D ) . <br><br>That state of affairs can hold for centuries ( see the original "Reconquista" that was locked in back and forth movements and foamy border states in both sides until one of the sides states gathered enough critical mass to overcome the other ) and, with the long story of rebellious feelings in both sides of the border fringe areas against their capitals, I do think that this is a more probable outcome, atleast on the 1-2 centuries scale.

That is more a recipe for a rehash of the ol'Med piracy and raiding than of colonization ( not that classical greek-style colonies could not form here and there, between large spaces ) . I do not deny that the large muslim populations of England, France or Germany will try their bid sooner or later, but even if they do, I am midly sure they would fight as much against their perceived Christian opressors ( or not so much percieved as real, like in France nowadays ) as against any Morrocan or Lybian warband that tried to go there . I strongly suspect that in general Europe will dissolve itself in a myriad of statelets as the cost of keeping together people that doesn't want to be together becomes too high for the decaying avaliable physical and human energy to counter it. Maybe we will end with a enlarged HRE-like power structure, with some nibs in the south by some enterprising Morrocans or Tunisians :D So, in resume, I would look more for the less socially cohesive states in Europe to get some serious social stress ( say, places like Spain, Belgium or the UK ) or even outright rebelion ( or, most likely, something in between, like isolated areas minting their paralel coin and acting more or less independently of the central governement ). The bad part is that you can already see signs of all of that nowadays :/<br><br>Oh, and a personal pet peeve: <i>There is no such thing as a Spanish language</i>. Not even in Spain they call the first official language Spanish ... as the real name is Castillian. I know that is relatively common in the Americas to call Castillian Spanish, but that is like calling Swahilli or Somali African ( as Spain, before being a country name, is a geographical term ;) ). I know, just a pet peeve, but it irks me :p<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c6891443926799776953 title="comment permalink">11/29/12, 12:45 PM</a><br><br>

The reason for it is because the use of "Spanish" as the name of the language is of recent coinage ( the wiki point out that the first time it was recognized as a alternative correct form was in 1923 ) and even in the Spanish speaking world it is far from consensual. In Spain itself currently it is officially coined as Castellano as you point ( unlike Español, that is the correct translation of the term Spanish ). There is a lot of politics behind this back and forth, but I'll get to that below.<br><br>@ jphilip <br><br>You are right in saying that nothing would stop a England or a Castille of imposing their will in their backyards ( not exactly in this case, but more on that below ), but you need to remember that both England and Castille are not exactly a inevitable result of the geography, thus not being a assured thing in the future. England in itself only exists on this current form because of a mess of viking and Norman invasions<br>and there is literally nothing that prevents it of becoming the balkanized region it was in the Saxon kings time, with pretty much no power to project. Castille is even worse, because what is currently known as Castille was always the poorest region of the Iberian penisula ( just read something about the Roman conquest of the area, especially about the siege of Numantia to get a idea ) and the only reason the region gained ascendacy was because of the north south direction of the Reconquista ( that allowed the Castillian royalty to control the Asturias and Andalucia ), the fact that Galicia and Portugal parted ways and the fact that the central position of Castille allowed them to pick on the richer coastal lands in one side or another at more or less leisure ( this added to the fact that Portugal and Aragon passed far more time trying to see who dominated Castille instead of uniting efforts against it. In the end it was Aragon that got the Castilian crown ... ). Nothing of this was inevitable or even expectable besides of the weak precedent of the Visigoth monarchy, so I would also not put all my chips on that...<br><br>On the Spanish and Franco question ... well, I'm not so versed in Spaniard legalities, but IIRC there was only one official language in Spain in the Franco regime time. Even today if you go to a Basque or a Catalan area, you will probably will not have any dificulty to find a old man harping about your usage of the " language of the empire" if you try to speak in castilian with them. Given the pan-Spanish worldview of Franco ( His thesis on the Army school was "How to conquer Portugal in 28 days " ;) ) and the fact that the Basque and the Catalan areas were also strong bastions of the Republican Spain, that is surely not a surprise. But then again, the languages were still there anyway ... ( as a P.S. there is a ridiculous variety of languages in the Iberian penisula, especially in the northern ridges )<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c1595697846337850740 title="comment permalink">11/29/12, 4:34 PM</a><br><br>

One of the reasons that Greece has had so much trouble is that it has a low population growth rate and the current national debt of Greece is too high for future generation to be able to pay back the wealth (as opposed to the money) that has already been loaned. So the bankers stopped buying their debt/bonds. Well the US has a far greater debt, and a low birth rate and legal immigration will not be enough to provide enough future Americans to pay back the debt, especially as many legal immigrants have a low birth rate as well. So the answer to this is to turn a blind eye to illegal immigration, or to talk of things like a (second) one time amnesty and family unification. For all the high minded reasons given for an immigration bill, in reality it is about showing the world's bond buyers that there will be a large enough labor force in the future to cover the debts that are being rung up now.<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c7777588114139981617 title="comment permalink">11/29/12, 8:13 PM</a><br><br>

An insurgency (or war band) doesn't have to take out that much infrastructure to make a huge impact.<br><br>Showing the effectiveness of insurgents against our (and I literally mean ours too) forces regularly in the media with wars in foreign countries is probably a really unwise thing to do. It is a sort of training exercise.<br><br>Did you know that historically armed bands of men roamed at will through the mountain range that I live in? They mostly seemed to be tolerated / supported by the local farming families here. The reason for this is that they picked off the gold shipments en route to Melbourne.

I have been a resident of Central California for a little over a decade and had some opportunity to drive around the state and also Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico. Yes, the Hispanic influx cannot be denied. But neither can the Anglo influx. The Southwest is heavily dependent on petroleum and petroleum and electricity enabled irrigation to sustain the large populations of both Anglos and Hispanics. If the empire collapses because the petroleum runs out or becomes too expensive, then so will the population centers. The Southwest without the petroleum will support neither a large population of Anglos or Hispanics. Absence of water and energy will ultimately turn around both the Anglo and the Hispanic migrations into the area. LA without electricity will not just have to do without an internet, it will also have to do without water.

Japan has far too many people to feed on its own acreage, and as the age of abundance ends, things are going to get very harsh there. Gaijin in particular are very likely to get the short end of the stick."</i><br><br>Interestingly mainstream press today in UK is talking about the prospect of us having a lost economic decade or two along the lines of Japan. Personally, I doubt it because Japan stalled against the background of a rapidly growing world economy and much greater volumes of fuel and other world resources being brought on-line, at least until 2005. UK will not have the luxury of that context when our financial misallocation of resources into 'property bubbles' and the like takes us down the Japanese road. <br><br>I wrote a piece back in 2008 included a remark about British agricultural history when I described Britain in 1939 as essentially a cluster of large cities set in a small run-down farming area, needing to import 70% of ‘food as calories’. The farming situation since then is different, but the essential point is that we could not feed the present population with home-grown food, even if we made draconian changes in the way we live. We are about 4 persons per ploughable acre, and a significant fraction of the better land is close to sea-level.<br><br>We are suffering in Britain just now the usual political struggle between 'Atlanticists' and 'Europeans’. Both sides could be beside the point it seems to me, but inward net legal migration from new eastern EU members is becoming an ever bigger issue. Migration flows these days are so vast in both directions, including students, so that relatively smaller changes in net inward migration have large and visible effects and these have been accompanied by considerable levels of social tension.

As for the name of the language, that's one of the differences between your side of the Atlantic and mine; over here, people don't speak Castilian, but a rapidly evolving successor language combining rounded-off Castilian, bits and pieces of other Iberian languages, and influences from the old Native American languages, which is called Español by the people who speak it. <br><br>Nano, if the Zetas are already building that much infrastructure, the crisis may be closer than I thought. <br><br>Jetfire, Canada would be crazy to allow it. I suspect that what we'll get, down the road, is several post-US nations in the eastern half of the continent, more or less maintaining cultural continuity with today's United States, and possibly something similar (though highly Asian-influenced) in the Pacific Northwest. <br><br>Nathan, that's a good point; I could easily see a Mormon state hanging on in Utah and southern Idaho, at least for a while. <br><br>Wullow, that's business as usual after the kind of imperial collapse I've outlined. King Arthur was the leader of a big warband -- it's just that he was on the side of the Britons rather than that of their Saxon, Irish, and Pictish enemies -- and quite a bit of evidence suggests that he was no more obsessed with legalities than was, say, Hengist, his opposite number on the Saxon side. <br><br>Leo, a very strong current.

As for siege warfare, a lot depends on how much military technology survives how long. If effective artillery stays in use, ordinary walls aren't of any use at all, but there are other alternatives -- I wonder if anyone will remember Vauban? <br><br>Leo, that's one effect of the social schism that alienates the internal proletariat from the dominant minority -- the number of people who are willing to risk their lives for the state for patriotic reasons drops like a rock. <br><br>Mary, unfortunately I have no control over the comment software -- that's Blogger's business, not mine.

He and the other employees there all have to know at least a little Spanish, because a very large fraction of the inmates speak that language. <br><br>Tripp, thank you! It's good to see somebody else using Toynbee as a source for understanding. Your universal church, though, is lacking something...and that would be religion. I know it's unfashionable to mention this, but the urbane unbelief of imperial cultures doesn't have a lot of staying power as things start sliding downhill. <br><br>Amy, the US is far beyond the point at which its national debt can be paid off by any possible amount of economic growth -- and that would be true even if economic growth wasn't a thing of the past, as it is. It's possible that some of the people supporting immigration haven't grasped that yet, to be sure. <br><br>Tripp, much obliged, sir!<br><br>Lugh, now that you're finished yelling, you might take a deep breath, read what I've written, and notice that I'm not saying any of the things you accuse me of saying.

I suppose I'll have to add Toynbee to my reading list, right after the entry for "Life and Work in Medieval Europe." <br><br>I'm interested in how the decline of the US will play out for areas like south Louisiana, which were absorbed into the empire long ago but still retain a lingering cultural memory of their own distinct culture and folkways. That is, the more inland parts of south Louisiana like Lafayette that won't succumb to rising sea levels and ongoing coastal erosion within the next century. My guess is that the people who retain enough knowledge of the hybrid-indigenous folkways and blend those with modern appropriate tech, they might have half a chance of cultural survival. In many areas down here a subsistence lifestyle there is only 1 or 2 generations away. My Grandfather, a child of Cajun sugarcane peasants, plowed his families' subsistence garden in the 1930's and had to convince my Great-Grandmother to get electricity in 1946. But then again, what's left of the offshore oil reserves in the Gulf and Texas nationalism are big factors in how things play out, too.<br><br>As for Mr. or Ms. Lugh, I suspect he or she may be a crossover from the recent namedrop on Beck's media fiefdom. FWIW, I don't think any of Beck's "books" are worth a turnip seed.<br><br>@ Renaissance Man and others on the topic of rebuilding in New Orleans:<br><br>Yes, the 9th Ward has largely been rebuilt, but most of the financial inputs were from Brad Pitt's Make It Right Foundation and other national non-profits, not local, state or federal money that was misspent and stolen (much like the BP oil spill money will soon be). Because of the outside liberal non-profit sensibilities, many of those homes are now energy efficient and complete with rooftop PV solar and built to modern EE standards, making the area of the "greenest" US neighborhoods. <br>If you want to see examples of lingering destruction from Katrina, use Google Earth to view New Orleans East or the area just south of the University of New Orleans. Many of the small towns along the coast are also in a state of severe disrepair, but many of them were that way long before Katrina reared her ugly head. <br>The real story is the state of Louisiana's coastal marsh--it loses a football field's worth of wetland every 38 minutes, due to poor ecosystem management and the ravages of the oil and gas industry. You can clearly see the extent of erosion by comparing the satellite imagery with comparable maps, which mostly still outline the coastline of the 1950's. The reluctance of the State and Federal governments to devote the necessary resources to restore the coastal ecosystem and protect one of America's largest port systems, the oil and gas infrastructure here, and the cultural treasure of this region is a big indicator of our decline. <br>Of course, most of the city of NOLA is doomed in the next half century or so, so if you've got the urge to come visit, take it in while you can!<br><br>@JMG: While playing on Google Earth, I noticed you've got a very nice looking lodge there in Cumberland. Perhaps one day in the course of our travels I'll make a visit!<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c5868348182397768281 title="comment permalink">11/30/12, 5:48 PM</a><br><br>

Until recently this was ground zero for the Great Immigration. During the '90s there was a lot of auto theft and some border bandits, and my land was overrun, fences cut and piles of trash from immigrants who jettisoned everything. That's all gone now. The collapse of jobs, a new 16' high steel wall instead of 8 strand barbed wire, and a LOT of border patrol has made a huge difference. Interestingly, just as the foot traffic collapsed the media brawl suddenly became huge. <br><br>A few points; this is not the Roman empire. I think a better model is the waves of Italians that many thought would never be assimilated. (Their descendents are now called "white" or "anglo" or "gringo" around here). <br><br>The old hispanic families I know become progressively American. Very fast. For instance, our army and marines are made up of blacks, Latinos, and rural whites. and many of them come from and retire to AZ. So not only do the hispanic families have very strong ties to the US military, there are a lot of people of various races here who are heavily armed and know how to take on bandits. <br><br>In urban areas, you can refer to them as Chicano, Latino or Hispanic, but if you call them "Mexican" you're asking for a fight. They aren't Mexican. Most of them hate the Mexican govt, the corruption etc. I know of a number of older Hispanics here who haven't been over the line in years. There are too many stories of bad run ins with Federales. <br><br>In Rome, the state had a monopoly on the means of organized violence, until riders with the newly invented stirrup annihilated their army at Adrianople. From then until Crecy and Agincourt, heavy shock cavalry, standing on stirrups and wielding a heavy spear, swept all before them. Rural people didn't have a chance, and had to cut a deal with the barbarians. <br><br>Now, in contrast, every rural area in the country can quickly and easily raise a militia of heavily armed men and women who could take on zetas, or even a foreign army. Remember, the "army" that defeated General Santa Anna at the battle of San Jacinto was just a bunch of guys with their own guns. <br><br>And that's why, if the federal govt can' manage the border, the National Guard will have to do it. A few companies of troops, with a different set of rules of engagement, could stop all armed border traffic, by the simple expedient of shooting anyone who is armed and/or puts up a struggle. And if the state can't do it, then militias will spring up to do it. And nobody wants that, so govt would be forced to act, unless there was absolutely no govt. In that event, border bandits would be the least of our worries. <br><br><br><a href=on-border.html#c7415588541683804255 title="comment permalink">11/30/12, 6:15 PM</a><br><br>

Even later warbands will have trouble and if they look like they're getting artillery, plan for star forts (at least one was used in WW1). In rural areas, something similar to a castle could be used, since thats what they were built and used for.

The Hohokam etc. ag cultures went for over a thousand years, and for some time the Phoenix basin was heavily irrigated and sustained a very large population. It is estimated that the pop of AZ didn't rise above those earlier levels until the 1920s, or even later. <br><br>Alas, by 1450 there is no evidence for ANY agriculture in AZ! It all collapsed, well before Columbus brought plagues, and the few survivors were hunter gatherers. Basically, farming here is unsustainable, even on the very low level that was acceptable to paleo Indians. But since we've lowered the water tables, played out the lands and over grazed, etc. etc., I wouldn't count on much being around here once irrigation powered by fossil fuels ends. And since most American produce is from irrigated lands in CA and AZ, well, you guys back east might have to redesign some things.<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c1223166559484521210 title="comment permalink">11/30/12, 7:02 PM</a><br><br>

If the fall of the Empire is coinciding with the increase of natural disasters, then warbands will have an equally hard time affording the means to run raids.<br><br>America is a large land mass, even larger than my home Australia. The Japanese which landed on our shores and attempted to capture parts of our country during the war, ran into the logistics of a very large and very water lacking continent. Nature defeated them before the allied troops did. <br><br>As the boundaries of nature start to shift (as they appear to be doing at an increasing rate) warbands will be up against recovering from natural disasters, as much as the Empire is. <br><br>It seems to me, the reason the US Empire is running out of money, isn't just because of the resources running out (ie: fossil fuels) but also because they're running out of healthy soil to grow food. As the warbands come to claim the US territories, they will have to contend with the same unforgiving landscape.<br><br>If my memory serves me correctly, both Alexander The Greats' Empire and the Roman one, coincided with natural epidemics. Alexander's army was halted in India because his men were being picked off by tigers and they were developing diseases from the humid conditions their biology hadn't adapted to.<br><br>Likewise, Rome ran out of trees to chop down for their resources into war machines. Arable land to grow food for the soldiers began to dry up.<br><br>I wonder if the difference in our present history compared to Empires which have fallen in the past, is that in no such time before now have such large tracks of land become so desolate and lacking in resources. <br><br>War becomes risky for soldiers on both sides, because infection creeps in easily in hotter conditions, with little water to go around cleaning wounds. <br><br>I recall quite a few events in history, where battles weren't won by military might, but rather by a change in weather. Those odds are increasing the more nature is presently intensifying.<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c2858327347827108795 title="comment permalink">11/30/12, 8:52 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks, Randall, for bringing it to the list!<br><br>--<br><br>My wife teaches elementary school in one of the local public districts. In her class there are a good mix of anglos, latinos, and other foreign students (university family housing), and they represent all three of Toynbee's classes: the dominant minority (the rich kids), the internal proletariat, and the external proletariat. In the same class are the scions of power and privilege, poor anglo and poor latino citizens, and several kids whose parents have been/might be deported and have no path to become citizens in the US.<br><br>We've seen a few cases locally of what happens to the kids who were brought across the border informally as their parents sought work or fled the violence of the border regions. If they finish high school, they can't go to college because they have to pay foreign student tuition. Even if they could, they wouldn't be able to work professionally without citizenship, and they'd be loaded down with unpayable debt. What ends up happening is that some take low-wage jobs, some of the young women get pregnant, and some join the black market economy. <br><br>The upshot of the current immigration laws is to drive members of the internal proletariat (latinos who grew up here, many of whom don't even speak spanish, and identify culturally as USAns) into the external proletariat (the rising outlaw war bands and their parallel economy). By cutting off their options and basically forcing them underground, the US gov't is driving the demographic and identity trends even more forcefully away from what one would think would be desired by the political class. In the context of this week's post, regardless of what one thinks of the moral questions, this looks a lot like the US making the worst possible choice in setting up our own future to be much messier and more unstable than it otherwise would have to be.<br><br>Sheesh.

When my acupuncturist / general therapist asked me how I avoided getting angry and blowing up at him, I told her that my morning "meditação" includes a Water visualization.

As for your experience on the border, interesting that other people on different parts of the border are reporting very different experiences -- and just shooting everyone who comes across is not as easy as it sounds when the other side is armed and shooting back. I'd encourage you to reflect on how well your advice would have worked on, say, Rome's frontiers in 375 CE or so. <br><br>Leo, the star forts were Vauban's invention -- my guess is that that's a technology worth reviving.

Probably won't prevent sharp population loss via hunger, disease and warfare, but your chance of receiving some level of support from whoever's the current Pacific hegemon is higher. <br><br>Stephen, er, have you lost track of the fact that the outlanders are more than willing to shoot back -- or, for that matter, shoot first?<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c4748312310846973878 title="comment permalink">12/1/12, 11:28 AM</a><br><br>

That's one of the points I was trying to make, and of course you're quite right. One of the things that makes warbands flourish in such times is that they are much less dependent on expensive infrastructure than the existing institutions on either side of the border. <br><br>Steve, as I see it, current immigration law mostly works to prop up white middle class lifestyles by forcing down the cost of wages. Keeping immigrants out of the middle class is part of that, of course -- but you're quite right that the long term consequences are potentially explosive. Toynbee, interestingly enough, talks about that in general terms -- one of his core arguments is that the dominant minority in a declining society keeps on repeating the same failed responses to the same worsening challenges, because they're more committed politically and culturally to the responses than to actually solving their society's problems. <br><br>Jose, thank you!

Richmond BC is the largest Chinatown in North America, but even in Vancouver, the population is similar. (If, as is suspected, the First Peoples in this region are primarily of later stage Asian rather than Meso-American origins, then this is a trend with DEEP roots.)<br><br>In effect, what's happening now is that as Imperial America decays, older patterns are reasserting themselves. The plains out to the Eastern Cascades are becoming Meso-American again - appropriate for a people that have adjusted to a hot, dessicated environment. In Cascadia, on the other hand, you have cool temperate rain forests, and a coastal seafaring populace - coastal Chinese and Japanese, Russian, Norse, Swedish and Scottish, along with the Coastal First Peoples.<br><br>I only see this trend becoming stronger over time, especially assuming that China continues asserting its economic interests in the Pacific Northwest. Significantly, I think even your warband assumptions hold true - there are "gangs" in this region, but the most well organized of them are Asian.<br><br>On that topic, one other observation - in the wake of the continued collapse of the Japanese government (over Fukushima and the continued long emergency) it's worth noting that most of the native aid and support after the tsunami came not from the government but from the Yakuza. One other theme that emerges from history is that as an establishment loses its legitimacy, it is very often organized crime that lays the foundation for the next layer of that civilization, primarily because it is in the best interest of such warlords to provide pockets of stability on their home turf.<br><br>Again, looking forward to more posts.

Liddesdale is no more than a day’s bicycle ride from where I am writing. Small though Britain maybe geographically, the Scottish border country saw a noteworthy low point of human history in the West: as nasty a collapse of social values as say in Bosnia or gangland N Mexico.<br><br>These are lovely people nowadays of course, though the countryside still feels haunted in some places. The Cumbrian farmers just across the Border from Liddesdale are still there near the old Roman signalling station, as are some of the old fortified farmhouses. I noticed though that while their speech has a distinctive Cumbrian sound, the feel of this bit of border country is very different from that in the Lake District Cumbrian heartland a little further back from the Border.<br><br>This Cumberland as I am sure you know is the origin of the name of your town in the US. Cumberland was known for its independent peasants referred to as 'statesmen' (DeQuincy), people much respected by the early 19thC poets Wordsworth and Coleridge, and they are still there in the country speech and demeanour and on some of the small farms. All this is encompassed in terrain we bicycled across in half a day. And those good folk in the hill fastness round the lakes were descendents of Viking raiders become settlers. <br><br>There is among the hills of Borrowdale and Buttermere (Bothar’s Mere) a lightness in the air, as of lives worth living over these many centuries despite material poverty and a demanding human ecology. For a longer time perspective I recommend Castlerigg pre-historic stone circle one of the most wonderful elevated positions in the UK for observing over the seasons sun and moon and the ecliptic.<br><br>Liddesdale was returned to civilisation and the name Greer long since became an honest one. I note from the <i>Ettrick &amp; Liddesdale Advertiser</i> that 150 years ago one “Mr George Greer, Agent of the Scottish Temperance League, lectured in the Parish Schoolroom on Thursday evening, the 27th ult.

I've never heard mention of the fact that not even the "no-deal alternative" will impose enough new taxation, and cut enough spending, to relieve our government of the need to borrow unimaginable amounts of money (the deficit may, possibly, be reduced, but the debt still grows as long as there is any deficit).

Canada has popped up fairly often here in the comments over the past few weeks so I'd like to share some speculations on our fate as the US goes down.<br><br>The Canadian project since well before Confederation has been all about avoiding overt annexation by the US. This has been literally carved into our geography in odd ways -- for example the city I live in is awkwardly placed well inland from its logical location on Lake Erie, and our transcontinental railway was displaced far south of its most viable route, both for defensive purposes. The only realistic military threat we have ever faced has been from the US.<br><br>Over the last 200 years we've done a fair job of slowly trading away resources and shifting allegiances, resulting in our current status as a nominally independent vassal state of the US.<br><br>I expect as a large resource-stuffed country with a small population and a soon-to-be balmy climate we are going to attract a lot of attention from rising players like China as the US falls.<br><br>However I can't see our political elite attempting to actually switch loyalties from Washington to Beijing. In the final analysis, at any stage of decline or disintegration, it is still going to be a lot easier to roll tanks north from the US than east from China, and this distinction will not be lost on them.<br><br>As strong warbands begin to roll up from the south, we can expect a kind of knock-on effect that will send their US equivalents rolling north in turn. The result I'd expect to see is various annexations and amalgamations as US remnant nations occupy or merge with formerly Canadian statelets, while various global players back transitory alliances in a Canadian Great Game focused on control of the tar sands and arctic shipping.<br><br>All in all not a happy fate for my adoptive nation... but it is still a big place, and if one is wise enough to seek an obscure backwater of little strategic or resource value, the worst of the future might still pass one by!<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c8698849143080105635 title="comment permalink">12/1/12, 9:04 PM</a><br><br>

You may or may not like it, but for what it is worth Kevin is a genius presenter and from an outsiders perspective it is quite clear that he is something of a player of people.<br><br>Over the past two to three seasons the effects of the financial downturn in the UK have been a constant theme. Interestingly too, the more recent houses are much smaller than a few seasons ago, which I approve of (small being good).<br><br>I mention this because at a cafe the other morning (fortunately for me, the cafe is also my post office, newsagent and milk bar!) I overheard two fifty something guys bragging to each other about debt. My favourite quote was, "I'm a big believer in debt".<br><br>I am aware of a quite a few people of that age that are in a financial situation of debt that they don't have the income to pay off and I've been wondering at what point houses and businesses start getting dumped so that this debt can be settled?<br><br>I can't believe that the outcome will be any different for us here than it was for you there.

Emeryville was solidly upper-middle class, with an underclass of aspiring renters, but walking across San Pablo would find one in a significantly rougher neighborhood... one where the Black Panthers were still idolized. There weren't specific choke-points like a freeway overpass might present, so there was an interesting coexistence between relatively affluent artistic/technical types and severely destitute, disenfranchised street people.<br><br>I would be deeply interested in JMG's extended take on California's prospects. I've since returned to the Central Valley exurbs, and the local politicians out here seem to be focused on a return to the 1990s... reaping most of the necessary tax revenue from a continual expansion of the "bedroom community" concept of high-density single-family housing inhabited by people dependent upon an average 100-mile round trip commute. At the same time, I've found employment with one of the older organic/permaculture farming operations in the area, so I'd like to think I could make a stand here, even in the face of shrinking water supplies. However, it's obvious that California as a unified political entity is absolutely dependent upon massive public works projects. The forebay of the Delta-Mendota canal is scarcely 10 miles from my current residence, and I have to wonder how north and south will remain unified if projects like the proposed high-speed rail system and the Delta-bypassing peripheral canal (or tunnel) never come to fruition.<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c7887273453641954954 title="comment permalink">12/2/12, 12:52 AM</a><br><br>

I.e. pointless. It's the same thinking as "defending" coastal cities against sea level rise. You can spend way too many resources on this effort, up to and including all the resources you could ever have at your disposal, and it will still fail. When faced with a rising tide your choices are move inland or learn to swim. "Defense" (on beyond the universal basic and tangible needs for personal safety, of course) just wastes resources you could have used for much more constructive purposes. This applies equally to literal littoral tides and metaphorical cultural ones. <br><br>MC Smallwood -- if you are looking at that area of Idaho, you need to investigate the local politics and culture of any given community VERY carefully. Rural areas in that part of the world are bringing in many newcomers, a significant number of which are arriving with dreams of building a model society that conforms to their own personal beliefs and biases. Some of these beliefs might not be openly spoken to a prospective transplant on first meeting, so it might take a little detective work. This applies no matter where your own preferences lie in the multidimensional space of politics and belief. Communities only a few miles apart can have strongly different ideologies; and if they are in the same county this can result in some extremely volatile and tense situations within county government!<br><br>This same phenomenon has been ongoing in rural regions across the U.S. for several decades, but for the reasons you mention about climate and geography that area is one of the more attractive hotbeds of it. It often crops up in areas that have been experiencing rapid rates of incoming transplants, especially escaping suburbanites. When we were looking to relocate a decade ago, these issues eliminated that region from consideration very early in the process. In general, rural areas that are growing rapidly are not (in my opinion) good bets for someone who is looking for a place to put down deep roots for the long-haul. They tend towards cultures dominated by codified ideology and commercial profit motives, whether that ideology is neofascist racial supremacy, utopian green communitarianism, or Mormon polygamist fundamentalism (and you will find all in Idaho now).<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c5130728243118470559 title="comment permalink">12/2/12, 8:36 AM</a><br><br>

And according to the above linked discussions, that day may be nearer than even Greer believes.<br><br>It is estimated that the drug cartels now employ 600,000 people in Mexico, and generate more new jobs than any other industry. Chapo Guzman's cartel is now considered to be one of the three largest criminal organizations in the world. The recent report that HSBC had laundered $7 billion for the cartels between 2007 and 2008 comes on the heels of an older report that Wachovia Bank laundered $378 billion for the cartels between 2004 and 2007. Wells Fargo, The Bank of America, Citigroup, Western Union and American Express have all been implicated in money laundering for the cartels.<br><br>While the Mexican body count continues to rise (nearly 120,000 since 2006, accoriding to the latest estimates published by the Instituto Nacional de Estadisticas y Geographia) the United States is escalating its not-so-covert military involvement in Mexico and putting proverbial boots on the ground as part of the $1.6 billion U.S.-financed Merida Initiative. But have such "initiatives" (in actuality, taxpayer-funded boondoggles for giant military contractors), turned the corner in the drug war? Not by any objective measurement.<br><br>Greer is also right about the growing base of social support from the poor and disenfranchised. In this <i>narco corrido</i>, for instance, is a <i>campesina</i> who declares: "Chapo goes for the poor people, and we go for him." Later she says: "He doesn't like to see poverty, sadness and hunger."<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy76Gee0dT8<br><br>I would not at all be surprised to find out that, amongst the poor and rural populations, the drug cartels have more legitimacy than the Mexican government.<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c3141590237915452054 title="comment permalink">12/2/12, 10:04 AM</a><br><br>

The article indicates that despite denouncement by Roman Catholic clergy, many Mexicans, and particularly members of the drug gangs, venerate and make offerings to La Santa Muerta (Holy Death) for love, money, and protection on this side of mortality, and for mercy and non-judgment on the other. In addition, Jesus Malverde, a legendary outlaw hanged by Sinaloa officials a century ago, has become a likewise venerated Robin Hood-like folk saint among the same crowd.<br><br>Fwiw, according to a co-worker of mine who was born, raised, and educated in Mexico, Caucasian-Americans are commonly referred to as gabachos and the USA as El Gabacho. In addition, he said that in many areas of Mexico, including DF, people are as concerned about the federales as they are about the drug gangs. In fact, in many areas, the drug gangs provide some aid and services that the official government no longer provides or never did.

What I want to get across is not a refutation of your points, but hopefully an accompaniment. <br><br>First, stirrups at Adrianople or no, I don't see the zetas ever being able to take on regular US troops, or even reserves. A company or two of AZ national guard (who after all served in Iraq and Afghan), could destroy anything the cartels could ever come up with. And if they didn't try, bands of local militia could it instead. <br><br>Second, once the drug wars end, the drug gangs run out of steam. <br><br>third, I think you're right about wargangs ultimately destroying what remains of the SW, at some point along the decline. I just don't see it coming from Mexico. I see it coming from the collapse of the SW urban monsters of LA, Phoenix, Las Vegas and Tucson. Most of the population out here will be displaced, ultimately, and I anticipate things getting really ugly. I'm about as far away from these centers as one can be in the borderlands, and if I was younger I'd be looking at land in W. Oregon. But my wife and I have sunk everything into a permaculture/paper adobe "farm" next to one of the few SW towns with community, and we've been joined by most of our extended families and I don't see us going anywhere. I figure on developing water resources further so that they will outlive me, but I don't have any illusions that it will serve another generation. <br> <br>A half century ago Ed Abbey wrote that someday a tribe of "blue eyed, Navajo Bedouin will ride over a ridge" and discover the broken ruins of Phoenix. Since then Phoenix has grown ten-fold, and so the fall will be far greater. One doesn't want to be too close to such conurbations when they go down. <br><br>I figure that very long term, the future of most of the southwest/California will be brown Roman Catholic/Evangelical, with a less brown Mormon population radiating out of Utah, and an even less brown "hippy" culture radiating out from the Willamette valley. The Devil, or course, is in the details. <br><br>best, jim<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c1434763028767281775 title="comment permalink">12/2/12, 12:03 PM</a><br><br>

That Mexicans continue to go north, while at the same time many more than was previously the case feel that they'll have better odds in life by returning home.<br><br>Incidentally, if the long descent will be as long as I think it will, it's interesting to consider that the warbands of many decades hence will be Mexicans whose grandparents shopped at Wal-Mart (de México, currently the country's largest private employer) and whose great-grandparents ate at McDonald's. Most or many of the members of the warbands may not have any siblings or have just one or, at most, two siblings.<br><br>In other words, to imagine what Mexico or Mexicans will be like in, say, 60 years' time based on what we think we know today is about as useful as imagining the U.S. of 2012 as a country where nearly all appliances, cars, and other industrial products were made in the U.S.; where an urban white working class makes up a huge percentage of the population; where a large majority (over 90%) of the adult population is married; where a large majority of the population listens to the same radio programs and watches the same TV shows, and embraces a mass consensus culture and social aspirations -- i.e., the USA of 1952.<br><br>I'm not saying the Mexico of the warband era will be "better" than it is today, but I know it will be hugely different than it is today.<br><br><br><br><a href=on-border.html#c4324686146026350799 title="comment permalink">12/3/12, 9:50 AM</a><br><br>

I am enjoying your comments too as the stories they tell provide an insight into another country and place. Most enjoyable.<br><br>Years ago, I watched the River Cottage series and I always enjoyed Hugh's encounters with people who had lived through war time rationing in the UK as it was quite remarkable how resourceful those people were. <br><br>Generally chooks have been too historically valuable for their egg production to eat them! It is hard to convince others about this, so I play the chicken puzzle game with them. It goes like this, if you wanted to eat a chicken a week now how many chickens do you need to keep? The numbers of chickens required at the end of the puzzle are clearly quite a few more than they imagined and the people involved always look a little troubled!<br><br>I'm considering writing an article on the economics of producing your own food (i.e. why do it?), because having tried many different systems here, the numbers are starting to come in. Vegetables are clearly far and away some of the best returns in the shortest period for the time invested.<br><br>Alcohol has the best financial return, although this is only because the retail product has quite a bit of tax on it (fair enough too).<br><br>Interesting stuff.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c4758481577446043041 title="comment permalink">12/3/12, 11:22 PM</a><br><br>

You know, mano dura — “I’m a strong man.” He ripped the mask off Mexico. In other words, he was going to claim he’s the big guy. And the mask he ripped off revealed what’s really going on in Mexico: mass poverty and social disintegration. Now it’s turned into a war by the Mexican government against the Mexican people...<br><br>What we’ve created, with a foreign policy, meaning our free trade treaty, is, one, slave factories all over the country, where nobody can live on the wages, two generations at least of feral kids on the street. Fifty percent of the kids you call high school kids in Juárez neither go to school nor have jobs. They did a recent university study there, and they found out 40 percent of the kids in Chihuahua, young males, wanted to become <i>sicarios</i>, professional killers. We’re looking at a Detroit, Baltimore, etc., where we’ve created something so bleak that crime is actually, and murder, is a rational way to live. And we’re not going to put a lid on it by “just say no,” by presidential visits, and by — what was it? We’re now going to teach them how to run a court system, you know, send our experts. <br><br>Let me tell you something about the Mexican justice system. Ninety-three percent of the people convicted there never see a judge. Ninety-three percent of the people convicted there never see an arrest warrant. Ninety-two percent of the people convicted there are convicted with no physical evidence. We’ll skip that they’re all tortured. There are no — there’s essentially no jury trials. This is not a justice system; it’s a, you know, a murder system. You’re processed like sausage. We’re, quote, going to “reform” it. <br><br>What we’ve done is what we’ve done historically: we’ve gotten on the wrong side. We’re not siding with the Mexican people. We’re siding with the people that own the country and terrorize them. <br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><a href=on-border.html#c7909931711527352059 title="comment permalink">12/4/12, 6:48 AM</a><br><br>

Just look what's going on in the United States:<br><br>http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2012/11/real-median-household-income-in-the-21st-century/<br><br>The systematic destruction of the livlihoods of working people began in the US only four years ago. Mexico has been at this for 30 years, since Mexico has served as the test tube in which US authorities could conduct their economic experiments. The result, as Carlos Fuentes put it, was that Mexico "was threatened with an acute case of schizophrenia. A minority centered their lives on the New York Stock Exchange, and a majority on the price of beans. One economy was all gilded wrapping paper, the other all huts and untilled land. The former was the minority's, the latter the majority's." <br><br>After 25 years of economic devastation, the complete disintegration of the society began about 5 years ago. How many years of grinding American workers into the dirt do you believe it's going to take for the bullets to start flying in the US?<br><br>And for those who believe Charles Bowden was exagerating regarding the dysfunction of the Mexican criminal justice system, take a look at this documentary:<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCLyehdEdys<br><br>Or this one:<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAvLDNscVXs<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c6802249984711374725 title="comment permalink">12/4/12, 7:54 AM</a><br><br>

Baja, particularly, was as safe as can be. I was in Punta Abreojos in 1992 just before NAFTA kicked in. I was having a couple of beers with a local fisherman &amp; a local teacher. The fisherman was very excited about how much NAFTA would do for Mexico. I said I thought that it would ruin Mexican agriculture &amp; the Mexican middle class, which was growing then. The teacher looked at me sadly said " I would love to disagree with you, but I can't". I don't think either of us realized quite how much harm it would do.<br>The last time I was in Baja was 1997. I flew to Loreto &amp; kayaked for a week, then rented a truck for 3 or 4 days. The agency &amp; anyone else I spoke to was quite specific; " Don't just go driving down some track in the desert like you used to. You will see something you shouldn't &amp; they will kill you.<br>NAFTA certainly wasn't the only factor at play, but it sure tilled the fields where the grapes of wrath were sown.<br>Steve<br><br><a href=on-border.html#c5399896950341633042 title="comment permalink">12/4/12, 10:16 PM</a><br><br>

Back when the border was the Cimarron River this area was in Texas/Mexico, and there are many Mexicans here now.
