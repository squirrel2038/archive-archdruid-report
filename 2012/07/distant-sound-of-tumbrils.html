<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">I’ve commented more than once in these essays about the echoing gap between the fantasies of elite omnipotence so common in contemporary America, and the awkward realities of a nation where power has become so diffuse that constructive action is all but impossible. The diffusion of power over time is a commonplace in the history of nations; an earlier post in this series has already discussed <a href=../../2012/05/democracys-arc.html>the concept of anacyclosis</a>, the ancient Greek historian Polybius’ analysis of the way the diffusion works; still, there’s another dimension to it as well. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">That dimension? The cluelessness that so often afflicts ruling classes in the last years of their power. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">There’s no shortage of poster children for that in the present case, but I want to call on one of the less blatant examples here, precisely because he’s a very smart man. The person I have in mind is Robert D. Kaplan, who burst onto the current-affairs scene in a big way in 1994 with a harrowing and crisply written article titled "The Coming Anarchy." He’s one of the brightest of the tame intellectuals who provide American politicians with things to talk about, and like many of those tame intellectuals, he clawed his way up from a middle-class background to his present status as an adviser to Pentagon brass and a regular speaker at high-end conferences. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">Thus it’s revealing to go back to one of his books from the 1990s, the lively but inconclusive <i>An Empire Wilderness: Travels into America’s Future</i> (1998), and read his account of his one brief collision with the country he thinks he’s exploring. Most of the book chronicles Kaplan’s encounters with his peers—that is to say, other tame intellectuals and the politicians and businessmen whose largesse keeps them employed—in their natural habitat, a landscape of airports, office parks, urban condominiums, and other fashionable venues. Once, though, his years as a foreign correspondent in some of the world’s rough places broke through, and he climbed aboard a Greyhound bus for a trip through the American Southwest to see the country and the people first hand. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">The scene is really one of the best examples of unintentional comedy in modern letters. Kaplan briefly succeeded in extracting himself from the bubble in which tame intellectuals of his caliber normally live, and the world outside the bubble shocked him right down to the soles of his Bruno Magli shoes. His fellow passengers were, like, <i>fat</i>, and even the thin ones didn’t seem to be trying to fit any definition of pretty and stylish he’d ever encountered; they wore cheap ill-fitting clothes in garish colors, and some of them had their belongings in plastic garbage bags rather than, say, Gucci suitcases. You could practically hear the "Ewww,
<i>icky</i>!" escape his lips. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">Now it so happens that I’ve done a certain amount of travel by Greyhound bus through various corners of the country, and shared space on a moving bus with the same kind of Americans that left him gaping in horror. (If I’d been on that bus with him, no doubt he’d have been appalled by the guy with the scruffy beard and ponytail two seats up, wearing baggy clothes that had seen many better days—hint: you don’t wear nice clothes on a long bus trip—and reading some dog-eared fantasy novel from the 1970s instead of whatever piece of highbrow trash the <i>New York Review of Books</i> was touting that week.)  I’ve seen the garish polyester tank tops and the T-shirts that look like they’ve been used to clean auto parts, the women on their way to visit boyfriends who are doing five to ten for one thing or another, the college students who don’t have fancy scholarships, the middle-aged couple with bottom-level jobs on their way to visit some uncle they haven’t seen in ten years and who’s dying of cancer, and all the rest of it.  All this is familiar enough to most Americans, but to Kaplan, it came as a shock. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">Mind you, he had the courage to get in line along with his unfashionably plump, unfashionably dressed, unfashionably accessorized fellow passengers, and board that bus. I suspect that most of his peers have never done anything of the kind, and would never think of doing so. In today’s America, if you want to avoid seeing how most people live, nothing could be easier; America’s geography is so thoroughly carved up by income level that it takes a deliberate effort to fall out of the comfortable orbits inhabited by the middle and upper classes and plunge back down to Earth. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">This is quite common in aristocratic societies at certain points in their history. When Marie Antoinette responded to reports that the Parisian poor had no bread by saying, "Then let them eat cake," she was being clueless, not catty; a life in the rarefied circles at the zenith of
<i>ancien régime</i> France had given her precisely no exposure to the fact that it was the price of bread, not some unexpected shortage of it, that was making the lives of the underclass wretched. Her husband probably had a slightly clearer grasp of the situation, at least in the abstract, but he—along with a great many other aristocrats who would share his fate—had no more useful an understanding of the powderkeg on which the vast and tottering structure of the <i>ancien régime</i> was so unsteadily perched. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">The irony here is that the ancestors of these same aristocrats had been as hard-bitten a collection of ruthless pragmatists as history has on display. The medieval barons whose progeny were on their way to an appointment with Madame Guillotine not long after 1789 resembled nothing so much as old-fashioned Sicilian mafiosi, complete with the Mafia’s devotion to the Catholic church, its code of honor, and its readiness to slaughter people en masse whenever the situation seemed to warrant it. Like every other feudal elite in history, the old French aristocracy emerged in a time of chaos, when the last scraps of central government had gone missing in action, and local landowners smart and strong enough to gather a band of armed followers and lead them into battle could impose their own rough justice on as large a domain as they could seize and hold.</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">Such times do not favor cluelessness.  Even after the feudal system formalized itself, the heir to a barony who was too detached from the hard realities of the time could count on being removed from his position by the business end of a battle-axe.  It was only after warfare became a monopoly of the French king, and aristocrats no longer had to risk their lives regularly leading their vassals on the battlefield, that it was possible for the French upper classes to isolate themselves in a bubble of their own creation and start drifting toward their wretched destiny. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">It’s of interest to note that this process took a great deal longer in two other European nations, Britain and Prussia—those of my readers who got an American public school education, and so know nothing about history, will probably need to be told that Prussia was the nucleus of the German Empire, and what’s left of it is now part of Germany. In Britain until after the Napoleonic Wars, and in Prussia right up through the Second World War, it was common for the sons of aristocrats to join the military.  Since Britain and Prussia both spent most of the 18th century at war, clueless young aristocrats tended to be removed from the gene pool via the helpful Darwinian selection pressures of early modern warfare. It’s worth noting also that British noble families drifted out of the habit in the 19th century, and the stereotype of the blithering aristocratic idiot entered British popular culture not long thereafter. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">America’s aristocracy—yes, I can hear the screams of outrage evoked by the use of that latter phrase. Let us please get real; we have one, or a close equivalent to one. In every community of social primates, there’s an inner circle of members who have more influence, and more access to whatever wealth happens to be available, than the other members. In every community of social primates, your odds of getting into that inner circle depend partly on whether your parents belonged to it, and partly on your own ability to defeat rivals and bluff or bully or fight your way into it. Any group of social primates that claims not to have an aristocracy—as far as I know, this affectation is limited to human beings, though I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that bonobos have gotten into it as well—has simply found it convenient to rely on a covert hierarchy instead of an overtly recognized one.  In today’s America, as in every other human society, the single most important predictor for your place in the income distribution curve is your parents’ place in the same curve. Some people do move up from below—Kaplan, as already mentioned, is an example—but they do so by adopting the values and attitudes of members of the social strata above them, who by and large control who is and isn’t allowed to make that ascent, and who make that choice on the basis of who fits in. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">America’s aristocracy, as I was saying, has never had the tradition of sending its sons into the military.  The great wars of America’s history—the Civil War and the two World Wars—have seen members of every class show up at recruiting stations; the little wars have been fought by professionals or, in a few cases, by whoever happened to enlist when the drums started pounding and the press yelled for war. Most other potential sources of Darwinian selection have been kept away from America’s privileged classes with equal solicitude. The one exception is economic struggle, and even there the transfer of wealth from individual financiers and industrialists to trusts and holding companies has done much to guarantee that even the most feckless child of wealth and privilege will continue to enjoy wealth and privilege until the guy with the scythe makes the whole point moot. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">John Kenneth Galbraith, whose prescient writings pointed to so many of the pitfalls into which today’s America is busily flinging itself, sketched out the consequences with his usual urbane wit in his 1992 book
<i>The Culture of Contentment</i>. Galbraith seems to have taken a good deal of pleasure in making himself unpopular in the corridors of power and privilege, and the book just noted must have contributed heartily to that end; I’m thinking here particularly of his discussion of the unmentionable fact that the more money an American makes, the less actual work he or she has to do to earn it. Still, the core of the book is a precise and mordant comparison between the privileged class of contemporary America and an example I’ve already cited, the French nobility on the eve of the Revolution. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">That comparison has an exactness that very few people notice these days.  Louis XIV, the Franklin Roosevelt of his day, took a great deal of wealth and privilege from the French aristocracy and imposed a flurry of restrictions they found burdensome.  After his time, it became a central goal of the nobility to restore their position at the king’s expense. Their strategy is one with which modern Americans ought to be familiar: they insisted on a massive military buildup and an aggressive foreign policy that landed France in expensive wars, while at the same time demanding tax cuts.  The goal was simply to bankrupt the French government, so that—no, not so that they could drown it in a bathtub; instead, they wanted to force the king to call the États-Général—roughly, the equivalent of a US constitutional convention—which alone could create entirely new tax structures. Once that happened, they hoped to bully the king into restoring their former privileges as the price of acquiescing in a new tax regime. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">The result was a high-stakes game of chicken between the party of the aristocracy, and the party of the civil servants, bureaucrats and officials whose authority and wealth was guaranteed by the power of the king. (If you want to describe these two parties as "Republicans" and "Democrats," I’m not going to argue.)  What neither side noticed was that their struggles imposed severe burdens on the rest of the population, the peasants, laborers, and small-scale businesspeople on whose passive acquiescence the entire structure of power and prestige ultimately rested. As the struggle went on, the aristocracy did their best to delegitimize the king and the central government, while the civil service and its supporters did their best to delegitimize the aristocracy; both sides succeeded beyond their wildest dreams, and managed to strip the last traces of popular legitimacy from the French political system as a whole. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">So when the aristocrats finally got their way and the États-Général were summoned, all it took was a few speeches by radicals and a bit of violence on the part of the Paris mob, and the entire structure of the
<i>ancien régime</i> disintegrated in a matter of weeks.  The aristocrats, who were chiefly to blame for the mess, were also the last to figure out what had happened. It’s tempting to imagine one of them, stepping aboard the tumbril that will take him to the guillotine, saying to another, "So, Henri, how’s that political strategy working for you?"—but there’s no evidence that any of them managed that degree of insight even when the consequences of their failure were staring them in the face. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">I sometimes wonder whether the members of America’s privileged classes will show any more insight into the forces behind whatever messy fate waits for them.  Certainly they’re making all the same mistakes as their French equivalents. The power, wealth, and influence of the privileged classes in today’s America is a function of their ability to manipulate an elaborate structure in which government and what we jokingly call "private" industry are inextricably tangled. Most members of those classes have no skills worth mentioning other than those needed to manipulate that structure. They’re very good at manipulating the structure, and extracting wealth from it—that’s why they have the status and the influence they do—but they have forgotten, as most aristocracies forget when they reach senility, their own dependence on the structure. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">Like the aristocrats of France before the Revolution, indeed, they’re busy undermining the structure that supports them—the culture of executive kleptocracy that pervades the upper end of American business these days is hard to describe in any other terms—and they’re equally busy trashing the last scraps of legitimacy the American political and economic system still has in the eyes of the people, for the sake of short term political advantage. It has in all probability never occurred to any of the people engaged in these activities that there could be negative consequences, or that the people in ugly clothes who bear the brunt of all this brinksmanship may eventually withdraw the support on which the entire structure depends. None of this can possibly end well: not for them, and probably not for the rest of us, either. I would remind those of my readers who think they would cheer the collapse of America’s <i>ancien régime</i> that what followed on the heels of 1789 was not the Utopia of reason promised by the radicals of that age, but the Terror, followed by the Napoleonic Wars. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">In a way he didn’t intend, a core metaphor from Kaplan’s famous article "The Coming Anarchy" makes a perfect image for the mess ahead. He imagines the people of the world’s rich industrial countries as passengers in a limousine rolling through the dark and potholed streets of some Third World city, rife with poverty and violence. It’s interesting to note that he never asks what will happen when the limo runs out of gas. (I don’t happen to know his current views, but in earlier books he rejected the concept of peak oil.) Nor does he discuss what happens when the driver tries to dodge a pothole without braking and slams the limo into a brick wall—that’s more or less what’s happening to the economy of the industrial world just now—and let’s not even talk about the possibility that the people of the city might throw up some barricades, or lob a couple of Molotov cocktails in the limo’s direction. When one of those things happens—and I’m all but certain that it will—I hope Kaplan has enough of his wits about him to put on a greasy T-shirt and a pair of torn blue jeans, and mingle with the crowd. </span></div>

<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">I’m not sure what it is about UFOs, that iconic image of twentieth century folk mythology, that has been such a magnet for the apocalypse meme. Within a few years of those first 1947 sightings, UFO enthusiasts began to insist that sometime very soon, the saucers would make their presence impossible to ignore, either by landing on the White House lawn or in some other suitably dramatic fashion. Even though the years and decades have rolled by since then, the conviction remains unshaken; I still get fervent emails now and then insisting that I’ll see how wrong I am once Disclosure happens, which is sure to come any day now. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">Still, not every true believer has the patience to sit and wait for the promised miracle to arrive all by itself. In 1952, science fiction fan turned UFO enthusiast Alfred Bender organized the International Flying Saucer Bureau, one of the very first UFO organizations in North America, and launched a project to talk to the aliens by mass telepathy. On World Contact Day, March 15, 1953, at 11:00 am Greenwich time, IFSB members and friends around the world concentrated on a message that began: "Calling occupants of interplanetary craft!" The goal was to get the saucers to respond somehow, in order to make contact with alien intelligences who would then save the Earth from the threat of nuclear war. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: small">More than two decades later, an obscure Canadian band named Klaatu used the words of the message as the lyrics for their one major hit,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNBV5hofD_U">Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft</a>, which later got covered by the Carpenters. Still, that was the only response the message got; if there were aliens in Earth’s skies in 1953, they weren’t listening. </span></div>

NEVER. That attribution was debunked over 100 years ago, being a slander propagated by her aristocratic enemies. <br><br>This woman was slandered and scapegoated incessantly and mercilessly, not by the "common" folk nearly so much as by members of the aristocracy and certain members of the royal family who deplored her for her Austrian origins and her distinctly non-aristocratic manners.<br><br>If there's anything one cannot accuse that unfortunate princess of, it's a lack of compassion or charity. Starting with her first year in France, when she and her husband gave away a considerable amount of money to victims of the fireworks explosion that marred their nuptial celebration, Marie Antoinette gave generous sums to charity every year, and after being chastised for her extravagance while in her early 20s, cut back her spending very sharply, remodeled her dresses, and continued to give a significant portion of her yearly income to charity, founding and supporting homes for poor young mothers and adopting many poor children, not just one little boy. She and her husband had their children donate their Christmas gifts to poor children, and insisted that members of their intimate court give, also. <br><br>Sorry to digress, but it distresses me to see a decent, kind person, who never harmed anyone in her life, made into a symbol of everything that was wrong with a savagely unjust order she couldn't have changed if she'd tried.<br><br><a href=distant-sound-of-tumbrils.html#c5627326197370439990 title="comment permalink">7/11/12, 11:15 PM</a><br><br>

In Europe (in which I include the UK) we have a similar problem of a ruling elite detached from the masses. This seems to me particularly clear in France and the UK where members of the ruling class are increasingly career politicians from the same small group of universities (and in some cases schools!). In the past in Britain many members of parliament used to come via the professions or on the other side of the political divide the shop floor so had experience of how the real world worked.

Our ancestors didn't use "primitive" rigs because they couldn't figure out fore and aft sails or jibs, but because they made what would work with the materials they had.

I believe many of these parallels are informative and valid. However, I think there is a significant difference between the past (e.g. the fate of the French aristocracy) and now. The difference, I believe, is that those in power have access to technology and weapons that are so much more sophisticated and dangerous than what aristocrats and ruling classes of the past had access to. This means they can spy on people and use all sorts of means to imprison, injure and kill people with an efficacy past rulers could not even have dreamed of. Sure, people also have access to more sophisticated technology now than in the past but this change in technology seems to have benefited the ruling class disproportionately. Hence, I believe the discrepancy between the power of the people and that of the current ruling class is far greater in favour of the latter making it so much more difficult for them to be overthrown. <br><br>What am I not understanding? I accept that peak oil is real and that it will change society fundamentally over time. I also accept the Law of Wholeness and therefore agree that when the ruling class hurt society they hurt themselves in some way. However, given the technology and the institutions available to them I cannot see them being toppled. Rather, I imagine them continuing to rule indefinitely, albeit over an increasingly impoverished and unstable society. However, that will make their wealth and privilege even more of an advantage making them even harder to topple. What I can imagine is the ruling class creating a world resembling that of George Orwell’s 1984. Obviously I assume you disagree. Please dissect my logic and tell me where and how I am wrong. This is one of those instances where I do not want to be right.<br><br><a href=distant-sound-of-tumbrils.html#c8989717825632169069 title="comment permalink">7/12/12, 12:00 AM</a><br><br>

They had been cooking things up for years prior. Most of the nobility had either fled to the HRE or England, or were working in the Etates to try and reform the system without bloodshed. The feudal system was long abolished. And the nobility was well aware of the feelings of the peasantry--the queen (who btw never said "let them eat cake"--that is a misattribution) might have been, but by the time 1789 rolled around, there had been riots.

It could have been worse, as improved selection did occur a few generations back, when the purchasing of commissions was abolished, but that only happened after the shocking leadership failure displayed at the Charge of the Light Brigade. <br><br>Here in the UK it's now manifestly obvious that vital sections of the establishment are compromised.

Recently, at the likely behest of the CEO, a new uniform policy was implemented. This policy requires employees to wear black dress-pants and white-dress shirts along with black neckties (yes, including female employees) and black shoes and belts. It is difficult to imagine a uniform more ill-suited for grocery-store work. I guess we should be grateful we weren't required to wear suit-coats as well. And despite being paid absolute peanuts for wages, all new employees have to buy all their uniform pieces for themselves, including the black shoes and belts if they didn't already own such clothing-items.<br><br>This corportation also pursues policies and attitudes that effectively chases away the very sort of good and reliable employees that a customer-service-oriented entity should really be trying to retain (at least when the good employees in question have any sort of option of working elsewhere, and they <i>never</i> want to return once they leave). They also cut employee working-hours to the marrow of the bone so that lines at the registers are frequently long and shelves are often poorly stocked. As a result, they are losing market-share in this locality. But the more market-share they lose and the more employees they alienate forever, the more feverishly committed they become to torturing and killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. Oh, and the grocery bags of this chain of stores prominently features the face of the CEO on them and has done so for the past four years.<br><br>It is difficult to imagine such corporate types not encountering significant personal difficulty when the commonfolk start lashing out as everything falls apart. As a spiritual person, I have absolutely no desire to participate in said lashing out or even condone it in any way. But when a society becomes politically and economically unstable, the commonfolk have a way of not much caring for such quaint notions as The Golden Rule or spirituality.<br><br><a href=distant-sound-of-tumbrils.html#c6356138012839791597 title="comment permalink">7/12/12, 4:38 AM</a><br><br>

The American Aristocracy will go down, presumably taken out by the people on Kaplan's bus. But there are factors in America today that can't be paralleled by 19th century France. Factors like sheer size of population, more racial diversity, and the fact that much of the "peasantry" performs work that, like the bygone French aristocracy, also will be rather useless in an age of scarcity and decline. (As opposed to a directory listing from 1866 in my Hudson Valley township, which lists name and occupation of all residents. More than half are designated "farmer" and the great majority of the rest are also involved in making an actual something--hatter, wool spinner, mason, blacksmith, carpenter, shoemaker, painter, miller, tinsmith.)<br><br>Human psychology being what it is, I'm guessing lots of disillusioned folk will strike out at the nearest target that their brains can categorize as "different"--whether that be someone of a different color or religion, or the poor schmo who has a "nicer" car.<br><br>I confess that recent TAR posts have been disconcerting. When I discovered your blog, it helped me think more cohesively about many of the issues I had been grappling with, and at the same time, reading back through the archives, it gave me some hope that there were steps I could take to begin to prepare for coming changes. More recent posts, however, are filling me with a vague sense of dread, with intimations of imminent social unrest and violence, and "major resource wars" in the next decade or two. (I have a male toddler, so that worries me greatly.)<br><br>I've recently beefed up our home's insulation, and took a full working share at my CSA farm this spring in addition to taking a small community garden plot. While my wife does not share my views, she has at least been learning how to can vegetables. She got very angry recently when I suggested that our son won't be going to college because that institution is a giant bubble and debt creation device (and we could not afford it in any case.)<br><br>I guess my point is, I'm hoping that you will continue to offer practical advice mingled in with these ominous rumblings.<br><br>Finally, a note about the recent Collapse Now While the Collapsing's Good" meme here at the Archdruid Report. This month's Harper's magazine has an article, "Broken Heartland, The looming collapse of agriculture on the Great Plains." In covering various solutions, the author talks to a couple, Frank and Deborah Popper, who for years have been espousing the idea of The Buffalo Commons: "The suggestion that residents embrace their own decline and convert their land into a vast national park known as the Buffalo Commons has sparked the enthusiasm of conservationists and the wrath of local farmers in equal measure."

Although the tumbrils never rolled, there was a brutal economic sorting that left large swaths of the former elite staggering off into brief, impoverished retirements. And new elites were swollen by unfashionable, ruthless opportunists of various stripes, some criminal, some bureaucratic, some political. (Eventually, the siloviki, heirs to the Soviet security apparatus won out as gatekeepers of the new aristocracy, but that's a later development in Russia.) What was striking in the 90's was the utter, sudden and total destruction of the power of legal ownership, bureaucratic regulation and money, (legitimacy had already died long before) and the sudden power of those who had physical control over the material resources. It didn't matter who had jurisdiction over the factory, it mattered who actually had the machinery, the energy sources to run it, and the cooperation of enough people to run it, or access to enough violence to take it - without any real money or contracts or even legitimacy.

Have been reading your blog for a while, but have just decided to dip my toe into the discussion a little.<br><br>Your post discusses the effects of failed leadership, something that we are all going to be familiar with in the coming years.<br><br>Along with discussing failure, you often outline ways to adapt using alternative methods, so a discussion about how leadership could be improved in the face of a seriously downsized human race might be useful.<br><br>I'd like to offer up a quote from my favourite author to illustrate this.<br><br>“The merest accident of microgeography had meant that the first man to hear the voice of Om, and who gave Om his view of humans, was a shepherd and not a goatherd. They have quite different ways of looking at the world, and the whole of history might have been different. For sheep are stupid, and have to be driven. But goats are intelligent, and need to be led.”<br>― Terry Pratchett, Small Gods <br><br>A quick look at history shows us that large civilizations have an aspect of leaders acting like their subjects are sheep, and indeed the problems of scale may make it the more effective course.<br><br>While we cannot know the future, it is fairly certain that civilizations will tend towards localization for most things, along with some trade.<br><br>As these civilizations fragment into much smaller communities, leadership may evolve as well. Treating the people that follow you as intelligent equals who require guidance is a strategy that is likely to work well in a community.<br><br>In short we will need more goatherds and less shepherds. Since large civilizations have an habit of blowing themselves up, it strikes me as being a little more sustainable in any case<br><br>Forgive me if this has been discussed in an earlier post, as I have not read them all.<br><br><a href=distant-sound-of-tumbrils.html#c4710738403496516403 title="comment permalink">7/12/12, 7:18 AM</a><br><br>

I try to focus on the US, since that's where I live, and the last thing the rest of the world needs is one more American trying to tell them what to do!<br><br>Void, depends on what you mean by the lower classes. The current system, for example, could keep running about as well as it is now -- which admittedly is no great prize -- after the extermination of every American who makes seven figures or more a year.

Well, we'll see. <br><br>Thomas, nah, nitwits like Thomas Friedman are only part of the reason. A significant part, but only part. <br><br>CGP, I'd encourage you to think about just who actually has access to all those technologies of control; it's not the elite, it's a bunch of employees hired from the polyester-wearing class, who are being paid low wages to sit in front of the screens and do the scut-work of managing a security state. Their interests are not necessarily the same as those of their bosses. The French monarchy had a very extensive system of secret police, domestic spies, and soldiers, and the great majority of them simply refused to do their jobs when push came to shove, because the collapse of legitimacy affected them as much as anyone. <br><br>I'd encourage you to remember the collapse of East Germany a few decades ago. The East German state had arguably the most comprehensive system of repression ever put in place, with something like half the population spying on the other half, and it fell over, twitched, and died in a matter of weeks because not even the secret policemen believed in the system they were hired to uphold. That's the way revolutions unfold -- and it's also the reason why Orwell's 1984 is a great novel and an inaccurate prophecy. <br><br>Karim, thanks for the correction.

Not sure where you're getting your facts -- for example, the claim that most of the French nobility had fled the country before 1789 is frankly malarkey -- and you might want to doublecheck them. <br><br>Robert, there were significant factions in French society who supported the aristocratic party against the claims of the crown and its bureaucratic supporters, for much the same reasons that lower middle class Americans support the Tea Party against the Democrats and federal bureaucracy. The swing toward condemnation of the entire elite class came only after the revolutionary process got under way, and I think you'll see the same thing this time around. <br><br>Mustard, the problem there is that Britain isn't constantly at war these days. It takes a sustained barrage of enemy fire to bring the Blimps down to earth!<br><br>SeaMari, so's any recent comment from Obama you care to name. It's going to be wryly amusing to watch them try to portray the minute differences between them as vast issues, though at least we can be sure that the charade will end as soon as the polls close this November. <br><br>Raven, sure, and a week after they no longer have the US to protect them, all those rich exiles will be quietly interned "for their own protection" and never seen again. It's part and parcel of the upper class sense of entitlement that so many people fail to realize that money isn't real power any more than it's real wealth. <br><br>John, the Prussian influence in the US educational system vanished about the same time Prussia did. It had its problems, but at least students learned something. <br><br>Ando, thank you!<br><br>Mister R., back before I was able to write full time, I had jobs like that, in which management was drifting around in La-la land, pushing programs and policies that were gutting the companies they ran.

Or maybe just made to do their own yard work for a couple of hot weekends), I’m not convinced it will happen here. I’m sure things will get messy as we go further down the road. But I think the people really in the know will be able to fence themselves in somehow. They don’t actually need to become feudal masters; they can just put themselves under the thumb of some Lord Protector who can do the ugly stuff for the elite class. And there are plenty of scapegoating and attention turning opportunities of course. So I’m thinking the result will be more like a true Third World dictatorship, an impoverished mass held down by a kleptocratic elite for a long time to come. More Hunger Games than Jacobin Club. But time will tell.<br><br>On a related note, I’ve been turning an idea from Introduction To Spiritual Ecology” over in my mind of late – how the power of any flow of energy only manifests fully when it approaches its limits. Now that I’ve gotten my head around this principle, I’m seeing it everywhere I look. And generally it’s a beautiful thing to see. But I wonder if this also applies to broader (and not so beautiful) society-wide energies, like the pursuit of limitless material growth? If so, does that account for the increasingly bizarre and self-defeating (but nonetheless powerful) behavior of leadership elites, as they get closer to the hard limits of growth?

I suspect they've got good reason to do so. We'll be getting to that down the road a bit. <br><br>Phil, I enjoy Murphy's essays!

Just as the uppermost echelon has no idea about what goes on below them, so does the great obsessively-washed middle have no clue about what goes on below THEM. In our society "Let them eat cake" is not uttered by a fictionalized member of "The 1%." Rather, it is uttered on a daily basis by the middle class about the bottom 10-20% or so, often in the form of "Get a job!" or "Go back where you came from!" (that latter to ones what have managed to find one of the jobs that the Great Middle would never stoop to doing anyway). The attitudes you describe about bus travel are as likely to be held by a suburban householder with a 5-figure income than by an elite neo-aristocrat with a 7-figure income. <br><br>This divide was evident in the Occupy encampments last year, when the problems in the camps were often publicly attributed to those icky homeless people and dirty barefoot hippies, not to the "real" occupiers. I guess the 99% somehow is defined to exclude the bottom 10%... <br><br>Attitudes towards those below this second wall of cluelessness are perhaps one of the very few remaining meaningful dividiosn betweeen the two major political parties; and even tehre, neither party really want to talk about it much. The middle needs better jobs and health care; we're not concerned so much with the bottom who have no jobs ad no healthcare, and that seems to be across the board now. <br><br>So I'm not sure what this double division does to the scenario... to use meteorological analogies, when a Hurricane develops a second eye wall, the overall intensity of the storm drops. On the other hand, when a tornado funnel breaks into multiple vortices, that typically makes it even more destructive. Will the middle lash out in both directions attempting to exterminate (metaphorically or literally) those both above AND below it? Or will the bottom try to do to the middle just what the middle is doing to the top? <br><br>SeaMari -- Romney may have been at the NAACP but he was not talking to the NAACP.

Their limos are fully fueled Gulfsteams, their correspondence moves at the speed of light, and, unlike the aristocracy of yore, neither their holdings, nor their loyalties are fixed.

Regarding the Tea Party, Writer Thomas Frank has compared our political situation to a sort of French Revolution in reverse, with the peasants streaming into the streets shouting "up with the aristocracy!" There's also a good bit in Fukuyama's latest book about how the French aristocracy became an extractive rentier class, and how tax collection became "privatized" allowing tax collectors to use taxation as a means of personal enrichment rather than a means to fund necessary government functions.<br><br>There's a new book out in the manner of Galbraith that's apropos to this post: <i>Twilight of the Elites: America After Meritocracy</i> by Christopher Hayes. you may want to give it a read. Hayes talks about how all our institutions seem to be riddled with fraud, corruption and incompetence despite the supposed rule by the best and the brightest:<br><br><i>Hayes pins the blame on an unlikely suspect: meritocracy. We thought we would just simply pick out the best and raise them to the top, but once they got there they inevitably used their privilege to entrench themselves and their kids (inequality is, Hayes says, “autocatalytic”). Opening up the elite to more efficient competition didn’t make things more fair, it just legitimated a more intense scramble. The result was an arms race among the elite, pushing all of them to embrace the most unscrupulous forms of cheating and fraud to secure their coveted positions. As competition takes over at the high end, personal worth resolves into exchange value, and the elite power accumulated in one sector can be traded for elite power in another: a regulator can become a bank VP, a modern TV host can use their stardom to become a bestselling author (try to imagine Edward R. Murrow using the nightly news to flog his books the way Bill O’Reilly does). This creates a unitary elite, detached from the bulk of society, yet at the same time even more insecure. You can never reach the pinnacle of the elite in this new world; even if you have the most successful TV show, are you also making blockbuster movies? bestselling books? winning Nobel Prizes? When your peers are the elite at large, you can never clearly best them.<br><br>The result is that our elites are trapped in a bubble, where the usual pointers toward accuracy (unanimity, proximity, good faith) only lead them astray. And their distance from the way the rest of the country really lives makes it impossible for them to do their jobs justly—they just don’t get the necessary feedback. The only cure is to reduce economic inequality, a view that has surprisingly support among the population (clear majorities want to close the deficit by raising taxes on the rich, which is more than can be said for any other plan). And while Hayes is not a fan of heightening the contradictions, it is possible that the next crisis will bring with it the opportunity to win this change.</i><br><br>Full review: <a href=http://crookedtimber.org/2012/06/18/guest-review-by-aaron-swartz-chris-hayes-the-twilight-of-the-elites/ rel=nofollow>http://crookedtimber.org/2012/06/18/guest-review-by-aaron-swartz-chris-hayes-the-twilight-of-the-elites/</a><br><br>In your telling, Kaplan is a poster child for this meritocratic elite.

"Those who don't learn history are doomed to misquote it!" ...<br><br>@North Coast, <br>Your account of the charities of Marie Antoinette reminds me of the current-day efforts of Al Gore to mitigate global warming. The offering of financial fraud and minor inconvenience to defer nature's wrath is much too little, much too late. It is also similar in that those feeble efforts are met with derision from political rivals. <br><br>@Glenn, <br>Good points you make there, I was thinking the same thing. So much of the infrastructure of current technology is taken for granted, and while an alchemist of 500 years ago <i>could</i> have made a one-off crystal radio at great expense, there would have been little point in doing so if there wasn't a nearby 50kW+ AM radio station. I believe I've mentioned here it before, but I have read an account of a transistor built from ice crystals (sorry can't find a reference). Traces of ammonia or acetic acid as dopants, and of course you have to keep it cold. The charge carriers are protons, so your ohmic contacts must also be hydrogen electrodes. I doubt that they will find practical applications for it. <br><br>As for the 50kW AM stations, maybe enough glassmaking and metallurgy will survive to make tubes; that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl-QMuUQhVM&amp;feature=results_main&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PLBE536F1E5F6072B2" rel=nofollow>French ham</a> makes them, and I didn't see anything much beyond 19th-century tech in his machine shop. <br><br>I also enjoyed browsing the site someone mentioned, sparkbangbuzz.com or whatever. It had a cool kitchen-table laser demonstration (though I wasn't sure just what was lasing, or whether he was just deriving illumination from a spark-discharge). Most of the guy's technology was interesting but wouldn't have much practical use in a severely-constrained economy. How easy will it be to obtain a robust 60kV power supply in the year 2100? And a burnt piece of galvanized steel as a crystal radio detector ... hmmm, maybe.<br><br><a href=distant-sound-of-tumbrils.html#c2722906240562337247 title="comment permalink">7/12/12, 11:50 AM</a><br><br>

Well, we'll see."<br><br>Kind of a cryptic response, so I'll try to clarify my second point. (Unless you were speaking of birth control).<br><br>Ever since the bronze age a lot of improvements have been a direct result of the availability of either improved or more affordable materials. The limit does not seem to be human ingenuity, but what we can afford in terms of time, labour and energy. As you and others have said, a good deal of what we view as "scientific" or technical advances have been enabled by scientists and engineers having access to cheap energy to make their ideas work.<br><br>In a pre-industrial society, the common wisdom is that labour is cheap, and goods expensive. That is because all goods take more labour to produce, in the absence of our current cheap energy.<br><br>In the specific case, of sailing rigs, which you commented on, and which I happen to know a bit about (it's just my life's passion and vocation), the advances of the last three centuries are the result of materials availability. I'm not worried about the ideas of modern rigs being lost, sailors are pretty bright, and it didn't take long for all the improved rigs (from a modern eye) to be developed. I'm not speaking of modern yachts of course, but of working craft, in both fishing, cargo and passenger transport between say, 1750 and 1900, though there are good examples outside this range.<br><br>One of the consequences of this logic is that the knowledge of the making and handling of the older, pre-industrial rigs and hulls needs to be preserved. In the age of salvage (coming up soon on your scale, the present is beginning to feel suspiciously like industrial scarcity to me), we should be able to mimic the 19th century pretty well. It's your "dark ages" until the slow rise of the potential ecotechnic future in which the older knowledge, now mostly shared by a few academics and very serious re-enactors will be needed. As just one example, the differences between how a hand woven hemp square sail of the 1600's was sewn, roped and handled is quite different from how the same sail, on the same type of vessel was sewn, roped and handled in the late 1700's when machine made cloth became widely available.<br><br>In any case, there are plenty of sailors, shipwrights and re-enactors familiar with 19th century design, construction, rigging, sailmaking and ship handling in the U.S. currently, whose knowledge will carry us through the age of salvage. I will try to pass on the more primative information for my heirs in our dark ages.<br><br>Glenn<br>Marrowstone Island<br><br><a href=distant-sound-of-tumbrils.html#c792940950134481943 title="comment permalink">7/12/12, 12:29 PM</a><br><br>

Then I read of the growing influence of international criminals in the economy of that country and how popular it was becoming as a resort for very wealthy Americans. Now we're told that the President has been overthrown by politicians who have strong connections to the military and to American policy makers. <br><br>The American aristocracy, or kakistocracy, does not fail to buy friends wherever it needs them. They can afford to buy all the military, political, media, bureaucratic and legal support they need, especially if they are already major partners in the local political and crime scenes.They are of course already inter-related in various ways with the very similar scum at the top of the heap in the rest of the world.All the money stolen from America has been re-invested elsewhere.<br><br>Thus, I doubt that, as you say <br>'a week after they no longer have the US to protect them, all those rich exiles will be quietly interned "for their own protection" and never seen again.' <br><br>It is probably easier to overshadow and control a small country than a large one. Enough of the no-longer-paid American forces will be happy to follow new paymasters, (taking their fancy equipment); especially if there is a political deal with the surviving American government to give a figleaf of legitimacy. After all, if the Gulf States can hire the elite of the Columbian army, it is quite conceivable that Paraguay say,acting as a front for a few super-rich Kakistocrats, could hire all it wanted of the American army, navy and air force after an American economic and political collapse. 'Atom bombs? You got'em!'<br><br>Also, the American Kakistocrats don't have to give up entirely on America. They can continue to control the political parties, and supplement this by creating or bribing mobs and protest movements amongst the 'sheeple'. The example of Clodius in the late Roman Republic could be up-dated.<br><br>It is said that the continental European feudal aristocracy arose from a mixture of the invading barbarian chiefs with the local senatorial class. It would be no surprise if a similar mixture of 'previously American' crooks with 'previously American' mercenary commanders and locally powerful interests became the rulers of the New World Order well beyond what used to be known as the New World.<br><br>Crisis is Opportunity.

Unless you happen to like the way sweat smells when the person exuding the stuff subsists on McDonalds. (I've long been one of those pagan types who doesn't wear deoderant, but since I eat in a more healthful manner than some of my fellow Americans, I don't think my sweat is all that stinky.

In fact and linking tone of the first comments to your post, both the Greek and American elite ( in company of a lot other elites ) are being quite ready to kowtow to the supposed future Chinese overlords, in the same way the French aristocracy had no issue in exiling in Koblenz and other places, while bringing all the crowned heads armies of Europe against their kinsmen ...<br><br>By the way , and only tangentially related, you mentioned in another post that the "globalization" ( aka sweatshopping somewhere far away ) was a sign of the change of relative costs between mechanized ( and oil fed ) and manual work. That is definitely a plausible position, but note that a lot of countries decided to do the oposite of what the globalisation suposedely upheld and basically payed to kill or buy the other countries industries. The Chinese politics on the USA can definitely be described as such and the EU subsidies to literally not work in a lot of countries that were middle-manned by kleptocratic local nababs ( I'm in a country where the EU payed the fisherman to not work just to not make competition to the French and Spanish fishing fleet in the 90's ), that were thinly disguised actions from France and Germany to protect thir own industries ( that or the readiness for Volkswagen and Renault to grab the Skoda and the Dacia auto factories ) ... well, we could explain it as processes to save their industries from the rising tide for a while by making them aparently more valuable due to lack of competition. Not a winning proposition if we continue going down the Hubbert ( or Seneca ) slope as we are, but something we will definitely see a lot in the next decades.<br><br>Just to end , and tying up everything in a neat package, for a lot of time ( not sure if now ) the biggest profiter of the EU agrarian policy subsidies was a certain Elizabeth of Windsor ( due to the fact that the Crowned Head in England has a lot of real estate attached to the title ). Given the treatment given to her son in the recent riots ( in the same way his limo got eggs it could had got a Molotov, like you suggest in your methafor ) and his ... well, disatachement for the plight of the common englishmen, I guess that family fit like a glove in all of this discussion :/<br><br><a href=distant-sound-of-tumbrils.html#c610874187950506464 title="comment permalink">7/12/12, 3:29 PM</a><br><br>

This is self-evident: every society has poor people but few have revolutions.<br><br>That may explain the relative docility of Americans thus far: lots of stored wealth combined with a sense that the people on the bottom deserved to be there. Historically, if you had enough drive, there were institutions you could take advantage of to be upwardly mobile. Now those institutions are being dismantled.

Certainly both the American and the French Revolutions of the late 1700s were organized -- somewhat behind the scenes -- by relatively small groups of people who built on foundations of widespread popular discontent. The same was also true of the Russian Revolution of 1917, according to well-informed Russians I knew who had lived through those times.<br><br>Nor was the nation-wide student movement of the '60s spontaneous. It began in Berkeley, of course, and by accident I was a "fly on the wall" as it took off, spread, and was carefully crafted to seem spontaneous by the people who organized it. <br><br>Thereby hangs a small tale. In those days, about fifty years ago, I was trading weekly Russian lessons for home-cooked dinners. One of my pupils, who was a co-worker of mine in the university library, happened also to be the wife of an officer of the local chapter of SNCC (the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee). The two of them were only a few years older than I, so we would all have a companionable dinner together, and then she and I would work on Russian at the dining table while he made plans with his friends and fellow-organizers in the living room. I heard a lot of what was said those evenings, and I also briefly met a few of the major players behind the scenes -- not just people involved in the Civil Rights Movement, but also people who were planning the Free Speech Movement before it came to the attention of the pubic, and were working to provoke occasions and provide content for the oratory of well-known front-men like Mario Savio. At some point, maybe in the last months of 1965, a stroke of dumb luck also put a very large sum of money (IIRC, about $100,000), free and clear of any obligation, into the hands of some of the people who were organizing the Free Speech Movement. They used that money over the next few years to send speakers and organizers to universities all over the country. <br><br>MAbout ten years ago I learned that the husband of my student was not just some random young political activist trying to make his mark on the times, but the son of the redoubtable Archie Brown, a leader in the San Francisco Longshoreman's Union and also a member of the Communist Party's national committee.

Read the wikipedia entry. Then did an image search to get a better idea. Amongst the images of two wheeled carts pulled by ungulates there was a glossy head shot of.. well, what I imagine a French aristocrat would look like in the modern era. The link contained this lovely gem:<br><br>Are you familiar with the phrase “tumbril remark?”<br><br>It’s a great phrase. Tumbrils were used to carry French Aristocrats to the guillotine and ‘tumbril remarks’ refer to things the entitled aristocrats said that made the peasants feel like they were <i>completely justified in killing them</i>. “Let them eat cake” is usually the example cited.<br><br>Emphasis in the original.<br><br>Also, the discussion of meritocracy and mastery of a completely useless branch of knowledge reminded me of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle rel=nofollow>handicap principle</a> where an individual signals their fitness through a costly action that is correlated to the actual trait of interest. The classic example is the peacock's tail which requires a lot of resources to produce and makes it easier for predators to spot. This adaptation evolved to provide reliable signaling between animals who have an obvious motivation to bluff or deceive each other. <br><br> This segues to a previous post, <a href=../../2012/05/democracys-arc.html rel=nofollow>Democracy's Arc</a> you responded to a question about the high levels of cooperation amongst bees with: We're social primates, not social insects, and one consequence of that is that -- like most mammals -- each of us is always jockeying for position vis-a-vis the rest of the baboon troop.<br><br> Which leads back to the handicap principle, from Wikipedia: The central idea is that sexually selected traits function like conspicuous consumption, signalling the ability to afford to squander a resource simply by squandering it. Receivers know that the signal indicates quality because inferior quality signallers cannot afford to produce such wastefully extravagant signals.<br><br> Which leads back to the tumbril remarks that drip from the lips of people engaged in sending wastefully extravagant signals. Said words provide excellent justification for conveying the speaker to the chopping block via simple carts.

The Guardian is read by quite a number of more 'progressive' teachers, so there must be an audience, but perhaps they are not representative, except of one segment of the mostly better-off university educated stratum of UK life.<br><br>We have a curious obfuscation about education in our class-stratified society. We call better-off private schools, 'Public Schools'. (Think Tony Blair, David Cameron &amp; the Mayor of London. Strange is it not?) Privilege starts early and stays/pays the course. Lord Palmerston back when attempted the first 'reform' of The House of Lords, and more than a century later we still have an unelected second chamber - and we will have for a while yet. <br><br>Our ruling-classes - I still tend to think of our dear Queen as representing something - used to send their small boys at the ages of 7 to 9 away from their home and from their nurse, (their mother usually not having such an intimate role), to 'boys-only' schools. As the empire grew these developed a kind of quasi-military training, infused with imperial values and became associated usually with forms of 'muscular christianity'. These schools tended by and large not to enhance intimately satisfactory later adult life. <br><br>This costly system could not be adapted to cater for the later mass society and universal minimum literacy. Compromises and attempts at transmitting an 'ethos' meme, however, were made, and these persist. British working class never wholly accepted the 'ethos', nor even fully the concept of compulsory education. In their way, all our kids tended to have an emotionally hard time, certainly until the last few decades. (Where mass media, fast food and other consumerism has led, is another story). The old-school reality though never matched the ethos very closely, and led to a lot of rewriting of personal history during adult life. By and large, especially perhaps in the well-off private sector in Britain, who had more to reform, some of the more outright nightmares previously routinely inflicted on children have been largely rectified.<br><br>So, I guess certain sympathy for wealthy Manhatten from the readership of the Guardian. <br><br>Personally, I think the current meme of 'toughening up' to beat the global competition, is so much political BS. It’s a bit like suggesting we remove regulation of our city smoke and other air pollution to 'toughen up' our lungs and weed out the namby-pambies. Careful management of education for a few hours a day is possible, but forcing young primates into age-stratified fenced group environments however justified on grounds of immediate security, has a strong probability of introducing social pathology, as well as cultural cluelessness. Doesn't work for most social animals, including I have to say, pigs. Dmitry Orlov has had some very interesting observations on educational experience. I think I know what he means when he discusses the Russian term <i>krugozor</i>.

Since the draft was hanging over all our heads, I decided to stay with ROTC for all four years and then discharge my military obligation as an officer. You could choose your specialty as an officer back then. Because I was very good with both mathematics and linguistics (including Russian), I choose cryptography, which fell under military intelligence. <br><br>About half way through my junior year -- and not all that long after I had started giving those Russian lessons to my co-worker -- the kindly old sergeant who oversaw all us ROTC undergraduates called me into his office one day, and advised me to drop out of ROTC. He said he thought I would have a hard time actually getting enlisted men to obey my orders, once I was an officer. This did make a certain amount of sense to me, since I knew that I was something of an oddball and a geek. But I was also worried about doing my eventual military service as a private, if ever I was drafted; and I told him as much. What he said in reply astonished me. He promised that if I did quit ROTC, I would never have to worry about being drafted -- no explanations, just that bare promise. I slept on it overnight, and agreed the next day to do what he asked, since he did inspire a great deal of trust in me. As it turned out, I was right to trust him -- somehow my draft board never got around to calling me up. <br><br>But this whole conversation never made much sense to me until about a decade ago, when I finally happened to learn just who my co-worker's husband was.

Others, who were far to the Right even of the John Birch Society in their politics, thought he was a dangerous leftist, maybe even a secret Communist, manipulating things to stir up as much trouble as possible.

The similarities are quite striking. The French aristocracy accounted for something like 5% of the total population, yet they owned all the land and resources. In the U.S. now, fewer than that control almost as much. <br>It is also telling that (most everyone missed the fact), last year, the 'arab spring' was everywhere in fact, triggered by food riots. But not in the "occupy" U.S. which was about being frustrated in the American Dream of becoming wealthy, or at the very least, well-off and secure.<br>I must point out there are -- to my mind -- at least two crucial differences between the France ca. 1780 and North America in 2012.<br>First the powerful myth of democracy, i.e. that anyone can climb the ladder to "success" is still operent and still fervently believed, especially by those who ought to know better. Whereas, the French peasantry had no such opportunity, nor yet even the pretense of such. Thus the North American can still be coddled into believing that if they are not wealthy, it's somehow their own fault.<br>The second reason is Hollywood, professional sports, TV (Religion is the opiate of the people? Marx hadn't seen anything yet!), the National Enquirer, the cult of celebrity for celebrity's sake, &amp;c. all serve to keep the general population under far better state of controlled distraction than anything the any previous civilization ever devised. All of these also provide highly-visible exemplars that support the democratic mythos that the most underprivileged kid in the most appalling ghetto can still become hideously rich and famous. <br>I just wonder if a sufficiently large percentage of the population can ever lift themselves off the couch and pry themselves away from the TV long enough to rebel.<br>Paris Hilton and Warren Buffett notwithstanding, people in the class of the Koch brothers are quite competent and utterly ruthless and have demonstrated they will do everything possible to keep their power and privilege, hence the current focus on state security measures, drones, and other high-tech, remotely-operated equipment and hence the increasing percentage of "news" being devoted to pop culture instead of anything significant. Moreover, I suspect there will always be sycophants enough to operate those remote-control devices, at least for the middle-term.<br><br>P.S. to JP, the Centennia atlas does exactly what you ask (http://historicalatlas.com/) and Talessman's Atlas of World History is fascinating... and free his hobby.

Interesting event with presentations and debates on all sorts of topics. James H. Lee, a futurist, did one called "The Upbeat Guide to the End of the World" based on his book _Resilience and the Future of Everyday Life_. Lots of overlap with the ADR in terms of changing current lifestyle, gardening, tool-sharing, non-job careers, cutting consumption,etc. But not a lot about actual scarcity and a general assumption that the technology for things like elder care robots will be around for us in the foreseeable future. Very optimistic.<br><br>A more sobering note was a visit to the State Art Museum, which featured an exhibit called "Oil" by Edward Burtynsky, who specializes in photographs of altered landscapes. This exhibit focused on the role of oil in our culture and featured photos of oil tar fields in Albert; ancient derricks in Azerbaijan; acres of scrap cars and planes in the desert near Tucson,AZ; the Talladega Speedway before a big race; suburban sprawl and highway interchanges; and the end zone of the oil story, ship-breaking in Bangladesh and crushed oil-drums waiting to be recycled. Amazing and depressing.<br><br>In line with the gathering theme of mocking the end time predictions for 2012, there were a couple of presentations on Apocalypse. One presenter had been raised as a Jehovah's Witness and recalled her confusion when the world did not end in 1975. Members were told that the church had never made that prediction, even though she had clear memories of it. Her doubts began then, even though the adults around her seemed to buy into the revision of history.<br><br>The limits on the amount of English land and the primogeniture system contributed to the pattern of sons of the gentry going into the Army or Navy. Since younger sons could not inherit the estates they had to choose a career. The Church, the law and the military were the only acceptable paths, as engaging in commerce would drop one out of the upper classes. Managing agriculture on an estate was acceptable, but managing a business was (genteel shudder) "trade." In America there was less prejudice against commerce and the opening of new land provided more options for younger sons, so there was little reason for them to seek a military career unless it personally appealed to them.<br><br><a href=distant-sound-of-tumbrils.html#c7098003344466552341 title="comment permalink">7/13/12, 10:03 PM</a><br><br>

Can't wait to see how the spin doctors are trying to get out of that one!<br><br>What is really fascinating is that given these circumstances, you'd have to speculate that this legislation was lobbied for and written (ie. drafted) by the very industry that benefits from it. Scary stuff, because you then have to wonder how much of this sort of activity goes on and how pervasive is it? Probably quite a often and probably very pervasive.<br><br>Also, a lot of commenters have fantasies about Third World Dictatorships. It takes a lot of manufacturing, energy and financial support from Industrial countries to run these dictatorships. Any break down in local manufacturing facilities means that weapons and raw materials have to be sourced externally otherwise the force cannot be maintained for very long. It may be wise for commenters to consider the golden rule in this circumstance.<br><br>The other thing is that commenters also tend to have fantasies about are off shore funds for wealthy types. Yes, these exist, but haven't you lot ever noticed that in the event of an economic crisis, large flows of funds tend to be channelled back into the US - particularly into government bonds which are seen as a safe haven. These are subject to the same risk as everything else in a major economic collapse. Wealthy people worry about losing their wealth, it’s what keeps them up at night. The only wealth that money has is what it can buy. It is not a resource in itself (kindling maybe?).<br><br>Someone also mentioned Warren Buffett. He comes across as a pretty decent sort of a bloke. But, I may be wrong, hasn't he channelled most of his monetary wealth into a large not for profit trust with his children as trustees? Doesn't this structure avoid certain death duties and capital gains? What was one of the main points in this week’s essay?<br><br>Hi shargash,<br><br>Good to see that someone knows their Aussie history. William Bligh lacked political nous. To have been mutinied against once, fair enough, but twice, you'd have to ask the hard questions.<br><br><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum_Rebellion rel=nofollow>Rum Rebellion</a><br><br>What was interesting is that Governor Lachlan Macquarie that followed Bligh in NSW took the same people and resources and ran the colony completely differently. A very smart man.<br><br>Hi Adrian,<br><br>Sorry to hear about your water troubles. Over here those summer conditions are pretty typical every few years or so. Your hedgerow plantings are on the right track, but in the short term you need an over storey of very drought hardy shade trees. In those conditions, I'd recommend oaks or acacias. They may not grow much during those types of seasons, but at least they won't die either. The acacias are also nitrogen fixing. Also apply woody mulch (made up of a variety of woody materials – the more diverse the better). When you think you have put enough mulch on, add some more and make it deep. This stuff reduces evaporation and keeps the root systems cool like a blanket plus encourages fungal systems which feed the trees. Never let any soil at all be exposed to the sun and if in doubt add more mulch. Also don't cut the grass short. Hot weather will mean that it will die back, but at least the dead leaves will shade the soil. Too many people mow grass short because of fashions, which ends up then requiring too much water to keep alive. You never see short grass in nature in hot dry climates. Also if weeds take hold in your exposed soil, give them a chance and then when conditions change, chop and drop them – they’re trying to help you.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=distant-sound-of-tumbrils.html#c3325784097294428321 title="comment permalink">7/13/12, 11:17 PM</a><br><br>

Workers who don't even have the luxury of eating three meals a day or wearing different clothes two days or more in a row, let alone being able to drive their own car to work would certainly shock the upper middle class and elites who are the voices of our media. But I'd argue, since graduating college in 2011, that what I see in my workplace has already become the new norm, especially for young people. There's been a lot of talk about my particular cohort of young people, the recent college graduates who have certainly dug themselves into a very troubling situation; I'd argue, however, that the cohort slightly younger than us, today's teenagers, have been given even less opportunity and are already fighting just for the scraps left at the very lowest rung of the social ladder, often not even being able to get access to that. <br><br>What we see is a permanent expansion of the lowest class. It's important, however, to remember that using your own personal anger or disappointment as fodder for hopes or fantasies of a total collapse of this system you find so unjust is not constructive; as JMG mentioned, the French Revolution was not followed by a utopia but instead by Terror. No matter how much you find wrong with our system, the responsible course of action is still to do your best to work with it. As the midwest corn crop failure disaster begins to get coverage, I can already say I'm thankful there's still reasonably priced food in the store and an employment opportunity that gets me access to that food.<br><br><a href=distant-sound-of-tumbrils.html#c1065904838784846338 title="comment permalink">7/14/12, 7:02 AM</a><br><br>

Your drought sounds like the summer of 2008/09 here where the summer rains failed, the aquifers were depleted by below average rainfall over winter and spring and hot winds blew in from the centre of the continent day after day. The upshot though was that not much grew. But, with a bit of advance preparation, not much died either.<br><br>I didn't have the spare water capacity then that I have installed now either, although even now I'd still only use the water I do have on the vegetables and herbs and then leave the trees to chance, as they'll probably be OK. <br><br>One bonus of hot dry summers is that the fruit that does grow is smaller but much more highly flavoured - not that most people care about such things nowadays. As an interesting side note, in recent times friends have fed me imported garlic in quite a few different houses now and it tastes odd to me. The imported stuff costs between 5x and 80x of the price of the locally grown stuff (due to a soil virus/fungus). The imported stuff is sprayed with methyl bromide which goes some way towards explaining the odd taste. But palates become quickly accustomed to changing flavours… Sorry, I digress.<br><br>It is worthwhile having a look at the video for the work that the Permaculture Research Institute of Australia is doing in the Jordon desert as their basic methods are as applicable here and also at your place as in Jordan.<br><br><a href=http://http://permaculture.org.au/2009/12/11/greening-the-desert-ii-final/ rel=nofollow>PRI work in Jordan - Greening the desert</a><br><br>It is worth watching because they have chosen to start a demonstration site at probably one of the most inhospitable places on Earth. There is nothing particularly complex or difficult in the techniques they employ in Jordan, it is just that they are prepared to employ them, observe them and be held account for the outcomes. Perhaps this can also be viewed as walking the talk?<br><br>Corn is so central to your diet in the US, it is a significant national risk if that one crop fails. It is a very heavy feeder too which is a burden on your ecosystem and an impending disaster especially if chemically fertilised.<br><br>As to your question about the future, I wonder about this issue too. As an observation, the culture that we do live in is profoundly wrong in that we pursue the interests of the individual regardless of the expense of that pursuit. <br><br>In comparison, the forest here doesn't work that way at all and each species is part of a larger system. The whole system is in a state of flux and change and different species push at their limitations, but they all live within those limitations because they have no choice. More or less, it seems to be a system that works.<br><br>We tend to be the species that doesn't accept limitations, or we impose them on others if the limitations conflict with our own individual needs.<br><br>Enough ranting... You'll know we are on the right track when you note that mutual obligation becomes social currency again. That is the thing to look out for. We're not there yet and it may be a strange time in between, but we'll get there eventually as we have no choice in the matter.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=distant-sound-of-tumbrils.html#c6676906974022809424 title="comment permalink">7/16/12, 2:21 AM</a><br><br>

In Revolutionary France, the aristocrats may have fled to Coblenz but the army was largely on the side of the National Assembly, so the attempt to restore the Bourbons by way of Austrian bayonets ran into the hard fact that one of the largest armies in Europe was still very much in the way. <br><br>Jennifer, that's the way revolutions start. <br><br>Escape, it's a bit more complex than that. A successful revolution depends on the conjunction of middle class radicalism and a shift in loyalties on the part of the masses.

I think you need to go read some history. <br><br>Author, that isn't what I said. What I said is that by and large, the higher a salary somebody earns, the less they have to do to earn it. The average CEO of a bank probably gets more in a year than your great-uncle made in his lifetime; that's the sort of thing I was referencing. <br><br>Robert, there are always groups of people trying to organize dissent and make something happen. I'm interested in what differentiates examples like the Sixties movement, which didn't overthrow a government, and 1789 France, which did. <br><br>Michael, never blame conspiracy for something that can be accounted for perfectly well by stupidity. <br><br>Tim, I hadn't heard the term "tumbril remark," no!

It was a straight-forward reform movement, not a revolutionary one. It wasn't even an exclusively leftist movement back then; many centrists and a certain number of rightists strongly supported the FSM in its early days. It was only Ronald Reagan's hostile response to the Free Speech Movement, as a new governor, in late '66 and '67 that polarized things for political advantage, and started to tip the movement more strongly leftward.<br><br>In 1968, of course, lots of other things began to erupt as well both in politics and in culture. What was left of the old Free Speech Movement was quickly subsumed into the whole "[Late] Sixties Movement," which was actually a highly disorganized bundle of various distinct movements, which often fought against one another as much as they fought against the "mainstream." All of the various revolutionary movements that emerged during that period, without exception, managed to alienate the rightists and to create a new sort of conservative -- "Reaganist" rather than Goldwaterist" in its views. More significantly, all these revolutionary movements managed to alienate the enormous part of the population that thought of itself as anti-extremist or moderate. And in the US, any revolutionary movement that alienates the moderate center is doomed from the outset. (This is not necessarily true in other countries, but it seems to be an enduring truth in US political history.)<br><br>At least, this is how it seemed to me at the time, and still seems so in retrospect.<br><br><a href=distant-sound-of-tumbrils.html#c155530245684874768 title="comment permalink">7/16/12, 4:10 PM</a><br><br>

France avoided a sucessful foreign intervention more by luck than design: the French army not only was mostly in France, but also did no broke in the too common warring factions that happen all the time when the political power goes down ( say, the cyclic story of the Chinese dynasties aftermath ), mainly because the exodus of the previous elite dropped the control of the army in the hands of a small and highly coesive group of middle rank officers like Massena, Junot or, last but not least, a certain Bonaparte. It could had definitely not had happened in that way ...<br><br>Now the US army might or not hold in one piece if the political elite flees and ask for a external power to intervene ( the US army does have it's internal rivalries and cliques like any other , and who knows what will happen to it if the bigwigs disappear and become the enemy ), but that is pretty dwarfed by the fact that the US Army is spread around the world and the battle ready parts of it are not in the US and neither can come to fight in the US readily even in ideal conditions. In that the situation seems far more similar to the Philip II grab of the Portuguese throne in 1580-81 ( with the full consent, invitation and support of the high classes against the popular strata that had crowned one of his cousins King of Portugal ): as the Portuguese troops were tied to action in India and the Far east, it was easy to capture the power center in Europe before the troops in India could even think on acting.

One of the things I appreciate most about your work is the historicity - your view that the collapse happens step-wise and differently in different places, rather than all at once and everywhere. <br><br>It seems to me that the deeper the denialists bury their heads in the sand, the louder the doomers yell that everyone on the planet is going to die, and very soon. Not a surprising reactivity, but some nuanced interpretation would be good.<br><br><a href=distant-sound-of-tumbrils.html#c7913353673883315546 title="comment permalink">7/18/12, 7:30 AM</a><br><br>

You're quite right, of course, about alienating the center; I've thought more than once that the radical groups that spend all their time trying to alienate most people are, by that action, proclaiming that they're not actually interested in making change happen. <br><br>Nox, I read it when it first came out. His "X class," of course, isn't outside the class system at all; it's better known as the middle class intelligentsia, which always deludes itself into thinking it's outside the class system, and thus ignores the benefits it gains from that system. <br><br>Diane, not a bad metaphor -- though I think in this case Kaplan's blindness is self-inflicted. <br><br>Carp, fascinating! I'd been expecting this to start happening fairly soon; the sheer volume of denial makes it clear that people are starting, however unwillingly, to pay attention. <br><br>JP, I'm not sure I find that analysis convincing; still, it's worth considering. <br><br>Phil, the frustrating thing about Monbiot is that he gets it, except when he doesn't. <br><br>Mustard, it would explain our politics...<br><br>Bob, I've commented on it at vast length in previous posts, and will be discussing it again in this week's post. The short form? The collapse is already happening. While people sit around waiting for a fast collapse, industrial civilization is collapsing the way real civilizations collapse, in the real world -- a bit at a time, spread out over years. We're already seeing the fallback positions being established, and failing, and being replaced -- what do you think the last four years of dubious economic gimmickry and spreading unemployment are about? This is it; this is what collapse looks like. <br><br>Ricardo, an interesting parallel! I'm not sure if you're aware, though, that the US military has quite a bit of its total force based in the US, for reasons we'll be discussing down the road a bit -- and as long as current technologies hold out, quite a bit of the remainder can return here in a matter of a few days at most. <br><br>Cathy, I'm talking right now about the leading edge of the next round of catabolic collapse, which will probably hit at some point in the next two decades. There's not a lot of good news to it, except for the fact that those who work on their green wizard skills are going to be much better prepared for it than those who don't. <br><br>Tideshift, the fixation on overnight collapse is another form of denial. It's a denial of what's actually happening -- "no, no, we don't have to go through a long slow grueling decline, it'll all be over in a flash!" More on this in this week's post. <br><br>Justin, that may be, but your image makes a good memory anchor!<br><br><a href=distant-sound-of-tumbrils.html#c3832474508513553439 title="comment permalink">7/18/12, 10:49 AM</a><br><br>
