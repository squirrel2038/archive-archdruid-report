<div class=MsoNormal>
Over the last four months or so, as this blog has sketched out the trajectory of empires in general, and then traced the intricate history of America’s empire in particular, I’ve been avoiding a specific issue.  That avoidance hasn’t come from any lack of awareness on my part, and if it had been, comments and emails from readers asking when I was going to get around to discussing the issue would have taken care of that in short order.  No, it’s simply a natural reluctance to bring up a subject that has to be discussed sooner or later, but is guaranteed to generate far more heat than light. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The subject?  The role of protest movements in the decline and fall of the American empire. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s an issue sufficiently burdened with tangled emotions and unstated agendas that even finding a good starting place for the discussion is a challenge. Fortunately I have some assistance, courtesy of Owen Lloyd, who is involved with an organization called Deep Green Resistance and recently wrote a  <a href=http://dgrnewsservice.org/2012/05/04/book-review-the-blood-of-the-earth/ >review</a>
of my book <i>The Blood of the Earth</i>. It’s by no means a bad review. Quite the contrary, Lloyd made a serious effort to grapple with the issues that book tried to raise, and by and large succeeded; where he failed, the misunderstandings were all but inevitable, given the differences between his views and mine.  Thus it’s all the more striking that his review points up so precisely the reasons why protest movements have by and large been spinning their wheels in empty air for thirty years, and will almost certainly continue to do so while America’s empire crashes and burns around them.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The point that matters here is the review’s denunciation of one of the central points of the book, which is that those who want to change the world need to start by changing their own lives.  According to Lloyd, we don’t have time for that, since the biosphere is in dire peril; what’s needed instead are the standard tools of contemporary activism—"direct action, community building, and outreach," in his convenient summary. His reasoning is logical enough, as far as it goes; if your house is on fire, after all, it’s a little late to install sprinklers and smoke alarms.  If the situation is as urgent as Lloyd claims, all other considerations have to take a back seat to an all-out effort to deal with the immediate crisis with the most effective means available. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a common enough claim in the contemporary activist community; Derrick Jensen had <a href=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/4801/ >an article in Orion Magazine</a> a few years back making essentially the same argument.  Still, there’s a problem with that argument, because the responses Lloyd, Jensen, and other activists are promoting here have been standard across the spectrum of activist groups for more than three decades now, and that’s more than enough time to see how well they work. The answer?  Well, let’s be charitable and say "not very well." </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For years now, leading environmentalists have been bemoaning how much ground is being lost year after year, and how little the environmental movement has been able to do even to slow that down.  They are quite correct in that assessment, of course.  It’s standard these days to insist that this simply shows the power differential between the corporate interests that profit from environmental destruction and the citizen groups that are trying to fight them.  That argument seems convincing, too, so long as you do what most people these days are taught to do, and ignore the lessons of history. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Glance back to a slightly earlier period and at least one of those lessons stands out in bold relief. In the 1970s, environmental activists facing equally powerful and well-funded corporate interests built a mass movement and forced through landmark legislation.  In the United States, the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act, and a bevy of less famous but equally important environmental bills crashed through a wall of corporate opposition and became the law of the land. That sort of success is something that today’s environmental activists can only daydream about, and it was accomplished using the same tools that activists use today—with one important addition: the environmental activists of that time recognized that the most effective way to advocate any given change was to make that change in their own lives first. That awareness was not limited to the environmental movement; it was pioneered by the feminists of the 1960s and 1970s, in fact, who turned it into a core principle of their movement—"the personal is political"—and leveraged it efficiently to bring about dramatic if still incomplete gains in women’s rights. They recognized, as did many other activists in those years, that if your lifestyle supports a system, and depends on that system, any efforts you may think you’re making to force significant change on that system will be wasted breath. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It will be wasted breath because most people, reasonably enough, want to see that there’s a life worth living on the other side of the changes your activist movement wants to make, and the best way to give them a glimpse of that life is to enact it yourself. It will also be wasted breath because most people have a tolerably good nose for hypocrisy, and are highly familiar with the kind of demagogy that calls on everybody else to make sacrifices and get by with less so the demagogue doesn’t have to do so. Talk to Americans who didn’t support either the climate change movement or its corporate opposition, and you’ll find that for a good many of them, it was when word of Al Gore’s air-conditioned mansion and frequent-flyer miles got around that they decided that global warming was yet another manufactured threat, meant to stampede people into acquiescing with somebody’s political agenda. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finally, it will be wasted breath because if the system you think you want to change is also the system that supplies you with a comfortable middle class lifestyle, with all the comforts and conveniences that such a lifestyle supplies, the changes you will push the system to make will pretty reliably be limited to  those that will not affect your continued access to the lifestyle, comforts and conveniences in question. The Breton peak oil blogger Damien Perrotin <a href=http://theviewfrombrittany.blogspot.com/2012/03/false-choices.html>has commented amusingly</a> on the influence of what, in France, are called bobos—that is, bourgeois bohemians (the acronym works equally well in both languages), members of the liberal upper middle classes. Bobos are terribly eager to see themselves as the saviors of the world—that’s the bohemian side—and will do absolutely anything to fulfill this role, so long as it doesn’t require them to give up any of the benefits of their privileged status—that’s the bourgeois side. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I hope the term catches on in this country, because we have a lot of bobos over here, too. Last week’s discussion of captive constituencies has a special relevance in any discussion of the species <i>Bobo americanus</i>, because being active in the captive constituency of some otherwise mainstream political faction is a very popular way to play the role of saving the world without risking disruption to the system that gives bobos their privileged status. There are also substantial personal rewards available for those who take leadership positions in captive constituencies, and help keep them captive. It’s a role bobos are well qualified to fill, especially those who come from the upper end of the class hierarchy and so have the connections and skills for the job.  That’s where you get the executives of mainstream environmental groups who draw six-figure salaries, maintain cordial relationships with corporate sponsors, and show an obvious willingness to settle for whatever scraps may fall from the tables of wealth and power onto their corner of America’s unwashed kitchen floor. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, the bobo-ization of American radicalism is not limited to such obvious cases.  When you hear activists loudly insisting that it’s possible to save the world without being an ascetic—and I’m sorry to say that, yes, that well-worn trope turned up in the Owen Lloyd book review cited above—you’re hearing the echoes of bobo influence, in the form of the popular but profoundly wrong notion that it must somehow be possible to maintain today’s unsustainable lifestyles on a sustainable basis.  That’s not going to happen, for reasons that reach right down into the laws of thermodynamics; no amount of handwaving is going to make it happen; and the sooner we get used to living with a lot less, the less damage we will do to ourselves, each other, and the Earth as the industrial economy sputters to a halt. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course that suggestion is anathema to the existing order of things, in America and elsewhere. It’s usually anathema in a declining imperial society. James Francis’ useful study <i>Subversive Virtue: Asceticism and Authority in the Second-Century Pagan World</i> chronicles how the imperial Roman government came to treat the asceticism of Stoic and Neoplatonic philosophers as an unendurable threat to its authority. They were quite correct to do so; a system that maintains itself in power by bribing the lower classes with <i>panem et circenses</i> and the middle and upper classes with the more lavish entertainments chronicled in Petronius’
<i>Satyricon</i> has no convenient lever with which to control those who have no interest in these things.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus it’s probably safe to assume that there will be no effective opposition to the status quo in this country until some movement arises that in practice—not just in theory—embraces an essentially ascetic approach.  My guess, for what it’s worth, is that the first movement to do so will be a revived Marxism. I’m no fan of Karl Marx, and even less a fan of the various ideologues who filled out the framework of his system, but Marxism has features that will give it powerful appeal in the decades ahead.  It gives the poor someone to blame for their misfortunes, and does so in a far more detailed manner than (say) the vague rhetoric of the Occupy movement; it is among the few ideologies that manage to fuse a rigorous intellectual tradition with a utopian future vision of religious intensity; and it has a strong ascetic element—the figure of the Marxist revolutionary, lean, passionate, doctrinaire, and contemptuous of material goods except insofar as they might help further the cause, was a common social type in Europe for close to a century. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Marxism also has an advantage just now that no amount of money could buy it: the extraordinary campaign of unintended propaganda that the Republican party is currently carrying out on its behalf.  Right now, even the most moderate and revenue-neutral attempts to use the powers of government for the benefit of American citizens are being lambasted by the GOP as communism.  It’s an embarrassing admission of intellectual poverty—one gathers that the American right spent so long belaboring the Red Peril that it really has no idea what to say now that communism isn’t around any more—but it also guarantees a familiar kind of backlash. Fundamentalist churches that spend too much time denouncing Satanism, complete with lurid descriptions of Satanic living replete with wild parties and orgiastic sex, get that kind of backlash; that’s why they so often find that they’ve merely succeeded in making devil worship popular among local teens. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the same way, if the Republicans succeed in rebranding, say, public assistance and food safety laws as Marxist, the most likely result of that campaign will be to convince a great many Americans of otherwise moderate political views that Marx might have had something going for him after all. As suggested above, I don’t consider this a good thing; in theory, Marxist revolution leads to the glorious worker’s paradise of the future via the inevitable workings of the historical dialectic, but in practice the dictatorship of the proletariat reliably turns into just another dictatorship, with the usual quota of gulags and unmarked mass graves.  Still, in a country where most people are frighteningly ignorant of history, and are being driven to the wall by a corrupt and spectacularly mismanaged imperial economy in headlong decline, it’s unpleasantly unlikely that this point will be remembered. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, other forces are pushing American society toward a crisis that its existing political and economic arrangements are unlikely to survive, and the rehabilitation of Marxism is unlikely to proceed fast enough to reach any sort of critical mass before that crisis hits in earnest.  It’s probably a safe bet that the more mainstream groups will increasingly side with the established order of things—I’ve long suspected that before all this is over with, the Sierra Club will come out in favor of strip mining the national park system so long as it’s done in, ahem, an environmentally sensitive way. Outside the bobosphere, things are much less clear, for the twilight years of a disintegrating political system tolerably often create a fiercely Darwinian environment for ideologies and political movements, in which the only thing that matters is which set of beliefs and personalities can build the strongest coalition at the right time, absorb or marginalize the largest fraction of opposing groups, and make the most successful bid for power.  As that bubbling cauldron of competing belief systems boils over in violence and systemic disruption, it’s anyone’s guess who or what will come out on top. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Whoever ends up more or less in charge of what’s left of the United States of America when the flames die down and the rubble stops bouncing, though, will have to face a predicament far more difficult than the ones encountered by the winners in 1932, or 1860, or for that matter 1776. All three of these past crises happened when the United States was still a rising power, with vast and largely untapped natural resources, and social and economic systems not yet burdened with the aftermath of a failed empire; the winning side could safely assume that once the immediate crisis was resolved, the nation would return to relative prosperity, pay off its debts, and proceed from there. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That won’t be happening this time around. When the crisis is over, whatever form it takes, the United States—or whatever assortment of successor nations end up dividing its territory between them—will be a shattered, bankrupt, resource-poor Third World failed state (or collection of failed states) that will likely have to struggle hard even to regain basic levels of political and economic stability. That struggle will be pursued in a world in which energy and other resources are getting scarcer each year, energy- and resource-intensive technologies are being abandoned by all but a very few rich and powerful nations, and unpredictable swings in temperature, rainfall, and other climatic and ecological factors make life a good deal more difficult for everyone.  In that not-so-far-future America, the comforts and conveniences most of us now take for granted will be available only to the rich and powerful, if they can be had by anyone at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the world our choices over the last three decades or so have been preparing for us, and for our grandchildren’s grandchildren. In such a world, the people who will have the most to offer their communities, their societies, and the biosphere that supports all our lives will be those who have the courage, now, to walk away from the consumer economy and its smorgasbord of dubious pleasures, and learn, now, how to get by with less, use their own capacities of body and mind, and work with the patterns and processes of nature.  For the time being—specifically, until we get close enough to the crisis period that even the most nonviolent challenge to the existing order calls down massive violence in response—protest can still accomplish goals worth pursuing, especially if activists wake up once again to the power of personal example; over the longer run, though, it’s the change on the individual, family, and community level that so many of today’s activists reject as pointless that have the most to offer the world. </div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
Comets are fascinating things, and they have an ancient reputation as omens of trouble. Still, you might expect the industrial world in 1973 to have responded with a little less frenzy to the appearance of the much-ballyhooed Comet Kohoutek. It was discovered by Czech astronomer Luboš Kohoutek on March 7 of that year, while it was still a very long way from the sun, and back-of-the-envelope calculations suggested that it might put on a spectacular show.  The mass media proceeded to lose the word "might" and fill headlines with claims that Kohoutek would be "the comet of the century." </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was all it took to catch the attention of the apocalyptically minded. David Berg aka Moses David, leader of the Children of God sect, did the most to publicize a Kohoutek apocalypse; his proclamation  that the comet would destroy the world in January of 1974, printed on bright orange flyers, was handed out by his followers to people all over North America. (I think I may still have one in a file box in the basement.) All through the last months of 1973, the comet had something of the same cachet that the supposed end of the Mayan calendar has today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As it turned out, though, the prophets were wrong, and so was the media. Far from being "the comet of the century," Comet Kohoutek turned out to be a very modest spectacle indeed, barely visible in the night sky above my backyard—I think we were too close to the streetlights or something. Fans of apocalyptic prophecies quickly found some new prediction of doom to discuss, and the phrase "Comet Kohoutek" had a brief moment of fame as a synonym for "dud." </div>

My church has a reading group with this book, so I recall a quote I copied from my first reading 20 years ago. It's about long suffering and seeing a path that sets us free from bondage to our own fears. How do you draw others out of their solitude? Just an idea but I think when you look in the right way, the chances to act, against apparent self-interest, encourages others as well, and our collective delusions can be slowly exposed and collectively reworked....<br><br><a href=#c3477145157126377579 title="comment permalink">5/16/12, 11:11 PM</a><br><br>

Father Zossima and His Visitors. (d) The Mysterious Visitor Paragraph 12 <br><br>"That life is heaven," he said to me suddenly, "that I have long been thinking about." And all at once he added, "In fact, I think of nothing else." He looked at me and smiled. "I am more convinced of it that you are, I will tell you why later on." <br><br>I listened to him and thought that he had something that he wanted to tell me. <br><br>"Heaven," he went on, "lies hidden within all of us - it lies hidden in me now, and if I will it, it will be revealed to me tomorrow and for all time. … And we are all responsible to all for all, apart from our own sins. You were quite right in thinking that. And it is wonderful how you could comprehend it in all its significance at once. And in truth, so soon as men understand that, the Kingdom of Heaven will be for them not a dream, but a living reality." <br><br>"And when?" I cried out to him bitterly, "When will that come to pass? Will it ever come to pass? It is not simply a dream?" <br><br>"Then you don't believe it." He said, "You preach it and don't believe it yourself. Believe me, this dream, as you call it, will come to pass without doubt. It will come, but not now, for every process has its law. It's a spiritual, psychological process. To transform the world, to recreate it afresh, men must turn into another path psychologically. Until you have become really, in actual fact, a brother to everyone, brotherhood will not come to pass. No sort of scientific teaching, no kind of common interest, will ever teach men to share property and privileges with equal consideration for all. Everyone will think his share too small and they will be always envying, complaining and attacking one another. You ask when it will come to pass; it will come to pass, but first we have to go through a period of isolation." <br><br>"What do you mean by isolation?" I asked him. <br><br>"Why, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our age - it has not fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet. For everyone strives to keep his individuality, everyone wants to secure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself. But meanwhile all his efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self-destruction, for instead of self-realization he ends by arriving at complete solitude. All mankind in our age is split up into units. Man keeps apart, each in his own groove; each one hold aloof, hides himself and hides what he has, from the rest. He ends by being repelled by others and repelling them. He heaps up riches by himself and thinks, 'How strong I am now and how secure.' And in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps up, the more he sinks into self-destructive impotence. For he is accustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the whole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in men and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and the privileges that he has won for himself. Everywhere in these days men have ceased to understand that the true security is to be found in social solidarity rather than in isolated individual effort. But this terrible individualism must inevitably have an end, and all will suddenly understand how unnaturally they are separated from one another. It will be the spirit of the time and people will marvel that they sat so long in the darkness without seeing the light. And the sign of the Son of Man will be seen in the heavens. ... But, until then, we must keep the banner flying. Sometimes even if he has to do it alone, and his conduct seems crazy, a man must set an example, and so draw men's souls out of their solitude, and spur them to some act of brotherly love, that the great idea may not die."<br><br><a href=#c4280096303483912324 title="comment permalink">5/16/12, 11:14 PM</a><br><br>

No stable govt. until several elections and the population is exhausted and accepts a radical who promises the moon. In this case it is called Syriza which rejects Troika policy to austerity Greece to save to death for the banks pocketbooks. When this happens to Spain in some couple of years and then like a domino effect everywhere else as the economies collapse protest will be superfluous as they will have succeeded. We see what protest brought to Syria, civil war. Protests in the 1960s brought 1970s RAF, etc. We will have fundamental national interests expressed first at the ballot box when the economies collapse and then in wars like a chess game in say ten years perhaps. Of course as you say we are on the downslope of industrial civilizations so that whoever wins will have control over less resources and maybe have to leave people to their own designs like Russians and their potato patches or Post-Roman people in similar situation. Minimalist govt. with every so often fights for the resources from the political centers but which most people will ignore, due to no electricity and news and internet perhaps in their neck of the woods, literally.<br><br><a href=#c7378980572154142928 title="comment permalink">5/17/12, 12:57 AM</a><br><br>

I spent the entire day from dawn until almost dusk, dropping trees and cutting up for future years firewood and I am zonked out. <br><br>Don't stress people about the trees as the forest is so poorly managed hereabouts that I'm actually also doing some good and if anyone is really interested drop a comment and I can talk more about this and provide a link to an interesting paper on the ecology here.<br><br>As a confession I used to live in a bobo suburb and attend bobo events like "confest", until my travels took me through Nimbin one day and a chance visit to an old hippy museum. I found it to be a really sad experience because I couldn't pretend that the idealism wasn't completely subverted. Then with fresh eyes I looked at the world I lived in and saw the truth that it was no more than skin deep - an image so to speak. <br><br>The people around me in the bobo suburb were doing quite well, in fact they did far better than the average. There was some extreme conspicuous consumption going on if you just poked below the surface, so I moved to get some air and truly be the change that I used to bang on so much about.<br><br>I read Owens critique and he doesn't have much to worry about with the bright green technologies as they are really expensive so won't make much of an impact at all. Also his supposition about resistance is kind of off the mark because change will happen regardless of his personal beliefs or actions. It is inevitable, and the people demanding change on others would be far better to get their own houses in order. Yes, I can say this with some level of credibility.<br><br>Speaking of which, I've been tweaking my solar power system recently so that I haven't had to use the petrol (gas) generator to top up the batteries over winter. So far, so good as I haven’t so much as pretended to start it up, but the winter solstice is coming up on June 21 here.<br><br>Also a bit of feedback about the solar hot water here, which after much messing around with now seems to operate as you'd sort of expect. Even in mid-May (ie. late autumn) some useful solar gain was to be made today and the water was toasty hot tonight.<br><br>Oh well, chop wood, fetch water. But definitely no activism! What a waste of time. I can't even convince the neighbours to get more involved in growing their own produce - even to not accepting freebie vegetables and fruit trees which are now self-seeding and adapted to local conditions here.

I have been a reader for a while and have had many moments of illumination. As a graduate of the Women's Movement I'd like to expand on "The Personal is Political" This meant more than walking your talk. It was a way of helping women understand that the circumstances of their life were not completely or even largely a matter of personal choice but a political arrangement (a power distribution). Women were pigeonholed and limited and then internalized their frustration as self-blame and inadequacy. To know that the details of laundry cooking and childcare were society's way of distributing unpaid labour was a tremendous relief. It was consciousness raising at it's most empowering. Today the consciousness raising is not about personal empowerment as much as it's about survival. This is a much harder sell!<br><br><a href=#c7487291875995750146 title="comment permalink">5/17/12, 6:40 AM</a><br><br>

I find the possibility of Marxism a bit head-scratching, though, considering your familiarity with the irrational side of human nature. Mention Marx as even just another economist who described the workings of capitalism (increasingly accurately, as it turns out), and you might as well invoke old scratch himself. Americans are a stubbornly anti-intellectual lot, and Marxism’s intellectual rigor has all but assured that it never had much of a chance here. Can you imagine the average suburban church-going American making it through chapter one of Capital, or mentioning words like bourgeoisie in casual conversation? Maybe on college campuses, which does not a revolution make. That Communism has failed is as true to the average American as water flows downhill or the earth is 6,000 years old. The well has been poisoned for socialism in America essentially forever – during the last depression my city was governed by socialist mayors, yet even the most liberal leftist will run away screaming in the other direction from such an appellation today.<br><br>No, Americans want simple answers that will allow them to hold on the their privileges and not make sacrifices, and the Republicans have an endless supply of easy answers. The only functioning social institutions in most of America, for better or worse, are the churches. They are deeply committed to the reactionary ideology of modern day Republican party, and will follow it to the bitter end. Every failure of that ideology to date <i>has not caused a retreat from it, but rather a doubling down,</i> and I see no end in sight. And the money and resources backing up this movement is pretty close to infinite. This is why I think resistance is futile. They will do literally anything to prevent another Roosevelt, even if that means pushing us toward another Hitler. As Halford E. Luccock said, often misattributed to Sinclair Lewis, “When and if fascism comes to America it will not be labeled ‘made in Germany’; it will not be marked with a swastika; it will not even be called fascism; it will be called, of course, ‘Americanism’.”<br><br><a href=#c2363443394497364841 title="comment permalink">5/17/12, 8:02 AM</a><br><br>

The U.S. will become Mexico North, ruled by a small hereditary oligarchy, with corrupt institutions backed by bribery, legal and otherwise, and with most people barely surviving from day to day. Eventually Americans will realize they will almost all have to live like the Mexican immigrants in my neighborhood – living in multigenerational households to save on rent, saving money for emergencies, walking to the corner grocery store, cooking beans and rice at home, buying used goods at rummage sales, and getting their services and jobs provided through the informal network of people who know people while paying and getting paid under the table in the informal network economy. Green not by choice, but by necessity, precipitated by their own political ignorance. Thus, to your point, we need not do too much for this reality to emerge.<br><br>Eventually, capitalism will fall as it becomes increasingly unworkable due to a confluence of factors now reaching critical. It won’t be overthrown by any sort of revolution as Marx predicted; workable structures will be bootstrapped into place, and we’ll muddle through, which is much less dramatic or romantic for the budding revolutionary. Through a process of (de)evolution we will arrive at what the next economy looks like.

I now await each week's post eagerly. As usual, this one was educational and enlightening. <br><br>I have been considering the ascetic lifestyle you discussed pretty much since I started reading your blog, but I've always felt like it's just not something I can undertake immediately; my circumstances leave me feeling like I have little control over my life. Of course, if I look at things logically, the lifestyle you espouse is probably the best way to take control of one's life. I am now in a situation where I may be forced into it whether or not I think I am ready. Despite working 60 hours a week for the last year, I am facing homelessness by the end of the month if I don't make some drastic changes. I probably have no choice but to dispose of about 90% of my material possessions and downscale my life dramatically.<br> <br>Unfortunately, I will be no closer to creating a more sustainable lifestyle for myself and family but I suppose I can look at it as an opportunity to start over and build that lifestyle from scratch. It will be complicated by the fact that I am a single father with a teenage daughter, as well as two young adult daughters who are in nearly as dire circumstances as I am right now. At least one of them has some inclination towards sustainable living, but all of them may be forced into it more quickly than they realize. I only hope that I can lead by example, and convince them that although the American Dream they've been taught to pursue is only an illusion, a better, more satisfying life can be created on the fringes of this decaying empire.<br><br>Kevin Lee<br>Port Townsend, WA<br><br><a href=#c3654106888708582944 title="comment permalink">5/17/12, 8:38 AM</a><br><br>

If it's "members of the global 1", then relatively few individuals in the US qualify. In fact, as I understand it, median personal income is around $26,000, while the threshold to belong to the global 1% is close to $50,000 (in 2012 dollars -- the $42,000 threshold was worked out in 2005 currency). My guess is that somewhere around 10% of Americans qualify. And for what it's worth, I don't think very many of those were out on the streets during the Occupy protests.<br><br>Anyway, what this brought me to was the thought that it might be worth trying to come up with a working definition of "middle class" for the purposes of these discussions. If for instance, "middle class" means having an individual income of over $50K, then very few Americans, and even fewer people in most other countries, qualify.<br>It seems that there really is no clear understanding of what the term means, and given the coming readjustments in living standards, it might be good to have some common language to talk about that. <br><br><br>Maybe a definition based on the trappings of the middle class would work?

Prejudice against people of color was everywhere, yet most of us white people realized that we were hypocritical. Here we were, fighting a never-ending war for freedom and democracy, yet we had disenfranchised our country’s main minority to the point that they were rioting and burning down large sections of cities. Things had to change, and everyone knew it. I don’t mean to deny the courage and hard work and sacrifice of those in these movements, I just wish to point out that a message has to be popular to make a change.<br><br>Today’s messages are much harder to sell:<br><br>“We can stop anthropogenic climate change, but you'll have to ride a bike ten miles to work everyday and become a democrat.” <br><br>“We can reform the banking system, just be prepared to lose everything in a financial panic.”<br><br>Unlike the causes of times past, these choices entail personal sacrifices, risks and huge lifestyle changes. It’s no wonder they aren’t popular enough to get traction.<br><br><a href=#c7809248351585780275 title="comment permalink">5/17/12, 9:07 AM</a><br><br>

I doubt I'm the only reader who felt an uncomfortable shudder of recognition when I came across the line about the United States headed towards the status of a Third World failed state. Anyone on board with you this far would agree we're well on the way, but put in such blunt terms it's sobering.<br><br>That brings to mind American cities. A lot of people here have probably heard of Wendell Berry, but not Grace Lee Boggs. She's a 97-year-old Chinese-American woman who spent about fifty years in Detroit, participating in the old Marxist left, the Civil Rights movement, and the Black Power movement. Starting in the 1970s, and more and more since then, she's become one of the foremost voices in community activist circles promoting sustainable living, community gardening, getting rid of cars (an especially powerful statement in Detroit). <br><br>She has forcefully argued, including in her recent book The Next American Revolution, that the old struggle of the Marxist left to take over the state, or win expanded access to the middle-class American consumer lifestyle, is bad for the planet and inseparable from state repression and empire. One of her favorite phrases is "be the change you wish to see in the world." She has mostly done work in inner-city black communities, but really her message dovetails with that of JMG, Wendell Berry, and a lot of other people in different kinds of communities who are calling for sanity. <br><br>What I find striking is that such a message is coming from the American city which, arguably, most resembles the conditions JMG describes in this post. We would all do very well to heed the voice of someone with such experience.<br><br>Great job on a stellar article. I hope the book reaches a very large readership.<br><br><a href=#c1222173432372414292 title="comment permalink">5/17/12, 9:28 AM</a><br><br>

Outstanding job as always. I love the comments about the bobos as I think the idea really captures a portion of the electorate, throughout the world I might add, that has altruistic aims, but just goes about it in a way that accomplished nothing short of failure. It reminds me of the “environmentalists” in the U.S. that think driving a Prius, spending exorbitant amounts of money at Whole Foods for items that are out of season and shipped halfway around the world, and sending a tax-deductible $25 donation check to the Sierra Club every year solidifies their status as Champions of Gaia. <br><br>The intent is certainly there, but even the most committed activist by and large refuses to do the heavy lifting that would truly result in change. In this example, planting a vegetable garden or giving up the car could prove much more effective, but that requires time that could take away from the panem et circenses of the modern era, such as Desperate Housewives reruns. <br><br>In essence, it is easier to be a charlatan for a cause, or a stooge to a political faction, as opposed to an actual practitioner of the arts that one subscribes to, especially if the subscriber’s actions have a chance at actually upsetting the status quo. <br> <br>This reminds me of the Cathars whose very existence, like that of other ascetic groups that you mentioned including the Stoics and neoplatonists, threatened to upset the existing balance of power. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Cathars presented the Catholic Church with perhaps one of its largest doctrinal threats in its history. The members of the group were followers of Christ, but they believed that he was mortal rather than a divine being. As such, they sought to emulate him in as many ways possible to show the greater path to salvation through good deeds. The priesthood of this group was open to both sexes, and the group practiced herbalism, celibacy, and pacifism among other things. <br><br>By adopting these edicts, and shunning material wealth, they represented a clear break with the Catholic Church, which was seen as a monolithic and fraudulent organization that did not represent the true will of God. The ideas of this group gained traction in significant portions of medieval France and Italy, and while the church viewed them as a mere nuisance at first, the strong foothold gained by the Cathars over time increasingly persuaded the church to respond with violence. An inquisition followed and by the 14th century, the church wiped the Cathars off the map, often quite literally, by raising entire villages to the ground. <br>Yet while the Cathars were destroyed, their ideas survived perhaps even to the point of serving as the the intellectual catalyst for the Reformation which would come two centuries later. <br><br>The point is, the group shook up the power structure tremendously not by directly engaging the Catholic Church, but by showing people how their lives could go on, and perhaps even be fuller, without it. It was a powerful sentiment, and there are examples of “showing by doing” serving as a model for change throughout history if one knows where to look. <br><br>Activism and marching on the street with a sign in support of a cause are easy and require little self-sacrifice or self-investment. They also generally fail to upset any of the power structures that are deemed threatening. On the other hand, living the change you wish to see is an entirely different matter; it is more difficult, but it is one that has proven to be the most revolutionary time and again throughout history. To quote Elvis, it is time for “A little less conversation and a little more action.”<br><br><a href=#c8847429199443036251 title="comment permalink">5/17/12, 9:44 AM</a><br><br>

Nearly every single religion on earth (though you'll have to inform me whether this is so in Paganism) has a strong ascetic element. The sad fact is, most of the environmental movement is tied to the Progressive Left, which views any religion that is not mostly concern with "social justice" as a reactionary bastion of greed, racism, sexism, and war-mongering. <br>Having grown up Eastern Orthodox, where asceticism has a very strong place, learning to "live with less" seems natural and proper to me. A famous Russian saint once said, "Acquire the spirit of peace and thousands around you will be saved", and this inward struggle bearing fruit in the world around us applies not just to our spiritual condition, but to our physical condition as well.<br>I think it is symptomatic of the ills of modern life, and thus one of the reason that so much that passes for activism is outwardly focused, is that looking in ourselves and having a true change of heart is difficult and painful. It is much easier to convince ourselves that we are entirely on the side of right, and we must then march forward to "save" the rest of the world. Solzhenitsyn once famously said that the dividing line between good and evil runs not through parties, nations, or groups, but through every human heart, and who wants to rip out a piece of their own heart?<br><br><a href=#c4421093131394441481 title="comment permalink">5/17/12, 9:53 AM</a><br><br>

I'd suggest that Anarchism is more likely to become the resurgent radical ideology than Marxism.<br><br>But then, I could be wrong. Unlike most folks here, I don't reject activism or radical movements entirely. Activist movements, often based around a politics of identity and fueled by a radical, pseudo-religious ideology have won every important right we've enjoyed over the last hundred years. And while large-scale activism no longer seems able to accomplish anything (in part because of the activist community itself and its complete failure to appeal to the general public) I've seen activist campaigns win important victories at the local level.<br><br>At the same time, as someone who's been around radical movements for the last decade, I really appreciate reading criticism of activism. I've found authoritarian and totalitarian strains in every radical movement I've been around. Anarchists police each others' language and lifestyles. "Deep Green Resistance" is little better than a cult. And don't even get me started on the International Socialist Organization...<br><br>Still: I don't think that activism or a large movement is incompatible with creating change at the level of "individuals, families, and communities." I think the promise of this century is the prospect of movements based around horizontal, networked ties of mutual support between just such individuals and groups-- which is exactly the sort of social and economic structure that most socialists have been promising for the last century and a half.<br><br><a href=#c551546675715970624 title="comment permalink">5/17/12, 10:11 AM</a><br><br>

If a powerful congressional panel has its way, it could be the last time the Navy ever uses biofuels to run its ships and jets.<br><br>In its report on next year’s Pentagon budget, the House Armed Services Committee banned the Defense Department from making or buying an alternative fuel that costs more than a “traditional fossil fuel.” It’s a standard that may be almost impossible to meet, energy experts believe; there’s almost no way the tiny, experimental biofuel industry can hope to compete on price with the massive, century-old fossil fuels business.<br><br>Committee Republicans, like Rep. Randy Forbes, insist this isn’t an attempt to kill off military biofuels before they have a chance to start. “Now, look, I love green energy,” he said in February. “It’s a matter of priorities.”<br><br>But if the measure becomes law, it would make it all-but-inconceivable for the Pentagon to buy the renewable fuels.

You suggest that I believe it “possible to maintain today’s unsustainable lifestyles on a sustainable basis”. But it isn’t that I believe unsustainable lifestyles are sustainable, it’s that I don’t believe that it is possible to maintain any lifestyle on a sustainable basis in the context of an unsustainable culture. For instance, studies have found that even the homeless in the United States have a carbon footprint twice the world average (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080428120658.htm). In your book you say that you live in an Appalachian town without a car, and thus will be better situated for a time when oil becomes prohibitively expensive. But of course when oil becomes prohibitively expensive, food in the local grocery will become expensive too, regardless of whether you are walking to the store or driving there. You are benefiting, like the rest of us, from the numerous subsidies of a cheap oil economy now beginning to unravel. Even when you hear about a lone person or two living without money entirely, it quickly becomes clear that they wouldn’t be able to maintain that lifestyle without utilizing the privilege of cheap oil. There’s no escaping that.<br><br>Okay, perhaps it is possible that a few individuals, relocating deep in the woods, could perform something like a total escape from the oil economy. But I don’t see it as something that could happen on any serious basis. Even if everyone voluntarily reduced themselves to homelessness, which seems an unlikely proposition, we would still have an aggregate carbon footprint something like twice that of the typical country. So what I am suggesting is that instead of working on reducing our own consumption, we need to be stopping that consumption at the root. We need to ensure that unsustainable lifestyles will not be sustained any longer. I agree that we are better off changing our lifestyles voluntarily, because it will make the changes down the road– which are inevitable for anyone, no matter how purportedly sustainable they claim their lifestyles to be– easier to bear. But just as you can’t end rape by not raping anyone, and you can’t end genocide by not killing anyone, you can’t stop global capitalism by simply ending (or more likely, reducing) your participation in it. I find that just another example of magical thinking.<br><br><a href=#c5859968171694056125 title="comment permalink">5/17/12, 11:43 AM</a><br><br>

I'm a big fan of beatnik literature, and one of the books I'm reading now is "Fug You" by Ed Sanders about his press, bookstore and band The Fugs...also a lot of history about the counterculture and protest movements of the '60s in New York's Lower East Side. It's interesting to contrast the beats involvements in such things as the Civil Rights movement, Feminism, and Sexual Liberation, areas where they lived by their own example, to what is now the "protest" movement. Which to me, in my early 30s, seems to be mostly people whining that they aren't able to live like a bobo so easily. (I heard this bobo term before... thanks for reminding me again of it!)<br><br>2. Derick Jensen. In my own magical praxis dreamwork play a central role. I'd read bits and pieces of Jensen's work, and while I can understand the sorrow he feels for the state of the world, his books are rather difficult to read. However I thought I'd give his newest title "Dreams" a go... I haven't made it all the way through this hefty tome yet, but what I like it about is how he addresses the nonrational aspect of our nature, and how industrial society has tried to ditch this nonrational aspect, but how the nonrational can actually empower us. He also talks about Otherworlds and his encounters with animals, spirits of the dead, etc. All things I can relate to from a shamanic point of view. And I am happy he is bringing his own views on dreams and dreamwork to the activist and environmentalist audiences who will read his book. However what irritates me about Jensen is his insistence that all forms of civilization are bad. I don't agree with this. I happen to like many aspects of culture and civilization. I think some of it would be very useful to salvage before the neo-luddite-marxist-barbarian-punk-rockers descend on the bobos in their already-decrepit and not-worth-fixing suburban homes. So I think Jensen is worth reading. But like anyone else you might read, there is stuff to filter out. It will also be interesting to see if the more secular sides of the environmental movement will take up his ideas on dreams, otherworlds, and the nonrational. <br><br>As for me, my own connection to nature will always be tied to my spiritual views.<br><br><a href=#c5531450951670025179 title="comment permalink">5/17/12, 12:01 PM</a><br><br>

It is the rule of radical individualism promoted by sociopathic thinking, which, in turn, is promoted by actual sociopaths, who’s brains are wired without a conscience, who prosper and take control of the machinery of competition the better to prey on the weak who actually have our brains wired to allow for a conscience. For those for whom this is a new idea, please read The Sociopath Next Door.<br><br>No sustainable culture can successfully tolerate the elevation of these mental defectives to positions of power. The remarkable thing of our time is that the destruction and collapse routinely caused by the assumption of power by this segment of the population is now affecting the entire world rather than isolated cultures. Rome reduced much of the world under its control to a state of collapse, socially and environmentally. But this is true of all expansionist cultures which are all ruled by sociopathic individuals who transfer their diseased attitudes to the general culture and precipitate collapse. Only bottom up, complex and evolving systems of governance, sans ruthless competition, have any track record of sustainability. Marx and the early anarchist understood this fact of nature but remained under the spell of a fundamentally sociopathic world view. All institutions that include competition between individuals for positions of power and authority are sociopathic at their core. That most assuredly includes the academic world that is blinded by its own ambitions.<br><br>At this point in my standard rant the libertarians begin to think that I am one of them. I am not. If anything my thinking is much more radical. I am a radical communitarian. Sorry.<br><br>This article, good as far as it goes, ignores biology, human and otherwise, and therefore is lost in the weeds of naval gazing. There is plenty of scientifically founded information to support a communitarian viewpoint, but it is uniformly distasteful to the radical individualist mode of thought that dominates currently and is studiously ignored by the overeducated.<br><br>Out of the rubble of our sociopathic institutions will come those who return to biologically healthy modes of thought. Science is the worship of testable hypotheses. Sociopathic thinkers use scientific results when it suits them and ignore science when it doesn’t and always want to twist scientific thinking to do their biding. Misunderstanding Darwin is a good sign of sociopathic thinking. Evolution is a series of answers to problems presented by our environment. For the solitary species one might say that radical individualism is that answer. For social species like ourselves radical individualism is a disease.<br><br>herb<br><br><a href=#c6294255478186925557 title="comment permalink">5/17/12, 12:10 PM</a><br><br>

For a while I actually *was*, living the good life on my small organic farm, learning new skills and basically being much more in keeping with the Earth's systems.<br><br>My Achilles heel came in the form of a close relative who used bad thaumaturgy to convince my other half that what we were doing was, basically, insane.

I got the term, as mentioned in the post, from Damien Perrotin, who referenced current French slang. <br><br>Barath, I'm not going to risk a guess as to how soon the crisis stage will hit -- that's always a very uncertain thing -- but a break with normalcy is a very common feature of this sort of crisis. Think of the experiences of a family living in Atlanta in 1855-1870, or a family living in Oklahoma City in 1925-40; there's a period of creeping drift, then the status quo ruptures, there's a ragged period of descent into crisis, and then everything goes haywire (Sherman marches through, or the dust storms begin) and the entire structure of ordinary life goes away in a hurry. I suspect a lot of people now living will have that sort of experience. <br><br>Raven, that's pretty much a given. <br><br>Catherine, thanks for the details! From an outsider's perspective, one of the most powerful things that came out of that process was the recognition that women needed to make change in their own lives -- to refuse the disempowering and pigeonholing -- in order to make real change. I'd like to see more of that happening now. <br><br>Larry, it's going to be a colorful show straight across the board. I'll be interested to see how the Chicago situation works out. <br><br>Lynn, yes, they were right. The Grange to this day has a rule that prohibits bank employees from joining the organization -- that's one of those necessary steps to avoid cooptation.

A century ago, fundamentalist Christianity was a radical left-wing movement, and it was the Republican party that supported environmental causes. Yes, people will double down, and double down, and double down...and then something gives, and a sizable portion of the populace snaps into a different view of things. I think we're very near such a snapping point, and the GOP is unintentionally doing everything in its power to see to it that Marxism benefits from that. <br><br>Steve, thanks for the link -- it's a source of much hilarity to me, at least, to note how many times in the last decade some highly experimental research into an unproven and risky energy source has been ballyhooed as the solution to all our problems. A society that actually had solutions to its problems wouldn't have to flail like that. <br><br>Kevin, that's a harsh path to walk, and I'm sure it doesn't help to know that hundreds of thousands of Americans are facing it with you.

It's rather good, at least until the last few paragraphs, where I can see exactly the problem you've mentioned. In fact, it's something which you would think a good reading of Blood of the Earth (or the posts it's based on) would rectify. He presents a false dichotomy. Act now, in this very specific and radical way, or the world will end. <br><br>I think Paul Kingsnorth pointed out a little while ago that the problem with this thinking is in defining what is meant by the end of the world. Is it the end of the modern lifestyle? Of industrial civilisation altogether? Of 9/10 of the human race? All of the human race? All life on the earth's surface? Each of these has two properties -- likelihood of happening, and the severity of its consequences. What many activists do is to mix up the likelihood of the end of the modern lifestyle with the severity of the wiping out of all life on earth. That's dangerous black magic.<br><br>Paul Kingsnorth also wrote an article in Orion magazine echoing much of what you said in this post, about <a href=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/6599/ rel=nofollow>walking away from environmental activism</a>. If you haven't seen it, I'd recommend taking twenty or thirty minutes to do so. It's very eloquently written and makes some important points.

One’s example will communicate something to others. But while a few will think you are an inspiration, most will think you’re a Nutter. I’m guessing if Al Gore had cycled off to his new Yurt right after an Inconvenient Truth was released that most people would have put him into the Nutter category, and we would still all be where we are. <br><br>The trouble is, that no one who has the stuff really wants to give it up. Or at least very few. I’m backing away from mine, but mainly because I think I’m going to have to anyway and I think I’ll be better off in the long-run by controlling my own descent. So there is a self-interested aspect to my motives.

Some of the greatest activists I have known personally have been community health workers offering free doctor’s services to homeless or struggling kids. I also knew a homeless, visa-less activist who spent day and night working, (and for all I know still does), on helping refugees behind bars to receive fair hearings in the face of the largest race based scare campaign this side of the yellow peril. And there are still fellow activists who on a regular basis organise long walks throughout Australia and the world that seek to maintain the dialogue about the effects of uranium mining, nuclear energy and nuclear weaponry and while doing so allowing ears to hear and voices to be heard in remote places where much of the action actually takes place. Some even travelled the USA in attempt to get every capital city to individually outlaw nuclear energy to try and prevent the need for us to dig it up. If this is direct action, outreach and community empowerment then I’m all for it. And many activists do go through stages of asceticism in their campaigns, often taking it on cold turkey in the midst of major cultural conflicts only to burn out within a very short time, become cynical and revert back to a “simpler” life within the dominant paradigm. <br>I myself have been an activist for many causes in Australia and Hong Kong and will openly admit and discuss the flaws inherent in the processes and attempts we made. But jaded as I may be, I do not look back with disdain. It’s partly through those connections that I am the organic gardening, rubbish interventionist, workshop facilitating person I am today. It’s through reflection on raw experience that I can learn such valuable lessons. The false notions of consensus that are reached through valid attempts to attain it are everywhere within these groups for many reasons. There are powerful personalities, passions, body language and the caution/awe of newcomers and the confidence/arrogance of veterans. Not to mention the need for expediency and the gargantuan task of devising methods for campaigns against mind bogglingly powerful corporate/government bodies, backed by police and very often cultural habit. It’s clear that hypocrisy runs rife through the activist community. It’s as prevalent as depression and chauvinism. It is so because it is rife in society at large.<br><br><a href=#c6761413599158975299 title="comment permalink">5/17/12, 7:46 PM</a><br><br>

Deep ecology, Gandhian personal example, Christi-anarchist philosophy, theatre of the oppressed techniques and even military discipline have been explored in order to enhance our understanding and by virtue our actions. Yes we could all stand to do better in setting personal examples, not just setting up facades of unity, integrity and perfection, but lets not get caught in a binary headlock either. The fact that NGO CEO’s are on six figure salaries and hawkers on the street try to sell EZY—PLUS save-everything-with-a-monthly-donation packages doesn’t mean that us living off dumpster diving and spreading the rewards amongst our friends and strangers need be tarred with the same brush. There are many definitions of activism and I guarantee this blog falls into one of them (though I’m not so sure about the CEOs). Your blog is an active part of a community of people making choices and acting in ways that aim to better humanity and themselves and is especially powerful in nurturing awareness of how the personal is political. When it boils down though, we make personal choices and define ourselves and actions in complicated ways; being influenced and attracted and repulsed in an ongoing process I’ve dubbed the cosmolectic. All this is part of the reality of living with dissensus (thanks for the term), which I see as an unavoidable fact of life, not to be encouraged as much as accepted. <br>We are all somewhere on a curve known as learning. And it has to be said that people only a little younger than myself and living in the modern west have grown up being handed a techno fantasy lifestyle that’s difficult to see alternatives to. To counter this we need to cultivate compassion and understanding as well as our gardens. We need to preserve the DIY traditions and wild spaces that surround us and revert more than a few tamed ones back. And we need to admit and learn from our mistakes.<br><br><br>@ John D Wheeler, I think one way they tax the household economy is through fines as penalties for “criminal behaviour”.<br><br>@LynnHarding, the other day I met an old guy who has been in bio-dynamics for what seems like forever to someone my age, and who was a member of the early movement to outlaw DDT having personally seen and photographed its effects on insects and then birds. He did the most remarkable thing at this workshop where I met him. He apologized for having been partly responsible for why bio-dynamics was not more widely accepted. He felt they were being too exclusive and not allowing for people to find their own ways of approaching this extraordinary method of earth connection and soil enhancement. He felt terrible that they had set the movement back thirty years or so here in Australia and his apology was so sincere. So I really appreciate what you’ve said and feel that there’s a hell of a lot of apologizing that still needs to come from people far less caring than old John Priestley.<br><br><a href=#c6530063289540907994 title="comment permalink">5/17/12, 7:46 PM</a><br><br>

Not sure how well that'll work for the present case, though. <br><br>Pentronicus, a lot of white people had to give up very definite privileges when Jim Crow died, and a lot of people of all colors would have a lot to gain from a return to honest banking, so I'm not sure how well your distinction works. <br><br>Igneous, well, I wasn't familiar with Grace Lee Boggs, and clearly I need to read her. Thanks for the heads up!<br><br>Troubador, true enough, though the example of the Cathars also shows how catastrophically protest can implode if it isn't prepared for the potential backlash from the centers of power. We'll need to be a lot more careful this time. <br><br>Lament, exactly. I'm not saying that protest is inappropriate -- that's something Owen Lloyd missed (see below) -- but it has to be rooted in, and combined with, the harder work of changing your own life, or it goes nowhere. <br><br>Steve, I don't think activism is inappropriate, or incompatible with the other changes I've been discussing, either! My point, again, is that it's not a substitute for changing your own life. <br><br>Escape, you'd think the GOP, for all its flag-waving, would have more sense than to cripple the ability of the US military to survive a serious interruption to oil imports. Sheesh. <br><br>Owen, thanks for your response as well, but I think you need to reread my post! I'm not saying that personal change is necessarily a replacement for social change -- I'm saying that the methods being used for social change for the last thirty years, including those you discussed in your review, have flopped so dismally because they don't address the personal dimension. It's all very well to insist that we ought to stop consumption at the root, but the means you've proposed for doing that have failed, and one more round (or a hundred more rounds) of direct action, community building, and networking, the standard toolkit of contemporary activism, aren't going to accomplish any more than they've done over the last thirty years. The environmental movement won victories when it addressed the personal dimension, and its members were willing to make changes in their own lives; once it abandoned that strategy, it started losing, and hasn't stopped yet. That being the case, maybe it's time -- or past time -- to revisit the methods that worked. <br><br>Justin, I'll have to read the Sanders book! I'm less thrilled about the prospect of reading Jensen -- his previous books have left me distinctly unimpressed. Still, that he's exploring the inner dimensions of the crisis of our time is probably a good thing. <br><br>Herb, yes, I know it's popular these days to come up with claims that the people whose policies one doesn't like are mentally abnormal, psychotic, etc., etc., ad nauseam. That's simply another amplifier of the polarization that's tearing this country apart; I don't think it's helpful at all.<br><br><a href=#c7104308193330610096 title="comment permalink">5/17/12, 10:39 PM</a><br><br>

Monasticism functions because it takes the material aspect of life down to the bare minimum, and so permits time to be redirected to more important things. As for asceticism feeding violence, er, maybe you ought to discuss that with some Jain monks...<br><br>Owen, for heaven's sake, I didn't claim that you were a bobo! Your review was only one of several things I discussed in my post. Some of your ideas seem to have been bobo-ized, but that's true of much of the environmental movement these days. The claim that direct action, community building, and networking can be equated with asymmetric warfare, for example, got a lot of play in glossy avant-garde publications a few years back; it's simply another repackaging of the current ineffective methods of protest, but I don't think many people realized that or pointed it out. <br><br>That aside, the fact that you do without a lot of the goodies of the consumer economy -- you mentioned in your review that you don't use a car or a TV, which is an excellent start -- makes you a more effective proponent of change; you'll find that if you talk about those things, and address the need to change from that background, a lot of people will take you more seriously than they would take somebody who'd just driven up in an SUV. You might consider using that effect. <br><br>Don, by all means! I read it back in the day, though I didn't save a copy. <br><br>Harry, it's not quite fair to misquote Fire Sign Theater and say "We're all bobos on this bus," but there are a lot of recovering bobos here. Good to hear that you're making sensible changes. <br><br>Jason, it's not just a matter of preaching to the choir -- every day new people go looking for the insights they're not getting either from the mainstream media or the established protest movements, and some of them end up in the peak oil blogosphere. Keep with it if you can. <br><br>Kieran, I read Paul's piece when it first came out -- a very powerful and moving essay, and one of the reasons I follow the Dark Mountain phenomenon. (A shared fondness for the poetry of Robinson Jeffers accounts for a fair fraction of the rest.) <br><br>Yupped, if Al Gore had announced that he was replacing his old mansion with a passive solar house made of recycled materials, with solar water heating and other green technologies, and done it, he would be a massive political presence now. If he'd also announced that he was giving up air travel, and traveling by train from here on, and done a few other changes like that, he'd have become a stunningly effective figure, and the climate change movement might not have collapsed the way it did. It's not necessary to live in a yurt -- though that's certainly an option, and can be a good one for some people -- what's needed is a willingness to change in a green direction, visibly and publicly, and stick with that.<br><br>Wall, a back to the land movement is not a good idea at this point, for reasons I've explained about fifty dozen times so far. What's needed is a "reinhabit right where you are" movement, but nobody wants to hear that -- the daydream of going back to the land, being conveniently unavailable to most people, is far more cozy. <br><br>Rashakor, thanks for the history!<br><br><a href=#c3973330279364048095 title="comment permalink">5/17/12, 10:58 PM</a><br><br>

These thoughts might just have some bearing on the attractiveness of life changes.<br><br> Something of the ‘effete’ clings to the English view of the aesthete - the student of the beautiful - but I am thinking of something else! More than any school or study of art forms; more like a way of being in the world. Some people see the world differently, and their memories relive the world differently because they accurately recover the beautiful across the range of sensory experience. This is no clinging to art objects. This is more like a sense of being in touch. They would not wish for substitutes. Such a sufficiency for themselves and for their love could look decidedly ascetic as it typically needs minimal material expression, although there can be great grief in the loss of small things and of individual companions.<br><br>I think there is more of this stuff in us than we realise. <br>Steve W said; “I'm always amazed when other people in the world have less materially than those of here in the USA, but still appear to be happier!”<br><br><a href=#c7127115106259352058 title="comment permalink">5/18/12, 6:24 AM</a><br><br>

First, he thinks activists can continue their futile political efforts of the past 30 years. Or, he says, they can take Gandhi's advice and prioritize leading by example, adopting simpler living arrangements to reduce their individual ecological footprints.<br><br>Why no other options? Is it possible that the environmental movement's 30 years of repeated failures did not actually exhaust all of the possible alternatives for resistance? The movement's brief early period of legislative successes is supposed to be convincing evidence that "being the change" (personified by Appropriate Technology practitioners at that time), and thereby encouraging others to follow, is activists' best and only bet for stopping environmental destruction.<br><br>It is my impression that Owen, fully recognizing the failure of mainstream environmentalism, rejects the claim that Gandhian asceticism is the only alternative. I think he is just as interested in avoiding those failures as JMG. Indeed, that seems to be the central purpose of DGR. While Owen is not explicit about the alternatives, the DGR mission is essentially to identify the strategic flaws of the mainstream movement in order to act more effectively. JMG deems this pursuit <i>a priori</i> doomed to failure and his own chosen pursuit the only worthy one.<br><br><a href=#c5279001003188449075 title="comment permalink">5/18/12, 11:46 AM</a><br><br>

Yes, it's true that simply not raping anyone won't end all rape, but surely it's a prerequisite to any sort of activism. Imagine an organization that claims to take a radical stance on ending rape and sexual abuse, claiming to be getting to the root of the cultural patterns of violence and domination behind the individual incidents. What if this same organization took the stance publicly that it didn't matter if its members were rapists and beat their wives, as a few personal outbursts are nothing compared to the huge amount of sexual abuse taking place in this country due to cultural issues.<br><br>That would be rightfully pointed out as ridiculously hypocritical, yet it's the equivalent of what Derrick Jensen and his strain of so-called radical environmentalists say.<br><br>Owen's statement "I don’t believe that it is possible to maintain any lifestyle on a sustainable basis in the context of an unsustainable culture" and the paragraph that follows really misses the point. Yes, nobody can live up to the impossibly high standard you've set in this day and age. Saying that it's not worth making any changes because of that it like saying getting into physical shape is worthless because you will never be able to runs mile in two minutes. That ignores the tremendous gains that you can make, it's not all or nothing. My lifestyle is certainly not perfect, but I do consume far less than an average American, and keep on making strides in that direction. Seriously cutting consumption is both pragmatic for ourselves and lightens the burden on the planet. Yes, that's a modest compared to all the environmental destruction going on, but it's a necessary first step. For all the radical talk, what positive environmental changes have Derrick Jensen and the Deep Green Resistance people actually achieved.

I protested against the Iraq war and saw how utterly useless it was. Once I understood the ramifications of peak oil, I understood why it was useless. At that point I felt like I had two choices. I could become an activist and go to meetings and marches or whatever, or I could stay home and learn how to live locally and sustainably. <br><br>I chose the latter and never looked back. I understand why those activists burn out, they've got two full time jobs! I'm still not living completely sustainably. There are various challenges, we're slowly moving toward it. Just bought some good bikes so we're all outfitted and hoping to do a lot more biking in the future. I totally agree that we can only lead where we are willing to go. One thing I would say is that living a lower energy more local life can have surprising benefits. Watching my children pick veggies from the yard and bring in eggs in my small urban lot brings me a lot of joy.<br><br>Igneous: Thank you!

One of the feature threads of this article and much of your writing is Gandhi’s famous epithet of being the change you want to see in the world and that idea, or your adherence to it, is not in dispute, least not by me. It is an overstated and under applied principle and asking others to change without out changing your own ways is a futile form of caring for the planet.I did feel that the references to direct action, outreach and community building and activists were very broad and needed some clarification and so took it upon myself to add to the discussion. I understand that you were referencing your experiences and the role of activism in American life, of which I have little practical experience. If I misunderstood you in my response, or was guilty of the tangled emotions entwined in this issue, then I hope it is understandable considering what I have invested in such activities. I do for my part see how unproductive, or even counterproductive many of those efforts were and hope that what I wrote gave off some light, and not just heat. I see this blog particularly as a form of outreach, direct action and community building funnily enough. Perhaps that may seem to be stretching those definitions to some but after all, it’s about doing what works in accordance with your conscience and after all my time spent following your blog, I’d have to say that it is working and I would endorse your blog to any activist I know, and do: kudos. My response was a rant but what I was hoping to achieve was to at least mention in this forum the work that goes into developing activist’s minds and tactics by activists themselves and the self criticism sessions that we have been through and the failings and mental health issues that many end up with due to their efforts. You are on the money with many of your criticisms and I can vouch for that from personal experience. It’s worth mentioning the disrepute that the big-business end of activism can have at the grass roots end also. Activist organizations are branches of civil society that keep alive many important tools, social discourses and local forms of knowledge that are unavailable within mainstream settings. There are a large variety of groups, and tactics employed at the community level would never pass the scrutiny of the board of members of some of the big NGOs. My aim was to add another voice to this discussion, a voice with experience in the area in question and not to point the finger. I can only hope I’ve widened peoples views of what taking part in grass roots activism entails.<br><br><a href=#c3545639362447745707 title="comment permalink">5/18/12, 11:42 PM</a><br><br>

Certainly there will be people who seek heat. Either way, I'm glad you took on the topic. Not because I am interested in protests (the only thing I have protested was having to clean my room as a teenager) but because of where it led me personally and what I was able to share of it with those around me.<br><br>Having come from alcoholics and enablers, black sheep and the righteous of a fringe religion, I'm sensitive to how deed and word align, but also aware that we are complex beings each with a path that may be incomprehensible to someone else. The people I am most inspired by are doing their work and not asking anything of me that they haven't asked of themselves, and for me, the most lasting change comes from inspiration rather than fear.<br><br>Whenever I feel offended or the heat rises about a topic I know it's probably not the topic that needs my attention but it's more likely a gate, one I can enter or pass by, to something deeper in myself, some part that may have been long forgotten and in need of some interaction, play, expression. Yesterday I found succour in the Confessions of a Recovering Environmentalist by Paul Kingsnorth (thank you Kieran for the link, and oh my, Dark Mountain feels somehow like home). I've been about as much of an environmentalist as I have been an protester, but I think what he's written about is part of a natural progression when we reach a point in our lives or the life of a project when we must retreat and reflect even more deeply, perhaps to let the extraneous that has collected around our core fall away or at least take stock of what has gathered over time. When I've done this fully it's taken me much deeper into life, away from anything that could be packaged for any kind of consumption but that I might one day be able to share and be witnessed in. <br><br>The inner work is as important as the outer work, the personal work as important as the community level work. As above so below. One is a reflection of the other, how could it be anything else?<br><br>I've spent a lot of time split, and this looks like another call to integrity. Maybe I'm learning to see through the inner poet's eyes.<br><br><a href=#c2872344144471537328 title="comment permalink">5/19/12, 5:22 AM</a><br><br>

I've been talking to regular people - nowhere near any real protest movement, much less a progressive one. But there's a pervasive sense that people are going to have to lower their material expectations, because the good jobs are not coming back. This bothers me, not because it's wrong, but because it is clearly going to be very convenient to the powers-that-be, and I expect it to be increasingly embraced as a way to keep people's hands off the pitchforks (or their golf-clubs as the case may be). Also, the mindset that is evolving is more feudal serf than green wizard, but then I suppose changing that is a task worthy of the wizardry.

It's as effective as it is because it combines those tools with the central theme of taking personal responsibility for making changes on an individual level -- in my own life, and in the lives of those readers who are willing to do so. I'm not sure why you seem to think that I'm presenting this as an either/or (activism vs. personal change) when what I'm saying is that activism becomes most effective <i>when it is combined with personal change</i>.

It won't keep people's hands off the pitchforks -- if people become convinced that it's going to be poor, the flaunting of conspicuous wealth is going to enrage them; it's the fantasy that we can all make it rich that leads so many people to make excuses for the perks of extreme wealth, since there's always the hope that any one of us might enjoy them someday.

In fact, pretty much any successful religious revival movement I can think of, from Hamas to the Pentacostals, has a hefty dose of applied egalitarianism as part of the praxis.<br><br>Go back a bit further in US history and you strike a rich vein of Pure American Marxism in the form of the Wobblies. I'd be willing to bet that any latter-day Red protest movement that gains traction on the peak oil downslope will pick up some key attitudes, and even a few tactics, from the I.W.W. of the early 20th century. "We Are All Leaders!" and "Kick the Bosses off your Back" is the kind of in-your-face direct action Marxism that appeals when Americans are hungry and transient.<br><br>As a final touch that loops directly back to JMGs thesis of living the change, I am reminded of Scott and Helen Nearing, whose contributions to both Marxist thought and self-sufficient living are near-legendary. Their 1954 "Living the Good Life" is sometimes credited with sparking the back to the land movement that followed. They certainly had their critics, but to my mind did much to live with integrity and clarity.<br><br><a href=#c7414729062624907463 title="comment permalink">5/19/12, 9:49 PM</a><br><br>

I've been saying the same things about the future, often in the same terms (e.g., "the US is going to become a Third World nation"), since this blog started. I've noticed though, that it normally takes a while for any one reader to get it -- "Oh, wait a minute, you mean the US is going to become a <i>Third World nation</i>?

Still, much of the process will likely be driven by a simpler phenomenon -- people who want answers to what's happening to their lives and their communities will hear so much ignorant ranting by Republicans about Marx and socialism and communism and all, that sooner or later some of them will pick up copies of the Communist Manifesto and <i>Capital</i>, and find a coherent system of thought that seems to explain what's going on. I don't think it's a particularly good explanation, but to people who are being impoverished by the idiotic policies of today's pseudoconservatives, it's likely to be a compelling one.<br><br><a href=#c2373056915923398129 title="comment permalink">5/19/12, 10:35 PM</a><br><br>

Most faiths and spiritual paths teach us to find personal happiness and stability in the spiritual realm rather than the material realm, so it is a great anti-dote to the conditioning of the Age of Material Excess which is now ending for most of us in the Western World. The paths I am most familiar with are Buddhism (Tibetan) and Paganism (Druidry) and both of these have been a huge influence and support on a personal and community level in my journey towards a more simple and sustainable way of life. <br><br>It is not a choice of one or the other between spirituality and activism. I have Quaker friends who very much walk their talk in the realms of peaceful protest, I have been involved in small-scale and large-scale magical work in support of various activist causes and I try to bring my spiritual values and practice into the situations I encounter in life. If I put this at the heart of how I live then right thinking and right action come naturally.

BTW, I'm not sure why the first half of your comment didn't come through -- it wasn't in the Blogger queue. <br><br>GHT, the attitude you've expressed here is of course a very common one. It misses nearly every point that's important in our current situation, but that's not uncommon, either. You say "it's never enough," and if by "enough" you mean something that will prevent the end of the industrial age, of course, you're right; nothing you can do at this point will have the least effect on the speed and severity of the decline. That's already baked in. The question is what you're going to do in response. <br><br>Of course you can sit back and enjoy your comfortable lifestyle until it drags you down; a lot of people are doing that. The problem here is that living without all those fossil fueled luxuries takes skills you don't have and preparations you haven't made. The learning curve isn't fast, either. If you get working on it now, you still have the time to learn the skills and make the preparations that will save your life, your sanity, and some of the things you care about as we head further down Hubbert's curve. If you don't, you've just chosen an utterly miserable future. <br><br>Your choices right now also shape events further on in the future, and have effects on other people and living things. If you have skills, you can teach them to others; if you make preparations, your ability to help others goes up dramatically, and so does your ability to get by without placing an additional burden on an already overloaded biosphere. If nothing really matters to you other than your own comfort, of course, that's not going to be any kind of incentive, but I'm going to hope that you don't belong to the pathetic class of individuals for whom that's true. <br><br>What you do now can make the future better for others. Is that "enough"? Well, when you raise a child, what level of love and caring and hard work is "enough"? If you actually care about something, the question is simply what you can do for it, not what counts as "enough." If you don't -- well, then, I pity you. <br><br>Candace, that's certainly possible. I figured that it was going to be controversial, simply because a fair number of my readers feel sympathy for, or are actually affiliated with, protest movements of various kinds.<br><br><a href=#c3976118455937072343 title="comment permalink">5/20/12, 10:51 AM</a><br><br>

The protest movements, or their remnants, go underground. At which point they can only contribute to more unravelling, for there is no way left to 'win' anything meaningful. <br><br>Which is not to say that political action and protest are futile now.

They are willing to take some difficult decisions because they also see benefits. This leads to improvements in infrastructure and knowledge that can only help to bridge the gap between where we are now and where we need to be to survive when the pumps run dry.

I thought it might be a right wing hoax, so i checked Snopes. According to the e-mail, the Bush home uses a fraction of the energy of Gore's, has a cistern for rainwater, a grey water system, and a geothermal heat pump, among other features. Gore's house uses 10-12 times as much energy as the average home in the US, although it is only four times as large as the average for new homes. The arguments posted by some Gore defenders are the most pathetic part--it uses more energy because its bigger, so the comparison is not fair, and it uses energy swaps--so it is green energy, etc. As you say, people have a good eye for hypocrisy and jetting from your mansion to Hollywood to save the planet just pushes the buttons of the average American. <br><br>Many Americans are also strongly suspicious of those they see as elitists who want to stuff the ordinary person into public transit but show no signs of abandoning their own limos. Years ago (late 80s) the head of Bay Area Rapid Transit was asked whether he relied on his own system.

The commercial hair products, the store toothbrush, the pre-packaged breakfast biscuits, the vehicle in like-new mechanical condition less than four years old. Does that make you poor?<br><br>Procure your food from your garden, or by trading effort or cast-offs with friends and neighbors, pick up clothes at the Salvation Army and re-size them and patch them for work clothes -- and keep one "best" set for social wear. Haunt the city dump, and search store dumpsters for furniture, for handy things, for stuff that can be fixed, or cleaned, to trade for food.<br><br>Does that make you poor?<br><br>Maybe -- if you think "poor" means "not enough money to buy the necessities through normal commercial and retail channels:, then I guess it does make you poor. Even if the normal commercial and retail channels become undependable.<br><br>But if you look at it differently, and think that "poor" means not being able to secure shelter, food, and healthy community and family relationships, then you need never be "poor" at all.<br><br>Don't think of the retail opportunities you might miss -- think of the time and freedom you gain to focus on the fundamentals.<br><br>Advertising and merchandising in particular make us believe that 'value' means money. And that our value to our country is what we contribute as taxes, and what we spend in the money economy. The fact is that families and communities thrive on non-cash relationships and exchanges. It will be "enough" when you find yourself thinking, "Well, I guess I should keep some money, in case I find something I actually want to pay for." Until then, gardening and other skills from earlier times are a great way to retreat from the stress of the money economy. Even if you do believe you are building a better future for yourself and those you care for.<br><br><a href=#c2516011665768748091 title="comment permalink">5/21/12, 9:59 PM</a><br><br>

But thankfully most activists I know have the common sense to recognize that the personal is political AND the political is personal. They joined the effort to block Keystone XL and occupied Oakland while raising chickens and growing their own food. Clearly these two responses work best together--like peanut butter and jelly!<br><br>This tired debate diverts attention from what really demands discussion: How do we build an effective grassroots response to collapsing industrialism that is both life affirming and powerful enough to break the death grip of those who would exploit this long emergency at the expense of everyone else on the planet?<br><br>From Deep Green radicals like Lloyd, we get superficial remedies like "direct action, community building, and outreach." OK, but how do we build resilient communities that can weather industrial collapse and support grassroots resistance to corporate power? What types of organizations, strategies and tactics advance our struggle? How do we involve more people in this process at multiple levels of participation? How can we seize the initiative and begin taking advantage of the weaknesses and divisions in the forces arrayed against us? Can we use the coming crises to move people toward a more democratic, equitable, planet-healing future instead of being herded further down the road to austere militaristic authoritarianism?<br><br>JMG’s “personal approach" is also bereft of worthwhile answers to these questions. The historical “lessons” he draws to discount political action are cherry-picked and distorted to fit his predetermined conclusions. JMG says, “the responses Lloyd, Jensen, and other activists are promoting here have been standard across the spectrum of activist groups for more than three decades now, and that’s more than enough time to see how well they work. The answer? Well, let’s be charitable and say not very well.”<br><br>Certainly JMG is aware that there’s more than one way to look at this historical experience. Over the past decades of economic growth, radical movements have had a hard time gaining traction. Growth, for all its depredations, does not provide fertile ground for anti-systemic movements. Thus, it was extremely unlikely that any combination of “standard responses” would have proven successful.<br><br>Later, JMG concedes that political struggles will have a decisive impact on our future. He says, “the twilight years of a disintegrating political system often create a fiercely Darwinian environment for ideologies and political movements, in which the only thing that matters is which set of beliefs and personalities can build the strongest coalition at the right time, absorb or marginalize the largest fraction of opposing groups, and make the most successful bid for power.”<br><br>Yet JMG shrinks from asking: How do Green activists navigate this treacherous political environment to build “the strongest coalition at the right time, absorb or marginalize the largest fraction of opposing groups, and make the most successful bid for power”? Instead, he praises those who learn how “to get by with less, use their own capacities of body and mind, and work with the patterns and processes of nature.”<br><br>What will happen if we offer no resistance those who shred our Constitutional rights, drive our economy off the cliff and ravage the planet? If we forfeit this power struggle to them where will this leave us? Will we toil as serfs on their private estates because we didn’t fight for the land? Will we labor in their debtors’ prisons because we didn’t democratize our economic system? Will tyrants rule over us because we didn’t take power and learn to govern ourselves? Will we suffer an endless series of bloody resource wars because we didn’t dismantle the empire’s military institutions?<br>Learning to work with nature and get by with less is an absolutely necessary but totally insufficient response to war, tyranny, and ecocide.<br><br><a href=#c6887288987114724094 title="comment permalink">5/22/12, 7:53 AM</a><br><br>

You have, I hope, heard of the Civil Rights movement and the entire flurry of social change movements in the 1960s? Those took place during periods of steady economic expansion. So did the Progressive movement at the beginning of the 20th century, and a great many other successful movements for social change.

The scope of your knowledge and sophistication of your analysis are a marvel to me, as are the level of intelligent and engaged commentary you attract and the reliability with which you respond to comments. Very refreshing in the online world where deep and sustained attention is rare.<br><br>I'm a committed transition town member (in the UK) and perhaps a borderline 'bobo', although far from earning a six-figure salary. My consumption levels are modest but I am in the early stages of my personal 'great re-skilling', very far from having the skills and habits I would need to weather major shocks to the system I depend on. But it's worth saying that perhaps the biggest change in my life that has come through being involved in the transition movement, is that the number of people I know on a personal level and could depend on (to some extent) in a crisis, has increased at least tenfold compared to my previous 'consumer bubble'. This means also that the diversity of skills I could access through these networks (providing I can also offer something in exchange or reciprocity) has also multiplied vastly, and even that new (or revived) sets of skills and collective capabilities are emerging through links across the network. So no-one has to learn everything on their own.<br><br>The question I wanted to raise was this:<br><br>What is your take on the use of information technology as an instance of unjust privilege and unsustainable energy-dependency?<br><br>It might sound as if I'm pointing the finger (suggesting that because you've got a blog and spend a lot of time on it, you too are a hypocritical over-consumer). But that's not the intention. I am mostly thinking about myself (and others I know) and the fact that we spend a lot of time online and are only dimly aware of the amount of energy we are using in this way, and the material wastage from extracting minerals for IT equipment, etc.<br><br>I have so far chosen to involve myself fairly heavily in online communities - while at the same time, learning and planning to wean myself off most other types of resource-intensive activity (by cycling, food growing, working locally, salvaging for re-use, etc). I feel that losing contact with the accessibility of information and the richness of knowledge and perspectives that can be accessed online, would be a retrograde step.<br><br>But, sometimes I wonder if I am actually pursuing a chimera, thinking that I can learn what I need to learn by 'accessing information', when the real learning will only come through engagement with the real world.<br><br>What do you think? How to strike a balance between information consumption and real-life knowledge creation? Or should the latter take precedence? You clearly don't exclude the former, but what principles do you apply to keep your use of IT moderate and focused on what is really valuable for yourself and others?<br><br>I am asking this not only for myself but also because I've become involved in a 'community hub' project (a partnership between a park/greenhouses, re-use centre, theatre and library within an urban neighbourhood). The friends of the library are drafting their vision for its future, and see it becoming a 'digital hub'. I have a hunch this emphasis is unwise, given digital's dependence on energy. But am not sure how best to make the argument, and what to propose instead. Any thoughts?<br><br><a href=#c3628280324870701234 title="comment permalink">5/22/12, 2:34 PM</a><br><br>

I've written extensively elsewhere on what activists might do in response to the current situation -- <a href="http://drivingsocrates.com/?p=267" rel=nofollow>here</a> is one example. As for the bobo shortage among the activists you know, that's really good to hear; I've heard from plenty of other people who don't share your experience.<br><br>Guilherme, the notion that a fast collapse would be a good thing is fairly common. I've critiqued it at some length elsewhere; the short form is that it's fairly easy to recover from a sudden collapse, and to rebuild a fair approximation of our current society -- which is not exactly a useful thing in terms of the values Dmitry is discussing. (I know that he rejects out of hand the idea that such a rebuilding can take place; it's one of the ways in which I think his predictions miss the mark.) <br><br>More generally, though, I think we're well past the point at which any politically possible action can delay the crisis of imperial America. So it's really a moot point; it's in the stabilizing and rebuilding phase after the crisis hits that green activism is likely to have the most effect.

So yeah, I don't think it matters much what the bobos do, or what any of us does at this point, as far as the changes ahead; I'm feeling like it's more a case of "adapt or die" than "Save the World". <br><br>The world -- as we have known it, that is -- can't and shouldn't be saved; things can't go on as they were/are. Yet the momentum and inertia of the juggernaut is too enormous for any emergency stop to come in time to avert major disruption. Too bad in a way, but there it is; though there is much to critique in D Jensen, he was right on when he called it (western technocratic capitalism) a Culture of Make-Believe: the crash that's coming is partly class conflict, partly national/race conflict, partly based in ancient highly-gendered notions of patriarchal domination (over nature, women, etc), all of the above -- but more intractably it's a widening chasm between fantasy and reality, between a culture of imagination, entertainment and wishful thinking and some basic physical limits. Pigs won't fly, and yet our entire culture is a flying-pig competition.<br><br>I'm discovering (through the school of experience) that gardening in a short-season climate is more than a tad challenging :-) Like most amateur/wannabe food producers, I discover daily that it's harder than it looks. Slowly, with many discouraging moments, I'm finding out which cultivars seem to like it in my micro-biome and which don't thrive; fortunately, taters seem to be very happy as do most Asian greens. I figure in a pinch, people can survive on taters, greens, and goat milk (plus eggs and some fruit). Hoping it doesn't come to that in my lifetime, but if it does I'd like to think I can enjoy my taters and greens without pining too much for things like restaurants, Chinese take-out, French bakeries, and the other lovely frivolity that forms a thin but shiny veneer over the disaster of our times. <br><br>I keep telling myself that stopping the disaster is the most important thing, the best thing that could happen -- I should celebrate the end of the insanity; but in all honesty I have to admit I'll miss the French pastries. The upside I guess is that I'm appreciating the heck out of every convenience and luxury while we still have it. Chocolate, diesel fuel, grapefruit and internet access are currently at the top of my "thank goodness I don't have to give this up yet" list. Oh yeah, and digital photography.<br><br><a href=#c2246361039231873900 title="comment permalink">5/22/12, 5:05 PM</a><br><br>

Or why do you think it is still possible, even in theory, to develop some "over-all" strategy for using "the coming crises to move people toward a more democratic, equitable, planet-healing future"?<br><br>I don't think that some comprehensive plan can or should be developed. And I'm not saying that the government or economic elites will be part of building any useful response to catabolic collapse.<br><br>But I do think is is feasible for a grassroots resistance movement to eventually congeal around the need for: 1) dismantling militarism &amp; empire; 2) economic security &amp; social justice; and 3) harmonizing and healing our relationship with the planet.<br><br>These 3 movements already exist in embryonic form in America and around the world. Their most coherent expression at this point are the global social forums that began at the turn of the century in Puerto Allegre, Brazil. These emerging resistance movements will have more staying power and deeper roots if they become integrated into widespread, but locally based, efforts to build resilient communities (like Transition Towns) that prepare themselves to take up the vital functions of survival &amp; security as the institutional edifice of industrial capitalism crumbles.<br><br>The whole process may really gain traction if a new cultural narrative takes shape through music, drama, dance, art, etc. that celebrates and honors the spirit of human solidarity and planetary renewal and rejects consumerism, nationalism, and all the other "isms" that keep us divided and unable to defend our long range interests as a species.<br><br>I also think it is possible to develop a much more sophisticated approach to waging this protracted power struggle. One that maximizes our advantages, anticipates crises and formulates useful responses, and outmaneuvers and outwits efforts to crush us.

Any time I hear language about how various activist groups want to, for example "move people toward a more democratic, equitable, planet-healing future", it always carries a whiff of the GULAG to me. The fundamental mistake lies in the activist thinking that because they are publicly, actively, and outwardly focus on this future vision, they have any business "moving people" in any direction whatsoever. This smack of an ideological struggle to impose a particular worldview on the globe. There are probably as many legitimate responses to the evils of industrial society as there are people. Some of those responses may be democratic and rationalistic, some might be patriarchal and religious. Making the whole world into a homogenous system will result in evil and suffering regardless of any laudable stated ends.<br><br><a href=#c6510291105539401902 title="comment permalink">5/23/12, 7:46 AM</a><br><br>

My guess is that Ntropee doesn't mean -- or at least doesn't think he means -- forcing people to follow the revolutionary vanguard toward the glorious new green future. Whether that's what it would work out to in the end is another matter. <br><br>Bruce, that's certainly one cure for binary thinking. I find it also works to do the old Druid Revival exercises in ternary thinking -- for example, every day, when you read the morning paper (or news websites, these days), note ten binaries being shoved at you by the media and find a third alternative to each one. <br><br>Macsporan, I think it's all but certain that some such project will be attempted, though whether it gets put into place will depend on any number of factors. The French and Russian revolutions started out with grand talk of human rights and ended with guillotines and gulags respectively, and a green revolution could just as easily go down the same path. <br><br>Chris, well put. I think sometimes the best place to start is to stop -- set aside all the demands for action, just for a little while, and take the time you need to figure out what actually matters. That will field a storm of condemnation from all sides, of course, because all sides have much to gain from keeping people rushed and not thinking. <br><br>Lament, I tend to think rather that the core mistake of most activism is the assumption that having the right goals is a protection against using the wrong means. History shows otherwise with bitter consistency; it also shows that a movement can start out with the highest ideals imaginable, and descend step by step into inhuman brutality, by the simple process of treating its goals as more important than the moral status of the means it uses to get there.<br><br><a href=#c3699979249412363266 title="comment permalink">5/23/12, 8:14 AM</a><br><br>

It's not all "bread &amp; roses." But it is important not to throw the baby out with the bath wash. Can demagogues lead these movements astray? They can and they have. Movements must work tirelessly to evolve sound democratic principles and practices that limit and counteract infiltration, co-optation, demagoguery and the tendency toward intolerance and extremism that can be so destructive to their goals and values and make people fearful of involvement.<br><br>In the end, societies must have some form of governance.

They need that knowledge so they don't repeat the same mistakes.<br><br>What we can do as a society, rather than continue the momentum of movements (also teaching the younger generation to adopt opposition to achieve anything) is build rituals in our daily lives, to help remember the important stuff.<br><br>In Australia we have ANZAC day to remember the fallen soldiers in Gallipoli. This is given a national public holiday and every school does something ceremonial (as a collective) to remember the price of freedom. My mother, myself and my own daughter were part of Anzac day ceremonies at school. We have a saying that goes along with it - "Lest we forget", and let's hope we don't!<br><br>What we aren't remembering is the spirit of that day, every other day. And we raise the younger generation against a backdrop of hopelessness, with an endless monologue of destruction which gets harder for them to carry (let alone perceive) every day. To which I can understand the reasoning behind JMG questioning the way we operate as collectives, and what do we truly understand from that process?<br><br>As a woman, I benefited (but also lost some things) with the emergence of feminism. I teach my own daughter about the values which were beneficial, but I don't repeat the same dogma that actually hurt how guys were perceived by society, in order for the change to happen.<br><br>Nothing is more distasteful than reading degrading comments about guys intelligence, to sum them up as a sexual deviant - rather than a valuable participant in society, who like all of us, crave intimacy. How many generations of women were subjected to similar dogma without deserving it in the past? <br><br>I would hope my daughter's generation will take those freedoms as given, and practice every day the value of them, rather than repeat a dogma which forgets women (and men) have attained their freedom by now. <br><br>I do agree we have the nature to forget, but how we remember also determines how we ultimately treat the world every day. To which I say I agree with some of your concerns, I just feel we need an approach which deals with individuals fully.<br><br>Otherwise we do let future generations down just as equally as having turned a blind eye.Because we taught them how to confront opposition for good causes, but we didn't teach them to practice love and value that, as just as honourable - if not more so.<br><br><a href=#c936444998058225837 title="comment permalink">5/23/12, 11:16 PM</a><br><br>

What I wrote about is simply the fact that, objectively, your knowledge about what Marx's ideas are and what they're not is very limited. No, he did not consider natural resources to be valueless and no, he did not subscribe to the paradigm of perpetual growth. Only someone who doesn't know even the most basic features of Marx's worldview can believe that he accepted those ideas.<br><br>But, as I wrote in the original comment, I don't blame anyone for being ignorant about Marx, especially not in the US. The cultural fog left by Cold War propaganda must be so thick that it would take much more than just intelligence to see through it.<br><br><a href=#c9146379063853525311 title="comment permalink">6/4/12, 1:52 PM</a><br><br>

But I would submit that it is important to remember that Marx &amp; Engels aren't responsible for everything done in their name. The process of social change itself always modifies the ambitions, policies, goals, and programs under which social change proceeds.<br><br>In Engels words: <br>“…numerous desired ends cross and conflict with one another, or these ends are from the outset incapable of realization, or the means of attaining them are insufficient. Thus the conflict of innumerable individual wills and individual actions in the domain of history produces a state of affairs entirely analogous to that in the realm of unconscious nature…The many individual wills active in history, for the most part, produce results quite other than those they intended--often quite the opposite.”<br> <br>Nowhere is the verification of Engels’ powerful insight more obvious than in the outcome of the political movement he and Marx founded. Over a century-and-a-half later, the citadels of world capitalism remain untouched by their "international proletarian revolution."<br><br>Yet ironically, while their communist vision has not materialized, Marx’s program was warped to fit the interests of the soviet state and the East European regimes under its sway. This led to some bizarre distortions of his ideas. For example, in Poland, working class leaders were jailed and their Solidarity movement crushed in Marx’s name; after all, how could workers possibly go on strike or rise up against their own state? Meanwhile, in capitalism’s underdeveloped periphery, rural, peasant-based nationalist movements organized themselves under the banner of the international proletarian revolution.<br><br>Marx and Engels’ communist ideology has indeed produced “results quite other than they intended--often quite the opposite.” <br><br>However, some of the powerful insights provided by Marx’s materialist method of analysis provide excellent starting points for uncovering and explaining the historical limitations, conceptual flaws, and political distortions of his own theoretical conclusions.<br><br>For example, take their notion that the technologies employed by any society have a profound impact on the social and class relations needed to operate them. “Social relations are closely bound up with productive forces,” wrote Marx in THE POVERTY of PHILOSOPHY. “In acquiring new productive forces men change their mode of production…the hand mill gives you a society with the feudal lord; the steam mill, society with the industrial capitalist.” This insight can be very helpful in explaining why the policy of rapid industrialization pursued after the Russian and Chinese revolutions could not possibly yield broad-based, democratic, working class control over the economic system. Large scale industrial societies foster and require centralized modes of control--like corporations and central committees--not participatory democracy.<br><br><a href=#c1362202294166291583 title="comment permalink">6/4/12, 2:38 PM</a><br><br>

(I checked his books out from a variety of libraries, thus don't have them to hand to cite examples.) I may just revisit him as time permits, and post a more detailed discussion one of these days. <br><br>Ntropee, whether Marx and Engels are "responsible" for what consistently happens when people try to build societies based on their ideas is hardly the point, and if you want to talk about the value of a critical understanding of Marx' ideas as an essential part of an education in political economy, I'm not arguing at all. My point, again, is that when people do try to build societies based on a Marxist blueprint, those societies reliably turn into bleak bureaucratic dictatorships. It wasn't just the Soviet state and its European buffer zone; China, Cambodia, and a baker's dozen of Third World Marxist states did exactly the same thing. That's not a trivialization of Marx, merely a recognition that one narrow section of his and Engels' work -- the part that tried to sketch out what a postcapitalist world would look like, and how it might arrive -- contains lethal flaws that, combined with the prosaic realities of human nature, foster tyranny. Could those flaws be fixed? Probably, but I have yet to see a convincing job of it.<br><br><a href=#c8627011068697501810 title="comment permalink">6/4/12, 6:13 PM</a><br><br>

The root of the problem is that what Marx means by "value" is different from what the common usage of that word implies (including its usage in Economics textbooks). In the usual meaning, the word value refers to a relationship between a person, acting as an 'evaluator' and some thing or process to which value is ascribed. In this sense it would be quite ridiculous to say that natural resources have no value. But this is not at all what Marx means. In his terms, the notion of value refers to the fact that, in a market economy, the mutual interdependence between the members of society is mediated through the exchange of the products of their labor, and that that interdependency can only be expressed as an exchange "value" of their respective products. Something or some process has value to the extent that it contains socially useful human labor. Labor is then the essence of economic value, and time is its measure. In this sense value is only the <i>form of appearance of a social relation between people</i>. Natural resources cannot, by definition, have this kind of value (under certain circumstances they can have a price, however); that does not, in any way, mean that Marx thought that natural resources are not economically important, only that he thought that "those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails", in very real terms, do treat Nature as a pool of free inputs to be plundered. That, as he pointed out repeatedly, is one of the most irrational aspects of a profoundly irrational system.<br><br><a href=#c8001626294375162337 title="comment permalink">6/5/12, 7:56 AM</a><br><br>
