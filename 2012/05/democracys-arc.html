The troubling news about methane releases from the Arctic ocean that was the focus of last week’s post on <i>The Archdruid Report </i>belongs, as I mentioned then, to the wider trajectory of industrial society’s decline and fall, not to the more specific theme I’ve been developing here in recent months. The end of America’s global empire takes place against the background of that wider trajectory, to be sure, and core elements of the predicament of industrial civilization bid fair to play a crucial role as the United States backs itself into a corner defined by its own history. Still, important as the limits to growth are just now, there’s much more at work in the endgame of American empire. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus this week’s post will plunge without further ado from the austere heights of atmospheric chemistry to the steaming, swampy, snake-infested realities of American politics. It’s a jarring shift in more ways than one, since everybody basically agrees on what methane is, what the atmosphere is, and so on; the terms that frame debates about the greenhouse effect and anthropogenic global warming are clearly defined and bear some relationship to observable fact. We don’t have that advantage in  politics. In particular, the possibility of an intelligent conversation about American politics is hamstrung by the spectacular distortions imposed on basic terms by nearly everybody involved. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The worst example, and the one I propose to explore this week, is democracy. It’s hard to think of a word that’s bandied about more freely, but I keep on waiting for Inigo Montoya from <i>The Princess Bride</i> to stand up and say his classic line: “You keep on using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On both ends of American politics, for example, democracy is for all practical purposes defined as a political system in which a majority of voters will support whatever group happens to be using the word at that moment. That definition can be seen at work most clearly in the shrill insistence, common these days over much of the political spectrum, that the United States isn’t a democracy; after all, the argument runs, if the United States was a democracy, the people would vote in favor of their own best interests, which of course just happen to be identical with the platform of whoever’s talking. The fact that this claim can be heard from groups whose ideas of the people’s best interests differ in every conceivable way—for example, the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street—simply adds to the irony. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Behind the rhetoric is a conception of democracy that has nothing in common with the real world, and everything in common with the Utopian fantasies that have come to infest contemporary political discourse. When Americans talk about democracy or, with even richer irony, “real democracy,” they usually mean a system that does not exist, has never existed, and can never exist—a system less real than Neverland, in which the free choices of millions of individual voters somehow always add up to an optimal response to the challenges of a complex age, without ever running afoul of the troubles that inevitably beset democratic systems in the real world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here’s an example.  Nearly all those who insist that the United States is not a democracy cite, as evidence for that claim, the fact that our elections are usually corrupt and sometimes fraudulent. Now of course this is quite true; the winner in an American election is generally, though not always, the candidate that has the most money to spend; the broader influence of wealth over America’s media and political parties is pervasive; and election fraud is as much a part of American culture as baseball and apple pie—the Democrats who waxed indignant about the rigged election returns from Florida in 2000, for example, by and large seem to have gone out of their way to forget about the voting machines at the bottom of Lake Michigan that put John F. Kennedy in the White House in 1960. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Does this prove that the United States isn’t a “real democracy”? Not at all. This is how democracies actually function in the real world. Under a system of representative democracy, the people who have wealth and the people who have power are by no means always the same; some of those who have wealth want power, some of those who have power want wealth, and the law of supply and demand takes it from there. That extends all the way down to the individual voter, by the way. Give citizens the right to dispose of their votes freely, and a significant number of them will use that freedom to put their votes up for sale—directly, as in old-fashioned machine politics, or indirectly, by voting for candidates who provide them with goodies at the public expense. There’s no way to prevent that without depriving citizens of the right to vote as they choose, and you can’t eliminate that and still have a democracy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By this point I suspect some of my readers may be wondering if I’m opposed to democracy. Quite the contrary, I’m very much in favor of it; despite its problems, it beats the stuffing out of most systems of government. It has three benefits in particular that you don’t usually get in other forms of government. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
First, democracies tolerate much broader freedom of speech and conscience than countries ruled by other systems. I can critique the personalities, policies, and (as here) fundamental concepts of American government without having to worry that this will bring jackbooted thugs crashing through my door at three in the morning; in nondemocratic countries, critics of the government in power rarely have that security. Equally, I can practice the religion I choose, read the books I prefer, carry on conversations with people in other democratic countries around the world, and exercise a great many other freedoms that people in nondemocratic countries simply don’t have. These things matter; people have fought and died for them, and a system that makes room for them is far and away preferable to one that doesn’t. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Second, democracies don’t kill anything like as many of their own citizens as most other forms of government do.  The history of the twentieth century, if nothing else, should have been enough of a reminder that authoritarian governments come with a very high domestic body count. All governments everywhere kill plenty of people whenever they go to war, and all governments everywhere go to war when they think they can get away with it; imperial democracies also tend to build up very large prison populations—the United States  has more people in prison than any other nation on Earth, just as Britain in its age of empire shipped so many convicts to Australia that they played a sizable role in the settling of that continent.  Still, all other things being equal, it’s better to live in a nation where the government doesn’t dump large numbers of its own citizens into mass graves, and democracies do that far less often, and to far fewer people, than nondemocratic governments generally do. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finally, democracies undergo systemic change with less disruption and violence than nondemocratic countries do. Whether we’re talking about removing a failed head of state, coping with an economic depression, dealing with military defeat, or winning or losing an empire, democracies routinely manage to surf the wave of change without the sort of collapse such changes very often bring to nondemocratic countries. The rotation of leadership hardwired into the constitutions of most successful democracies builds a certain amount of change into the system, if only because different politicians have different pet agendas, and pressure from outside the political class—if it’s strong, sustained, and intelligently directed—very often does have an impact: not quickly, not easily, and not without a great deal of bellowing and handwaving, but the thing does happen eventually. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All three of these benefits, and a number of others of the same kind, can be summed up in a single sentence: democracy is resilient. Authoritarian societies, by contrast, are brittle; that’s why they can’t tolerate freedom of speech and conscience, why they so often murder their citizens in large numbers, and why they tend to shatter when they are driven to change by the pressure of events. Democratic societies can also be brittle, especially if they’re newly established, or if a substantial fraction of their citizens rejects the values of democracy; still, all other things being equal, a democratic society normally weathers systemic change with less trauma than an authoritarian one. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One measure of this greater resilience, ironically enough, may be seen in the lack of success radical groups generally have when they try to delegitimize and overturn an established democratic society.  Rhetoric that would bring a brutal response from authoritarian governments get little more than a yawn from democratic ones. A few years back, the phrase “repressive tolerance” was the term for this on the American far left. I doubt those who denounced it under this label would have preferred to be dragged from their beds in the middle of the night, shot through the head, and tumbled into an unmarked grave; the rest of us, certainly, have good reason to be thankful that that’s not the way America generally deals with its dissidents. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That aside, there’s equally good reason to want a system in place just now that can handle systemic change with the smallest possible amount of trauma and violence, because we’re headed for a great deal of systemic change in the years and decades ahead. Part of that is due to the wider trajectory of industrial society I referenced toward the beginning of this essay, part of it is due to the ongoing decline of America’s global empire, but a good deal of it comes from a different source</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Greeks, who had a penchant for giving names to things, had a convenient label for that source: anacyclosis. That was the moniker coined by the Greek historian Polybius, who chronicled the conquest of Greece by the Romans in the second century BCE. He noted that the squabbling city-states of the Greek world tended to cycle through a distinctive sequence of governments—monarchy, followed by aristocracy, followed by democracy, and then back around again to monarchy.  It’s a cogent model, especially if you replace “monarchy” with “dictatorship” and “aristocracy” with “junta” to bring the terminology up to current standards. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A short and modernized form of the explanation—those of my readers who are interested in the original form should consult the <i>Histories</i> of Polybius—is that in every dictatorship, an inner circle of officials and generals emerges.  This inner circle eventually takes advantage of weakness at the top to depose the dictator or, more often, simply waits until he dies and then distributes power so that no one figure has total control; thus a junta is formed. In every country run by a junta, in turn, a wider circle of officials, officers, and influential people emerges; this wider circle eventually takes advantage of weakness at the top to depose the junta, and when this happens, in ancient Greece and the modern world alike, the standard gambit is to install a democratic constitution to win popular support and outflank remaining allies of the deposed junta. In every democracy, finally, competing circles of officials, officers, and influential people emerge; these expand their power until the democratic system freezes into gridlock under the pressure of factionalism or unsolved crisis; the democratic system loses its legitimacy, political collapse follows, and finally the head of the strongest faction seizes power and imposes a dictatorship, and the cycle begins all over again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It can be educational to measure this sequence against recent history and see how well it fits. Russia, for example, has been through a classic round of anacyclosis since the 1917 revolution: dictatorship under Lenin and Stalin, a junta from Khrushchev through Gorbachev, and a democracy—a real democracy, please remember, complete with corruption, rigged elections, and the other features of real democracy—since that time. China, similarly, had a period of democracy from 1911 to 1949, a dictatorship under Mao, and a junta since then, with movements toward democracy evident over the last few decades. Still, the example I have in mind is the United States of America, which has been around the cycle three times since its founding; the one difference, and it’s crucial, is that all three stages have taken place repeatedly under the same constitution. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A case could be made that this is the great achievement of modern representative democracy—the development of a system so resilient that it can weather anacyclosis without cracking. The three rounds of anacyclosis we’ve had in the United States so far have each followed the classic pattern; they’ve begun under the dominance of a single leader whose overwhelming support from the political class and the population as a whole allowed him to shatter the factional stalemate of the previous phase and impose a radically new order on the nation. After his death, power passes to what amounts to an elected junta, and gradually defuses outwards in the usual way, until a popular movement to expand civil rights and political participation overturns the authority of the junta. Out of the expansion of political participation, factions rise to power, and eventually bring the mechanism of government to a standstill; crisis follows, and is resolved by the election of another almost-dictator. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Glance back over American history and it’s hard to miss the pattern, repeating over a period that runs roughly seventy to eighty years.  The dictator-figures were George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Roosevelt, each of whom overturned existing structures in order to consolidate their power, and did so with scant regard for existing law. The juntas were the old Whigs, the Republicans, and the New Deal Democrats, each of them representatives of a single social class; they were overthrown in turn by Jacksonian populism, the Progressive movement, and the complex social convulsions of the Sixties, each of which diffused power across a broader section of the citizenry. The first cycle ended in stalemate over the issue of slavery; the second ended in a comparable stalemate over finding an effective response to the Great Depression; the third—well, that’s where we are right now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s no shortage of crises sufficient to tip the current system into its final stalemate, and no shortage of people in the political class who show every sign of being willing to give it that final push. The great difficulty just now, it seems to me, is precisely that fashionable contempt for democracy as it actually exists that I addressed earlier in this essay.  In 1860, that habit was so far from finding a place in the political dialogue that the constitution of the Confederate States of America was in most respects a copy of the one signed at Philadelphia a long lifetime before. In 1932, though a minority of Americans supported Marxism, fascism, or one of the other popular authoritarianisms of the day, the vast majority who put Roosevelt into the White House four times in a row expected him to maintain at least a rough approximation of constitutional government. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s much less true this time around.  Granted, there’s less public support for overtly authoritarian ideologies—I expect to see Marxism make a large-scale comeback on the American left in the next few years, for reasons I’ll explain in a future post—but as Oswald Spengler pointed out almost a century ago, in the endgame of democratic societies, it’s not the cult of ideology but the cult of personality that’s the real danger. As the Russian proverb warns, it’s never a good idea to let the perfect become the enemy of the good; in our time, as a growing number of Americans insist that America isn’t a democracy because it doesn’t live up to their fantasies of political entitlement, it’s all too possible that one or more mass movements could coalesce around some charismatic figure who offers to fix everything that’s wrong with the country if only we let him get rid of all those cumbersome checks and balances that stand in his way.  How many of the benefits of democracy I listed above would survive the victory of such a movement is not a question I would like to contemplate. </div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Roberto Vacca’s<i> The Coming Dark Age</i> got plenty of favorable reviews when it saw print in Italian in 1972, and English and other languages in 1973. As apocalypses go, Vacca’s was as lively as it was up to date. He argued that the industrial societies of his time had reached so high a level of complexity and interconnectedness that they were riding for a very hard fall; all those linkages and complexities meant that cascading crises that would bring one system crashing down after another, leaving the people of the industrial world struggling for survival without transport, power, food, or water, had become a statistical inevitability and would begin by 1985. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Except, of course, that it didn’t. Ironically, Vacca, a computer scientist, missed the fact that the complexity whose risks he described wasn’t an independent variable; it was being driven by the rise of exactly the computer technology that was making high complexity manageable, and would make it even more manageable in the decades ahead. Despite the failed prediction, or possibly because of it, <i>The Coming Dark Age</i>
marked the coming of age of a flurry of apocalyptic prophecies that relied, as Vacca’s did, on the questionable claim that extreme worst case scenarios sooner or later have to come true. We’ll discuss another of these next week. </div>

Because of the primacy of the Commons (despite what Winston Churchill said) whenever a Government with an absolute majority is elected an authoritarion regime is formed for a limited period of time. It depends on whether the leader is a strong figure or not whether it begins as a dictatorship or a junta. You could argue that Margaret Thatcher's government was junta-fied by John Major, similarly Tony Blair to Gordon Brown. Okay, it's not an exact analogy, but it's interesting to note the anxiety caused by minority or coalition governments, because the model of monarchy has seeped into the workings of democracy - someone has to be in absolute powers, or the Brits get nervous (to generalise outrageously!)<br><br><a href=#c2621516334364952169 title="comment permalink">5/3/12, 3:37 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not so sure that such an accumulation has not already started with some of the more obscene executive orders that have come into being (most recently the National Defense Resource Preparedness Act). What is different, however, is what you mention as a common hostility to democracy - or the general indifference to it - which would allow those vying for power to take charge without needing to provide the pretense of "keeping the classical antiquity ideal of the republic alive", as was apparently required of Augustus. If I were to place money on the thing, I, too, would lean towards the rise of an autocratic leader.

One of the benefits of democracy is that it tends to be a more efficient way to maintain social order. One of the main reasons the Soviet Union “fell,” I believe, is that Gorbachev and his circle realized they did not have the resources necessary to maintain their police state, which is a very costly endeavor with it's spies and gulags. He literally said he would no longer play the games with the West that his predecessors had and embarked on an evolutionary program to mimic our more efficient democratic principles for maintaining social order. He realized it is far more efficient to promote a democratic system where the populous is convinced it has choices through thaumaturgy and becomes essentially self policing.

I see it all the time on the left, as I live and work near an enclave of wealthy liberal types, many of whom are still in a hangover from the 60s. I went through a personal phase of lamenting the inequities of our democracy, but I stopped being so critical of it when thinking about a conversation I had with my right-wing brother-in-law.<br><br>He worked during college at a union cereal mill in Battle Creek, and he told many stories about workers sleeping on the job, shifts that were overstaffed, and how the high wages kept the workers in all the beer that they could drink after a shift was over (and sometimes during it). Comparing his stories to the corruption in politics and business that resulted in corporate jets and yachts, sweatshop labor conditions, widespread poverty and massive inequality, I couldn't escape the conclusion that corruption is simply a part of human enterprises. The real work we have in navigating the myriad of choices in politics and other aspects of public life is choosing the character of our preferred corruption. <br><br>Since that time I've been a volunteer election judge at every election. I have plenty of friends who are activists and political move-n-shakers, but I am happy to play the role of counting the ballots and making sure that those who bother to show up can have their vote registered. I also feel pretty grounded in my politics, thinking about why I vote for one scoundrel over another doesn't get me wrapped up in righteous indignation or a set of partisan ideology.<br><br>--<br><br>As for the three sets of anacyclosis in American political history, this post is well-timed for me. I'm about halfway through Gore Vidal's American Chronicle series of novels, and I had been coming to a similar conclusion about our history. The cast of characters seems pretty consistent throughout, though the names, parties, crises, and national mood changes. Thinking about all of the upheaval in our society over the past 236 years, it's striking that though the balance of power passes to different constituencies again and again, the underlying foundations of law and governance are pretty much the same.

What you say about Abraham Lincoln riding roughshod over previous law and tradition in order to institute a new exegesis is quite true. Prior to the American War Between the States ("Civil War" is <i>such</i> a misnomer), what we now call "The United States of America" was called <i>"These</i> United States of America" because the Union really was a federation of politically sovereign entities. Neo-Confederates who say that the right to secede was implicit in the original political arrangement of 1789 aren't just "whistling Dixie", so to speak. (Sorry, I couldn't resist.) Abraham Lincoln realized that if America was to be a succesful rising industrial power, we needed to become a more unitary state. However, the union remained so territorially large that many of the mundane responsibilties of legislation, governance, and law enforcement remained the responsibility of state governments.<br><br><a href=#c8243956781736393200 title="comment permalink">5/3/12, 8:34 AM</a><br><br>

Specifically, the portrayal of professional wrestling, in particular the competition and rivalries between participants, as being genuine or not of a worked nature. Referring to events or interviews as being a "chore" means that the event/interview has been "kayfabed" or staged, or is part of a wrestling angle while being passed off as legitimate. Kayfabe has also evolved to become a code word of sorts for maintaining this "reality" within the realm of the general public.<br><br>Kayfabe is often seen as the suspension of disbelief that is used to create the non-wrestling aspects of promotions, such as feuds, angles, and gimmicks, in a similar manner with other forms of entertainment such as soap opera or film. In relative terms, a wrestler breaking kayfabe during a show would be likened to an actor breaking character on camera. Also, since wrestling is performed in front of a live audience, whose interaction with the show is crucial to the show's success (see pop), one might compare kayfabe to the fourth wall, since there is hardly any conventional fourth wall to begin with.<br><br>"Kabuki theater" is the American pundit's term for our this sort of thing. I've been known to call particularly egregious examples "bukkake theater." Slate <a href=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_good_word/2010/04/its_time_to_retire_kabuki.single.html#pagebreak_anchor_2 rel=nofollow>suggests a better term</a>, "Grand-Guignol, which Wikipedia aptly defines as "graphic, amoral horror entertainment." <br><br>That's a good second choice but I want to stick with kayfabe. <br><br>The primary difference between the totalitarian dictatorships and the democracies is that the totalitarians fear open criticism and the autocrats of democracy realize it doesn't matter. Carlin's brilliant "American Dream" rant would have been worth a bullet in the head or an extended stay in Club Gulag in the USSR but in the US of A nobody bothers because it doesn't matter.

Thanks for this revisit and update of the idea, it's quite interesting. I want to propose a tweak to the model to make it more universally applicable:<br><br><i>Legitimacy</i> is the underlying "master resource" that sustains any political system, just as living organisms and natural forces are driven by energy.<br><br>Another key feature is a spectrum of power distribution, ranging from concentrated (e.g. dictatorship) to diffuse (e.g. democracy). "Concentrated" could also be called "monopolized" and "diffuse" could be called "fragmented", but I'd rather stick to the most neutral terms possible.<br><br>Legitimacy is subject to a comparable law of entropy as energy is - the political system's legitimacy constantly deteriorates. The entropy leads the political system to develop away from its last maximum state of power distribution and towards the other end - i.e. a concentrated system develops towards increasing diffusion (dictatorship &gt; junta &gt; democracy) and a diffuse system develops towards increasing concentration (democracy &gt; corrupt party politics &gt; dictatorship).<br><br>Although the distribution is a spectrum, change is not necessarily gradual all the time. The political system will usually have a degree of resistance to change which will cause tension to build up until change is brought by abrubt political events (e.g. rebellions, coups, assassinations, scandals), comparable to earthquakes (large or small) in nature.<br><br>Finally, the rate of entropy is highly variable between times, place, culture, and also which way the system is developing. Cultural values can be biased towards either extreme of power distribution, causing a higher rate of entropy when the system is going toward the culturally favored state. For example, I would say Russians highly favor concentrated power, while my own Icelandic culture tends towards diffuse power.<br><br>So what's the point of this model? I believe it's a more universally applicable elaboration of anacyclosis. The Greek idea reminds me of the well-known Chinese cyclical view of dynastic history, in which the Mandate of Heaven (legitimacy) is gained by a new imperial dynasty which unifies all of China (peak power concentration), then gradually loses it (entropy), leading to corruption, barbarian invasions and natural disasters. Power diffusion in this context is towards increasing power of regional warlords or officials. Eventually, either through war between regional states, or through a successful popular rebellion against the degenerate dynasty, a new dynasty is founded and China returns to concentrated power.<br><br><a href=#c8514101384534477381 title="comment permalink">5/3/12, 9:02 AM</a><br><br>

Quite a trick, if that is what has happened. The question seems to have been put, with some success; "Who needs government if there are market forces that respond to consumer choice?" It is then possible to portray 'government', and the messy compromise of executive choices made by elected governments, as having usurped freedom in society, i.e. the freedom of owners, business (“the freedom of managers to manage”) and consumers. It is actually possible to pull off the trick of simultaneously personifying 'strong government' and being 'against government'. Margaret Thatcher here in Britain managed that trick many times and outflanked powerful forces both within her own government and in the civil service and justice system, and in the educational establishment, including academic economists, and, indeed, in industry. I should add that she was able to, and did, remove whole industries, though sometimes I guess somewhat inadvertently. Britain was the first major country to follow Pinochet’s Chile down that experimental 'privatisation' road advocated by the hitherto ‘wacky’ Chicago school of ‘neoliberal’ economics.<br><br><a href=#c9169054275187553722 title="comment permalink">5/3/12, 2:44 PM</a><br><br>

It's a tendency rather than a strict deterministic pattern. <br><br>Joel, Candide's Law -- if all else fails, you can always tend your garden -- is a good rule to keep in mind! (We're already eating radishes and turnip greens, and had a nice round of asparagus; the kale, snow peas, and early lettuce aren't that far behind.)<br><br>Phil, that's also a possibility. <br><br>Christophe, excellent. You're most welcome. <br><br>Ladydog, exactly. It's fashionable to imagine sudden change as soon as possible, but history moves at its own pace. <br><br>Cherokee, the "super PACs" simply bring out into the open what's been going on all along. As for the 1929 crash, we had that in 2008; what's going on now is identical to the failed attempts of the Hoover administration to keep things patched together -- the same policies, in fact. We're waiting at this point for our Credit Anstalt moment. <br><br>Paul, fascinating. I haven't studied British politics much, so can't really say much more than that. <br><br>Thijs, the voting machines in Lake Michigan were put there by Mayor Daley. Back in the day, voting machines were these complicated mechanical devices, supposedly tamper-proof, that registered how many votes were cast for which candidate. In 1960, Daley simply had his crew get a bunch of spare machines, voted mostly Democratic on them, then swapped them for the voting machines that had actually been used in strongly Republican precincts and had the latter dumped in Lake Michigan. The fake votes gave Kennedy Illinois, and the electoral votes from Illinois were what put him ahead of Nixon in the 1960 election. That used to be famous -- I'm not surprised that it's been edited out of our historical memory, but I understand that people who do scuba diving in Lake Michigan can show you the voting machines, rusting in the mud at the bottom of the lake. <br><br>Craig, oh, it's always a spectrum, and whether the US considers a nation a "pariah state" or not has very little to do with the civil rights available to its citizens; it's basically a function of whether its leaders can be counted on to knuckle under to pressure from Washington.<br><br><a href=#c4387379097089159813 title="comment permalink">5/3/12, 2:48 PM</a><br><br>

The Roman people were by and large proud of their institutions and traditions, and so the Principate had to leave those intact while transferring real power elsewhere. Since the 1960s, that's been increasingly untrue of the US, which certainly makes matters easier for future despots. <br><br>MawKernewek, true, the ability to get rid of a failed head of state is one essential of democracy, and I'd be open to the claim that it's the most essential of the lot. <br><br>Brien, most of the things you've specified as part of a democratic society aren't found in democratic societies. That's the sort of thing I was talking about in the post -- the use of the word "democracy" to mean, not an actual system of government, but a dumping ground for fantasies of the way things ought to be. <br><br>Kleymo, fascinating. I'm generally not a Huntington fan, but will certainly follow up the link. <br><br>Don, we're social primates, not social insects, and one consequence of that is that -- like most mammals -- each of us is always jockeying for position vis-a-vis the rest of the baboon troop. It's not a matter of being dumber; over our evolutionary history, looking out for the Number One Primate has apparently paid off better than the alternatives. <br><br>Justin, bingo.

It's a fitting dance partner to the threads on fascism.<br><br>There is no such thing as a perfect system: anywhere, anytime. Only a more or less functioning system and even that is subjective.<br>Democracies are flawed because humanity is flawed and in the grand scheme of things evolution gets the final word. That said, I have personally met people while they were locked up in Australian Refugee Detention Centres who took risks most people in a democracy would never take, just on the off chance that they might live in relative stability, let alone paradise. <br>A journalist who stowed away in a ocean freighter and whose mother was beaten and whose colleagues were found in a large unmarked pit - some fifty of them; a couple who committed the sin of having an interfaith marriage; an ex police officer who refused to cut peoples hands off anymore. And I met some whose "claims" couldn't be "verified" who were sent back never to be heard from again. <br>Yes my democratic nation sent them back for myriad motives and misunderstandings and has left me with little respect for political posers and button pushing bureaucracies. But we were able - with a few arrests and fines and police surveillance and vitriol from a fearful public - to travel the country and hold public discussions, do interviews, speak directly to police officers about their roles and meet the detainees themselves without worrying (or knowing) that we - and quite likely our families - would be tortured, killed and publicly displayed. There are many who suffer under our current establishment it is true, the First Peoples for instance who never invited the First Fleet over in the First Place. "We've come along way since Botany Bay" but there is still many ways to go from here and the fact that most people don't actively participate in our democracy doesn't mean we don't have one. However flawed and historically (not to mention presently) unethical it can be, with a little indifference and a lot of unrealistic expectations, it could always be worse.<br><br>@ lamentforthetirnanog “I would resent it much more than a monarch or dictator who leaves me in peace.” Well it all depends on why they leave you in peace.

Not in some libertarian sense of the word. But more literally smaller nation-states. If a central concentration of power is a simple function of the current human social technology of the nation-state, a smaller state might serve to restrict the room for power gradation. Sadly the road is not a pleasant one to travel.</i><br><br>This comment and the earlier one about corruption being endemic to the human condition has me thinking about my own political beliefs. <br><br>I think it's human nature to exploit advantages and it's not so important what the current generation says they'll do with it, the next one is the one to watch; if men say they need a military for self-defense, they may be sincere but will their sons and grandsons resist the urge to start wars and not just end them? <br><br>I believe that human organizations become sclerotic, unresponsive and corrupt in time. It is as natural and unvarying a process as aging and the only way to accommodate it is with death and renewal. Poor organizations fail and are replaced by competitors. Allow organizations to become too big to fail and poor choices are rewarded, not punished, and the inevitable crash threatens to take out vast swaths of society. <br><br>I distrust aggressively centralized systems. I agree that planned economies fail because you have people far removed from the situation at hand trying to make decisions that require local knowledge. But I also believe that without proper oversight, everyone will take shortcuts, will cheat. Human nature strikes once more. <br><br>I like the idea of government oversight and regulation. The government isn't in charge of building houses, running power plants and growing food. It does set the rules for how all of that should be done and keeps everyone honest. It's an attempt to get the best of both worlds. Striking the balance requires a continued conversation, a public debate. <br><br>I find that people in the public debate fall into the following categories: <br><br>1) Means well, knows what they're talking about (rare) <br>2) Means well, hasn't a clue (most common) <br>3) Self-interested, competently evil (mixed bag) <br>4) Self-interested, really bad at it, Mayberry Machiavellis (quite a few)<br><br><a href=#c810600403564945492 title="comment permalink">5/3/12, 7:08 PM</a><br><br>

The self-interested kind are usually the ones in power, benefiting from the status quo and have a vested interest in keeping it this way. <br><br>I'm not drawing the line between left and right. There are reasonable conservatives politically but they've been ejected from the Republican party. The Democrats are pretty much the liberal branch of the Republican party and their leadership pretty much consists of the same self-interested types who are doing quite well under the status quo. <br><br>My personal supposition is that the Democratic Party exists to occupy the space that would otherwise be taken by a proper opposition party. It is like the blast suppression system on a rocket pad, taking fiery passions and taming that power, calming and redirecting all of that force away from the superstructure so it can safely attenuate in the atmosphere. Energetic volunteers are kept spinning their wheels until they are spent and burned out. They leave having accomplished nothing, changing nothing, and are no longer a threat. The Democrats are mindful of what happens when a populist faction within the party slips control. Just witness the difficulty they've had with the Tea Party torpedoing same, comfortable, moderate candidates. It's like the consternation of the rich man whose son pays attention in church and actually takes the teachings of Jesus seriously. "No, no, that's not how it works! Going to church is keeping up appearances. The stuff the pastor says, it's like the parsley on your dinner plate -- it's meant for decoration, you're not supposed to eat it! Those sayings of Jesus, you're supposed to nod reverently and say 'Aw, isn't that nice.' You're certainly not supposed to live it out! Give up all your wealth to follow him, are you mad?"<br><br>I find the whole situation deeply troubling. I'd like to believe the "we'll muddle along" crowd who says things will be fine, there's never the big disaster. Yeah, that's been ok for some but not for others. Muddle along has turned to bomb blasts and horrific death quite often in history.<br><br><a href=#c4095900243300449035 title="comment permalink">5/3/12, 7:08 PM</a><br><br>

You were talking about the law of limits, and how that’s sometimes the hardest law for people to accept. It reminded me of an experience I had at the end of October, which for me held a certain symbolism both in my own life and the larger society I live in.<br><br>It was the day a big snowstorm came to the East Coast, and I had already planned to hike up Old Rag Mountain in Shenandoah with a hiking group. There was almost a foot of snow on the ground the highest we got. Three quarters of the way up, we started to do the beginning of the rock scramble section, the section where one has to jump over 30-foot crevices from one large boulder to the next. It’s normally challenging on a sunny summer day, so in the icy treachurous weather, it would have likely been impossible without a good chance of being injured. However, one of the hikers with us, not wanting to be a “coward,” was determined to try it, as long as another would join him. No one else was that stupid to volunteer. So we all turned back and walked down, including him, though a bit relunctantly at first. <br><br>Most of the way down the mountain, I found myself deep in contemplation, thinking about the symbolism of having the courage NOT to go all the way to the top, even though it was our original plan. What if everyone else in my group didn’t want to appear to be a coward and had continued on? Would I have had mustered the courage to express my own limits, and turn back alone and not just follow the crowd “courageously” attempting do the impossible? <br><br>This made me reflect on how oftentimes humans think of courage as courage to be a daredevil and do seemingly impossible and heroic things, to be strong and invincible. And that type of courage is important and admirable to have at times. But as you say, balance is important. There's also a different kind of courage that's important at times, which is the courage to recognize and admit limits and weaknesses and to be able to say no to impossible feats. Sometimes that kind of courage is actually harder to exercise than the former, I think. This is true in my personal life, but also true in the larger contemporary human predicament that we face in this era of hitting the limits to growth on a finite earth.<br><br>People talk about gathering enough courage to do the impossible--launch a green tech revolution that will miraculously lead to a sustainable society, or the courage to find an energy source that will power society for years to come, or the courage to spark a mass revolution in consciousness that will bring about the Great Turning and some utopian society. But perhaps the courage which is hardest to express is our weakness and vulnerability, that we can’t achieve impossible goals. That takes a lot of humility, something which is lacking in this age. And paradoxically, having this latter type of courage might actually allow us to achieve some goals that matter in the decades to come.<br><br>Limits (ecological and other kinds) and their relationship to freedom is a topic I often contemplate. I find that accepting limits, the ability to actually say “no, I can’t do this,” and being honest about my own weaknesses, in a paradoxical way, has been a tremendous source of freedom in my life, though that’s often counter to the current dominant ideology of what “freedom” means. It is a topic that I’ve contemplated writing a larger set of essays on. Do you know of any books that explore recognizing limits as being a source of freedom?<br><br><a href=#c7054140445743991159 title="comment permalink">5/3/12, 9:13 PM</a><br><br>

The problem (which I have communicated poorly, my apologies) is that something called "democracy" is spoken of by contemporary discourse as the <i>sine qua non</i> of civilized life; more a set of political virtues than any concrete system. "A dumping-ground for fantasies" is an even better description.<br><br>In such an intellectual environment, no distinction is made between the concrete system of holding periodic elections on one hand and the political truism that "things go better when people are participating rather than scared" on the other. Without making that distinction, any rational discussion of the pros and cons of true democracy versus, say, constitutional monarchy is impossible. <br><br>In such an intellectual climate, there is no choice between competing systems of government; there is only the choice between sacred Democracy and mere barbarism.<br><br>This is all the more sad given that real Democracy has much to favor it, as you have cogently argued - to inflate its claims is unneeded. In addition, for us Americans it is the working system given us by our forefathers, and that should count for something. Democracy is many good things, but civilized culture has preceded it and will long survive it. <br><br>I hope clarity eventually enters these matters in our national discourse, though I fear I may have muddied more than I cleared.<br><br>Regards,<br>Brien <br><br>PS ~ As regards economic freedom and the rest, what I was clumsily trying to express is that if we're trying to enumerate desirable goals of a regime, then that list is much, much longer than mere presence or absence of a ballot box. That's all. <br><br>It's also probably a long list of which everyone has a different version. But hey, coming to agreement and compromise on such things is the heart of politics, right?<br><br><a href=#c1628758144613451785 title="comment permalink">5/3/12, 10:16 PM</a><br><br>

Part of the US political scene is the repeated attempt of Party A to prove that Party B has lost the mandate of heaven, that they are "steering the country wrong," that "the voters have got tired of them" etc.<br><br>Another thing about party politics that drives me nuts is Party Discipline; politicians are required to vote the party line on any given issue regardless of their personal convictions or the convictions of the community which elected them. You get Party A, you get the whole standard menu of Party A, the official platform. (And the winner-take-all electoral process only makes it worse; IRV could be quite a game-changer imho). Rarely does your own personal Senator from your own state actually represent the priorities of the voters of that state, if you see what I mean; if s/he isn't busy representing the priorities of the Chamber of Commerce and the PACs, then s/he is busy toeing the party line (which might come to the same thing).<br><br>Reading Trollope f'rexample makes me rather nostalgic for moments in history when elected politicians actually wrestled with their individual consciences when considering their position on key issues of the day. We've seen some minor dramas of this kind in our own time -- the few rogue Republicans who are willing to admit that climate change is a serious issue, for example. This tendency to form up teams, lump together opinions/positions and declare them as team property, persecute or denounce any team members who don't keep lockstep, etc. seems to be part and parcel of the decay curve of authenticity or sincerity in political life (whether it be the history of socialist movements or US democracy or whatever). Surely it must be some weird crossover of abstract intellectual concepts (like opinions, principles, and positions) with very antique primate notions like turf, territory, and tribe?<br><br><a href=#c1272940471581658937 title="comment permalink">5/3/12, 11:08 PM</a><br><br>

I propose that if we are trying to take the snarl out of words like "empire" and "capitalism" we perhaps should do the same with "corruption."<br><br>I heard a story on NPR the other day about how corruption and fraud can stem as much from social impulses to help someone else as selfish impulses to help one's self.

If you haven't already, expect some blowback from the Right on your use of the word, "democracy."<br><br>I believe you're using the term in a very generic sense (the way I and almost everybody else use the word) to mean a modern, representative, more-or-less pluralistic form of constitutional government. Conservatives, though, will tend to discount everything you say on this subject, because, as they are quick to point out, we are not a democracy, but a republic. That is, of course, no more technically correct than the term you use: think of the wide range of hypothetical and real governments that have used that moniker, from Plato, through Rome and on to modern forms, but it is used by them to gain points over the (so-called) Democratic Party in this country.<br><br>Not that they don't have a point. It conjures for them images of crones with knitting needles. Democracy, they will say, is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner. If anyone were arguing for pure democracy, their point might have some value, but as it is, it's only a rhetorical trick. But one that will get in the way of communicating with this constituency. Anyway, I was just thinking that when this gets ready for publication you might want to make sure your terms are more carefully defined than necessary for a blog post.<br><br>(Please insert obligatory "the Left is just as bad" comments here because, well, it's true.)<br><br><a href=#c1154345871865954686 title="comment permalink">5/4/12, 7:14 AM</a><br><br>

You mention the ancient Greeks but not one key aspect of the original Athenian democracy : sortition. Choosing most representatives at random for a short mandate was based on the principle of defiance against human nature. On the opposite, asking people to vote and choose between a small group of persons from the same law schools, is based on the principle of trust.

Regards to you and all commenters. This is a welcome breath of fresh air. Intelligent, sane, civil discourse, what a concept.<br><br>This week’s blog rang a familiar bell. This might be old hat, but want to see if you or fellow readers have read "The Politics Presidents Make" (1993) by Stephen Skowronek (political science professor at Yale). He describes a similar cycle, but of usually shorter duration. Each cycle has three stages - reconstruction, articulation, and disjunction.<br><br>Reconstruction would correlate somewhat to the dictator stage, wherein a president sets up a new vision and describes new policies, overturning the previous vision. He has great influence, though he may not necessarily be able to fully enact the vision and policies. The presidents of this stage are revered (and in some cases worshiped) and are reference points or touchstones. These presidents include Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, Roosevelt (FDR), and Reagan.<br><br>Articulation, which follows the Reconstruction by an election or two, may correlate to the junta stage. In this stage, a president is affiliated with the Reconstructive president and is able to make great strides in enacting the vision and policies of the Reconstructive president. This corresponds to the presidencies of Monroe, Polk, Teddy Roosevelt, LBJ, and I would argue Geo W Bush.<br><br>Another couple of elections occur before we reach the Disjunctive presidency. This presidency is usually considered a great failure. The Reconstructive vision has run its course, its policies are discredited, and the president is seen as incompetent. These presidencies include JQ Adams, Pierce, Hoover, and Carter. In each case, they served only one term and (except for Pierce) were immediately followed by a Reconstructive president.<br><br>We have not reached the end of the Reagan reconstruction and encountered its disjunction, though I expect that the next Republican president may have the dubious honor following either the 2012 or 2016 elections. This may set up the Reconstruction (dictator) in 2016 or 2020. But, as others have suggested, since we are on the lee side of Hubbert's Sand Dune, who knows what may happen.<br><br>BTW, George Washington is an exception, a towering, larger-than-life figure. He was followed by John Adams who, though there wasn't necessarily a “Reconstructive” vision, is seen as the first disjunctive president. During his presidency, previous visions for the country were repudiated and Jefferson set out on a different course.<br><br>Please understand that this is all just a very brief outline and my take on Skowronek’s perspective. Of course, he goes into much more detail and nuance, as well as analyzing the other presidencies scattered amongst these archetypes that don't necessarily fit the pattern.<br><br>Thanks, and again, best regards to all.<br><br><a href=#c2472681015904645995 title="comment permalink">5/4/12, 10:25 AM</a><br><br>

The cyclical model is compelling, but I keep wondering about the length of cycles you've established and the figures you've chosen to demarcate them.<br><br>Just focusing on Lincoln for a moment. While it is easy to see the unilateral nature of Lincoln's presidency, I can't see the junta clearly at all. The Southern elite took some bitter medicine after the war, but within 20 years they had pretty much reasserted their political control and formed a solid block that kept Northern interests in check for decades. The massive diaspora of African Americans out of the South is evidence enough of that.<br><br>I also find Teddy Roosevelt's absence odd given his importance in the establishment of the American Empire. In the wake of popular opposition in Congress, he abrogated great power to himself. And he really did have a junta of interested parties that capitalized (quite literally) on the changes he wrought.<br><br><a href=#c2265420229972509129 title="comment permalink">5/4/12, 10:44 AM</a><br><br>

But I think there´s some wrong information in this week´s post. In a democracy elections are forbidden! I´m not kidding. Do you happen to know the following paper?<br><br>Quote:<br>As stated earlier, for the Greeks elections were undemocratic. No wonder, the anonymous painting of a cross inside a huge mass is the absolute opposite of what is called self-government from responsible citizens. The ancient thinkers would most probably laugh at our today's pathos with which we applaud us for our "right" to be citizens for a day and then subject for five years.<br>Source: http://www.wertewirtschaft.org/analysen/Demokratie.pdf , page 43.<br><br>I know it´s in German and I know it´s a long read but in case of interest I´ll be happy to translate the key parts for you to read? <br><br>In short: The term democracy comes from "demos" and "kratein", and a major misinterpretation is that demos would mean "people" which it does not. If you look up demos it has two meanings, and the one fitting here is "smallest administrative unit" aka. "village". The Greeks never used democracy for a whole land or state, the term "state" came much later from the latin word "status" and has nothing to do with the Greeks. The greek cities were not united but rather autonom, self-governed city states, there was no "ancient greek democracy" like we want to see it....<br><br>This might surprise some readers but also taxes are forbidden in a real democracy! No kidding here, neither. <br><br>Another thing is that the founders of America knew from histrory that a big scale democracy cannot work but rather must lead into tyranny. They tried to avoid this but when I look around today I don´t think that they were successful? No offense intended!<br><br>Enjoy your Saturday!<br>Joachim<br><br><a href=#c3440999580772569141 title="comment permalink">5/5/12, 12:37 AM</a><br><br>

If one allows that anomalies in normal science are comparable to problems in a stagnant democracy then both can be addressed by moving in a radically different direction. The difference is that Kuhn's anomalies are 'problems' for a specific conceptual framework while for a government '<i>competing circles of officials, officers, and influential people emerge; these expand their power until the democratic system freezes into gridlock under the pressure of factionalism or <b>unsolved crisis</b>; the democratic system loses its legitimacy</i>' are problems of power sharing arrangements and anomalies of their ideology.<br><br> Interestingly, this also allows one to map the gradual 'diffusion of power' from the original dictator to the junta to the democracy to the gradual acceptance of a concept from the original radical scientist to some less radical colleges to the whole conservative establishment until problems and anomalies build up to the point of needing a new radical.<br><br> This makes me think of Odum's <a href=http://prosperouswaydown.com/principles-of-self-organization/energy-hierarchy/pulsing-paradigm/ rel=nofollow>pulsing paradigm</a>.

The Internet isn't nearly as energy / resource intensive as the car / ICE-based transportation system, given that the latter uses on the order of 20% of all energy globally. The Internet---including both the electricity and manufacturing energy of all the devices such as laptops, smartphones, data center servers, routers, etc.---uses about 2% of energy globally. That and with the exception of one or two rare minerals whose use isn't fundamental to my knowledge, computers can be made using very common minerals.<br><br>However, there are some major downsides to the Internet.

They don't always use the word "hypocrisy" directly, but there's a distinct tone of "how DARE my opponents SAY that? They don't take their own advice, so who are THEY to talk!"<br><br>Here's one example from each party:<br><br>"How dare this Democrat accuse us Republicans of lying to the public about being against reckless spending when in fact we always vote for increasing the size of the Pentagon military budget? THEY went along with our adventurous foreign wars TOO!!! So the Democrats are all a bunch of hypocrites!"<br><br>"How dare this Republican accuse us Democrats of exercising too much arbitrary and unnecessary control over the guns some Americans need as part of their daily cultural life? THEY exercise too much control over our DRUGS!!! So the Republicans are all a bunch of hypocrites!"<br><br>But pointing out that someone is a hypocrite can itself be a logical fallacy, "Appeal to Hypocrisy," if one is not careful.<br><br>Here's an example: Someone accuses me of committing adultery, meaning I've slept with someone who's not my future wife if I ever get married.<br><br>Let's suppose instead of saying the charge is false and I'm innocent, I say that my accuser is ALSO an adulterer, i.e., he's a hypocrite!<br><br>Well that may in fact be TRUE...but whether or not my accuser's a hypocrite, that doesn't excuse MY adultery. If I am guilty, my accuser is right to call me out on it, whether he's a hypocrite or not.<br><br>Meaning: if you accuse your opponent of hypocrisy because he's guilty of what he accuses you of, but if he happens to be right in his statement regardless, then it's no more productive than calling someone a fascist or a communist. You're still avoiding his actual argument in favor of attacking his character. That your attack on his character may be valid does not mean his statement of fact is not equally valid.<br><br>And all of this advice applies whether you're a conservative calling a liberal a hypocrite, or whether you're a liberal calling a conservative a hypocrite.<br><br>Oh, something else, too:<br><br>I've noticed that almost everyone who calls himself "avoiding the left and right debates" still uses the opportunity to take a potshot at the side he secretly doesn't like. A lot of people represent themselves as being fair and balanced, as being moderate, as being coldly rational and above the mongrels, as someone who hates the way our country is headed and the fact that our children are picking up habits of arguing...now if only this or that opposing party would go away!<br><br>For a conservative example, take the Conrad Black example I brought up once when I posted in an earlier blog post of yours. He's sick of all the warring debates in this country...now if only we'd vote all the Democrats out for being too divisive, the Tea Party and/or the Republicans can make sure all our discussions are civilized! We can have civil discourse in this country, if only all the Democrats would just go the heck away!<br><br>For a liberal example, take Frank Schaeffer, former evangelical who has left the fold. He's fed up with the crazy atheists and the crazy Christians. He wants a middle ground of faith...now if only the Republicans would quit being a bunch of morons! We could have civilized discourse in this country at last, if only the Republican Party would lose all of its Congress seats!<br><br>The tribalism in this country has gotten so bad that almost everybody who says they haven't picked a side...have in fact picked a side.<br><br>Hey, at least I'm willing to say I'm a liberal flat-out! :)<br><br><a href=#c2583184602829432618 title="comment permalink">5/7/12, 8:34 AM</a><br><br>

Looking at the results of recent European elections in France and Greece, an Obama loss in the upcoming election and a Romney-backed adoption of a Paul Ryan-style austerity program would seem catastrophic, as would an Obama win coupled with a greater expansion of U.S. debt. <br>Both sides of the spectrum will be screaming in any regard, and this is why I view this upcoming election cycle as perhaps one of the most intriguing in our nation’s history. It truly seems as though whoever wins the presidency will immediately be illegitimate to an alarming portion of the population even before they are sworn into office. Thinking back on American history, I can’t think of any other time that a democratically-elected American president faced such a situation upon assuming office. The conventions have yet to occur and people have yet to head to the polls yet opinions are being galvanized on both sides of the aisle and the familiar party incantations are being chanted on Fox News and the New York Times alike. This is why it was so dangerous when the left called for the impeachment of Bush, and why the Trump-led crusade against President Obama’s birthplace seemed to plunge our country into an even murkier place of political discourse. As you aptly stated, democracy doesn’t mean that your side gets all the goodies it wants, likewise, it also doesn’t mean the other side is an enemy that should be treated as such at every opportunity. <br> As I have argued before, at the end of the day, I think the basic concerns of most Americans are fairly identical. It is only in the machinations of modern politics and the two party system that the lines become blurred and people fall into the hyper-partisan trap whereby their opinions are so heavily influenced by the propaganda and rhetoric of cable news and pundit websites that they essentially permit blinders to be installed upon their innate sense of reason. This is troubling on many levels, not the least of which is as you alluded to in your post; it could potentially open the door for a tyrant with a cult of personality to emerge who promises the moon and stars in exchange for power. From ancient to modern history, there are striking examples of this sort of trajectory that we appear to be following. This time, at least for America’s sojourn in the imperial spotlight, the perfect storm seems to be brewing, as it often does at the end of empires, whereby there are so many variables at work that could provide the spark that could truly, as remarkable as it sounds, potentially end our democracy. To be sure, the tempest has been brewing for some time, but the plethora of potentially crisis-inducing situations coupled with the poisonous political environment in this country is enough to make one pause and hope that our constitution is stable and resilient enough to survive this go round.<br><br><a href=#c4698718563216369566 title="comment permalink">5/7/12, 12:41 PM</a><br><br>

I am very much inclined to accept it for a variety of reasons, one of which is that it meshes rather well with certain recurring patterns in the history of alternative religions and new religious movements in the USA. <br><br>For a while in the late 1990s and early 2000s I offered a course on the history of women-led new magical (or quasi-magical) religions in the USA from the late 1700s down to the present. (There is, unsurprisingly, no textbook on this subject, so I taught it chiefly from primary sources.) Working through this material, I noticed a rough cycle of about 60-80 years at play. <br><br>The first cycle began around the time of the War of Independence, with Mother Ann Lee (of Shaker fame) and more characteristically with Jemimah Wilkinson. For about 35-40 years the religious climate was permissive and these movements developed freely. (So did freethought, Deism, and Swedenborgianism, but these other movements, not being led by women, fell outside the scope of my course.) Around the time of the war of 1812, the religious climate seemed to change, and became steadily more repressive, and remained so for another 35-40 years. (The Anti-Masonic movement was connected with this development, though again it fell outside the scope of my course.) <br><br>The rapid rise of Spiritualism around 1850 marked the beginning of a second permissive era in our religious history. This period also saw the beginning of the New Thought / Christian Science group of religions, the founding of the Theosophical Society, and the rise of a new kind of non-Christian Occultism promulgated by Emma Hardinge Britten's books "Art Magic" and "Ghost Land," all around 1875-1876. Here, too, belongs the low-key Paganism of Victoria Woodhull. Repression of alternative religion set in again under the leadership of Anthony Comstock, and was in full force from about 1885 to the end of World War I. <br><br>There was a somewhat shorter permissive period from about 1918 to World War II, marked by a resurgence of Spiritualism, New Thought and Occultism (also cf. Aimee Semple McPherson within Christianity), and a somewhat shorter repressive period until the late 1960s. Then, of course, we entered another permissive era, in which we occurred the rise of Wicca and large-scale Paganism.<br><br>Permissive and Repressive are relative terms, of course. Two of the most important early leaders of First-Wave Feminism, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Matilda Joslyn Gage, were able to publish major critiques of Christianity as an oppressive religion in the middle of the 1890s: "The Woman's Bible" and "Woman, Church and State," respectively. But they got far more grief for these books of theirs than would have been the case twenty years earlier, even within the Women's Rights movement that they had helped to launch. (Gage was also an occultist and theosophist; Stanton's views on such matters are less clear.) Also, the boundaries are not sharp: each shift from permission to repression and back again took place over a period of 5-10 years.<br><br><a href=#c3140642053209708768 title="comment permalink">5/7/12, 6:50 PM</a><br><br>

Washington, of course, was the first president General of the Society of the Cincinnati. It was formed explicitly to uphold the example of the legendary Roman Cincinnatus, who was called to serve as dictator during a crisis, but laid down his powers and went back to his plow as soon as the crisis was over.<br><br>As for Franklin, among the various gewgaws in my great-grandmother's house was an old political placard saying "Why risk dictatorship? No third term!" This was, of course, a relic from the contested election that did put FDR in the White House for his third term.<br><br>It's instructive, too, to consider the designs of US coinage. From the 1790s onward, almost every coin had a female head, or full female form, with the name "Liberty" attached to her. She was nothing less than the old Pagan Goddess Liberty, as the emblem or even the patron of our new nation. Only in the 20th century did that design change, when the head of Liberty was replaced with portrait busts of various iconic dead presidents. It began with Abraham Lincoln in 1909 on the penny. Then came three of the founding fathers: George Washington in 1932 on the quarter, Thomas Jefferson in 1938 on the nickel, and Benjamin Franklin in 1948 on the half dollar. The word "Liberty" remained on all these coins, but it was no longer the name of an ancient Goddess, just a venerated political abstraction. And in the final analysis abstractions are, well, abstract . . . and political abstractions seem somewhat less real than concrete leaders.<br><br>As the cult of the Sitting President as the Larger-than-Life Leader and Living Human Symbol of the Nation (rather than just a man who happens to be acting as the chief executive at the moment) grew ever stronger, a few more recent presidents also began to appear on our coins, filling out and completing the new pattern: Franklin Roosevelt on the dime in 1946, John F Kennedy on the half dollar in 1964, and Dwight D Eisenhower on the dollar coin in 1971. (The current movement to put Ronald Reagan on the dime is part of the same pattern.)<br><br>On the gut level, this bothered me as it happened (I was born in 1942), and it still bothers me deeply. I would really like to see Liberty take her old place on every coin again. But I don't think it's going to happen.<br><br><a href=#c4734284349651207044 title="comment permalink">5/7/12, 7:46 PM</a><br><br>

Constitutional monarchy, for example, isn't a realistic option here in the US, nor will be for many centuries -- those things that are, other than some form of democracy, don't have the positive features I listed. <br><br>DeAnander, politicians always act like baboons scrambling for status. The difference is that in some historical periods, they have to pay attention to people outside the political class, and so make decisions on some basis other than what their party demands; at other times, they don't have that worry, and so simply do what will improve their status among other politicians. <br><br>BrightSpark, fascinating. <br><br>Cherokee, the thing that fascinates me is that the version of Keynsian remedies being applied at the moment is the same one that was tried, and failed abjectly, by the Hoover administration in the wake of the 1929 crash.

UK North Sea oil actually gave some early problems, exacerbating Thatcher's early economic disasters (industries sliding like snow off a wall). Oil drove up the pound sterling value, and early dramatic see-saw exchange rates helped kill a lot of otherwise viable industry. This was portrayed as necessary weeding of the uncompetitive. Later of course North Sea saved some bacon, but the first phase was almost entirely done by American oilmen. It was all inches, BTU, and degrees Fahrenheit; none of the rubbish world standard measurement units. One oil field was named after T. Boone Pickens’ wife Beatrice! <br>To put it another way: the wealth pump in the UK part of the North Sea sent a fair bit across the Atlantic. Part of the reason it got pumped so fast. (PS We are apparently attempting just now a reprise of ‘Thatcher’; at least that is what Public Relations tell us. A lot of people are being ‘weeded out’.)<br><br><a href=#c6752271880793498055 title="comment permalink">5/9/12, 3:13 AM</a><br><br>

To me, that strengthens the case, since I imagine you think about these things somewhat differently than they do.<br><br>The determinism of it bugs me a bit, though. Such social periodicity shoudn't happen (my engineering thinking tells me), unless it's an emergent behavior of all complex human social systems that is too hard for us to quantify. That such cycles are observable (and even used for prediction) gets us quite close to Asimov's psychohistory."<br><br>I think that the Strauss and Howe cycles are directly related to credit expansions/busts.<br><br>Expanding credit enables the inner world to be rejiggered by Awakening generations. People can afford to "find themselves" because the financial system crashed and was reset.<br><br>Eventually we get to today's exciting point where the credit expansion has run into the shoals of a credit bubble bust, wherein the Millenials don't even have enough money to live on their own.

It's all over the press.<br><br>S'funny how you never hear anybody talking about "energy austerity" and living within our "energy means" after binge-ing, eh? Yet the principle of the argument is precisely the same in both cases. Funny to imagine if all those articles had been written about "energy austerity" instead. To bad the premise of the former is wrong, but gets all the press; (the people being threatened with financial austerity aren't actually the ones who signed the commitments, their banks and governments did) ...meanwhile the reverse is true about the latter.<br><br>I think JMG's phraseology about "LESS is more" is much more attractive than harsh words like "austerity", which are meant to imply that the people under discussion need to be punished on moral grounds. Energy conservation is about prudent good sense, not punishment. Yet talk about energy conservation anywhere but here, and people react like you just slapped them in the face.<br><br><a href=#c3527847207799421124 title="comment permalink">5/9/12, 6:29 PM</a><br><br>
