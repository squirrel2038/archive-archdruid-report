<div class=MsoNormal>
Last weeks’ post attempted, with the help of the ancient Greek philosopher Polybius, to trace out the trajectory that democracies—and in particular the United States—tend to follow across time. The pattern that Polybius outlined, and that American politics has cycled through three times so far in the course of its history, begins with most of the nation’s political power concentrated in a single person, and follows the diffusion of power to the point that the entire political system settles into a gridlock only a massive crisis can break.  Just now, according to that model, we are in the stage of gridlock, and thus of maximum diffusion of power. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course this interpretation flies in the face of the standard narrative that surrounds power in America today. Both sides of the political spectrum these days like to insist that too much power is in the hands of the other side, at least when the other side is in the White House or has a majority in Congress. The further from the mainstream you go, the more strident the voices you’ll hear insisting that some small group or other has seized absolute power over the US political system and is running things for their own advantage. The identity of the small group in question varies wildly—it’s hard to think of anyone who hasn’t been accused, at some point in the last half century or so, of being the secret elite that runs everything—but the theory that some small group or other has all the power that everybody else seems to lack is accepted nearly everywhere. Whether it’s Occupy Wall Street talking about the nefarious 1%, or the Tea Party talking about the equally nefarious liberal elite, the conviction that power has been concentrated in the wrong hands is ubiquitous in today’s America. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s an appealing notion, especially if you want to find somebody to blame for the current state of affairs in this country, and of course hunting for scapegoats is a popular sport whenever times are hard. Still, I’d like to suggest that an alternative understanding explains much more about the current state of the American political system. The alternative I have in mind is that the political system is lurching forward like a driverless car along a trajectory set by the outdated policies of an earlier time, and that just now, nobody is in charge at all. Unpopular though this way of thinking about power in America is, I suggest that it makes more sense of our predicament than the more popular notion of elite control.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s important to understand what my proposal means and, more importantly, what it doesn’t mean. A great many of those who insist that power in America is in the hands of a small elite offer, as evidence for the claim, the fact that a relatively small number of people get an obscenely large share of national income and wealth, and they’re quite correct. The last three decades or so have seen America turn into something close to a Third World kleptocracy, the sort of failed state in which a handful of politically well-connected people plunder the economy for their own benefit. When bank executives vote themselves and their cronies million-dollar bonuses out of government funds while their banks are losing billions of dollars a year, just to name an obvious example, it’s impossible to discuss the situation honestly without using words like “looting.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, the ability to plunder one corner of a complex system is not the same thing as the ability to control the whole system, and the freedom with which so many people pillage the institutions they’re supposed to be managing could as well be understood as a sign that there’s no center of power willing or able to defend the core interests of the US empire against death by financial hemorrhage.  The only power the executives of, say, Goldman Sachs need is the power to block any effort to stop them from stripping their bank to the bare walls for their personal enrichment, or to cut them off from the access to tax dollars that’s made that process so lucrative.  That much power they certainly have—but it’s a kind and a degree of power shared by many other influential groups in America just now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Consider the defense industries that are busy profiting off the F-35 fighter, an impressively corrupt corporate welfare program currently chewing gargantuan holes in the defense budgets of the US and several other nations.  Years behind schedule and trillions of dollars over budget, the F-35 is by all independent accounts a dog of a plane, clumsier and more vulnerable than the decades-old fighters it is supposed to replace. The consortium of interests that profit from its manufacture have the power to keep the process chugging along, even as the delays stretch to decades and the cost overruns head toward lunar orbit, and again, that’s all the power they need. It’s all the more telling that they’re able to do so when the F-35 project is directly opposed to crucial US interests: having the US and its allies equipped with a substandard fighter, at a time when China and Russia are both busily testing much better planes, risks humiliating defeat in future wars—and yet the program moves steadily forward. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Examples of the same sort of thing can be multiplied endlessly, and they aren’t limited to corporations. Cities and counties all over the United States, for example, are being driven into bankruptcy by the cost of public-sector salaries and benefits that politically influential unions have extracted from vulnerable or compliant local politicians. Equally, other countries—China and Israel come to mind—have learned to make use of the diffusion of American power for their own interests.  It doesn’t matter how blatantly the Chinese manipulate their currency or thumb their noses at intellectual property rights, for instance; so long as they keep their lobby in Washington well funded and well staffed, they’re secure from any meaningful response on the part of the US government. I’ve come to suspect that the only reason the US government is down on Iran is that religious scruples keep the Iranian government from buying immunity the way the Chinese do; they’ve got the petroleum and therefore the money, and could doubtless have their own influential lobby capable of blocking hostile legislation in Congress, if only they didn’t let their ideals get in the way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The power exerted by each of these groups is by and large a veto power.  They may not be able to get new policies through the jungle of competing interests in Washington, a task that is increasingly hard for anyone to manage at all, but they can prevent policies that are not in their interest from being enacted, and they can defend any policy already in place that benefits them or furthers their ability to loot the system. They have that veto power, in turn, because no one in contemporary America has the power to get anything done without assembling a temporary coalition of competing power centers, each of which has its own agenda and each of which constantly has its hand out for the biggest possible share of the take. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Not every potential power center in American politics functions as a veto group, mind you. A great many groups have become captive constituencies of one of the existing power centers, and thus lost whatever independent influence they might have had. Compare the way that the Democratic Party has seized control of the environmental movement to the way that the Republicans have played the same trick on gun owners.  In both cases, the party can ignore the interests of its captive constituency until elections come around, and then bombard the constituency with propaganda insisting that the other party will do horrible things to the environment or the Second Amendment if they win the election. The other party duly plays its part in this good cop-bad cop routine by making threatening noises about gun rights or environmental issues at intervals. It’s an efficient scam, and it keeps environmentalists voting for Democrats and gun owners voting for Republicans even though neither party gives more than lip service to the issues that matter to either group. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To the members of the captive constituencies, in turn, all this simply feeds the belief that there must be somebody in the system who has the power they lack; after all, they keep on voting for the right people,  and yet none of their policies ever get enacted! Since very few gun owners ever sit down and share a couple of beers with environmentalists, there’s rarely an opportunity for them to compare notes and notice that neither side is getting what it wants, and the same gimmick is being used on both. The one place on the political continuum where this sort of comparison does take place is out on the fringes, where the extreme left increasingly bends around to touch the extreme right, and the paranoiac beliefs endemic to the farther shores of American politics turn the whole thing into yet another proof that the Freemasons or the Jews or David Ickes’ imaginary space lizards run everything after all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Just as the ability to plunder one part of a system does not equal control over the whole system, though, the ability to manipulate a handful of politically naive pressure groups does not equal the ability to manipulate the whole system. It’s precisely because no one group has an effective monopoly on power that political parties and other power centers have to resort to complicated and expensive gimmickry to hammer together the temporary coalitions that enable them to cling to whatever power they have and, on increasingly rare occasions, force through some policy or other that favors their interests. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As the system settles ever more deeply into gridlock, in turn, policies put in place in previous decades become increasingly resistant to change. Even those that turned out to have severe flaws will inevitably get support from those who profit from them, and from employees of government bureaucracies whose jobs would go away in the event of a policy change.  Machiavelli pointed out a long time ago that reforms always face an uphill struggle, since those who benefit from the status quo can be counted on to fight fiercely to hold on to what they’ve got, while those who might benefit from reform have less incentive to fight for gains they know perfectly well they may never see; factor in the mutual support among power centers who have a mutual interest in keeping the status quo fixed in place, and you have a recipe for exactly the sort of stasis the United States sees every seventy or eighty years, as the cycle discussed in last week’s post approaches its end. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
How the endgame plays out is a matter of more than academic interest.  In 1860 and 1932, a political system frozen in gridlock and incapable of anything like a constructive response to crisis finally hit a crisis that could not be evaded any longer, and the system shattered. In the chaos that resulted, a long-shot candidate with a radical following was able to pull together enough support from the remaining power centers and the people in general to win the White House and force through changes that redefined the political landscape for decades to come. That’s a possibility this time around, too, but a possibility is not a certainty, and nowhere is it written in stone that a crisis of the sort we’re discussing has to have a happy ending. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The range and scale of the crises facing the United States as it finishes the third lap around the track of anacyclosis, to begin with, pose a far more substantial challenge than the ones that punctuated the cycle in those earlier years.  In 1860, as we’ve seen, the question was which of two incompatible human ecologies would dominate the North American continent; in 1932, it was the simpler though still challenging matter of how to pry the dead fingers of a failed economic ideology off the throat of the nation.  This time, the United States faces two immense and parallel difficulties, neither one of which has the sort of straightforward solution that Lincoln and Roosevelt respectively had to hand. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first difficulty, as I’ve discussed at length in these posts, is that the global empire established by the United States in the wake of the Second World War is coming apart. The American way of empire – the custom of leaving the administration of subject countries to puppet governments drawn from local elites – was cheaper than the traditional approach of subjugation and rule by an imperial viceroy, but it turned out to be more vulnerable to change and less directly profitable to the imperial government:  American corporations profited mightily from the wealth pump directed at Latin America, for example, but very little of that money ended up in the coffers of the US treasury, where it could help cover the costs of empire. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As the American empire falters, in turn, rival powers expand their own military capacities and apply pressure wherever they can get away with it, short of being drawn into a premature war; the US military reacts with the same sort of stereotyped response that characterized the latter years of the British empire, preparing to fight bygone wars with ever more ornate and overpriced technology, while its most likely opponents show every sign of asking the hard questions about basics that lead to sudden revolutions in military practice. When this has happened in the past, the results have almost never been good for the established imperial power, and there’s no reason to think that things will be noticeably different this time around. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile America’s “empire of time,” its once-immense energy resource base, has been drawn down at breakneck rates for more than a century and a half. Recent handwaving around shale gas reserves has served mostly to pump up the price of drilling company stocks, and enabled a certain number of rich men in influential positions to get away with another round of looting; we’ve all heard the strident claims that the United States will become an energy exporter sometime very soon, but the numbers don’t even begin to add up, and it’s a safe bet that a few years down the road shale gas will have gone the way of ethanol and all the other energy sources that were allegedly going to replace petroleum and keep the industrial age running smoothly ahead.  The American economy is utterly dependent on very large quantities of petroleum; so is the American military; drastic changes, going far beyond the baby steps involved in manufacturing a few electric cars or running a naval vessel or two on biodiesel, would have to get started well in advance to cushion the end of either dependency, and those changes are not taking place. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The consequences of the end of these two empires can’t be dealt with on the battlefield, as the long debate over the shape of America’s human ecology was, and it can’t be dealt with by jerry-rigging a set of temporary expedients to overcome the mismatch between real wealth and a dysfunctional financial system, as the crisis of the Great Depression was.  It will require massive changes in every aspect of American life, starting with a steep decline in standards of living and the forced abandonment of privileges most Americans think of as theirs by right. That would be an immense crisis at the best of times, and these are not the best of times; our political system has spent the last thirty years trying to evade exactly these issues, while sinking further and further into stasis, and it’s our luck that the crisis seems to be arriving just as American politics freeze up completely. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That might result in the kind of systemic shock that brings another long-shot candidate with a radical following into the White House, and catalyzes immense natonal changes. It might also result in the more extreme form of systemic shock that shatters a nation into fragments. In the weeks to come we’ll be discussing both those possibilities, and others. </div>

<span style="font-size: large">End of the World of the Week #21</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s necessary to turn to history books to get the details on most of the apocalyptic prophecies discussed here and in <a href="http://www.vivaeditions.com/book_page.php?book_id=25">Apocalypse Not</a>, but there’s at least one important exception – and no, I’m not talking about Harold Camping. Nearly all of my readers will remember those giddy months toward the end of 1999 when a great many people expected industrial civilization to grind to a halt because an older generation of computer software used two digits, rather than four, to keep track of the year, and risked freezing up when “99” turned to “00” amd a variety of internal functions geared to incremental changes in date went haywire.  That was the Y2K crisis—or, more precisely, noncrisis—and it has a lesson that not everyone who lived through the nonarrival of that noncrisis may have grasped. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I had a certain advantage in grasping it, as I lived in the high-tech hotbed of Seattle and knew a lot of people in the computer industry. Some of them knew as much about the Y2K problem as anybody alive, but you’d just about have to schedule an appointment with them to hear what they had to say about it, because they were working as much overtime as they wanted, and raking in money at a dizzying pace. Those who still remembered enough from their college classes in COBOL and other obsolete computer languages were rewriting code for banks, bureaucracies, and big corporations; those who didn’t were generally installing brand new Y2K-compliant PC systems and networks for smaller firms that had decided to scrap their existing hardware altogether. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Quite a lot of people spent those last months of 1999 cowering in fear or gloating over the imminent demise of everybody else.  For computer geeks, though, the Y2K noncrisis was an extraordinarily profitable time, and every round of dire warnings in the media was followed by panicked phone calls to computer firms from more businesses eager to save their companies from the “Millennium bug.”  I can’t say for sure that those dire warnings were part of a deliberate marketing strategy, but they certainly functioned that way, and they drove the single largest boom the US computer industry had ever seen. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, I used an old and noncompliant PC for writing, and didn’t have anything like the money I would have needed to buy an up-to-date machine. Instead, a few weeks before the new year, I went into the software and reset the internal calendar to the equivalent date in December 1949, and then went through the rollover to January 1, 1950 without any trouble at all. </div>

This is the first admission I've ever encountered on national corporate advertising that Americans are having any trouble getting enough work.

One essay that dealt decisively to two of my favourite bugbears: Directors and IT managers.<br><br>Yeah, when I used to work in the big end of town, the focus of both directors and IT managers on their remuneration used to cause me despair! Truly, if they'd put as much effort into their jobs as their incessant concerns about remuneration, well, let's say that the businesses themselves would have run more smoothly.<br><br>There is a sentiment in the business community that the powers that be were “done over” during the whole Y2K kerfuffle. It is very interesting to note that in recent times, many IT jobs here are being shipped off shore to low cost destinations (recently the big four banks here tried a bit of this action). I predict that this is a beginning and not an end point. This is also much the same thing that happened to manufacturing jobs here in the late 1980’s, early 1990’s. Watch this space, and meanwhile, chop wood and carry water.<br><br>So, no one is at the wheel? This conclusion doesn’t surprise me as you can see that it is becoming increasingly difficult to introduce reforms. The competing voices clamour for their own self-interest and the government of the day has forgotten that they are voted in to make choices between the various vested interests – you can’t please everybody.<br><br>Change is a constant feature of our society and yet, I can still see that complexity is continuing to increase here regardless of the cost or effective return on that level of complexity. I reckon that that visionary you speak of will also need to offer to reduce the overall complexity of society and its institutions too. This will be appealing to the public. This is also in accordance with the theory of catabolic collapse as it ties in nicely.<br><br>Yeah, Australia is in the whole F-35 thing too, up to its eyeballs in fact.<br><br>Still haven’t received the copy of your recent book yet, but I’m hopeful it’ll turn up soon.

With a twist of their rings they can evoke anything - raise mountains, turn the sky pink, loft a castle into the sky forever. Fashion and novelty is all. Boredom is the enemy. Menageries (of curious things and people) and time travel are popular, leading to complications such as a love affair between a married Victorian woman of stiff mettle and our hero (almost inevitably Jheric Carnealien). Meanwhile, the stars in the heavens are going out. Occasionally, an alien arrives reporting that their world is lost, consumed by the encroaching dark - which is spreading fast this way! Hear our warning! Inevitably, they are popped into a menagerie and ignored.<br><br>The dancers dance and play games - and throw a really big party for the dark's arrival. This is the End of Time.<br><br>(subtext - humanity has mastered all physics - but abuse the power. Their children, now eternal citizens - care not one whit of their actions so fritter away 'endless' energy. Hidden machines perform wonders, such as re-arranging the intimacies of reality so the sky can be pink. Vast energies are spent on whims - so Humanity burns up the Universe. The dark is a consequence; this is humanities doing.)<br><br>The Sundered Worlds / The Blood Red Game (SF, c. 1964)<br><br>In another future, a space-faring humanity exhausts the Universe's resources and seek to flee - into the parallel dimensions of the multiverse! Here, they may find realities without life, but with resources ready to be plundered!<br><br>Unfortunately, species from other parallel universes have the same idea. War breaks out between realities, fought by fleets of ships, slipping sideways through parallel spacetime. Evasion is easy, winning is hard. Outside physical reach, psychokinetic battles are fought. Each ship is now filled with long corridors of "slumbering" psychic warriors. All is quiet (occasionally a head bursts. This is the Blood Red game).<br><br>// I am not doing justice to MM's ability to spin a tale, even so the sweep of his stories comes through<br><br>MM does Fantasy - the adventures of Elric of Melneborne and more (complete with excellent titles like 'The Jewel in the Skull', 'The Mad God's Amulet')<br><br>One story stands out (the title of which I have lost).

Where is the need, the urgency to be called back? The humans assert the aliens are evil oppressors. They see complex plots and conspiracies against them, and blame unfortunate events on the aliens. Elric joins and begins the slaughter of the alien.<br><br>However Elric is tired of being the Eternal Champion, never allowed to fully rest in piece - further, he is troubled by the docile nature of the 'evil enemy'. A crisis - and in revelation Elric sees humans as cruel, bigoted and deeply racist - the worst of their kind. If anything the aliens are the best of humanity! He must change sides!<br><br>The Champion now fights for the aliens and leads them to a complete eradication of humanity, down to the last babe.

Cities and counties all over the United States, for example, are being driven into bankruptcy by the cost of public-sector salaries and benefits that politically influential unions have extracted from vulnerable or compliant local politicians.</i><br><br>Well, this ties directly into Wisconsin's hyper-contentious recall election, so of course, I have something to say about it. (You knew I would, right?) The answer to the problem you've outlined is not, as Governor Scott Walker and his supporters would have us believe, entirely quashing the power of public-sector unions. In fact, Walker's tax-giveaways to big corporations threaten the state's fiscal solvency as much as too much public-sector privelege does. And let us not forget that Walker's agenda has left Wisconsin dead last in new jobs created for the previous year.<br><br>However, I would point out that the public sector in Wisconsin is starting to recognize (as if they had a choice!) that it will have to give up some things, evidenced by the fact that they have stated their intention to accept Walker's severe cuts in their pay and benefits though not Walker's goal of ending union collective-bargaining power. However, the unions still have a way to go in fully accepting this new reality, demonstrated by the fact that they supported Kathleen Falk, somebody who would have automatically given the unions everything they wanted, over the more likely to win Milwaukee mayor Tom Barrett, in the recent primary to determine who will run against Walker in June. <br><br>Barrett recognizes that it's just as unhealthy to give the unions everything they want as it is to give the owning-class everything it wants. I fear Falk would have been the left-wing antithesis of Scott Walker (both were certainly not averse to taking out-of-state big money), and the voters of Wisconsin would have given her a resounding <b>thumbs down</b> for that come June. As it is with Barrett's victory this week, it's going to be a squeaker if the recall side wins. And even that might not be enough if the Republicans engage in their characteristic lie-cheat-steal methodology to capture close elections and the Democratic Party heirarchy once again just sits on its collective hands and plays dumb. In which case, I peronsally will be done with the two-party system and elections forever.<br><br>One more thing. I do have a feeling that if the US and Israel are foolish enough to attack Iran, the Iranians are going to take the bloated military-industrial complexes of both countries to school in a pretty major way. And if Iran were to be completely smashed, it will be more because Israel is such a formidable little war-machine of a country than because of our decaying global empire.<br><br><a href=#c4842392571546629462 title="comment permalink">5/10/12, 6:16 AM</a><br><br>

There is certainly wealth concentration, and wealth can provide power. But wealth is not power, and the things that count as wealth can evaporate quickly – this is especially true right now. What we have is a lot of different sources of wealth and power pulling the present system apart, while the system itself is weak.

So the following is a bit out of place within the context of this post. Apologies.<br><br>The idea that empire creates a wealth gradient that leads to the breakdown of an empire's wealth pump mechanism by way of wealth entropy is most interesting. I'd like to take the concept a bit farther down the line. Money is an abstraction of wealth, meaning that the value of the natural resources, goods and services in the real world are the real sources of wealth, money is an abstraction of that wealth and is used for our means of commerce. Wealth can be further generalized as energy, matter and energy applied to matter. The application of entropy to human disequilibriums of wealth, or energy, as fundamental to understanding empires and why they break down makes sense. However, entropy may also be generalized into a rough explanation for why civilizations break down. An ecology is a system of processing and harvesting energy, what we harvest from this system, we call wealth. The health or sustainability of an ecology is directly related to the diversity of species taking part in its energy stream. The plant absorbs the sun, the bug eats the leaves of the plant, the bird the bug, another bird that bug, the worm the dead bird, and so on it goes until the human chops down the tree and builds a house. As empire is a wealth pump among humans, human civilization is an energy/wealth pump among species. The pattern of relationships recurses. Civilization is a way for humans to crowd out other species from participating in an ecological energy stream so the humans can multiply and utilize a greater share of the ecological wealth stream for human endeavors. <br><br>The human population has seen an exponential growth curve in the previous century coinciding with a massive die off of many other species. We are crowding out virtually every other species except the ones we have domesticated or that live off our largesse. The problem with the energy pump of civilization is that an ecology becomes brittle as it loses diversity, and once broken, does not recover easily. The terrible state of top soil all over the world as a result of industrial agriculture, which has been a means for humans to claim virtually all of the energy stream for themselves wherever they grow crops, but has left a million deserts waiting to bloom without the inputs of fertilizers (Hello, Cherokee Organics). Perhaps civilizations collapse when the energy pump has created an disequilibrium among species that can no longer be maintained. <br><br>To maintain the current disequilibrium, we are investigating ways to harvest tidal and wind energy, which will require a huge material and energy investment to manufacture the equipment, maintain it, and lay new lines to pipe it to people. I await the proposed scheme to harvest the massive plumes of methane gas being released in the arctic water. A sobering thought, the current iteration of civilization is global, and the civilized possess the means and will to pump every ecology that can be pumped so long as they have fossil fuels. The heart of civilization is a desert and the body may one day be too. <br><br>I suspect JMG's response would be that Gaia is more resilient than I think, but even factoring in ecological resiliency, it could be an ugly come down. A more optimistic thought, humans may evolve their interspecies wealth pump so that they are availing themselves of the energy stream, but not blocking it or causing turbulence. Surfing is a way to avail ourselves of the stream without disruption, massive tidal energy pumps that suck energy out of the waves for electric energy, causing unforeseen disruptions to the movement of sand and the ecology of critters and birds near shore, is an example of the kind of thing we are trying to do now.<br><br><a href=#c4694107536909648423 title="comment permalink">5/10/12, 6:40 AM</a><br><br>

There may be solutions (or more likely adaptations and ameliorations) to some of this, but every single one explodes the status quo.

Your description of the current state of our political-economy reminded me a lot of Sheldon Wolin's description in Democracy Incorporated. <br><br>His definitions of managed democracy and inverted totalitarianism fit nicely with some of your descriptions in this post. <br><br>The good cop-bad cop routine b/w the two parties that co-ops and controls 'captive constituencies' is spot on managed democracy. At first blush the system seems legit, but as you mentioned, it is indeed a scam.<br><br>The inverted totalitarian aspect seems to tie in with your descriptions of power centers with only veto power and a "political system [that] is lurching forward like a driverless car along a trajectory set by the outdated policies of an earlier time...". <br><br>No one is exactly in total control, but those power centers (corporate welfare queens, Chinese lobby, AIPAC, et al) that benefit from those old outdated policies ruthlessly defend them. They thwart any challenge to those policies through any means available to them. Mainly tools such as campaign contributions, PR campaigns, funding junk science and the like. IMO, these tools are primarily defensive. They buy time for the power centers. For example: big oil's expenditures on these tools to delay real action on climate change. <br><br>I am curious if you have read Wolin's book, Democracy Inc.?<br><br><a href=#c2297853524827398793 title="comment permalink">5/10/12, 6:54 AM</a><br><br>

However, people took the situation seriously and worked on preventative measures well beforehand. Perhaps a key reason why various interests considered Y2K worthy of a response is that computer clocks to be set forward and outcomes examined. In other words, Y2K could be tested beforehand. The large response to the problem may have prevented much more serious outcomes. Predicaments such as Peak Oil do not lend themselves so easily to this kind of examination.<br><br>Nevertheless, it is not unimaginable that the Y2K response contributed to the serious economic crisis that resulted shortly afterward: The dot-com bust. For example, with so much new equipment bought by businesses and other entities in 1998 and 1999 for Y2K mitigation, demand for computers slumped in 2000, causing problems for the high-tech industry.

A radical promotes a wholesale and NOVEL change in the structure of government and its relationship to society.

This is nicely done indeed. Whether it be through laws that require women to undergo probing medical procedures to obtain an abortion or Obama’s statement in support of gay marriage, it seems as though all of the stops are being pulled out in this election cycle to reign in the left and right wing bases on issues that become futile once the election cycle is over. With the candidates acting as the ringleaders, the clowns that serve as political pundits and the media will rehash debates about social issues that have been ongoing for decades in a foolish game of charades that will undoubtedly get some of these constituencies fired up and ready for the polls. It is what happens after the election that is most interesting. <br><br>I remember hearing from numerous friends about how Bush would try to overturn Roe v. Wade when he came into power. After all, they argued, the Bible Belt was a major force behind his election campaign. When he focused instead on economic and foreign policy matters these same friends didn’t know how to react. Likewise, friends who are friendly towards the 2nd amendment chanted about how Obama was going to take everyone’s guns away. Again, when it didn’t happen, they really didn’t know how to explain it. <br><br>The media, the parties, and the pundits create these unicorns, bugbears and hobgoblins, fantastical creatures to be sure, but that is entirely the point. The captive constituencies latch onto the threat, or the promise, propagate it via social media, the base gets fired up, and they then head to the polls. <br><br>In the end the unicorns and goblins fail to materialize, that is until of course they are needed in the next election season at which point they are revived in their full glory and the spin cycle repeats again. <br><br>What amazes me is how people from all walks of life, regardless of socioeconomic standing, educational level, ethnic group, or spiritual orientation fall into this trap time and again. For many, it results in electing someone to office that may not necessarily have their best interests in mind. For others, each election cycle is like a rehashing of the realities of post-WWII electoral American politics. No one truly gets even a fraction of what they want and regardless of all the pomp and circumstance, the American president remains more of a regent, a figurehead of sorts, whose sole responsibility is safeguarding the whole mess from imploding. <br><br>That is why environmentalists are up in arms about what they perceive as Obama’s failure to deliver on environmental unicorns, and it is also why the Tea Party continues to rail against the bugbear of national debt that many in their ranks happily helped create. The political headwinds and tailwinds are way too strong at this point to accomplish anything meaningful so the only thing that occurs is blame and of course more incantations about the evils of the other side.<br><br><a href=#c3229624121586876883 title="comment permalink">5/10/12, 11:29 AM</a><br><br>

The kind of money we might be said to have siphoned off the government-- the effect that that money had and has, individually, socially, and economically-- is simply not equivalent to government subsidies to banks and corporations. <br><br>Furthermore, in response to Justin: Chomsky is wrong about what a new new deal would mean, because in all of his writing he has never addressed the issue of energy depletion. That said, something like a New Deal, paid for by cuts in military spending, could actually help right now. I've seen this work. I worked in a rural area (Douglas County, Oregon) during the first round of Obama stimulus. The alternative high school I worked at applied for a grant and got it. We used the money to create a quarter-acre organic garden which is now producing 8,000 pounds of food for the local food banks and to employ local youth in a conservation program, which included providing "free" labor (paid for by us via Uncle Sam) to local organic farmers. <br><br>The point is, the stimulus made a real difference, both in the old-fashioned economic sense of getting people jobs and spending money, and in the new sense of helping create a sustainable local food supply that will help that area survive the decades to come. A larger federal investment could make an even bigger difference (and would, of course, have made *the* difference as the response to the economic crisis of the 1970s, rather than the Reaganist austerity and military Keynsianism that we actually got). It's probably never going to happen. My point is that just because both parties are thoroughly corrupt and basically Reaganist in outlook, and similar narratives dominate the discourse on both left and right, doesn't mean that the policy-ideas coming from left and right are equivalent.<br><br>I apologize if this was rambling or off-topic.<br><br><a href=#c5771108744530639672 title="comment permalink">5/10/12, 11:44 AM</a><br><br>

This issue is utterly off-topic here, which is a deliberate choice for illustrative purposes:<br><br>Obama's latest "radical move" (supporting same-sex marriage) represents his adopting a policy that is supported by a 60%+ majority of the American electorate. This is at best a modest "reform" position, representing a very small tweak to existing marriage laws. The other "extreme," such as what NC voters just passed, is only a small reactionary step to codify into law what was the de facto popular understanding of marriage just a few decades ago. <br><br>Here's a radical proposal about the same topic: Abolish all government recognition of and involvement with marriage. If it is a "sacred" institution, then why is it the government's business at all? Children have parents, biological or adoptive, the law can recognize this and duly grant parental rights and responsibilities. Inheritance, financial matters between partners, etc. can be arranged through existing legal systems (wills, partnerships, joint tenancy, etc.).<br><br>How often have you heard ANYONE in the media being allowed to advance that proposal? <br><br>Now try to envision equally radical positions to take on other issues and institutions more directly relevant to the core topics of this blog.

That mentality is the institutionalised pursuit of wealth and power before anything else. Of course sometimes, one factions pursuit of these goals come into conflict with that of another faction and we see some Elite infighting. <br><br>I tend to think of it as an illegal prizefight in which the participants and those involved in watching or betting etc, will be trying to crush the opposition, but will all close ranks to prevent exposure of the game to the outside world. That's because they see the public as a greater enemy than each other.<br><br>Because the agenda of these interests all flows in the same direction - that of a rapacious pursuit of ever more control by similar or allied corporate interests - it can easily appear as though a small number of individuals are running things because it is so systemic and consistent.<br><br>A remarkably small number of Corporations and Banks control the world's resources and finances, but they're very often occupied with trying to eat each other, before turning on the rest of us for dessert. Still, the end result is largely the same - an ever smaller core of increasingly wealthy interests emerging. <br><br>As for Iran, the reason that they are being threatened is because control of the country is part of a long standing plan for the region by the US Military and Political Elite. The US has never forgiven the Iranians for having the audacity to overthrow a US client dictator and then maintain their independence, despite US overtures at the time. It is this, plus the factors of Oil and Petrodollar hegemony, which are attracting the ire of the US and Israel, and not the smokescreen of Iran's nonexistent nuclear weapons program, which is as vapourous as Iraqi WMD. <br><br>Of course, the reason why Iran isn't actually being attacked right now, (and probably won't be), is because both Russia and China have made it clear to the White House that they won't allow it. This and the fact that many other influential countries such as India have made it unequivocally clear that Iranian oil is far too vital to their economies to be taken off the market as the result of a military strike. Hence the prolifera of sabre rattling, but little actual action. <br><br>Right now, Iran is emerging as a major regional power, and all the signs, are that the US is having to accept this. Of course neither Russia nor China will want an overly influential and powerful Iran, and this will be a factor in the ongoing balancing act of 'negotiations' playing out, where completely different discussions to those being reported in the media will actually be taking place as all parties involved do their best to save face. <br><br>Syria can also be factored into this Geopolitical theatre, as a staunch ally of Iran and with connections to Russia and China. It's the reason we haven't seen a 'no fly zone' and 'humanitarian intervention' to support the US/NATO backed terrorist groups currently fighting the Syrian government and causing absolute chaos, in the way we did in Libya.<br><br>It's interesting watching these international crises play out, and then applying a similar framework to what might be happening with the various factions domestically.<br><br><a href=#c5467111732007267326 title="comment permalink">5/10/12, 1:01 PM</a><br><br>

The first problem was addressed after about 10 years of sometimes intense work and dedicated, if not plodding, boring engineering. <br><br>The second, like all cultural narratives, was not there to be resolved successfully at all. It was there to tell a morality tale, this one in the ‘chicken little’ genre. Like the Unsinkable Titanic (a claim never made by White Star, incidentally), adrenaline pumping folk tales of Computer Little’s and latter day doom did not come from the ones busily fixing the problem. I believe Mr. Kunstler did a lot of end of the world predicting set on that stage. Come to think of it, both Y2K: Apocalypse Edition and The Unsinkable Titanic for Fun, Profit and Hubris, came from the same source: The media.<br><br>Then, when there was no Mad Max: Beyond Computerdome on 1/1/1900, er, 2000, people were angry at the IT professionals for ‘misleading’ them.

Yes, there are corrupt unions, but the unions in question here are not corrupt, and not even one quarter as black-hearted as they corporate fat-cats; they just have to learn to see a bigger picture and recognize that everybody will have to give things up in an age of contraction and decline. That so many people who support the unions are as reluctant as anybody else to realize the difficulties that lie ahead for our society, is the thing that concerns me the most right now. Failure to recognize this crucial truth would play right into the hands of the plutocrats who would use society's coming tribulations to consolidate their power to the maximum degree.

I'd point out cities in China and southern France, to name only two examples, that have been going concerns for three thousand years and haven't produced a desert -- I'd also point out the role of non-anthropogenic climate change in creating the deserts of the Middle East, which tends to get neglected in current critiques of civilization in the abstract. Still, industrialism is by definition part of a wealth pump -- it can't function outside of that context -- and only the self-terminating nature of a system dependent on nonrenewable resources will keep it from making a much bigger mess of things than it has already. <br><br>Andy, not until the status quo implodes, as it will.

Anthropogenic climate change began many millennia ago, probably with the taming of fire and the advent of controlled burning to manage landscapes for forage and hunting. It certainly accelerated with the spread of agriculture. Human activities were affecting climate patterns long before we began burning fossil fuels. An interestinh relatively recent school of thought has European contact with the New World triggering a massive increase in carbon sequestration (depopulation via diseases caused an end to large-scale agriculture and controlled burns, hence more carbon in biomass and soils). At the same time in Europe the Black Death reemerged and resulted in depopulation and reforestation there as well. The resulting lowered atmospheric CO2 (shown in Antarctic ice cores) may have contributed to (at least helped lengthen and intensify) the Little Ice Age. There are links to original sources about this stuff on the wikipedia page for the Little Ice Age. I would not be at all surprised if the desertification of the Middle East was actually in part due to the spread of agriculture and human population across the region.<br><br><a href=#c3134530055929380942 title="comment permalink">5/10/12, 9:05 PM</a><br><br>

That's not inappropriate, because -- for reasons we'll be discussing -- they're almost certain to get one in a big way within the next decade or so. Civil liberties are among the first casualties of any effective counterinsurgency campaign, and a very large number of the preparations being made very clearly have that in mind.

Crises come along and act as a solvent on the gridlock, opening up space for some new leader/set of ideas to take charge. We seem to have been lucky in this country with the generally reasonable quality of the new leaders and ideas (Founders, Lincoln, Roosevelt, etc). I hope we are similarly lucky with whatever comes next. My sense is that the current gridlock jockeys still have a ways to run, though, before they throw up their hands and admit defeat and create that opening. There does seem to be a lot of confidence around that all of this can be managed and muddled through. We’ll see. <br><br>Meanwhile, it’s a little strange to see apparently intelligent people who, on the one hand, seem to have at least some sense of our predicament, offering really bone-headed ideas and slogans in response. For example, the five-elite-families-are-keeping-us-from-the-energy-donut nonsense of Thrive; the end-Fed-restore-the-gold-standard trope; or even just standard issue elect-President-X-all-will-be-well stuff. Nuts really, but I suppose we like our solutions simple. I’m just resigned to waiting for the wave to crest, while doing something useful and hoping that I can survive in some sentient form. We’ll see again.<br><br>On a separate note I’m reading Mystery Teachings From The Living Earth at the moment. A lovely book, and thank you for it. I’m particularly enjoying the Law of Limits.

Also, players could belong to like-minded groups and they could be eliminated from the game (die) or spawn new members of the group (reproduce.) I wanted to make the game more ‘real life.’ I also created a new strategy that I called Honor among Thieves (I originally wanted to call it ‘Gypsy’ but my advisor thought it was politically incorrect. East coast public schools, you know.) My Gypsies, er, Thieves always cooperated with others of their group and always cheated outsiders (hence the political incorrectness.)

Information systems are very expensive. They don’t help companies save money, but they can help them do much more with the money they spend.

They didn’t realize that 60 percent of the US’s GDP comes from companies that employ fewer than 150 employees. These companies couldn’t afford million dollar, water cooled mainframes, but they sure could benefit from a lot of $5,000.00 PCs and some rudimentary, though poorly written, spreadsheets and accounting software.

That was the central point of the argument.<br><br>Ironically, aren't wealth pumps what we are discussing here recently?<br><br>The defensive tone of some commenters is really a reflection of the earlier Y2K arguments spouted by the IT industry and its PR machine. Isn't this the basis of an incantation?<br><br>Computers are a fairly recent innovation and they do allow us to process large volumes of data. Widespread use of computers is even more recent than this. However, government, business and people got by pretty well before them and will so again after they fall off the radar.<br><br>I don't believe our host is always correct because to err is to be human, but shouldn't we try to learn and peek through the fog that is thrown up in front of us all?<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c8431875026916623961 title="comment permalink">5/15/12, 4:28 PM</a><br><br>

I always try to relate this to the UK where I live - it doesn't differ much I think.<br><br>We've been stuck with two identikit main parties; Conservative and Labour for years - they like to pretend they are different but they don't differ much in reality.<br><br>The image is that the Conservatives cut taxes and Labour spends but before the general election they proposed pretty similar cuts with Labours cuts being about 6 months later.<br><br>I suspect the UK government is less constrained than the US since some unpopular NHS (National Health Service) reforms and cuts to benefits have been forced through even with objections from the Lords. The NHS reforms weren't even in the manifesto and are extremely unpopular.<br><br>However, the Liberal Democrats/Conservative coalition has made the Lib Dems vote collapse. So much so that the Green Party is readying to take them on directly and their only MP Caroline Lucas has just resigned as party chairman in a clever move to give the Greens more media attention. Their policies on the economy, banking reform and social issues should be good for most people. May be this might be the start of something.<br><br><a href=#c1227334698357461434 title="comment permalink">5/16/12, 3:15 AM</a><br><br>

I personally had little worry about it because of an incident that happened to us in early January 1997. We took a dog in for her 3-year rabies vaccination on January 2, 1997, and they discovered that their computer would not accept January 2, 2000 as the expiration date. Next time we went back to that vet they had upgraded their computer -- three years before Y2K itself. Banks had been dealing with post Y2K dates since 1970, given their 30-year mortgage schedules. Hardly any computer system fails to look ahead, meaning that all the Y2K bug glitches were tripped and fixed gradually over the months, years, and decades leading up to it. It is not like it was possible for it to suddenly strike the global computing system without warning literally overnight. And, yes, those who were proclaiming doom should have known this.<br><br><a href=#c474571902435293992 title="comment permalink">5/16/12, 6:41 AM</a><br><br>

It's pretty astounding to read the talk of papist and masonic conspiracies, things that would surely have unfolded if true and are proven bunk by their absence. <br><br>I grew up at the tail end of the Cold War and got a bellyful of communist conspiracy talk. As a credulous kid, I was completely take in by every claim. I was only disabused of this kind of thinking by witnessing the fall of the USSR. Unless it was some kind of rope-a-dope, the commies were done-for and history had spoken. The conspiracy buffs were full of BS. <br><br>I think that humans are pattern recognition engines and so we find it easy to see things that aren't there. And we also tend to hate a mystery. We prefer a good story to "I don't know." Explains mythology, explains religion, explains why we like simple and convincing explanations that might not be true. <br><br>My problem with grand conspiracies is humans just aren't that crafty. All the good conspiracies get found out eventually. Couple of guys conspiring to commit a crime? Plausible conspiracy. Gunpowder plot to blow up Parliament? Plausible conspiracy. Rich colonial landowners rebelling against the mother country? Plausible conspiracy. THEM controlling everything? Not so much. <br><br>Polluters don't pollute because they want to dirty the environment, they do so because it's cheaper than doing the right thing. Poachers don't kill rare animals for the joy of being jerks, it's short-term self-interest. <br><br>The general crap-storm this country is facing looks like an orchestrated conspiracy but I tend to believe it's the natural result of lots of self-interested parties looking out for Number One and the net result is that things are ruined for everyone. It's no more top-down and directed than the poor luck of a farmer who finds drought followed by locusts followed by a plague that carries away his family. It's all rotten luck but the gods haven't turned against him. He may find it more comforting to think it's for a reason, even a bad one, than to see it as random chance in a cold, uncaring universe.<br><br><a href=#c1850500100967434199 title="comment permalink">5/16/12, 10:47 AM</a><br><br>
