<div class=MsoNormal>
I think most of my regular readers are aware that I spent last weekend at a peak oil event. There have been plenty of those over the last decade or so, but this one, <a href=http://ageoflimits.org/ >The Age of Limits</a>, was a bit unusual: it started from from the place where most other peak oil events stop, with the recognition that the decline and fall of industrial civilization is the defining fact of our time.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s ironic, to use no stronger term, that this should be the point at which so much discussion of peak oil stops, because it’s also the place where that conversation began some fifteen years ago, at the very dawn of today’s peak oil movement. Back then, as conversations about the limits to growth were getting started again for the first time since the twilight of the 1970s, most participants in those early discussions seem to have grasped that the industrial world would either rise to the challenge of peak oil and undergo the wrenching process of shortage and reallocation that a successful downshift of energy consumption would demand, or plow face first into the brick wall of resource limits and crash to ruin. The debates then were over which of these would be chosen.  At this point it’s painfully clear which way the decision has gone, but the discourse of peak oil by and large remains the same. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If you go to most peak oil events, as a result, you can count on a flurry of panels and lectures pointing out the reasons why our civilization’s attempt to extract limitless resources out of a finite planet won’t work, can’t work, and isn’t working. Depending on the event, you will also get either a flurry of panels and lectures talking about how to make buckets of money profiteering off the inevitable failure of that attempt, or a flurry of panels and lectures bickering about who’s to blame for the inevitable failure of that attempt, or a flurry of panels and lectures airily insisting that the inevitable failure of that attempt isn’t inevitable at all so long as we all have faith in whatever the fashionable alternative energy du jour or the equally fashionable movement du jour happens to be. (You might also get two or three of these at once, in which case the effect is even more schizoid than usual.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What you won’t get is any serious discussion about what can be expected to happen on the downside of Hubbert’s curve, and how individuals, families and communities might be able to respond to that. At most, you might be lucky enough to find a late night discussion among three or four presenters and a dozen attendees at the hotel bar, sitting there with drinks in hand and talking about the uncomfortable and unfashionable realities that the event organizers have carefully excluded from the agenda. It was those late night discussions that provided part of the inspiration for The Age of Limits conference. What would happen, several of us wondered, if the themes central to those discussions were brought out of exile and put at the center of a collective conversation? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s more or less what The Age of Limits set out to do. How did it work?  By and large, remarkably well. Even on a quantitative level, it exceeded expectations; the organizers set their sights sensibly low, aiming for sixty attendees this first year, and kept publicity at an accordingly modest level. In the event, though, more than twice that number showed up, and launched a rolling conversation about decline, resilience, and survival that filled two full days and parts of two others.  The practical side of the conference ran smoothly, despite a couple of impressive spring thunderstorms, and the quality of the discussions was generally high; for me, certainly, it was a relief not to have to deal with more of the usual fearful insistence that X or Y or Z will let the current possessors of middle class privilege cling to their comfortable lifestyles, and to have the chance to talk instead about how those lifestyles are going to go away and what might be done to deal constructively with their departure. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thinking back over the weekend, three points of crucial relevance for the project of this blog stand out. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first and most basic is precisely the number of people who are ready to grapple with the end of industrial civilization: not as an abstract possibility to be shoved off on a conveniently distant future, not as an inkblot pattern on which to project one’s favorite apocalyptic fantasies, not as a bogeyman that can be used to stampede recruits into signing up for the greater glory of some movement or other, but as a simple and inescapable fact that is already shaping our lives.  Down the years since I first started trying to talk to other people about where our civilization is headed, that last attitude has been far and away the least common, and the frantic writhings with which so many people squirm away from thinking about that unthinkable reality have become wearily familiar. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the repeated pleasures of peak oil events is precisely that those of us who take that recognition seriously have the chance to share a meal or a couple of mugs of beer and talk openly about all the things you can’t discuss usefully with those who are still in the squirming stage. I mentioned in <a href=../../2011/11/gathering-of-tribe.html>a post last fall</a> the way that peak oil events function as a gathering of the tribe, but it would be more precise to call it a gathering of several tribes—the peak oil investment tribe, the environmental activism tribe, the alternative energy tribe, and so on.  It’s one of the oddities of the tribe to which I belong that it’s hard to give it a simple, straightforward name of that kind, just a clear sense of the trajectory our age is tracing out against the background of deep time, and it’s one of the less heavily represented tribes at most peak oil events. What set The Age of Limits apart is that it was specifically for this latter tribe, and the enthusiastic turnout in response to very muted publicity—little more than a few posts on blogs—shows me that the audience for such discussions is a good deal larger than I had any reason to think. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second point that stands out is the extent to which people in that tribe—and, I suspect, across a broader spectrum of society as well—are hungry for meaningful discussions of one of the taboo topics of our age, the relation of spirituality to the shape of our future. That hunger came as a surprise to our hosts; Orren Whiddon, the founder and general factotum of the retreat center where the conference took place, responded with noticeable discomfort to my proposal to give a talk on peak oil and spirituality, and his mood was not improved when two of the other speakers, Carolyn Baker and Dmitry Orlov, wanted to address the same topic.  Still, all three talks went forward; I talked about the lessons that traditional spiritualities offer for understanding our predicament, Dmitry discussed religion as a mode of social organization that can sustain itself for millennia, and Carolyn explored collapse as an initiatory experience—and all three talks drew large and enthusiastic audiences. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s among the major failures of contemporary Western culture that the keepers of its religious traditions have so signally failed to deal with the core issues of our time.  There’s a history behind that failure, of course.  In what used to be the religious mainstream, well-meaning but clueless attempts to become relevant in the 1960s and 1970s led clergy  to replace authentic spirituality with a new definition of religious institutions as some sort of awkward hybrid of amateur social service agencies and moral lobbying firms, deriving their values from the contemporary nonreligious left rather than from any coherent sense of their own traditional spiritual commitments. Since the vast majority of Americans then and now are on the moderate-to-conservative end of the political spectrum, and have next to no patience with the liberal ideologies that drove this shift, the formerly mainstream denominations ended up with a fraction of their old membership and influence as parishioners abandoned them in droves for more conservative churches and synagogues. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those latter, meanwhile, had just completed the same transformation in the other direction, surrendering their own  traditional commitments in order to embrace the political ideologies of the contemporary right. This is why so many of today’s supposedly conservative clergy are out there right now urging their congregations to vote for a Republican party whose platform could not be further from the explicit teachings of Jesus if somebody had set out to do that on purpose. Very few American religious groups have avoided falling into one or the other of these pitfalls. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That has had any number of unhelpful consequences, but the one relevant here is that either choice makes it effectively impossible for those who speak for religious institutions to say anything at all about the reality of our nation’s and civilization’s decline.  The denominations of theold mainstream are committed to what, without too much satire, could be described as the belief that everyone in the world deserves a middle class American lifestyle; those of the new conservative religiosity are just as rigidly committed to the claim that middle class Americans deserve, and ought to be able to keep, that lifestyle. Neither can begin to address the hard fact that this lifestyle and nearly everything associated with it are going away forever. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the vacuum into which Carolyn, Dmitry and I ventured over this weekend. For two of us, it wasn’t a first venture by any means; Carolyn has been discussing the spiritual dimensions of collapse for years now, on her website and in several worthwhile books; as for me, after some years of uneasy avoidance and sidelong references, I let myself be lured into discussing the interface between my own far from mainstream spirituality and the realities of the age of peak oil, and that discussion ended up turning into <a href=http://www.scarletimprint.com/bloodoftheearth.html>a book of its own</a>. For all I know, Dmitry has been working on his own take on religion and peak oil for longer still, but it was a surprise to me, just as I noted with interest that <a href=http://kunstler.com/blog/2012/05/ponzis-end.html>Jim Kunstler’s latest post</a> includes an uneasy discussion of the potential role of emerging minority religions (that’s spelled "cults" in today’s standard English, which Jim uses) in reinventing a coherent society in the wake of our decline and fall. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There is a good deal more that can be said about the religious dimensions of peak oil, and a familiar sinking feeling tells me that I’m probably going to be saying some of it, once the current sequence of posts on the fate of American empire has been completed. My readers outside North America—particularly in Europe, where religion by and large plays a negligible role in public life—may be puzzled by that focus, but there it is; when European countries encouraged their religious minorities to cross the Atlantic, as a good many of them did in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, they pretty much guaranteed that North America would have a much livelier religious history from then on than they would. Religion is a major organizing force in American public life; each of the great shifts in American politics and society have been paralleled, and often preceded, by a corresponding shift in the religious sphere; that pattern is highly unlikely to be broken by the traumatic redefinitions of American public life looming up ahead in the near future, and there are good reasons to think that the religious shift this time around is going to be on the grand scale. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So that’s the second point that struck me this weekend. The third was subtler.  It didn’t get any space on the agenda, and rarely had a central role in the conversations, but it kept on popping up here and there in casual talk. One woman, for example, noted that the farm families in her area, conservative down to their bones, watched the bizarre spring weather this year with increasingly nervous faces and suddenly weren’t talking any more about how global warming was a myth; three other people nodded and chimed in with similar stories of their own.  A man commented in passing that people who used to dismiss his efforts toward personal sustainability as a waste of time aren’t doing that any more, and some of them are asking for gardening tips. Quite a few attendees mentioned their sense that more and more people seem to be aware, however vaguely, that the troubles of the present time cut deeper and offer fewer options than those of years and decades past. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Something has gone very wrong.  That’s the message that’s rumbling like distant thunder through the crawlspaces of the American imagination just now.  Something has gone very wrong, and those whose public claim to power is their supposed ability to manage things so that they don’t go wrong—the captains of finance and brokers of political power who move from photo op to press conference to high-level meeting and back again—don’t know how to fix it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I don’t expect that sense to reach anything close to critical mass in the near future—though it will be interesting to note whether this year’s version of the traditional American game of electoral charades,  in which two indistinguishably airbrushed Demublican politicians pretend to be as different as possible until the moment the last voting booths close on Election Day, is able to whip up the same level of canned enthusiasm recent exercises of the same sort have managed. It could well take some years before the loss of faith in the institutions that define contemporary American life grows to the point at which it will become an unavoidable political fact.  For that matter, I have no hard evidence that this is happening at all, just stray bits of conversation heard in passing.  Still, those of my readers who have the opportunity might want to listen for the sound of thunder far off; if I’m right, the storm it’s heralding is going to be a whopper. </div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The comets that lent their inkblot patterns to the apocalyptic frenzies discussed over the last two weeks have, of course, a more recent sibling, Comet Hale-Bopp, which swung through Earth’s skies in 1997. Like Comet Kohoutek and Halley’s Comet, Hale-Bopp attracted predictions of imminent doom, but one of those predictions came unpleasantly true when 39 identically dressed corpses, each with a five dollar bill and three quarters in its pocket, turned up at a posh San Diego mansion. The coroner’s verdict was death by mass suicide. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The backstory begins in the early 1970s, when a minor New Age figure named Marshall Applewhite had an out-of-body experience during a heart attack, and became convinced that he had been chosen for a grand destiny. He and one of the nurses who tended him, Bonnie Lu Nettles, created a belief system composed of equal parts Christianity, New Age thought, UFO beliefs, and science fiction. Under a variety of names—Human Individual Metamorphosis, Total Overcomers, and Heaven’s Gate were among the best known—their group proclaimed that its members would shortly be whisked away from a dying Earth on flying saucers; the fact that this never got around to happening, and repeated dates predicted by Applewhite and Nettles passed without incident, drove away some followers but proved no obstacle to the recruitment of others. After Nettles died in 1985, Applewhite led the group alone. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Enter Comet Hale-Bopp. First discovered by amateur astronomers in 1995, it became a focus of fringe speculation in the autumn of 1995 when a photograph allegedly showing an elongated object hovering behind the comet’s head got into circulation on the internet. Astronomers pointed out that the "object" was a 9th-magnitude star, but this was promptly dismissed by UFO believers, who preferred to trust the claims of psychics who announced that the object was a vast spaceship, and that the comet itself was going to crash into the Earth. When this news reached Applewhite, he announced to his followers that the spaceship had come to pick them up. This time, for reasons nobody living will ever know, he decided to make sure that he and his followers would leave the Earth one way or another. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The method of choice was a cocktail of poisons blended in pudding and washed down with vodka. Applewhite and his followers "discarded their physical containers" in three shifts, with those not yet poisoned tying plastic bags over the heads of those who were already dying. Applewhite and two of his female followers were the last to go; after he downed the pudding, they tied a bag over his head, and then took the poison themselves. Meanwhile, Comet Hale-Bopp went on to finish its loop around the sun and soared off into deep space, and the supposed alien spacecraft was never sighted again. </div>

There is -zero- talk of peak oil at the moment (here in Asia people are optimistic as their standard of living has been going up for the last three decades and this is expected to just keep on going), but I suspect using the same methods they could mobilize much of the population here and in effect -some- of the Chinese diaspora elsewhere in the world to address peak oil. In the Buddhist context especially it could be seen as a virtuous and meritorious endeavor to intentionally take on a lower standard of living. That's how they got everyone to start recycling!<br><br><a href=#c3946443543759636823 title="comment permalink">5/30/12, 10:12 PM</a><br><br>

It was great getting to meet in person you, Dmitry, and a number of others who comment on your blog. Perhaps for me the most disconcerting realization was that I probably would never have met any of those people if not for your blog. Thanks again for helping build this community.<br><br>I did manage to miss all three talks on spirituality. I didn't really want to, but in each case the other session was always something I thought would be more valuable. In part this is because my spiritual beliefs are very solid. As far as I know, there is no formal religious organization based on this, but I have seen the core belief referred to as the "<a href=http://tech.dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/luf-team/message/1951 rel=nofollow>Cosmic Mandate</a>". To the best of my knowledge, I am the only one who has integrated that with Peak Oil. I'm not bragging, I would desperately love to find someone else who believes as I do, that our destiny lies among the stars, and that the current transition is both natural and necessary.<br><br><a href=#c2345228623303000634 title="comment permalink">5/30/12, 11:15 PM</a><br><br>

Like you, I have no hard evidence and this may just be a matter of confirmation bias, but it seems that more and more people are amenable to (though far from enthusiastic about) the idea that "normal" economic growth simply isn't going to resume. Even people who tend to think me a little bit crazy for believing that industrial society is going to come to an end and find it bizarre that I may go live in a yurt while learning to farm still have become much more skeptical in the last few years that things are going to return to normal.<br><br>Sure, I still hear plenty on the left arguing that we just need to invest in alternative energy and plenty on the right claiming that we just need to remove regulation and drill deeper, but I hear quite a number of others--leaning in both political directions--who think that growth is coming to an end. It's a view point I also keep seeing sneak its way into mainstream articles here and there. Peppered in amongst the cheerleading articles about how America's about to become energy independent, of course, but still. It's more than I ever noticed before.<br><br>It gives me a bit of hope, to be honest. There seems to be a small minority of the population who gets it. I'm not sure they even understand why things are shaking out this way, but they seem to have some sense that things are way off track from where our leaders claim they should be and they're not going to get back on track. Again, it's a very small percentage, but I see them and speak with them and teach them in my life, and their interest and enthusiasm gives me a lot of hope. As things continue to fall apart, a good majority of the population is likely to behave very unproductively. But this small minority . . . I think they'll take up the challenge and work to build some coherent and functional communities. It may not be enough, but those bright spots of action are going to be key.<br><br>Again, this might all just be confirmation bias, but I hope it isn't. I take a lot of comfort in the idea that as the hard realities of our future press ever closer, more and more people will recognize those realities and start making the necessary adjustments.<br><br>And on another note, consider me very excited about the possibility of you delving further into the relation between spirituality and peak oil after the current series. I would very much like to read your thoughts on that.<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=#c4683162229179809217 title="comment permalink">5/31/12, 12:25 AM</a><br><br>

I was interested to see what Dmitry's take on religion and spirituality would be since his writings indicate that he is, if nothing else, a most pragmatic and practical fellow. I think that those of us who are watching understand that it will be the cascading failure of individual institutions that will characterize collapse and he pointed out that organized religions have evolved a resilient structure that may insulate them from some of the factors that will cause many of our other social institutions and organizations to fail. Many religions have, after all have been around for centuries, have weathered severe societal upheaval before and are the very model of self-sustainability.<br><br>With regards to "the sound of distant thunder"...years ago I used to joke about the 'Zombie Apocalypse' and got weird looks ...and a few years later it was uncomfortable chuckles, and now it is just common knowledge. I know that every generation since Og the caveman has thought "things are really falling apart these days", but it DOES seem like this time there is a different quality to it. Almost everyone I talk to has the sense that something is seriously wrong. They can't put their finger on exactly what it is, so depending upon their political and social orientation they blame the libruls or the banksters or government or the media, but they almost all agree that we are heading in the wrong direction. ...and if the conversation has gotten that far, that is where it usually ends.<br><br>It WAS refreshing to be a part of a group of people where we didn't have to argue about the actual existence of peak oil, or global climate change or our headlong rush to collapse and could actually begin the conversation where it usually (uncomfortably) trails off.<br><br><a href=#c6789098712118903138 title="comment permalink">5/31/12, 12:30 AM</a><br><br>

Again just had a conversation about this. Why is it that the mainline churches did not pick up all of the youth who have abandoned their evangelical upbringing? Seems logical and self evident.

Is this the acceptance stage of grief? Hope you enjoyed the conference and that much of value was discussed.<br><br>You know, I never really initially wanted to believe you when you wrote about how the low tech movement of the 70's was such a valuable thing and how it fizzled out.<br><br>The latest instalment in my change of heart came surprisingly recently when comparing the standards of texts on herbs between a currently published book with one published in the 1970s.<br><br>It is a fascinating comparison too because the 1970s text is chock full of information across a broad range of subject for each plant such as growing notes, habitats, usages, history etc. On the other hand the currently published book (to remain nameless) had lots of glossy photos and was chock full of warnings - which were of the legal indemnity variety - and also the central theme that you could purchase the herbal extracts.<br><br>Speaking of the age of limits, the ongoing saga here to be powered entirely off the sun is a bit of a struggle. Being one month into the three month difficult solar patch (it is winter here after all), I've now had to crank out the petrol generator for at least 6 hours. Not a bad result and I'm pursuing four further avenues to avoid generator usage over the next two months.<br><br>People dismiss the difficulty of this sort of stuff really should be forced to live with it. They'd sing a different tune for sure as all of these systems require tweaking and maintenance to become self-sufficient. Some of the things I've had to do this week with trees scared me silly...<br><br>On the other hand I've discovered the joys of the vegetable kohl rabi which looks like it was made by a toy manufacturer in China, but tastes really good. Plus I also scored two old and potted olive trees today at a clearance sale. Transporting them home was interesting, at least it wasn’t far...<br><br>Few people mention peak oil over here, but you do start to see mention of the term food security.<br><br>It is also worth mentioning to commenters here (and this is only my personal opinion for what it is worth) that in the past, most people were peasants and just because we can't imagine our educated selves as peasants doesn't mean that the future won't put you into that role. Even those with a recognised craft historically would have had to be involved in producing food. Today, we ignore this truth because we think we are separate from nature, when we are every bit a part of the ecosystem.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c5364530115665107805 title="comment permalink">5/31/12, 3:24 AM</a><br><br>

I kept reading your blog expecting that any time now the spiritual shoe would drop. My own feeling is that unless significant numbers of people choose to engage in processes that lead to deep inner change, we are really screwed. Spiritual traditions throughout history, all over the world have been the creators and custodians of methods to produce these deep changes in one’s understanding of who one is in truth, and why one is here -- leading to enhanced ability to navigate the turbulent waters of unfolding life on earth.<br><br>That these traditions have had serious flaws and inadequacies in getting this alchemy right is an obvious historical fact. But in spite of this, there is much real gold to be found by careful sifters and discriminating minds. Out of all this there could emerge a spirituality better adapted to the modern world and its problems. How this might happen is something I continue to give a lot of thought to. To flesh out my ideas would take some extended space, but for now let me say that an intensive small group process focused on deepening our understanding of the realities we are facing, and a creative exploration of how to transform ourselves into such folks as might be able to envision a new approach to our lives, and effective ways to create and be able to enact real deep solutions to the problem of how to live together and evolve a culture of mutual help and happiness together are essential ingredients for this working. After all, if we cannot come together in small groups of like minded seekers and discover the ways to live in peace and harmony, then where is this crucial knowledge going to come from?<br><br><a href=#c6923380943579432383 title="comment permalink">5/31/12, 5:25 AM</a><br><br>

I should also note my girlfriend is studying history and to date has not been very convinced by my peak oil, resource based arguments and never had the interest to read my books on the subject. The historical based perspective you use to present the subject has really got her thinking though...<br>I've thought a bit about your second point, and like you think the role of religion in the future is a very very big issue, arguably it could shape the outcome of our descent far more significantly than any other issue. The sense I get is that as the decline goes along the mythological narratives chosen by many contemporary strains of christianity are going to come unglued. Does that result in a shakedown and reformation of core christian beliefs or just ultimate fragmentation and disintegration of mainstream christianity. I think the later seems likely. If that is the case then I think we are in for the development of some very interesting spiritualities. I suspect based on what I've seen in fellow friends seeking a religion that makes sense that we will end up with highly syncretic religions that span the spectrum of religions and spiritualities the earth has known.<br><br>Since this is happening in an era of decline and scarcity I also expect that neo-tribal organizational forms will be developed by many of these groups as a pure survival tactic. Perhaps if one group really gets something coherent and organized going there will be room to grow beyond that form, but if not I think much larger group sizes will be very hard to handle.

The results of this still are visible today. Here we have two almost non-overlapping groups of "back to the land" sorts. We have the religious ones; not just the Amish/Mennonite communities, but also conservative seventh-day sabbath groups and others who aspire to a time when men were men and women were in the kitchen. Then you have the greenies, the peakistas, the permaculturists, the CSA farmers, most of whom are secular. Other than sometimes buying each others produce, these groups are almost entirely non-overlapping and non-communicating. Then there are the remains of the 1970s back-to-the-land hippies, many of whom were vaguely spiritual, often a miss-mash of buddhism and Jesus Freak. These folks are primarily aligned with the secular greenies now, a generation on down the line. They don't talk about spirituality very much anymore, and their kids are gone, opting for urban living, jobs, and money. <br><br>I do think that overall the people who are making these sorts of transitions for spiritual reasons are more inclined to simply tend their gardens and commune with their deities, not taking a high-profile activist approach. The activists tend to come from the secular greenie movements, pushing technology and products, increasingly for a price.<br><br><a href=#c5558665144194335970 title="comment permalink">5/31/12, 7:37 AM</a><br><br>

She's mentioned that the pattern of afternoon summer showers that used to be so characteristic of west coastal Florida has been absent for the past several years. She's also noticed that our home state, Michigan, has had a bizarrely warm winter and spring, breaking record highs by large amounts in March. It's also been much warmer than normal here in the St. Louis metro area, to the point where everything perennial is about three weeks ahead of schedule.

I’ve walked away from a couple of religions in my lifetime (the Catholicism of my childhood and Liberal Episcopalianism of my mid-life), because I couldn’t get my mind to agree with the various ideas and concepts. <br><br>My spirituality now is quite far away from having any mental beliefs attached to it – it is more of an inner feeling of peace and connectedness that flows from meditation and stillness. That’s about as conceptual as I can get, and even that may be wrong (the peace I feel may just be my body and brain calming down, rather than any concept like connectedness). But, it works for me, is deeper than any religiously-driven experiences I’ve ever had, and it has saved me in many ways. <br><br>So turning this perspective in the direction of certain US religious leaders, it does seem that their religious/theological beliefs are quite tangled up with other ideas in their heads, like social conservative Republican ideas or feed-the-poor Liberal ideas. You can’t really see the join in some ways. So the certainty they may bring to religious commitment is mental energy they bring to politics ideas or attitudes towards the environment. My own experience has been that the more you can empty your mind of fixed ideas, the more room there is for a natural appreciation of the environment to grow inside you, or for you to be able to entertain such troubling ideas as the end of the current age. But you need to be able to tidy-up and let go of your mental attic first.<br><br><a href=#c2304718759393132832 title="comment permalink">5/31/12, 8:27 AM</a><br><br>

The long boom that took them from an agricultural backwater of barefoot peasantry to a miracle world of Sonic Drive-ins, perpetual air-conditioning, WalMarts, and creation museums is turning back in the other direction and they fear losing all that comfort, convenience, and spectacle. Since they don't understand where it came from, they conclude that it was all a God-given endowment conferred upon them for their exceptional specialness as Americans, and so only the forces of evil could conspire to take it all away."</i><br>In that one paragraph, I suddenly understood American Exceptionalism (British and European Exceptionalism was founded on coal), current political discourse, the fanatical adherence to questionable economic theories taught in universities and business schools.<br>You and he and others I respect have all noted that religious cults, or any pre-organized group like the Masons for example, is going to play a part in helping people cope with difficult times. During the turbulent migration era in Europe, monasteries became repositories of learning and models of organization.<br>I'm sure Amish, Mennonites, &amp;c. will weather the downslide quite well, on the whole, having defined roles and internal organization -- at least for now. People who have embraced hyper-individualism and the fashionable dismissal of religion-as-superstition, however, will either learn to organize in groups or suffer.<br>I'm not sure that religions (cults) will play such a large role in Canada or in Europe, since we actively discourage religion in politics for historical reasons and we have maintained at least some sense of social obligation.

One is as an anthropologist recently researching in the Midwest, I was shocked at how quickly people were accepting the unwelcome reality that their material lives were in decline. And although most people were unhappy about this, and hoped for (though didn't expect) a reversal of fortunes, there is a ready-made cultural narrative that many people were adopting as a means of buffering the psychological blow. Essentially, it is a story about how all the unnecessary consumerism was never that good for us, or happiness-creating. And maybe a bit of decline would have a silver lining. (Note that all I'm pointing out here is a cultural resource that people have to help them process - rather than deny - some of the coming reality.

It’s always interesting and often educational. One thing was left out of this weeks discussion. Most of the conservative Protestants in the US are Evangelical. Among other things this means they believe in the physical return of Christ, followed by a world war to defeat the “armies of Satan,” leading to an eternity in Paradise. At best, peak oil and climate change mean little at all to them because Jesus will save them before it becomes unbearable. In Genesis, God gave mankind “dominion over all the earth.” Therefore, they think it is their priviledge, if not responsibility to exploit the world’s resources. At the extreme end, they believe that using up everything will just bring the Rapture that much sooner. This sounds like blackmailing God to me, but logic and philosophical coherence are not an important part of their faith. <br><br>They will probably go the better part of a generation thinking that Jesus will return any day and taking pleasure in the increasing natural disasters as God smiting the wicked. These were the people who actually believed that God almost destroyed the entire city of New Orleans to punish the homosexuals and prostitutes.<br><br>Politicians in the state of North Carolina recently proposed legislation to make it illegal for any scientist in the state to measure rising sea levels in anyway besides a comparison to historic norms since 1900. They would not be allowed to consider the possibility of exponential increases or cliff hanging events. As one journalist put it, “a category 5 hurricane just off the coast does not exist because the weather has been fine for the past two weeks.” North Carolina depends on coastal tourism for a significant part of its economy so anything that threatens that is a devious lie.

His book, "Debt: the First 5000 Years" cites anthropological and historical evidence to show that this century's commonly held folk wisdom about the origins of money, credit and debt are completely backwards. <br><br>His book is a splendid exposition of how human interaction around the world and in other eras has taken a myriad of forms, values and structures -- that the narrow economic and mercantile lifestyle lived in the developed world today is just one of a seemingly infinite number of cultural arrangements of transaction and exchange, and _not_ the be-all end-all pinnacle of human society which we First World-ers tend to assume we have achieved. That's a fascinating topic in itself -- plenty enough for a whole series of columns -- but it led him in this podcast to make an interesting observation about religion.<br><br>According to his historical analsysis, the epochs and places where commodity currency such as gold coins reaches prominence tend to co-incide with the births of major religions and philosophical movements. He speculates that when people live in a mental sphere where money and economics are hard and tangible, where people are driven by avarice and materialism, then many people tend to want to balance that by turning to a different mental sphere where materialism is trivial, giving and altruism are valued. Conversely, in the many times and places around the world where the currency resembles more like "favors," "gifts," and "debts of honor" than hard numbers, people tend to incorporate morality and spirituality more seamlessly into their daily lives. As opposed to partitioning morality off into a specialty mental sphere, which can be safely ignored in daily transactions. <br><br>Graeber notes that our money system has morphed from one of hard commodities (gold) 60 years ago, into a system of virtual money, technological and intellectual exchange as well as flat-out debasement of the hard currency. This implies -- to me, anyway -- that in the long term, with economic collapse people may gravitate once again towards an appreciation of wealth as nonmonetary pleasure, an appreciation of security and of community and caring. <br><br>Unlike my friend Justin, I am often frightened and depressed about the implications of the fall of our civilization... but what Graeber said there does indeed strike a chord with me and gives me a good deal of hope. I see a lot of people my age and under rejecting, at least mentally, the mercantile values we've been handed. At least, that's what they say over beers. Now if only we could get them all to quit their counterproductive, destructive office jobs <i>en masse</i>...<br><br><a href=#c1487918143069871910 title="comment permalink">5/31/12, 5:30 PM</a><br><br>

I also end up talking with a lot of people. Over the past 3 - 6 months I've begun to notice something: there are a LOT of people who are very quietly lining things up in preparation for a different, and much reduced, way of living. Everything from creating small communities, to learning how to garden, to stocking reasonable amounts of (real) foods.<br><br>When the topic of climate change and peak oil come up, I watch as more and more people seem to relax. "Ah, I can talk about this here." And the conversation ensues. <br><br>It is my sense that there is a very large, very quiet, very committed underground "movement" of people who are preparing for that distant thunder, which they don't see as being all that distant.

That exploration lead me to many of the fringe and lesser known (for a wasp white guy) religions. I ended up being very spiritual but in a personal growth kind of way.<br><br>One book in particular had a profound impact, Serge Kahili Kings' "Urban Shaman". Being a bit of the scientist bent, the fact that wise people, aka shamans, witch doctors, healer, medicine women are common to it seems most if not all cultures seemed tailor made for my personality.<br><br>I recommend that first book to anyone who is more hands on with their spirituality. Though his later works all get a bit too commercial. He opened a website, school, institute, etc after the success of the first book.<br><br>Like JMG's concept of Green Wizards, shamans seem quite suited to help out as the descent progresses and society unwinds.<br><br>BTW, while the Green Wizard's forum is a bit slow right now, with the Spring planting Cathy is doing and Teresa's family health issues, that are keeping them both off site, I am on morning and evening, and offer a big "Come on over to our fire and share a bit of community."<br><br>If you want feed back about a particular project you are stuck on, or just want to what others are doing, please stop by. That way we don't clutter up the comments here.<br><br>(If you have any problems registering, feel free to email me at randomsurfer200 at yahoo.net )<br><br>Myself, I plan on trying my hand at candle making this Summer, but in true Green Wizard style, I am going to see if I can't convert some old DiskTV antenna's on our roof to solar cookers, to heat up and melt my wax. We had a bad hail storm last month, and we're getting a new roof out of the deal so I've asked the roofers to save the one the previous occupant left. Look for my thread on my efforts soon with lots of picture and info.<br><br>Come the Fall I have a couple of thermo-syphon projects I want to try, to help lower my Winter heating bill. <br><br>-----<br><br>Some general points on the comments:<br><br>"With regards to "the sound of distant thunder"...years ago I used to joke about the 'Zombie Apocalypse' and got weird looks ...and a few years later it was uncomfortable chuckles, and now it is just common knowledge."<br><br>The lunch room at work was all a buzz over the recent "zombie attack" making the news. Funny, no one batted an eye when I said, "Yeap, the 'Zombie Apocalypse' is upon us."<br><br>As for weird weather, a few days ago it was 95 degrees, tonight my garden thermometer says 56.

We are left with the older and poorer ones living in small homes of two bedrooms.<br><br>One thing of luck, they are on huge properties. My sister's place while small, could do a garden that is 10 times my size and still not cover a third of it.<br><br>Down side, our last big store, Wal-Mart, has been lured to another nearby sub-urb with tax abatements and give-me's by that town's government. We have what was once the nation's biggest mall, boarded up and 90% vacant down the street. The city has tried three times to get someone, anyone to come in and re-develop it. The latest plan, which seems to have fallen thru, was to bulldozer the thing flat and replace it with something more modern.<br><br>Problem is, when it was close to being closed, there was rampant shoplifting by groups of kids. Merchants left because of the crime not the older structure.<br><br>Now everyone goes to a place miles away where you have to drive to get there, and the over weight security guards ride Segways. <br><br>Our main street thru town is filled with strip malls and commercial buildings mostly empty. Luckily I've managed to cut my driving down and plan my trips to minimize my gas use. I'm too old to take up a bicycle as my primary mode of travel.<br><br>Not to mention, with the street lights turned off, I'll get run over....lol.<br><br>----<br><br>Zack said: "By this analysis, the only major religious institution in America that isn't hopelessly compromised re: the Long Descent is the Catholic Church."<br><br>Not wanting to spark a hot button argument, but the Catholic Church IMO is heads and tails at the front of the pack of organizations advocating the status quo of growth and entitlement.<br><br>As long as they get their tithe of course. If you were to auction off a single percentage of the treasure adorning the Vatican, how many starving people could you feed? <br><br>When 80%+ of Catholics use birth control, yet the leadership goes ballistic over the modest idea that their non-Catholic employees should get that covered in their health care truly shows that the air being breathed up on the top of the Mound is short of oxygen.<br><br>The nuns might be their undoing, since they, unlike the male dominated leadership seem to get it with their focus on helping people.

Where is a good nun with a big ruler when you need her?<br><br>(Pictures the Pope and certain Cardinals getting the knuckle rap...)<br><br>As to which group comes out on top, I've got money on the Buddhists. They have a great historical track record, a good present rep as being focused on the common good, and going forward are enough of a non-American main stream religion that those rejecting what's out there now will spark an interest in those seeking something to cling to as things go south.<br><br>I doubt I'll be around to see it, but I figure every town 100 years from now will have a temple.<br><br>----<br><br>JMG, I look forward to next year's get together. Perhaps we can finally meet.<br><br>Wasn't able to get time off this year, since I just got hired at my new job (after almost 2 years as a temporary worker).<br><br>I do hope to give a lecture at my local sci-fi con in October on peak oil and green wizardry.

I know a lot of Asian countries retain a much deeper involvement in religion. <br><br>John, glad you enjoyed it! As for your religious views, well, if it works for you, by all means; it's very nearly the opposite of my faith, but the rule of dissensus applies here, too. <br><br>Robo, as I commented in <i>The Long Descent</i>, the only way that Druidry is going to become a major religious movement in the decades and centuries ahead is if the existing large movements fail abjectly to come up with any meaningful response to the crisis of our age. Still, that's more of a possibility at this point than I would have guessed four years ago. <br><br>Joel, that's good to hear -- both that you've heard the same things I have, and that you're interested. A good-sized herd of sacred cows is going to have to be roasted over a slow fire when I get to those posts, but that can't be helped. <br><br>Everything, Og the caveman was right, too; he noticed that mammoths were being hunted too heavily, and predicted the arrival of Peak Mammoth. Everyone ignored him until the hunting parties started coming back empty handed, and by then it was too late to avoid some very hungry times. I bet there's a cave somewhere with the Og Curve drawn in red ochre on the wall...<br><br>Miles, in my experience the mainline churches go out of their way to chase off potential members below the age of 40 or so. I don't think they realize that this is what they're doing, but they do it very efficiently. <br><br>Lizzy, that may be part of it, but it's not the whole picture. More on this down the road. <br><br>Phil, nah, we've had a fair amount of informal religious violence but no wars of religion. As for religious advertising, sure -- it's big business these days, and the mere fact that everything authentically religious vanishes once that sort of thaumaturgy gets going is not something most American religious organizations are likely to notice. <br><br>Cherokee, I've seen that difference between Seventies books and their modern equivalents over and over again. As for kohlrabi, very tasty stuff! Glad to hear that you've discovered it. <br><br>Sixbears, not surprised to hear that actual conservatives find the pseudoconservative cant coming out of so many of today's seminaries unappealing. I can only hope that the pastor in question loses his job in the near future.<br><br><a href=#c5565147153850184644 title="comment permalink">5/31/12, 9:10 PM</a><br><br>

In my experience, though, the insights that transform on the deepest level are at least as likely to be found in solitude as in a group setting. <br><br>Justin, exactly; "plus ça change, plus la meme chose."<br><br>ChemEng, a definite data point. <br><br>William, I read it differently. I see the latest flurry of wildly unconstitutional security laws as an admission of failure and a betrayal of blind panic. You're right that they hear the distant thunder, but it's not a quest for total control so much as a frantic search for something to stave off total defeat. <br><br>Bill, that's good news. Not at all surprising -- there are still some old Seventies-era solar water heater panels on roofs here in Cumberland, apparently still very much in use -- but good to hear. <br><br>Twilight, maybe so. I'm guessing it'll be quicker than that, though. <br><br>Stu, I can't speak for other pagan faiths, but in my experience nobody ever converts to Druidry. People find out about it and say, "But that's pretty much what I believe anyway; I guess I must be a Druid." Then we welcome them, make room for 'em in the circle, and proceed with the ritual. <br><br>Maria, I figured that the annoying squeaking sound was whimpers of blind panic coming from office buildings in New York and Washington; thanks for setting me straight. ;-)<br><br>Thijs, maybe so -- but you'll notice that the pace of religious oddity in Europe declined steadily during the years when so many of your religious minorities were heading west over the ocean in steerage. As for ingroup/outgroup dynamics, I can think of plenty of aggressively secular groups that have as bad a problem with those. <br><br>Peter and Alkistis, thank you! I think it would be a great idea to launch something similar on your side of the pond. <br><br>Zach, I'm less certain than I was that the Catholic church is going to go anywhere in the US except up in flames. Much of the laity and a fair proportion of priests are on the leftward end of the line I traced, while the hierarchy is moving toward a rigidly reactionary and exclusionary stance; that's a recipe for an explosion. Elsewhere in the world, that's another matter; still, all this will require more research and study.<br><br><a href=#c482847030815896504 title="comment permalink">5/31/12, 9:29 PM</a><br><br>

Haven't read the Stephenson novel yet; I'll put it on the list. <br><br>Nick, the historical perspective to my mind is the key to making sense of our predicament; it's easy to spin theories in the absence of data, whereas history provides us with the data. As for the religions of the future, if things follow the usual course there'll be vast diversity followed by a movement toward one or a few main options; we'll see what those turn out to be. <br><br>Bill, that's what made the mainstream churches' leftward shift so self-defeating; they were trying to appeal to people who were in the process of abandoning religion altogether, while turning their backs on people who wanted religion but couldn't handle the liberal cant. Not a bright move. <br><br>Larry, isn't it fascinating how we supposedly have no inflation, but prices keep rising? <br><br>Wolfgang, precisely so. Those faiths that embrace asceticism -- starting with their own clergy and leaders -- will be much more likely to make it than those that cling to material wealth, if for no other reason than that all that wealth makes a great target for governments and thieves alike. <br><br>SLClaire, I've been hearing that sort of thing from a lot of very conservative people. <br><br>Yupped, that's one approach. A set of ideas and beliefs that are viable in an age of decline is another useful option. <br><br>Carmiac, you may run in more perceptive circles than I do. <br><br>Renaissance, oh, granted -- I'm speaking mostly about the United States, since that's the setting I know from personal experience. <br><br>Raven, that's fine, so long as you're willing to attend a lot of funerals.

Do you plan on publishing your Midwestern research? <br><br>John, I did three talks, all of them extempore. If you've been following the discussions here, you know the substance of the talks on "How Civilizations Fall" and "Green Wizardry;" the third, "Spirituality and Peak Oil" -- well, that's almost certainly going to become a book, and I'd like to place it with one of the large religious publishers, since it's going to be relevant well outside my own faith community. <br><br>David, I don't know of a good online source for what's happening; I get a lot of emailed announcements, as a likely presenter. Does anyone else have a suggestion? <br><br>Candace, thanks for the link!<br><br>Tuba, as a Druid, I can't ever leave my church -- wherever you go, there Nature is. <br><br>Prack, I don't know of any useful way to discuss this sort of thing with people who are deep into denial about it. Live your life, make your preparations and grow your garden; after a few more elections fail to fix anything, you may find your neighbors beginning to notice. <br><br>Adrian, I'll be getting to that at some length in a bit. <br><br>Kieran, I think it's a real possibility. There are also evangelical Christian novels of the "Left Behind" type that use the worship of Gaia as the church of the antichrist; that shows you just how deep the fear is. <br><br>Btidwell, yes, I'm quite aware of how freaky -- or, more precisely, panic-stricken -- people are over there, or more precisely over here; remember that I live in an Appalachian mill town with more than 80 churches in it. (Folks still giggled over Harold Camping's predictions.) The spread of dispensationalist Rapture theology is a fairly recent thing, and I doubt it will last long; it's a common mistake to overestimate the durability of religious fads.

Nice to know my musings were of interest RE: Quakers in England and their business interests, particularly those during the time when England was changing over to market-oriented agriculture and to modern urbanisation. (<i>Agricultural Revolution in England</i>; Prof Mark Overton’s book is partly available on google preview. He does not mention Quakers per se, but gives the context for the emergence of ‘middlemen’ in marketing agricultural produce needed by the rapidly increasing urban population as they and industry expanded after 1750.)<br><br>I have been fascinated by JMG’s drawing on earlier British examples when he links the relevance of history to contemporary trends in the USA; the nature of industry, capital and markets; the expansion and the decline of empire. I share the view that these histories have relevance to contemporary USA. I think that the change in Britain at the beginning of the industrial period could be relevant. Traditional peasant ‘husbandry’ changed to farming, with both gain and loss. ‘Ideologies’ emerged to provide intellectual frameworks for change. We might ask though, what were the changed circumstances that made ‘farmers markets’ obsolete? (In those days they had a radius of about 10 miles.) What happened to the historical customary and legal regulation of those earlier markets – "vociferously defended by the poor in times of dearth"? When was the last local ‘famine’ in England? Apparently it was in 1622/1623 in a few remote areas, though the more serious example was in 1596/1597, also likewise in remote areas. <br><br>Quakers were always ahead of their time it seems. They were on the ‘reform’ side of ideology but could understand the notion of ‘Progress’: in those days it was called ‘’improvement’. Increasingly ‘the market’ was the way forward. There were many successful Quaker businesses. The town of Reading on the river Thames west of London where I went to study agriculture at the University, was pretty well made by Quaker food manufacturers in the early 19thC.<br><br>The page 145 I wanted in Overton’s book is unfortunately missing in google preview. So I copy out a few sentences: <i> “On the other hand, by the late 18thC the idea of the self-regulating market gained currency, so that opposition to regulation acquired some intellectual justification. This is important because it marks a fundamental shift in attitude towards the nature of the market. Thus high prices following a bad harvest were seen as a ‘natural’ form of rationing and consequently no interventions were needed. This new ideology ignored the fact that the rationing mechanism was not equitable since the burden of rationing fell disproportionately on the poor. This contrasts with the interventionist tradition which had attempted to protect the weakest consumers from the consequences of dearth, </i>.<br><br><a href=#c4477394322358284913 title="comment permalink">6/1/12, 6:01 AM</a><br><br>

I'd note that the economic system as it's usually discussed is a far cry from what exists "on the ground" so to speak. Although people exchange labor for money just like the Econ textbooks say -- if you actually take a close look and listen you notice that what people want and try to create between bosses and workers is that whole messy set of reciprocal obligations and responsibilities, loyalties, symbolic exchanges and so on. It's mostly in an economy like this one, (or at the low end of any given economy) where employers can disregard what employees actually want that you see workers treated as interchangeable cogs undeserving of human treatment - just like the Econ textbooks say ought to be done in a market economy.<br><br><a href=#c3595971345815556739 title="comment permalink">6/1/12, 6:08 AM</a><br><br>

Like the use of the word "Love," perhaps we should insert the paragraphs necessary to even begin to explain our intended meaning, instead of relying on the verbal shorthand of labels. That said, I will happily use these labels in this note, with the hoped for understanding that they are very crude placeholders for a broad range of human behaviors.<br><br><br>It is undeniable that community arises around anyone of a multiplicity of possible shared organizing principles. In a simple form it arises out of a set of shared economic efficiencies and cultural expectations. As an example we share meat from our winter cattle kill because we cannot preserve it, we bond that as a cultural experience with shared food consumption and perhaps dance, song and storytelling; and rely upon that cultural sharing to cement the economic expectation that our community members will reciprocate in sharing their own winter kill with us. This is a highly effective dynamic that we find is a central adaptation of cultures in many times and places. Community as a set of shared economic efficiencies.<br><br><br>Community can arise in other ways as well, one of which is the shared definitions of in group/out group ethics and trans-rational belief systems that we label "Religion." In one extreme this organizing principle of community can manifest as a tool of exploiter culture, for instance the history of the Catholic Church in the second millennium. While even within this same general "Belief System" it can manifest as a means of conserver culture, for instance the role of Catholic monasteries in preserving written western culture during the latter part of the first millennium.

Four Quarters was founded with a full set of idealistic expectations of personal empowerment, privately owned economics, voting democratic decision making and egalitarian social values. Within two years we were poaching venison, eating potatoes by the sack and living without hot water or telephone. When confronted with the stark necessity of survival our organizations evolution based on Darwinian pragmatism began. We became an income sharing 501(d) "religious community that shares a common treasury" because when fully realized it is simply the most efficient survival focused economic arrangement possible. Rather than five residential grade washing machines for eight adults we have one industrial grade machine at a significant cost savings, as an example. <br><br><br>As an organizing principle to insure mutual economic reciprocity we rely upon our shared ethics and tools of personal growth, ie: "Religion." Thus I know that I do not need to submit to our group decision making process my invitation to an indigent person to share our food and lodging for a few days, even though I know that this will result in a loss of highly valued privacy, dissipation of essential shared resources and likely exposure to a dysfunctional personality.

And religion is like a pistol, its relative goodness can only be measured by the ends to which it is put.

I agree that religion will be prominent in the post-peak future as a way to create community and meaning for what is happening around us. As a woman, though, I'm concerned as to what type of religion may take root-Mormons and many other far-right religious groups ask their followers to have months' worth of canned food and other survival items in case of the End Times. I'd hate for the post-peak world to have mostly religions that are less than friendly to women. I'd like to think that more egalitarian religions, such as Druidism, would take hold, but demographically I'm not sure that would be the case. Obviously family life would be very different in the post-peak world and we would be more defined by gender roles simply because men, by and large, are stronger than women. It would be terrible though if women are again seen as second-class citizens. What are your thoughts on religion and gender roles in the post-peak world?

For instance, with anger and hostility, my rule is that there must be an imminent physical threat to justify getting angry or hostile. That does not mean that getting angry or hostile should be a response to physical threats, one should try to keep cool, but if I feel anger or other emotions brewing from non-physical stimulus, I check out of that by reminding myself that I need to cool off if I am feeling offended by perceived stresses to my ego. <br><br>What this means in real life is that getting angry or smart with me is a confusing experience. If I care about the person and keep my cool, I ask probing and direct questions about what the problem is. If I don't care, I either ignore them or if their antics are in my way, ask them to correct themselves coldly and respectfully. Sometimes it takes multiple confrontations, but not too often.<br><br>The biggest key is short circuiting that disruptive emotional reaction by dealing with its perceived cause by checking out of the emotion itself without checking out of the cause. The cause may be an imposition that has to be dealt with one way or the other, but without a physical component to the imposition, emotional responses should be irrelevant. <br><br>A second point is that while you can be calm, you do not have to be accommodating. I can be quite calm and very unaccommodating, which can be quite unsettling to emotionally dysfunctional people and a great relationship building experience with more emotionally healthy people. Perhaps the conflation of being calm and accommodating is what what leads to the cyclical meltdowns? i.e. you get fed up with bending over backwards for people.<br><br>Word verification: <br>henisme 15<br><br>(Should be:<br>Gennessee beerz 3)<br><br><a href=#c5713342610155738275 title="comment permalink">6/1/12, 7:27 PM</a><br><br>

I think the two concepts are separate: the standard gender roles will probably remain fairly constant, as they have in history; the work still needs to be done. People's attitudes about these tasks will shape gender relations.<br><br>I suspect women will once again largely end up managing kitchen and kids, while men will be out managing business. But as kitchen and kids become increasingly complex, there's an opportunity to reframe attitudes -- our own as well as men's and our cultures'.<br><br>Awhile back, our esteemed Archdruid wrote about the fate of the household economy in the late 1940s and the 1950s. He pointed out that during this time, food management and large portions of child-rearing became automated and relocated outside the home. Continuing to manage these tasks at home was considered unfashionable, crude, and unnecessary. Women's work became irrelevant, so women became irrelevant. To counter this, women fought to gain footing in more relevant realms: business, technology, mass culture. And because most household tasks were automated, this was possible. Even women who preferred the old gender roles were encouraged to become more "relevant": cooks and child-raisers were urged to become caterers, daycare providers, and teachers. I suspect that the spirit of second-wave feminism was driven primarily by the desire to remain important in general, not by a specific desire to enter the men's workplace. <br><br>As we return to the household economy, we need to re-emphasize how important these home tasks are going to be in the hardships to come. As long as people consider our work important, we will be respected. We should incorporate important roles into our household economy: resource allocation, dispute mediation, counselling functions, social secretaries (important in a world where community is key!), and the ability to aid in war (important in a world where war will emerge over diminishing resources!), to name a few.<br><br><a href=#c4639404132824482775 title="comment permalink">6/1/12, 8:48 PM</a><br><br>

In Ireland we don’t, at the moment at least, have the kind of far-right religious groups you do in the US. But there’s a weirdly similar danger posed by the other side of the spectrum too which I’m more familiar with. It’s maybe not as obvious. When it comes to issues around pregnancy, birth, breastfeeding and motherhood, there’s a very strong current on this side of the pond towards what I’ve seen called ‘naturalism’ or ‘biological essentialism’. I think it’s related to what JMG described as Romanticism. You’ll see it in action when people say things like ‘women’s bodies were designed for childbirth/breasts for breastfeeding’, ‘we’re mammals and that’s why we must breastfeed’ and when they glorify natural childbirth and female physiological processes in general as empowering. They treat suffering and pain as things that the benevolent Mother Nature would never permit, as aberrations caused by our rational brains and, therefore, our distance from nature (i.e. ‘instincts/intuition’). It’s a weird direction that some feminists have taken. It exalts concepts like ‘women’s intuition’ and ‘motherly instincts’ in a dualistic opposition to men’s ‘cold rationality’ and science. In doing so it fails to acknowledge that industrial medicine has provided any benefits to women. It also treats women as naturally more peaceful and cooperative than men. There’s all kinds of misunderstandings of evolution and biology in there.<br><br>Those kinds of beliefs are doing damage to women right now – there are huge numbers of women getting depressed and feeling like failures for failing to give birth naturally, or failing to breastfeed, or not wanting to be attached to their babies 24/7, or not feeling instantly bonded to their babies etc. My fear is that as those beliefs are extremely common in alternative circles, they’ll gain even more ground as natural birth and breastfeeding become simply unavoidable rather than choices. That would force women back to the sum total of our biology and what are culturally considered to be instincts at any given time. On the other hand, I guess those kinds of beliefs about nature are unlikely to survive extended contact with it. They don’t have much of a foothold in places where women currently have no access to modern medicine… <br><br>It’s that return of high rates of mortality and morbidity in childbirth that really depresses me. It needn’t necessarily affect women’s work, rights or status but it will affect our descendents lives in a even more basic way. I haven’t heard anyone in the peak oil scene discuss that reality. I’ve seen the promotion of midwifery and the above natural childbirth ideology in movements like Transition Towns but as far as I’m concerned they’re all just avoiding the bottom line, which is that in the absence of modern medicine many of our granddaughters will die or be injured in birth and with no or inadequate pain relief. They’ll face the same lottery that our ancestors did. It wasn’t uncommon for women in the past to be traumatized or haunted by their births to the point where they would never speak about them.<br><br>I’m sure in time that the old reality of birth will just be accepted again as a fact of life but I’m a bit worried about the transition. It seems to me that women at some point need to go through the same task of accepting the likelihood of earlier than expected death that those with chronic, modern medicine-dependent medical conditions must. And accepting that it’s a threat that only women will personally face. Now that’s inequality. That future may not be so distant either – in the UK and Ireland austerity cutbacks are already leaving maternity hospitals understaffed. But the grieving process for that loss hasn’t even started yet.<br><br><a href=#c3423764903877141992 title="comment permalink">6/2/12, 5:27 AM</a><br><br>

And I’m glad to hear that the conference went well – it makes me long to put together something similar on the west coast! I guess there’s no chance you have any plans to return to your old stompin’ grounds in Ashland for a visit? Will there be any write-ups or transcriptions (or videos?) of the conference that we can see?<br><br>I’m glad to hear the discussions on post-peak are including spirituality. That’s the place I’ve come to, also, after years away from any church – our relationship with Nature is spiritual; we are one body with her/it and our connection is not (cannot be) based just on logic or pragmatism. And you are right on the money with the comment about churches believing “everyone in the world deserves a middle class lifestyle”… how can any of them embrace the true relationship of human to nature, when they benefit as much as individuals from ignoring that relationship? They throw a bit of “not by bread alone” stuff out there, but are still putting on glitzy gatherings full of the perks of the first-world energy pump (from my friends’ descriptions). Many churches still have a real message of caring, but with the institutions and insurance industries’ regulations, they can’t even really help as they wish: can’t accept unpackaged food; can’t allow volunteers to make meals w/o a food handler’s card, etc. It’s all become “professionalized” (ie: monetized), leaving the average parishioner unable to do much except throw money in the basket (and one has to be working for that). But it comes back to having an unrealistic perception of what’s going on today – churches become part of the problem when they refuse to speak the truth about what is going on around them. A good quote I just read: “Our lives do having meaning… just as they are. It is our illusions that rob us of meaning, not our lives.” I’ve been pondering that for a while, and looking at the places my life feels meaningless – asking what my expectations and beliefs are. <br>(end Part 1)<br><br><a href=#c5523015722086565598 title="comment permalink">6/2/12, 7:23 AM</a><br><br>

Unfortunately, they are all still resisting even the basics of what they can do… I believe they know that they will end up getting very angry once they really face what’s going on – and they are not ready for that, yet. They’re still trying to hang on to the storyline that this is just a blip in the upward growth of mankind.<br><br>The cobb-built oven project I was to attend on Memorial Day got postponed, but my Master Preserver classes are going wonderfully well and in two weeks I should be ready to start demo’ing and helping others.

Wanting to contribute to its strength we looked at all of the “service” organizations as a possible nucleus for re-invigorating the community. Unfortunately, we found all of them to be either a “one-man” shows or moribund. Not all was lost because we also had a Presbyterian Church to work through and its inclusive outlook on faith and community outreach is very much attuned to that of our family. <br><br>We found that because the church is “aging” and with a declining membership those in the church were eager to listen to new ideas and use their tested organization to re-build the membership. By working together, patiently, through the church organization it is possible to re-discover its original purpose and connections to the community. It takes time but the spiritual and community rewards are beyond measure. <br><br>Too often the “Christian” church earns, and deserves, a reputation for being rigid, extreme of intolerant. This is especially true in rural areas where the rigidity and exclusion can center at the family level. In other words, if you aren’t associated with a certain family or are new to the community you are excluded from the community or church. Because our family had to move many times over the years as we followed my working career fixing broken community banks, primarily in small communities, we had the opportunity to visit, and join, many churches, including Unitarian, and we have found mainline Christian churches to be most tolerant of the bunch. <br><br>The Presbyterian Church is a particular example as it generally consists of older people who are well educated and, dare I say it, Liberal. Not the “doe-eyed” type but rather the “bobo” type however, they will listen and contribute when engaged in a well-structured discussion. Surprisingly, those of a “native conservative” bent also listen, engage and contribute in the discussion. The far right wing and far left are essentially destructive in the attempt to build a community. <br><br>Thanks for the excellent post.<br><br><a href=#c5155520399824751858 title="comment permalink">6/2/12, 8:19 AM</a><br><br>

In a lot of American farm towns until quite recently, and a few still today, you'd have to add in the Grange hall. <br><br>Tony, don't confuse spirituality as a whole with the really rather peculiar notion, popular in a few loud churches these days, that mythology ought to be wrenched out of its proper role and interpreted in a blindly literal, evening-news kind of way. Many religions and spiritual paths -- mine among them -- are comfortable, or even insistent, on the idea that human beings and human souls are part of the same cosmos as everything else.<br><br>Macsporan, well, we'll see. <br><br>Fabrice, thanks for the link. <br><br>Unknown Tasmanian, I didn't know you had Anabaptists there too!

I'll second your comment that religion is the one reliable organizing principle for a long-term communal system -- certainly it's the one that's worked consistently in the past -- and the renunciation of personal wealth is another crucial point usually ignored these days. More on this in a future post.<br><br>Jeffrey, there was a science fiction novel some decades back, "Hiero's Journey" by Sterling Lanier, which featured a monastic Brotherhood of the Eleventh Commandment. Their version ran as follows: "Thou shalt not despoil the Earth, nor the life thereon."

Thank you. <br><br>Adrian, "calm and accommodating" may be the problem; any fixed emotional state is an obstacle to realization, and it's one of the common pathologies of meditation that people so often pursue fixed emotional states in meditation as a substitute for realization. You might consider giving up the effort to become calm and accommodating, and instead, in your meditations, simply attend to what is -- knowing that "what is" includes rage, fear, and passionate action, among other things, all of which are part of the experience of being human and all of which can be encountered and embraced in a living spirituality.<br><br><a href=#c6897374274184479601 title="comment permalink">6/2/12, 10:25 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you also, JMG, for this week bringing up religion. <br><br>It has somewhere been wisely pointed out that in the contemporary world, monasticism plays the public role more dramatically played in ancient Israel by such culturally dissident writers as Isaiah and Jeremiah.<br><br>The quiet 1996 witness of the Tibhirine Cistercians resonates not in Algeria alone but also in today's North America, reminding us that we can, if we choose, even in North America lead lives of truth and joy. <br><br>The same is true of the contemporary witness of a Syrian Jesuit-led monastic community of Islamic-Christian reconciliation, Deir Mar Musa. <br><br>Both Tibhirine and Deir Mar Musa are readily researched on Google. <br><br>I also think of the courage shown by the neo-monastic community foundress Dorothy Day.

Her September 1945 editorial on the criminiality of bombing Hiroshima, currently archived at www.catholicworker.org, is a model of moral clarity.<br><br>One of Dorothy Day's phrases, I suspect from somewhere in her publications or her correspondence, is specially arresting - 'the duty of delight'. <br><br>In monasticism (Christian, Buddhist, whatever) we encounter individuals who follow JMG's precept from last week, holding up small, and yet prophet-like, lamps of practical example in our deepening communal twilight. <br><br><br>(signed) <br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>www dot metascientia dot com<br><br><a href=#c4990086162122306195 title="comment permalink">6/2/12, 10:48 AM</a><br><br>

I may write up something on my own, however, since I find the topic of work very interesting. A wise man once said that to be a full human being you needed to learn two things -- how to love and how to work. We credit love, in all its myriad forms, as central to human-ness and so complex that it nearly bursts the category. I like the idea of crediting work with the same complexity, centrality emotional weight, and importance.

In the last couple years my manner of speech has changed to correspond more and more with that of various forms of spirituality, generally blending in with which ever group I am around. That being said, when I speak of spiritual matters I remain informed by the most current scientific information.<br><br>For example around secular types I would certainly claim that humans are just another species that evolved alongside countless others and that they consist of the same kinds of atoms that are seen in things animate and inanimate; but of course the use of the word "just" there is ironic at best, like in the phrase "sure he is handsome, funny, kind, and intelligent, but he's just a billionaire."<br><br>We are the byproduct of evolution, but is not that the speaking of a language which in our glimpses of genetics already has shown a complexity of grammar and depth of informational content vastly beyond the language that birthed Shakespeare or the languages out of which modern Science itself is constructed? Do I propose some otherworldly intelligence as explanation of such complexity? No, that would quickly fall to reductio ad infinitum, which doesn't prove it wrong, merely unhelpful in explanation. Instead I propose that we regularly explore mysteries vastly more complex then the explorer, and that for this reason reductionist modes of language (atoms, game theory, logical atomism) will have implicit blind spots, where the necessary complexity of calculations to infer the behavior of a bee from the laws governing the atoms of her composition are well well on the far side of impossible, though certain constraints will still hold; the bee can be counted on to not violate the laws of thermodynamics seven days out of the week, even on the sabbath.<br><br>When we wish to comment on aspects of human life felt and lived, but lacking the type of language necessary for the commonly known modes of secular discourse, there is no bad thing in using spiritual modes to confront these issues. Of course, you don't want to forget about atoms and evolution when doing so, and if you are inclined to contradict them directly, it is good to have a pretty carefully though out reason to do so. But I find that there is much ground to cover in the spiritual discourse that run afoul of no lines yet drawn by more restrictively rationalistic modes.<br><br>For me I have a mental tool kit deterritorialized from my years studying philosophy that works adequately for translating between modes of discourse, though there are comments I might make in a context Christian, Zen, Magical, Cybernetic, Atheistic, or Animistic (as examples) which I would not know how to state, elegantly, in any other. But I can find peace, or at least coexistence between quite a few perspectives. Though explaining in Atheistic terms why I kiss the stump of any tree that I cut down, comes across silly at best, while in terms of Animism it is much more solemn.<br><br><a href=#c3130424743035246098 title="comment permalink">6/2/12, 2:29 PM</a><br><br>

One of the early lectures, with real stories from individual women (rather than dry statistics), was on how much has changed between then and now for women with respect to child-rearing, birthing, pregnancy and, yes, sexual desire. Life was hard for nearly everyone back in the 1800s and the first half of the 1900s, but this was the part of life where things became the hardest for very many women.<br><br>You never knew, back then, from one year to the next, which of your children would live and which would die young. Often as not, in the 1800s, you would lose a large fraction of your children before they were old enough to marry. One of my own great-great-great-great-great grandmothers lost six of her ten children -- her first and her last five -- before they were very old, in the first decades of the 1800s (in Rutland, VT). <br><br>You never knew how long your own next labor would go on, how hard it would be on you, and even whether you and/or your child would survive it. And you never knew, really, when your labor might begin, since late-term miscarriages and premature births seem not to have been all that rare.<br><br>Whenever you or your husband wanted sex, you could never know whether that would be the one time that would give you a child whose birth nine months later would cause your own death. If you didn't think of that possibility at the moment of desire, you certainly did once you found you had become pregnant.<br><br>And so forth. (Yes, there were skilled midwives, like Martha Ballard in Maine, who never lost a baby -- or hardly ever. But they were the exception.)<br><br>A colleague of mine born as late as 1930 in Mobile, Alabama, told me once how every September, when school resumed, she and her friends would all be curious to learn which of their classmates had died over the summer from the diseases that came in with the "dog days" of late summer -- *every* year it would be *several* classmates who had died in her largish circle of friends alone.<br><br>This is what our common future will look like, most likely, once modern medical care vanishes form the scene. Some things will not be quite the same as they were back then: the importance of sanitation and cleanliness in medicine will probably not be forgotten.<br><br>There are historians who have speculated that mothers became callous in the face of all that dying, as a way to protect themselves from sorrow. I did not see that in any of the first-hand sources I read. Rather, the women seemed to take what little comfort they could in the hard and obvious fact that one's emotional pain was not the exception, but the common lot of most of the women one knew, and they leaned on one another as they endured this hard thing called life.<br><br>I suppose something like this is what we will face once modern medical care becomes a thing of the past. Some of the students in my course, even as long ago as the early 2000s, had clearly sensed that future without much prompting from me, and they were quite engaged in finding out just how women had managed to get through their lives, and even take pleasure in their lives, under such harsh conditions. <br><br>They were able to find hints at the answers in the stories of other women and how they dealt with these things so long ago. Real stories of real people in the circumstances of one's own ancestors seem to be an extremely valuable resource as one figures these things out for oneself.<br><br><a href=#c3390827279135341607 title="comment permalink">6/2/12, 6:56 PM</a><br><br>

The Swedish have recently recognized Kopimism, a doctrine that believes that the sharing of information (which many in the US read as file sharing) is holy. As religions go, it's a remarkably reasonable one, and is likely the first religion in existence to be built on the principles of open source code.<br><br>Tribalism is already happening in the US, though the Internet has made it possible for such tribalism to transcend geopolitical boundaries. As the Internet transmutes and ultimately fades, however, and as the need for staying in one place for a job vanishes with the jobs themselves, I expect we'll go through a period of time - the Great Migration - where people will seek out and relocate into "tribal regions" rather than be caught up in regions where being different could mean imprisonment, assault, terrorism and death. Religion will be a part of that, as people work to codify their tribal characteristics into a moral/ethical framework, but it is likely that these churches, temples and other frameworks will tend to be inwardly focused - towards establishing values for a specific group - rather than outwardly focused and evangelical.<br><br>Of course, this is just guesswork on my part, and would love to hear your thoughts on what the shape of such new religions will be like.<br><br><a href=#c8411546993835416202 title="comment permalink">6/2/12, 8:32 PM</a><br><br>

I’m glad I was able to attend it. The setting for the event couldn’t be much better. The sight of forests, the sound of chirping birds (and even neighbors' gunshots during Carolyn's talk!) was a fitting backdrop for all the workshops. Much more of an authentic feeling than spending several days in a luxurious hotel with no windows.<br><br>These days I feel I’m constanting zooming in and out in both time and space. Sometimes I find myself trying to imagine the world several centuries into the future and what legends will exist then about our era, and then I zoom back in and focus on a single moment of kneading dough or dropping a seed into the soil. The art of interweaving the immediacy of the present moment with the wide lens of time is something I trying to achieve in my life.<br><br>For some reason, the quote, “Fish will be the last to know water” (from Einstein?) is something I have been contemplating lately. Like fish who have never experienced anything besides water therefore they don’t know it, I think it is hardest for humans to understand what they’re completely immersed in. I think the process of becoming more deeply limits-aware is a process of discovering the largely invisible waters we have been swimming in.

I've attached an article which alarms me. <br><br>As a bit of a background, there are two main retailers for food over here: Coles; and Woolworths. They control 70% of all retail dollars spent on food.<br><br>In recent times they have been embarking on some questionable conduct in relation to their suppliers. The upshot of this conduct has been that retail prices have come down, but the number of available products held on shelves has been reduced. Economists would be cheering this on, but within the supply chain, many manufacturers have had their profits reduced or have been put out of business. Apparently, many items are being sold below cost and if the suppliers complain then their products are pulled from the shelves. It also paves the way for imported produce sold as private label goods. Well done you lot!<br><br>As I've been growing a lot of the produce that I consume here and don't shop at either retailer, I hadn't noticed what was going on in relation to fruit and vegetables.

I didn't mean to say that Catholicism definitively <i>would</i> fulfill this role, just that it <i>might</i> and that it seems to have a leg up vs. either the Evangelical or Mainline churches with respect to the criteria outlined this week. I wasn't able to think of another tradition that's already established in America which shared these characteristics, although I see some readers have brought up the Quakers. I suppose we should add the Anabaptists to the list, also, although I have a hard time thinking of "established religion" and "Anabaptist" in the same thought! Can you think of any others?<br><br>You're quite right that Catholicism outside of America has it's own dynamic(s), though I'm no expert. It seems to me that Pope Benedict has been usefully pointing to ecological themes in some of his recent addresses, although I have yet to see that filter down to my local viewpoint.<br><br>Interesting times!<br><br>@dltrammel,<br><br>You wrote <i>"the Catholic Church IMO is heads and tails at the front of the pack of organizations advocating the status quo of growth and entitlement."</i><br><br>Interesting - not what I see at all. But then, I'm used to people hauling out Max Weber (*) as a club to "prove" that Catholicism is inferior because it <i>doesn't</i> support Growth™ the way Protestantism does (you know, the "Protestant Work Ethic"). Or has that gone out of fashion?<br><br>As for "auction off the artworks of the Vatican," I am sympathetic to the idea that this amounts to a demand that the Church stop curating these treasures for the public and let them become the private playthings of the super-rich.<br><br>I happen to know some twenty-something nuns. There are a few orders which aren't graying and dying. But, they're not on the liberal side of the divide, so they don't get as much press as the LCWR's political grandstanding.<br><br>You may be right about Buddhism.

Both my parents were baptised but the only times we ever went to church was with my grandparents at Christmas. My parents felt it was up to my brother and I to decide for ourselves once we were old enough which, if any religion we would adhere to. <br><br>Being relatively young I can say that religion and growing up in New Zealand I can say that religion is a small part of most of my peers lives. A few of my friends are practising Christians but by far most of my friends and outer circle are non-religious.<br><br>I have friends in the punk and heavy metal scenes that have absolutely no time for religion whatsoever and those are two music scenes that have traditionally had open derision for religion. I also have other friends who live a hippie lifestyle, which tends to involve partly living off the land, partly living off government handouts with a lot of psychedelics thrown in.<br><br>Personally I don't actively practice anything although I try to spend much of my time out enjoying nature. That is enough for me now although that may change in the future. I have read most of your writings on Druidry and it appeals to my Scottish heritage and my love of nature.<br><br>I understand your reluctance to talk about religion and spirituality on this blog as it is a topic that many people have very strong beliefs about. There are plenty of people in my life that I avoid the topic with altogether because it is not worth my while. But I would hope that perhaps the peak oil community is mature enough now to have this conversation and it sounds like that from your experience at the Age of Limits conference that perhaps this is beginning to happen.

If I had to wash entirely by hand, I'd own and wear fewer clothes :-) And seriously, that's one good practical response to the labour-intensive future: the less stuff you own, the less onerous is the job of cleaning and maintaining it (so much of which we now offload onto fossil slaves). <br><br>Sometimes less (Stuff) is more (free time). Smaller house. Less clothing. Fewer complex little machines that break easily. And sometimes more (effort) is more (quality): My partner used to love his bread machine; now he makes bread by hand and enjoys that. Pretty soon we'll have the pantry set up and start grinding our own flour, and the superb taste of bread made with fresh-ground grain will almost certainly lead to our loving that process too... manual drudgery isn't "drudgery" unless you happen to hate doing it.<br><br>I too worry about peak oil providing the excuse for patriarchal revanchists to launch a major backlash against female emancipation. Could well happen. There is a contingent of dissatisfied Wannabe Manly Men doomers (I run across 'em online now and then) who almost *gloat* as they predict the breakdown of social order, the "inevitable" domination of armed gangs, the imminent need for every man [ahem] to defend his turf, castle, and wimminankids. The subtext, to my cynical old feminist ear, is "and then those uppity women will have to knuckle under again because they'll need my protection!" Yeah well, maybe.

In addition, much of the teachings have diffused through the US church scene, with my rather conservative Baptist church in Jacksonville Florida (women wore skirts, not pants, KJV bible only, separated from the Southern Baptist Convention because they were too liberal, etc) teaching something similar in regards to tithing (tithe beyond one's means, and God would make up the difference).<br> By unique I mean, you know, like the UFO religion that permeates New Age circles that is essentially a point-for-point analog to modern evangelical Christianity.<br> It should be noted that cargo cults formed *after* the US military left.

(Actually I didn't have a spare plunger at the time, so I skipped that part.) Dump out the soapy water and add clean water to rinse. I needed two or three changes of rinse water, as I recall. Wringing the clothes by hand was the hardest part. The clothes came out clean enough, for not much work.<br><br>This summer I'm trying a slightly upgraded version of this technique. We found an old washtub on legs, with a drain hose, at a garage sale. I purchased a wringer and a laundry plunger from Lehman's. I figure that putting the washtub out in the sun and covering the top of the washtub with a storm window will yield a hot-water soak. Using the plunger will mimic the washing machine's agitator. The wringer should help with the most difficult part, wringing the water out of the clothes. I'll complete with line drying on the clothes rack. This seems to me to be nearly as easy as a washing machine, at least in theory. I'll report on the Green Wizards site after I try it.<br><br>My larger point: just because something was drudgery in the past doesn't mean it has to be now, if we apply Green Wizardry to the task.

I hope someday to know more British Friends. As an American Friend, I can only respond to Phil’s query from my own experience. <br><br>Phil, Though in the U.S. there are evangelical Friends that are much closer to standard protestant organization and beliefs, the Friends I am involved with carry on in the manner of the older tradition. There are not huge numbers of us. We have a distinctive, flexible, decentralized organization that is non-hierarchical and non-authoritarian—though to be a convinced Friend is definitely to participate in group life and decision-making, not to go it alone in hyper-individualism. We have no paid ministers. We gather and sit in silence for worship, something like meditation. <br><br>Our testimonies—for peace, simplicity, equality, and so on are meant to be used as ways for individuals and groups to consider their manner of living in the world and helps to spiritual growth, not as doctrines or creeds. As Alice says, “…if we are in touch with the divine power there will be evidence in changed lives.” In my experience, living in witness to the testimonies begins to cause changes around one, as well. Some Friends consider themselves Christians, others have a more explicitly earth-centered spirituality. ”Liberal” and “conservative” are labels that don’t really fit what we are about.<br><br>Earthcare, "reskilling," and low-carbon, plain living follow naturally from our testimonies. This is intensified by the fact that, by and large, we are very aware of the peak oil/climate change/over-population/environmental destruction dilemma, have been for a long time, and thus live according to this truth. I first heard of John Michael Greer and his writing from some other Friends.<br><br><a href=#c6577281630230333403 title="comment permalink">6/5/12, 10:04 AM</a><br><br>

She now worships at the church of Limbaugh, Hannity and so forth.<br><br>I've been practicing in the church of Nature ever since, but on my own, not within any organized group.<br><br>My wife and I now reside in Edmonds, Washington, quite near where JMG was born &amp; raised. There seems to be a full compliment of churches here, and they seem to be holding their own. Indeed, one of the local catholic churches just completed a massive addition to their complex, and yes it does very much resemble a world war one bunker.<br><br>Regarding local data points, it seems I notice more people with chickens in their back yards all the time. Edmonds is an eclectic town with a wide range of world views and economic clsses, from far right through bobo liberals to urban homsteaders.<br><br>The real estate pattern here for the last ten years or more (property values are fairly high because of proximity to Seattle and Puget Sound and Olympic mountain views) has been for wealthy individuals or developers to purchase lovely older houses, raze them, and build a giant mansion. Recently a house with a very large, sunny lot, built in 1910 went on the market and quickly sold. I figured it would be demolished, but the next thing I know, fruit trees, berry bushes, chickens and veggie gardens are filling every available space. I even noticed a solar food drier! So there is some hope.<br><br>Regarding camping in Cascadia, my wife and I just returned from camping on the Hood Canal, not far from the Elwha River. I'm happy to report that for the first time we cooked every meal for four days on a wood fire. I have a garage full of wood, but have never really cooked on a wood fire (my family always used fossil fueled camp stoves). For those looking to increase their resilience to collapse, camping now and then with as few industrial toys as possible is a great way to hone those skills.<br><br>And to keep the data points balanced, almost everyone in the campgound had a giant and nearly new diesel truck, whether they were towing a massive trailer or using a tent. our car was easily the smallest in the whole place.<br><br><a href=#c4283824943290600311 title="comment permalink">6/5/12, 6:07 PM</a><br><br>

Victorians, other than the very wealthy, had a lot fewer clothes, which is one reason why they had smaller and fewer closets in houses (they also stored clothing in chests and wardrobes). Wool outer garments can be maintained with brushing and spot cleaning for a long time.<br><br>@St. Claire--your system sounds workable. Would it work with flaked laundry soap in place of detergent? Those wringer tubs that got turned into planters are going to be valuable again.<br><br>@O'Neill and Mallow--in addition to handwashing, I've read that death from childbirth has been reduced when midwives have been given training in the use of forceps to turn a breech birth. A risky technology but probably less risky than a Caesarian section on somebody's kitchen table.<br><br>More recently, two technologies available in First World hospitals have been rendered portable and are beginning to be distributed in poor rural areas. One is a pneumatic stocking that can be drawn over the lower half of a woman's body and pumped up with a hand pump to slow down post partum bleeding until the mother can get medical attention. The other is a suitcase kit that charges a battery from a solar panel to provide adequate light for night deliveries in a clinic or ill-equipped hospital. These won't be manufactured if the industrial system collapses totally, but they are saving lives right now.<br><br><a href=#c6396804935561580994 title="comment permalink">6/6/12, 1:15 AM</a><br><br>

They’re also usually quoting the neonatal death rate rather than the perinatal death rate. The neonatal death rate relates to deaths up to 1 year and is a measure of paediatric, not obstetric, care. (Also a measure of childhood poverty in the US…)The perinatal death rates on the other hand for hospital births in the US are pretty normal by the standards of developed countries. Also, you have to be careful with comparisons because different countries collect and report that data differently. To take one example, some record a death within a few minutes of birth as a still birth, while others record it as a perinatal death. There are lots of studies showing that home birth in the US in particular has a massively higher death rate than hospital birth. That’s why the Midwives Association of North America won’t release their data. The crucial difference between the US and somewhere like the UK is that homebirth midwives in the US are, in comparison, extremely poorly qualified and generally un or under-regulated.<br><br><a href=#c2657196775843248843 title="comment permalink">6/22/12, 8:40 AM</a><br><br>
