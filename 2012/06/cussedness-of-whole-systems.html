There’s an interesting divergence between the extreme complexity of the predicament that besets contemporary industrial civilization, on the one hand, and the remarkable simplicity of the failures of reasoning that have sent us hurtling face first into that predicament, on the other. Nearly all of those failures share a common root, which is the inability—or at least the unwillingness—of most people in the modern world to pay attention to the natural cussedness of whole systems. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The example I have in mind just at the moment runs all through one of the most lively nondebates in today’s media, which is about peak oil.  I call it a nondebate because those who are trying to debate the issue—that is to say, those people who have noticed the absurdity of trying to extract infinite amounts of petroleum from a finite planet—are by and large shut out of the discussion.  Those who hold the other view, for their part, aren’t debating.  With embarrassingly few exceptions, instead, they’re <a href=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/22145/new_study_by_harvard_kennedy_school_researcher_forecasts_sharp_increase_in_world_oil_production_capacity_and_risk_of_price_collapse.html>merely insisting at the top of their lungs</a> that peak oil has been disproved by some glossy combination of short term factors, speculative bubbles, and overblown hype about the future, and can we please just get back to our lifestyles of mindless consumption and waste? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Behind the cornucopian handwaving, though, is a real debate, one that those of us who are aware of peak oil need to address. The issue at the heart of the debate is the shape of the curve that will define future petroleum production worldwide, and the reason that it needs to be addressed is that so far, at least, that curve is not doing what most peak oil theories say it should do. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The original version of the peak oil curve, of course, is the one sketched out by M. King Hubbert in his famous 1956 paper. Here it is:<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<insert graphic=""></insert></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/hubbert-curve-4c8b03.jpg style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=184 src=../../img/hubbert-curve-c2348d-320x184-g95.jpg width=320></a></div>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the model that underlies most of today’s peak oil analyses.  It’s a good first approximation of the way that oil production normally rises and falls over time on any scale—a well, a field, an oil province, a country—provided that external factors don’t interfere.  The problem here, of course, is that oil production doesn’t happen in a vacuum, and so external factors always interfere.  It helps to rephrase that last point in systems terms: the production of oil takes place within a whole system and is always influenced by the state of the system. That’s why at best, the history of oil production from any given well, field, oil province, or country only roughly approximates the ideal shape of the Hubbert curve, and many real-world examples stray all over the map in their wanderings from the zero point at the beginning to the one at the end. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s the failure to appreciate this point that has left a good many peak oil analysts flailing when global petroleum production failed to decline according to some predicted schedule. Anyone who’s been following the peak oil blogosphere for more than a few years has gotten used to the annual predictions—they tend to pop up like mushrooms every December—that the year about to begin would finally see rates of petroleum production begin dropping like the proverbial rock. Tolerably often, in fact, the same predictions get recycled from one year to the next, with no more attention to the lessons of past failure than you’ll find in one of Harold Camping’s Rapture prophecies.  Even among those who don’t go that far out on a limb, the notion that global production of petroleum ought to start dropping steeply sometime soon is all but hardwired into the peak oil scene. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The peak of global conventional petroleum production arrived, as I hope most of my readers are aware by now, in 2005. The seven years since then have given us a first glimpse at the far end of Hubbert’s curve, and so far, it’s not following the model. Conventional petroleum production has declined, and the price of oil has wobbled unsteadily up to levels that mainstream analysts considered impossible a decade ago; that much of the peak oil prophecy has been confirmed by events.  Overall production of liquid fuels, though, has remained steady and even risen slightly, as high prices have made it profitable for unconventional petroleum and a range of petroleum substitutes—tar sand extractives, natural gas liquids, biodiesel, ethanol, and the like—to be poured into the world’s fuel tanks.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s only fair to note that this was among the predictions made by critics of peak oil theory back when that was still a subject of debate. The standard argument economists used to dismiss the threat of peak oil was precisely that rising prices would make other energy sources economical, following the normal workings of supply and demand.  For all its flaws—and I plan on dissecting a few of those shortly—that prediction was rooted in the behavior of whole systems. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The law of supply and demand, in fact, is one manifestation of a basic principle of systems theory, a principle pervasive and inescapable enough that it’s not unreasonable to call it a law.  The law of equilibrium, as we might as well call it, states that any attempt to change the state of a whole system will set in motion coutervailing processes that tend to restore the system to its original state.  Those processes will not necessarily succeed; they may fail, and they may also trigger changes of their own that push the system in unpredictable directions; still, such processes always emerge, and if you ignore them, it’s a fairly safe bet that they’re going to blindside you. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The law of equilibrium is what’s behind so many of the failures of technological progress in recent years.  Decide that you can just go ahead and annihilate pathogenic microbes en masse with antibiotics, for example, and the countervailing processes of the planet’s microbial ecology are going to shift into high gear, churning out genes for antibiotic resistance that spread from one bacterial species to another and render antibiotics less effective with every year that passes.  The same is true of genetically engineered plants—one of the ugly little secrets of the GMO industry is that one insect species after another is doing exactly what Darwinian theory says it should, evolving right around the biotoxins released by Monsanto’s supposedly pestproof Frankencrops, and chowing down on the otherwise unprotected buffet spread for them by unsuspecting farmers—and of any number of equally clueless tinkerings with natural processes that are blowing up in humanity’s collective face just now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The global industrial economy is also a whole system, and though it’s countless orders of magnitude less complex and sophisticated than the biosphere, it still responds to changing conditions with its own countervailing processes.  That’s what’s been happening with global liquid fuels production.  As the rate of conventional petroleum production peaked and began its decline, the countervailing processes took the form of rising prices, which made more expensive sources of liquid fuels profitable, and kept total production of liquid fuels not far from where it was when conventional oil peaked in 2005. The wild swings in price since then have provided the thermostat for this homeostatic process, balancing the ragged decline of conventional petroleum and the equally ragged expansion of substitute fuels by influencing the profitability of any given fuel over time. In its own way, it’s an elegant mechanism, however much turmoil and suffering it happens to generate in the real world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Does this mean that peak oil is no longer an issue?  Not by a long shot, because the economic shifts necessary to bring substitute fuels into the fuel supply don’t exist in a vacuum, either. They also put pressure on the global industrial economy, and generate countervailing processes of their own. That’s the detail that both sides of the peak oil nondebate have by and large been missing, even as those countervailing processes have been whipsawing the global economy and driving changes that seemed implausible even to most peak oil analysts just a short time ago. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The point that has to be grasped in order to understand these broader effects is that the higher price of substitute fuels isn’t arbitrary.  Tar sand extractives, for example, cost more to produce than light sweet crude because pressure-washing tar out of tar sands and converting it to a rough equivalent of crude oil takes much more in the way of energy, resources, and labor than it takes to drill for the same amount of conventional oil. Each year, therefore, as more of the liquid fuels supply is made up by tar sand extractives and other substitute fuels, larger fractions of the annual supply of energy, raw materials, and labor have to be devoted to the process of bringing liquid fuels to market, leaving a smaller portion of each of these things to be divided up among all other economic sectors. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Some of the effects of this process are obvious enough—for example, the spikes in food prices we’ve been having since 2005, as the increasing use of ethanol and biodiesel as liquid fuels means that grains and vegetable oils are being diverted from the food supply for use as feedstocks for fuel.  Many others are less obvious—for example, as energy prices have risen and energy companies have become Wall Street favorites, many billions of dollars that might otherwise have become capital for other industries have flowed into the energy sector instead.  Each of these effects, however, represents a drain on other sectors of the economy, and thus a force for change that sets countervailing processes into motion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those processes are a good deal more complex than the ones we’ve traced so far, since they involve competition for capital and other resources among different sectors of the economy, a struggle in which political and cultural factors play at least as large a role as economics.  Still, one result can be traced in the unexpected decline in petroleum consumption that has taken place in the United States since 2008, and that precisely parallels the similar decline that happened between 1975 and 1985 in response to a similar rise in oil prices.  To describe this process as demand destruction is an oversimplification; a dizzyingly complex array of factors, ranging from the TSA’s officially sanctioned habit of sexually molesting airline passengers, on the one hand, to shifts in teen fashion that are making driving uncool for the first time in a century on the other, have fed into the decline in oil consumption; still, the thing is happening, and it’s probably fair to say that the increasing impoverishment of most Americans is playing a very large role in it.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus the simple model of peak oil that dates from Hubbert’s time badly needs updating. Ironically, <i>The Limits to Growth</i>—the most accurate and thus, inevitably, the most maligned of the various guides to our unwelcome future offered up so far—provided the necessary insight decades ago. By the simple expedient of lumping resources, industrial production, and other primary factors into a single variable each, the <i>Limits to Growth</i> team avoided the fixation on detail that so often blinds people to systems behavior on the broad scale. Within the simplified model that resulted, it became obvious that limitless growth on a finite planet engenders countervailing processes that tend to restore the original state of the system. It became just as obvious that the most important of those processes was the simple fact that in any environment with finite resources and a finite capacity to absorb pollution, the costs of growth would eventually rise faster than the benefits, and force the global economy to its knees. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s what’s happening now.  What makes that hard to see at first glance is that the costs of growth are popping up in unexpected places; put too much stress on a chain and it’ll break, but the link that breaks isn’t necessarily the one closest to the source of stress.  The economies of the world’s industrial nations are utterly dependent on a steady supply of liquid fuels, and so a steady supply of liquid fuels they will have, even if every other sector of the economy has to be dumped into the hopper in order to keep the fuel flowing. As every other sector of the economy is dumped into that hopper, in turn, the demand for liquid fuels goes down, because when people who used to be employed by the rest of the economy can no longer afford to spend spring break in Mazatlan, or buy goods that have to be shipped halfway around the planet, or put gas in their cars, their share of petroleum consumption goes unclaimed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This process is, among other things, one of the main forces behind the disappearance of "bankable projects" discussed in last week’s post.  The reallocation of ever larger fractions of capital, resources, and labor to the production of liquid fuels represents a subtle drain on most other fields of economic endeavor, driving costs up and profits down across the board. The one exception is the financial sector, since increasing the amount of paper value produced by purely financial transactions involves no additional capital, resources, and labor—a derivative worth ten million dollars costs no more to produce, in terms of real inputs, than one worth ten thousand, or for that matter ten cents. Thus financial transactions increasingly become the only reliable source of profit in an otherwise faltering economy, and the explosive expansion of abstract paper wealth masks the contraction of real wealth. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When systems theorists explain that the behavior of whole systems can be counterintuitive, this is the sort of thing they have in mind. It’s quite possible that as we move further past the peak of conventional petroleum production, the consumption of petroleum products will continue to decline, so that when the ability to produce substitute fuels declines as well—as of course it will—the impact of the latter decline will be hard to trace. Ever more elaborate towers of hallucinatory wealth, ably assisted by reams of doctored government statistics, will project the illusion of a thriving economy onto a society in freefall; the stock market will wobble around its current level for a long time to come, booming and crashing on occasion as bubbles come and go; meanwhile a growing fraction of the population will be forced to drop out of the official economy altogether, and be left to scrape together whatever sort of living they can in some updated equivalent of the Hoovervilles and tarpaper shacks of the 1930s. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No doubt the glossy magazines that make their money by marketing a rose-colored image of the future to today’s privileged classes will hail declines in petroleum demand as a sign that some golden age of green technology is at hand, and trot out a flurry of anecdotes to prove it; all they’ll have to do is ignore the hard figures showing that demand for renewable-energy systems is dropping too, as people who have no money find solar panels as unaffordable as barrels of oil. For that matter, the people who are insisting in today’s media that the United States will achieve energy independence by 2050 may just turn out to be right; it’s just that this will happen because the US will have devolved into a bankrupt Third World nation in which the vast majority of the population lives in abject poverty and petroleum consumption has dropped to a sixth or less of its current level. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s not the future that comes out of a simplistic reading of Hubbert’s curve—though it’s only fair to mention that it’s the future that some of us who used to be on the fringes of the peak oil scene have been discussing all along. Still, it looks increasingly likely that this is the sort of future we’re going to get, and it’s certainly the one that current trends appear to be creating around us right now. No doubt cornucopians in 2050 will be insisting that everything is actually just fine, the drastic impoverishment of most of the American people is just the sort of healthy readjustment a capitalist economy needs from time to time, and we’ll be going back to the Moon any day now, just as soon as we finish reopening the Erie Canal to mule-drawn barge traffic so that grain can get from the Midwest to the slowly drowning cities of the east coast. With any luck, though, the peak oil blogosphere—it’ll have morphed into printed newsletters by then, granted—will have long since noticed that whole system processes do in fact shape the way that the twilight of the petroleum age is unfolding.  How that is likely to affect the twilight of American empire will be central to the posts of the next several months. </div>

<span style="font-size: large">End of the World of the Week #28</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a repeated source of embarrassment for scientists of all kinds that the culture in which they live is so much less comfortable with hypothetical statements and tentative suggestions than the internal subculture of science tends to be.  Witness the embarrassment of the solar astronomers and atmospheric physicists who suggested, back in the late 1990s, that the upcoming solar cycle 23 might see some disruption of Earth-based electronics by the electromagnetic effects of solar flares. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was a reasonable supposition, since strong solar flares have a solid track record of frying sensitive electronic systems and disabling satellites. Still, it didn’t take long before their tentative suggestion was inflated into apocalyptic prophecy.  Web pages screamed that before cycle 23 was over, an immense solar flare would inevitably bring down the electrical grid worldwide, turning computers and other electronic devices into useless silicon fritters, and plunging the world into an instant dark age complete with roving hordes of starving survivors.  The popular online sport of apocalypse machismo—"I can imagine a cataclysm more horrifying than you can!"—went into overdrive on this one, spawning no end of highly colored accounts of just how everybody else was going to die. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As it happened, cycle 23 did see a couple of spectacular solar flares, including two of the largest ever measured, but none of the big ones happened to be pointed anywhere near Earth. (If the Earth’s orbit was as big around as a football stadium, remember, the Sun would be a beach ball sitting on the 50 yard line and the Earth would be a marble perched somewhere on the last row of bleachers.) When solar cycle 23 came to an end in December 2008, as a result, the Sun shone down on a world not noticeably more devastated than it had been when the cycle began. </div>

The reason that I say this is that Japan has been in what the rest of the world has called a 'Depression' or a 'Great Stagnation for the last 22 years and even during this period has still managed an average GDP growth (according to my slightly biased,cornucopian friend) of approximatly 1-1.5% per year,even with persistant deflation.Yet for most people things have got relatively worse.<br>For my part,when I got here in 2002 there were a vast number of easy to find and easy to acquire English teaching jobs.Things have changed dramatically! In the ensuing 10 years the oppertunities have contracted unbelieveably.On Mondays the Japan Times(the main English language newspaper) used to have between 2 and 3 pages of jobs(mainly English teaching),now there are maybe 5-10(rarely)jobs,with maybe 3 of those being English teaching.I look at this situation and come to the conclusion that because,in the private sector,spending on English language teaching is discretionary(there's a public sector too in elementary,JHS and SHS which is virtually unchanged with maybe a little decline)then people simply have less money to spend and so cut back on luxuries first(Being an eikaiwa(private English school) student used to be a sign of social prestige and wealth and therefore a luxury).When I first got here I lived very well ,now my existence is much more hand to mouth and precarious(though some of that is my own fault...).<br>Do you see my argument?Even though the wealth of this society has nominally increased,the amount of actual wealth owned by the general population is seen (anecdotally)to have decreased and that therefore maybe the increase has(maybe) been consumed by increased energy costs.Is that a fair enough conclusion?<br>I know that some people will point to last years disaster in Tohoku as maybe a factor but I can assure you the trend had been in process for a lot of years before that and hasn't substantially increased after ,though there was a jarring disconnect for about 2 months(no bread,butter,my favourite alcoholic beveridges disappearing from the shelves for prolonged periods and short term powercuts)things seem to have just continued their steady decline.<br><br><a href=#c6698557629341566422 title="comment permalink">6/27/12, 11:42 PM</a><br><br>

This is probably due to most people falling into the trap of specialisation. Ecologists aside, even the experts are specialists. Specialists become bogged down in detail and tend to miss the big picture. <br><br>I've noticed that experts in the media have been relying on this focus on the detail to soothe and dismiss arguments that they don't agree with. It is also then followed up with a display of value (e.g. I'm an expert). Their arguments are a mere puff.<br><br>Your background in ecology provides an antidote to this sort of thinking and I get why you asked us to read up on basic ecology. On an organic farm, you can't ignore the big picture. On the other hand, industrial farmers are all about keeping farms simple (just like a factory).<br><br>The other technique we employ here is that when things go wrong (as inevitably happens), we acknowledge the error. After the acknowledgement comes a post mortem analysis and we try and see whether there was anything to be learned from that error.<br><br>PS: This technique was employed yesterday to good effect after I accidentally squashed a plum and crab apple tree.

This post touches on something that's been bothering me as of late. <br>Basically, looking at the people around me, I've (painfully slowly) come to realize that the vast majority will never go through the "peak oil initiation", as you termed it last year. Instead, things will get worse and worse, and people will adapt as they go along, some doing better and some worse. <br>The progress meme will live on, most likely with the official line about how things are going getting more and more absurd and delusional, until one day, when it's far enough removed from everyone's daily existence as to be completely ignored and forgotten.<br><br>Nothing wrong with this per se, but I'm sure I'm not the only one hovering around the peak oil scene, who often thinks thoughts along the lines of "one day things will have gone bad enough that everyone will sit up, take notice and realize that this is what I was talking about and preparing for all along". That kind of vindication and sudden shift seems like just a variation of the apocalypse meme -- an abrupt break in what is otherwise a continuous development, and to the extent it happens, it will happen gradually and one individual at a time.<br><br>Just trying to structure my thoughts here, unashamedly in front of everyone...<br><br><a href=#c5124668526437213941 title="comment permalink">6/28/12, 2:17 AM</a><br><br>

The world is a cussed place.<br><br>Exponential growth was something I taught in biology classes as a very young man in the ‘60s, and I was persuaded by the ‘Limits to Growth’ hypothesis in the early 1970s. (BTW, the LG hypothesis is well summarised just now by your good self, if you don’t mind my saying so). I was dismissively sceptical in the early 1980s of the claims that ‘we’ (industrial civilization and my fellow technocrats) would provide modern resource consumption for everybody on the planet, and I absorbed the essential facts of climate change science in 1985. <br><br>Timing the oil depletion curve, however, did appear problematic, as did forecasting the end of the era of expansion, and these futures seemed somewhere beyond my own lifetime. The wakeup call came in early 2000 via Campbell &amp; Laherrere when the Hubbert curve for US production was clothed with new data and projected worldwide, but it was reading Jeremy Leggett’s book ‘Half Gone’, while on a plane going to work in 2005, that convinced me we were going to see imminent ructions. It was time I retired and stopped flying anyway. The notion seemed sufficiently explanatory: ‘peak oil’ was when we could no longer increase the amount we were getting out of the ground each year (despite the amount still left in the ground). <br><br>I mistakenly thought though, along with Leggett, that it would be the <b>perception</b> of the permanent end of oil expansion that would spook politics and the markets and ‘the public’ and bring about the first of the stepwise economic ‘crashes’. We are somewhere in there at the moment, but cunning plans and technological ‘magic’ still monopolise public discourse, and ‘normal’ continues as you describe. The decline and fall of the American empire might be happening as we speak, but is anybody going to believe it, at least in my lifetime?

Another factor that will be playing a role in the future decline of the same, and one that hasn't been given a lot of attention, is the already noticeable crumbling of highway infrastructure. Since road repair and maintenance is based on fuel taxes, less consumption means less money for maintenance. Less money for maintenance means road serviceability will decline. As serviceability declines, fewer people will risk taking their cars on the pothole-ridden roads, which means less money for maintenance, further decline in highway serviceability, and less driving. And so forth--a vicious cycle.

Yes, I'm old enough to remember the '70s. <br><br>So far, the peakists' predictions, (at least the ones not involving lizard people) starting from the late '90s have been hitting pretty close to 1.000. The effects of peak would be masked by "above ground" factors; would be denied by TPTB; would be blamed on prominent politicians; would correlate with economic contraction; would inspire resource wars. <br><br>One of the ones I found counterintuitive was that the economy would exhibit DEflation. Our friend Stoneleigh nailed that one. The deflation is just getting started, by the way. <br><br>One aspect of all this, which was covered in a short course I took in 1971, was from the study of sociology. Our lecturer described how the indigenous people of North America reacted to the destruction of their way of life. It fragmented their religious beliefs and practices. <b>They went from a more or less consistent and organized philosophical view of their world, to a larger number of local cults.</b> A trend of which we see only perhaps the tiniest thread currently, but one that I expect to really take off soon. <br><br>And Lauren, I really want to come visit your place some time, but for various local reasons I have not been able to do so.

The higher prices have resulted in much demand destruction in the West but at the same time that money has been used investing in oil development. Whilst this development has not seen the world "flooded with oil" as the cornucopian insisted would happen the production gains have been greater than the peak oil community had expected. A combination of reduced demand from high prices and a growing supply in unconventional oil (more accurately liquid production) has been the chief contributor of this extended plateau. <br><br>However, to believe this liquid plateau can last decades seems rather fanciful. As time goes on the geologic factors constraining supply will begin to play a greater force in determining production numbers than increased investment. In other words there are two forces at work when looking at liquid supply. There are geological forces that act as a drag to oil production while investment is the counter force to the geological force. The peak oil crowd insist geology is the determining factor and the investment/money force cannot overcome this geological force. The cornucopian crowd insist the opposite is true, that investment (and human ingenuity) will <b>ALWAYS</b> win out. At this moment of time, both forces would appear to be matching each other fairly equally hence the plateauing production.<br><br>However it is my belief that overtime the geological force will exceed the investment force on production resulting in declining production rates. Plus if we consider the economic system we find this system has been weakened considerably in the last five years so its ability to support the investment side will be reduced in the coming years. Also for production numbers to maintain this high rate and not decline sharply the economic system has to be maintained. <br><br>As we live in a zero sum world (perhaps it is even slightly less than zero sum) then the facade that all is well and everything is still growing can be maintained. But if there is a breakdown in the financial system then it is likely this will result in economic or other systemic failures which will cause failures in the oil system.<br><br>Now I am not well-versed in system analysis but one thing I do know about complex systems is they operate with various negative feedback (stabilising) loops and positive feedback (self-reinforcing) loops. Complex systems also contain tipping points where the system reacts to a certain stress in a disproportionate manner once a certain threshold of stress is reached. It is my belief the overall economic system is under stress and the system is using various negative feedback loops to maintain its structural integrity. However as these stress build up (which they will) I am sure there will be some tipping point where some sudden change occurs as the various negative feedback loops can longer cope with the stress load. It is for this reason I can subscribe to the stair-case model you put forward of relative stability followed by periods of sudden declines. However after the next big drop I have a hard time believing the governments can pretend things are as good as they were before. They may be able to fool the public today but a lie is only believable if it is sort of close to the truth, not miles off. Once the disconnect gets large enough you cannot lie and have people believe you. To attempt to do so and insist on it would mean the speaker loses credibility. At most, the government can downplay the level of decline that took place.<br><br><a href=#c5440201105648833079 title="comment permalink">6/28/12, 8:38 AM</a><br><br>

Even if industry manages to keep it ticking over for a few more years by pressure-washing gravel, the big picture is the one that matters. <br><br>But it does appear reasonable that the core of system will hold together well enough over the next few decades for certain competitive and privileged people to go on living much as they have, while an increasing number are cast outside the gates. That’s always been true, and is particularly true in poorer societies. That’s going to be an ugly process to watch – the increasing separation of the have-nots and the have-mores. I wonder when the pretense that we can all have it all will be publically jettisoned? When will politicians and leaders start to acknowledge more directly that we are a society of winners and losers and that some children will be left behind after all? That sort of language was much more prevalent before the current age of illusion.

In addition, technical advances (AI, robotics) may remove the need for many jobs.<br><br>- The financial sector can artificially increase GDP with very little consumption of resources.<br><br><a href=#c2691326414718952481 title="comment permalink">6/28/12, 12:45 PM</a><br><br>

Slightly off topic, but I thought it might interest you: over here there's talk of a grand effort by builders, investers, large companies and the government to start the large-scale...[*drumroll*] <i>demolishment</i> of office buildings.<br>The story in a nutshell: in the past decades, building office buildings was thought of as a certain way to make money. The growing economy would make sure there would always be a demand, so all a municipality had to do was make a fast buck selling land to developers, who would then make a big buck selling the land, now plus an office building, to investment funds, who would make long-term bucks renting it out to companies, who would then create jobs, supposedly out of thin air, thus adding to the tax revenues. There would have been glorious bucks for everybody, if only the economy had done its part.<br>As it is, there are huge numbers of empty office blocks dotting the Dutch landscape. Letting them crumble where they stand is cheaper than tearing them down or repurposing them, so crumble they do. <br>They are waste capital, costing everybody involved with them money.<br><br>Now the plan is to start a 'wrecking fund' into which everybody owning or building an office building is obliged put some cash. The money is then used to reward those who demolish or repurpose office blocks so that that becomes profitable.<br><br>Now if I understood <i>The Long Descent</i> correctly, purposefully destroying waste capital might be the smartest thing a society can do at this point, although this is probably a textbook case of 'too little, too late'. Still, it's interesting to see catabolism in action.<br><br><a href=#c4772275093494603457 title="comment permalink">6/28/12, 1:09 PM</a><br><br>

That position is occupied by health care expenses, which have ballooned from 5% to around 20% of GDP and continue rising steeply. While some portion of that rise can be blamed on greed (i.e. unfair salaries for executives of hospitals, insurance firms, and pharmaceutical companies), a large fraction of it has a more intractable cause.<br><br>Advances in modern medicine have largely not enabled us to live longer, healthier lives without treatment. Rather these advances have produced expensive long-term physical and chemical treatments that succeed in prolonging life by 5-20 years, often in a state far from optimum health. If this trend continues, we will continue to toss more of our economic resources into the medical "hopper" as new technologies emerge, trying to keep ourselves alive just a little longer.<br><br>I suspect that if and when rising energy costs eclipse rising health care costs as the primary driver of economic contraction, we will see more media and political attention on "peak oil" issues. Not that said attention will succeed in changing anything. <br><br>I guess my point (trying unsuccessfully to be concise) is that I feel the current lack of debate surrounding peak oil is not entirely outright denial; as high as energy costs are, they are not yet the primary financial concern for a majority of Americans.<br><br><a href=#c668375106975083312 title="comment permalink">6/28/12, 1:45 PM</a><br><br>

As for the book, hmm. No way I could get the "For Dummies" franchise or its equivalents to hire me for one of their books -- I'm way too far out on the cultural fringe for their tastes -- but I'll consider the possibility of a primer, in simple language, that could be produced cheaply and gotten into circulation.

Among other things, there are immense sectors of the economy -- think of tourism, the world's largest single industry, for example -- that can and will be catabolized to keep more critical sectors going. Seneca's entitled to his opinion, but history isn't on his side, you know. <br><br>Don, an excellent point! Of course you're quite right; decreasing funding for road maintenance is one of the ways in which the cannibalization of the rest of the economy will circle back to cause declines in petroleum consumption. You get today's gold star for catching that. <br><br>Fleecenik, of course! The cornucopians will simply insist that the regrettable rise in crime, banditry, insurgency, etc. is a minor speedbump on the road to a bright shiny future, and it's going to go away soon, anyway. <br><br>Avery, welcome to Third World America. Our grid is a ramshackle mess, not unlike the rest of American society. <br><br>Nathan, another excellent point. There are already very curious divergences between the amount of US oil production from Texas reported by the Texas railroad commission and the amount being reported by the relevant federal bureaucracy. <br><br>Rashakor, I'd say rather that the laws of thermodynamics, Le Chatelier's principle, and the law of equilibrium are all conceptual models, in different spheres of knowledge, of a common pattern in experienced reality. Still, to some extent that's just philosophical quibbling. <br><br>Jose, I didn't have the computer skills to do that, so I simply went back through history to try to find any society that overshot its resource base and survived. I didn't find any, so drew the same conclusion you did. <br><br>Lauren, that's got to be a ghastly experience -- especially knowing that it's a short-term bubble that's going to pop soon, leaving a permanently disfigured landscape and epic poverty behind it. <br><br>Jim, it's already happening. The US is full of groups of people with radically different ways of looking at the world, who can barely talk to one another because their basic presuppositions are so different.

What I'm suggesting is that petroleum consumption will decline ahead of petroleum production, so that we'll never quite get around to hitting the brick wall of too little oil for too many cars, tractors, etc.; instead, the cars will be abandoned, the tractors sold for scrap, and the economics of running an industrial society just won't work out any more, so that the last umpty-however barrels of oil will sit forever in the ground because it's impossible to make a profit extracting them any more. <br><br>Charles, thank you!<br><br>Yupped, that's a fascinating question. My guess is that the current holders of wealth and privilege are facing an assortment of horrific fates in the years ahead; they have no concept of the fragility of their privileged status, a whopping case of entitlement, and -- based on personal conversations I've had -- a complete inability to recognize that their paid thugs could very easily point a gun in the wrong direction and take everything. They don't know how to build the kind of relationships that foster personal loyalty, which is the foundation for a feudal society; all they can do is throw around money, and you can check history to see how well that works. <br><br>Simon, I'm considering a series of posts and a book on systems theory, but that isn't this one; what's next on the agenda is the rest of the exploration of the decline and fall of the US empire. <br><br>Jason, that's what I expect to see, too. People will be babbling about algal biodiesel long after they've forgotten how to spell the words. <br><br>Reaper, that's the common fallacy of high tech -- if you only notice how much energy it takes to power the end product, sure, it looks easy. How much energy, raw materials, and labor had to go into manufacturing the product, including extracting and purifying all the raw materials, maintaining the clean rooms, etc? How much has to go into maintaining the global network without which the end product is a lump of useless plastic and silicon? In a world where there are too many depands on every available scrap of energy, raw materials and labor, do you really think people are going to privilege thumb drives over, say, food and shelter? While you're right that some of the things that are lost, and some that are kept, will doubtless be surprising, that chestnut -- which keeps on being proposed here every couple of months -- strikes me as way off in the direction of wishful thinking. <br><br>MawKernewek, that's my guess.<br><br><a href=#c6641140085415924953 title="comment permalink">6/28/12, 2:26 PM</a><br><br>

Free-energy diagrams for chemical compounds look similar to what you describe. Most compounds are stable- until they're not. An example would be an explosive. If you push it too far past its point of stability (such as with a shock), it goes dramatically unstable. Natural systems have parallels. If you push them too far, they tumble out of their zone of stability, and fall into some totally different space. Climatologists, et al, typically refer to these as tipping points.<br><br>A point I like to make about complex systems is to think about the two space shuttle disasters. In both cases, we had complex systems which were operating perfectly, until one single part failed (in one case, an O-ring, and in the other case, a tile.) Then the entire sysem failed to work in a very short time.<br><br>On another point - far too much weight is assigned to Hubbert's curve.

Still, watch the aftermath; I suspect that Obama's just lost his last shot at a second term, because the arrogant absurdity of claiming to deal with the fact that people can't afford health insurance by requiring them to buy it anyway is an amazing giveaway to the GOP on the brink of a tightly contested election. <br><br>I can all too easily imagine the attack ads: a couple sitting around the kitchen table in 2014, say, discovering that they can't afford health insurance and still pay the mortgage, and the law requires them to pay for the health insurance, so they're going to lose their house.

Right now health care, including its insurance and pharmaceutical aspects, is arguably the most corrupt sector of the American economy, and has spent the last fifty years engaging in spectacular profiteering at the expense of the rest of us. That's going to change, if only because a bankrupt nation can't afford the world's most overpriced health care system. <br><br>Tuba, an American Spring will happen the same way the Arab Spring did, with massive funding from one or more foreign powers who have an interest in destabilizing the status quo. If that suggests that the end result may not be entirely in the best interests of the people, you're beginning to catch on. Thus it's crucial to make the changes that have to be made beginning with your own life, where you have some control over the outcome.<br><br><a href=#c3835007039782531553 title="comment permalink">6/28/12, 2:33 PM</a><br><br>

It's just terrific though to see such a view being applied so effectively to the broader situation of energy use. We're following closely related paths here--my most recent post at Beyond this Brief Anomaly (http://beyondthisbriefanomaly.org/2012/06/21/energy-density-and-the-prospects-for-renewably-powered-societies/) deals with closely related themes also explicitly from a systems perspective.<br><br>It's noteworthy that the value and utility of approaching energy situations in systems terms goes well beyond better appreciating supply-demand behaviour--in fact, the systems view is fundamental to the very concept of energy in the first place. The energy concept is itself a resultant of viewing physical phenomena specifically in systems terms, rather than in terms of discrete entities. Of course, we're almost completely unaware of this when we talk about energy now <em>as if</em> it's some sort of discrete entity. This isn't just an obscure philosophical point--it has profound practical implications. My own assessment is that this absence of appreciation of energy as a systems concept is central to the complete absence of any acknowledgement of EROI in any of the International Energy Agency's publications. It's also why International <em>Energy</em> Agency (and <em>Energy</em> Information Administration for that matter) is such a classic misnomer. International <em>Fuel</em> Agency would be closer to the mark. To earn its present name, it would need to engage in the type of inquiry that you deal with in this post.<br><br>All the best,<br>Josh<br><br><a href=#c512640243158730374 title="comment permalink">6/28/12, 3:07 PM</a><br><br>

It doesn't matter if it sustains 100,000 villagers, populations of rare animals and plants, and is a catchment area. If it's not making money, it's not making sense. <br><br>The same goes with water. As floods surge through rivers and across floodplains, emptying into the sea, there are a whole bunch of people who say that this is just going to waste. The problem is though, this process actually injects nutrients from the terrestial into the marine environment and sustains reefs and the like which are the ocean equivalents of rainforests; biodiversity hotspots. Damming these waterflows may help you in the short term, but I dread the consequences of endangering the reefs of the world and the immense impacts on static and migratory sea life. This is obliviousness to whole systems at best, and selfish ignorance at worst. <br><br>To add clarity to my understanding of the world, I like to make up words, and I've combined symbiosis with homeostasis to make symbiostasis - the process of to-ing anf fro-ing that sustains all relationships within the biosphere. It is my way of conceiving the actions of whole systems and process of (not progress) evolution. In this way, I'm using symbiosis in a general way, to suggest the interconnectedness of all things on Earth, not just a relationship between two organism, but the relationships between all organisms and their physical effects on air and water currents. A large forest for instance has an immense effect on things like air flow, water drainage and humidity which in turn effects, where and how, cold and warm fronts interact and therefore cloud formation, rainfall patterns and so on and so forth. These flows, and the organisms who must live within their parameters - whilst also giving them their definition, are a part of what I've called, for my own sake, symbiostasis.<br><br><a href=#c1180651024259522500 title="comment permalink">6/28/12, 7:00 PM</a><br><br>

As it so happens, I've been fascinated by homeostasis in complex systems for a long time -- specifically the cussedness of humans encountering "safety" equipment and precautions. There's a guy called J Adams who did a lot of work on this one. <br><br>Basically, the literature supports a fairly obvious (when you think about it for more than 3 seconds) pattern: every person tends to have an idiosyncratic "risk thermostat" set to a certain (perceived) point of hazard. If you, say, change external conditions (or inner perceptions!) by installing an airbag or antilock brakes on a person's car (or just tell them you have!), the response is cussed indeed. Drivers tend to drive faster and handle the car with a bit more panache, according to their inner risk thermostat. <br><br>The famous study is the Berlin (iirc) taxi driver study, in which a fleet of taxis were equipped with sophisticated antilock braking systems, and a subset of drivers were told about the new systems, while another subset was not, or was led to believe that their cars had not been upgraded yet. Anyway, the onboard telemetry revealed that those who believed their cars to have ABS started driving faster and braking harder: they *absorbed* the incremental safety improvement by behaving a little more riskily until they had restore risk homeostasis (in their own perception).<br><br>Similarly, straightening roads, widening the radius of curves, removing obstacles to long sightlines, etc -- all intended to improve "safety" -- all tend to result in higher driving speeds, rendering life more dangerous for e.g. pedestrians and cyclists in the area of the "improvement". When seatbelts were first required by law for drivers only, the immediate result was a spike in passenger deaths -- safer-feeling drivers drove a bit more riskily, and unprotected passengers experienced more fatal crashes. And so on. It's really, really hard to *make* people safe!<br><br>There are a few other interesting studies, which you can track down without too much effort; but the basic lesson is about countervailing forces, very much like the adaptation of bacteria to antibacterial treatments and the evolution of bugs to pesticides (whether external or genetically jiggered). When we push a complex system at a single control point -- treating it like a simple machine -- it tends to push back. (A related cussedness is the Jevons Paradox we all know and love: increase efficiency, thus decreasing the cost of energy, and people tend to consume more and more energy until they are once more paying the max cost they feel comfortable with!)<br><br>Road safety campaigns that treat a neighbourhood or town as a *whole system*, rather than trying to find single control points to push, have had more success; it turns out that global design parameters (the overall design and "feel" of a cityscape) affect people's behaviour in subtle ways. There's a lot of literature on this as well, on everything from "traffic calming" to urban forms and practises that tend to discourage vandalism and crime. There's a famous old book called "A Pattern Language" that explores some of the subtleties of *influence via design* (a kind of societal permaculture) vs single-point interventions which tend to hit the cussedness wall (aka diminishing returns and unforeseen consequences). Pls excuse the length, but I'm rather keen on this topic and JMG's latest ties it in to bigger pictures very nicely.<br><br><a href=#c4489965780034663180 title="comment permalink">6/28/12, 11:11 PM</a><br><br>

This is already happening, in a way, to me :-) <br><br>I'm living on very hilly terrain and my middle-aged knees are tired and easily strained. But I'm ethically vexed by driving our work truck for minor errands (it's a 2.6l Mazda but on these country roads we're not doing much better than 19 mpg, drat). The guilt is uncomfortable. So I'm thinking of putting a motor assist on my cargo bike: pride takes 2nd place to mobility :-)<br><br>I have some choices. Here are two I'm considering. I can buy a good, Canadian-made e-bike conversion kit (installed) for about $2000. But setting up our little homestead has eaten a lot of my capital and my pension is not as secure as I'd like -- I'm feeling a little worried about cash flow. Plus, the range on the Ebike option is a bit limited for my circumstances -- a 30 km round trip with cargo may be more than it can handle. It's not a sure thing.<br><br>OTOH, I can buy a Chinese-made 2-stroke gas engine retrokit for about $175 incl postage (no, that isn't a typo), and it will get something like 150 mpg (I think that's about 60 kpl), so the cost in liquid fuel is minor and the guilt factor way smaller than driving the truck. I can (still) get fuel on the island, so my range is theoretically unlimited. And it's less weight on the bike :-) I don't know how to do the math, but it might possibly use less energy in 3 years than the energetic cost of manufacturing the fancy E-bike kit with its Li-Ion battery and so forth. Who knows.<br><br>OTOH, it's noisy, and pollutes a bit. But... I'm feeling unwealthy (though of course not poor, because in non-cash terms we are very well off indeed). So here's the point where principle becomes (a) very expensive and (b) interferes with actual function, as in wanting to get the "green" ebike kit (to make a statement, to show the flag, because it's so darned kewl) even though its range may not be sufficient to make the journeys I want to make and complete the tasks I want to complete.<br><br>I'm leaning towards the gas engine -- me, who calls them Infernal Combustion and was a bicycle purist when I was a bit younger and on somewhat flatter topography! And that's where the "green energy revolution" cheerleaders I think are overly optimistic: at this historical moment their offerings are generally "overpriced" compared to severely downscaled versions of the old tech -- such as a 60cc two stroke velomobile kit, as opposed to a $60K 4 tonne SUV. Most of us, for whom price really is an issue, will tend to choose "less of the fossil option" because it's still so much cheaper than the dandy new tech option. This bugs me, but I can feel myself making the decision... in just the same way that any person with limited resources would: the money I can save by sticking with a minimised version of the old technology would buy a lot of food.<br><br>Anyway, clearly I'm feeling a bit compromised and tetchy about it, 'cos the article twanged a nerve there.<br><br><a href=#c1604739888081979824 title="comment permalink">6/28/12, 11:33 PM</a><br><br>

It is written from an ecological and historical perspective. Well worth your time. (This was in reference to your comment to Jose).<br><br>On another note, I've never quite understood why people have to go from one extreme to another. For example, a meme I see repeated here regularly is that if your office fauna job disappears then the only alternative is unrelenting hard work. This is simply not the case and these opinions are usually offered from a base of no experience.<br><br>People forget their history. Working in agriculture, you do go through periods of long hard work, but there are other times when not much is really going on – like over here in Winter, where it is clean up and fertilise time! It is a more natural cycle for humans and I can see from hindsight that the whole 8.30am to 5.30pm meme is an artificial construct. It is a pattern so deeply entrenched that no one seems to even question it.<br><br>Also, plant and animal availability means that you have a world of plants and animals to choose from right now. People don't quite understand that a diverse farm, whilst not being efficient, is actually a resilient farm. Also, diversity means that ripening periods are spread over a longer period of time thus spreading out the work and providing some insulation from weather shocks, which happen regardless of your best intentions.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c5197905962384216300 title="comment permalink">6/29/12, 3:25 AM</a><br><br>

I'm exploring the peak oil controversy for the first time, and it's been surprisingly difficult to find clear and coherent predictions from either side of the "non-debate." Or perhaps my Googling abilities are sub-par. Either way, this cleared up a lot of things for me, and gave me a framework for understanding the Hubbert Curve much less literally.<br><br>Reading your blog, though, I've often been confused by the certainty with which you gloss over alternate energy sources as if they weren't really worth considering. For example, here: "...when the ability to produce substitute fuels declines as well—as of course it will—the impact of the latter decline will be hard to trace." Either you're overlooking something, or you know some things I don't. So I was wondering if you might be able to point me to the sources or arguments that have led you to dismiss alternate energy so completely -- either things you've written, or other trustworthy authors on the issue.

Notice that the breeders got fixated on one variable without paying attention to the effects on the whole system -- a common story. <br><br>Cherokee, I've always thought that the notion that "office job" and "exhausting manual labor" are the only two options is an exact equivalent of the notion that continued progress along current lines and total catastrophe are the only two options.

What I dismiss is the claim that we can run our current society, which depends on extravagant use of highly concentrated fuels, on the much more diffuse and intermittent energy we can get from renewable sources. I've discussed the reasons for that in several of my books and about a hundred blog posts here; you might also go back through Tom Murphy's blog <a href=http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/ rel=nofollow>Do The Math</a>, which covers in detail the reasons why alternative energy sources will never provide more than a small fraction of the energy we currently use. <br><br>Tyler, the problem with most of today's organic farming is that it's become a source of boutique crops for the upper middle class, and as that class goes under, it's going to lose most of its cash flow. That's why the backyard gardens are so crucial -- they're there to maintain the tradition, keep skills and knowledge alive, and not incidentally keep a steady flow of good nutrition coming into households, while corporate agriculture finishes its saurian life cycle and lumbers off to die.<br><br><a href=#c2707938857858160871 title="comment permalink">6/29/12, 9:27 AM</a><br><br>

I start by explaining that the number of people in a society who are not engaged in farming is determined by how many people each farmer can feed. If each farmer can only feed himself then everyone is a farmer. If the farmer can grow enough food to feed two people then half of the society is free to pursue other activities. At ten to one 90% of the population can become priests or warriors, sculptors or accountants, etc. I usually try to frame the 90% as 'specialists' and their activities as the 'real economy' to help people understand the economic dependence on energy, in this case calories from food.<br><br> Then I draw the connection to fossil fuels and their EROEI. From the 100:1 oil in West Texas and Saudi Arabia 80 years ago to the 10:1 off shore rigs like Deep Water Horizon to the 5:1 or 3:1 for tar sands and lower still for oil shale. I explain that technology extends our reach which allows us to access more remote and lower quality fuels like the deep water Brazilian field Tupi but that extended reach doesn't come for free. It costs more to develop and process those resources resulting in a lower EROEI.<br><br> When I'm sure that they have really gotten the concept I explain that we started out with an economy fully based on renewable energy in the form of agriculture (quibbles about sustainable agriculture aside for the moment) and that when we discovered how to utilize fossil fuels we aggressively perused them because of their much higher EROEI. Since we went after the most abundant and accessible high quality fuels first we are now chasing smaller, harder to access, poorer quality fuels. This is exactly equivalent to reducing the amount of food that a farmer can grow which reduces the number of specialists that can be supported. The falling EROEI results in exactly what we are seeing happen in the metaphor: a shortage of food and a surplus of specialist. Or in modern economic speak high inflation (food and energy) and high unemployment (surplus of specialists). <br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br><a href=#c5480243637927399446 title="comment permalink">6/29/12, 9:34 AM</a><br><br>

The myths roll from one end of the spectrum to the other sowing the seeds of fear. As usual, the truth lies somewhere in between.<br><br>The ripening here of fruit and vegetables really does occur over a period of many months (all year really) because of all the different varieties growing. This past year has seen a massive increase in the number of self-seeded varieties too (a bit of slackness on my part) and it is really quite funny to see them popping up literally all over the place. I found an apple seedling today.<br><br>PS: Another wombat has finally turned up to call the place home. I’ve missed having a grumpy wombat loitering around the place.<br><br>Hi everyone,<br><br>I have a couple of almond trees that have yet to go deciduous in mid-winter, despite the rest of the orchard going deciduous. Does anyone have any idea why this may be the case? They are in a sunny spot, but so too are a lot of other trees.<br><br>Hi DeAnander,<br><br>Not to stress, I'm no purist and would go for the small motor option on your push bike. Adaption is the best course in most situations and 63km/l is truly remarkable economy. The LiPo batteries are incredibly complex to manufacture and won’t really last that long on an electric vehicle given that they are regularly completely discharged (no battery is made to be completely discharged, people confuse a batteries life cycle with liquid fuel tanks when they are not the same at all). At least a small two stroke motor can be repaired and will have a long life if looked after.<br><br>Hi Phil,<br><br>The varieties of tomatoes commercially available are grown and picked so that they can travel well without bruising. Taste is not a consideration. For fruit to ripen, it requires sunlight and heat to produce the sugars that give the fruit their flavour. However, ripe fruit is also very soft and does not travel well, which is why it is generally unavailable. <br><br>So, you have been trained very subtly over time to pick fruit based on how it looks. The green fruit is generally gassed with stuff like ethylene (yes, the same stuff as used in welders) to give the fruit some colour.<br><br>Ha! I could go on about the soil they are grown in too and the effect it has on the final product but I don't want to scare you. <br><br>Hi Andrew,<br><br>I live with solar PV in an off the grid arrangement. Renewable energy is only massively promoted by people who have no contact with it on a day to day basis. Yeah, it's great, but it won’t power an average person’s household. Over here the average household uses about 17kW/h per day. I'm happy to live with about 3.5kW/h per day (with a 3.4kW PV array). Being only a week from the winter solstice there are only two lights in the house on right now. It suits me, but it wouldn't be for everyone. I will say no more on the subject.<br><br>Hi Adrian,<br><br>If everyone is planting corn and there's a drought, well time to plant another type of crop. Seriously, they can't keep that up for too long, soil is not an inexhaustible resource.<br><br>Hi MawKernewek,<br><br>As a general note, I can't speak for the US situation but, it is illegal in this country to offer interest rates on loans greater than 48%.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c7086332814448523821 title="comment permalink">6/30/12, 2:28 AM</a><br><br>

We've passed peak oil (conventional), and the only reason we currently aren't sliding down into the abyss is that we are now extracting unconventional oil.

Very good. My take, as I've mentioned a good many times already, is that we're facing a decline one to three centuries in length, followed by a dark age of maybe another four to six centuries.

It looks like a mutual fund. <br><br>Dltrammel, thanks for the link! That's normal in a Third World economy, by the way -- a very large number of people are employed off the books, or in other ways that don't show up in official statistics. <br><br>Mustard, Liebig's law says nothing about collapse, despite the way it's been manhandled by recent collapseniks. What it says is simply that the maximum level of growth is determined by the scarcest ingredient. That could well be confidence and trust -- and a sharp downturn in that could cause a sharp decrease in the economy -- but that's not the same thing as collapse. <br><br>DeAnander, please do start such a blog. It would be very useful to have a running account of just how many things are being tossed into the dumpster!<br><br>Reaper, a BBS using packet radio technology would be entirely workable, until the infrastructure needed to keep you supplied with computer components goes away; at that point it's salvage time, and eventually enough computers give out that you're back to the old-fashioned message traffic system. Mind you, as a transitional technology, a global packet radio BBS would likely be a very good thing, but you'd want to make sure to keep up the skills and knowledge base so that you could discard it gracefully when it finally sunsets out. <br><br>Michael, my guess is that every last economically accessible drop will be extracted and burnt by people who simply don't care about the consequences. If any of those processes matter to you, now's the time to find substitutes. <br><br>Raven, you'll notice that none of the people who are promoting that line of thinking are volunteering to go clean up the mess at Fukushima Daiichi.

I've always been of the opinion that people who support nuclear power ought to volunteer to store the wastes in their basements. If it's as safe, clean, etc. as they say it is, what's to worry? <br><br>Allison, my guess is that the economics of nuclear power (unaffordable without massive government subsidies, on a scale that governments increasingly can't afford) will put an end to the nuclear age long before protests will. <br><br>Cherokee, glad to hear of the Return of the Wombat! As for self-seeded varieties, what's not to love? We get volunteer tomatoes every year, and inevitably they're stronger and more productive than the nursery plants we bring home to add to the mix of varieties. <br><br>Chris, good heavens, we're talking about something that will unfold over decades, and is only just getting under way in scattered places. If you want to move to the Rust Belt now, you need to choose your location well, and have a job you can take with you. <br><br>Dltrammel, thanks for the heads up!

Aerojet/GenCorp owns a large facility near Sacramento, which is becoming redundant since the end of the space program. Now much of this land is a Superfund site and intense cleanup is necessary to save local groundwater from continued contamination from the underground plume of toxic chemicals. Nevertheless, GenCorp has spun off Easton Development, a company devoted to real estate development of the land. One of the current light rail stations is near the planned development and Easton sponsored a public meeting with presentations and opportunity to comment. <br>The essence of the presentations was that Easton planned several developments on the former Aerojet land and that the one near the Hazel Ave. station would be a “Complete Community”, the current buzzword for planned communities that integrate high density housing, retail, commercial, workplaces, and transit, and transportation infrastructure incorporating the “Complete Street.” The “Complete Street” concept includes wider sidewalks with separation from the street by grass strips, trees, etc., bike lanes, curb extensions at corners to slow traffic and make crossing safer, planned transit corridors, and a number of other features to make walking, biking or taking transit more hospitable. I think these were the sort of provisions that have been recently trimmed out of the federal Transportation bill. (Because we know suggesting people might walk three blocks for a gallon of milk instead of getting into their Escalade is equivalent to using the flag to wipe mud off your bicycle.)<br>The talks were amply illustrated with photos of similar developments elsewhere and artist’s conceptions, maps, etc. Needless to say, the “Complete Community” is a reinvention of the “town”. Progress indeed.<br>Missing from the whole talk was any discussion of practical obstacles. It was simply assumed that the economy would improve, that all of this new housing, retail and work space will be needed in the next 20-25 years and that the funds would be available to build it. Even the most concrete obstacle, the need to complete cleanup of the site, which may take more than 10 years, was glossed over. Remember that the Sacramento area has been hard hit by the recession. There are many foreclosures and much empty retail, including entire shopping malls left uncompleted. I was really left wondering about the purpose of the meeting—which included a free pasta dinner—since those attending were local citizens, not movers and shakers of any kind. I think the Easton people are just trying to create some buzz; get people thinking the whole project is a good idea before any hard questions of permits, subsidies, etc. start to muddy the waters.<br><br><a href=#c4393903875929566860 title="comment permalink">6/30/12, 12:26 PM</a><br><br>

Glad to hear that you and Sara are OK. The high temperatures sounded quite extreme even for here which regularly gets a few days per year over 40+ degrees Celsius.<br><br>There must have been some serious winds as well to knock over all of those trees.

Yeah, I ended up with 50kg (110 pounds) of tomatoes a few months ago from about 50 heirloom plants (kept finding more of them, for a few weeks until even the chooks had had enough!). It made for a lot of tomato chutney. I'm having to seriously consider setting up a cantina in my shed to store all of the preserves + preserving equipment as it is taking over the kitchen! With the seed saving I've just been letting nature do its thing, bringing in the mulch and compost, plus simply throwing around the tomatoes and gone to seed vegetables. It's amazing what is turning up: carrots; broccoli; nasturtiums; potatoes; mizuna; bok choy; and celery to name a few.

My horticulturist friends in Oregon have not found this string of cold wet summers to be any kind of a good thing. <br><br>Alternative energy -- I look at ecological biochemistry. Microbes have proven incredibly adaptable at extracting energy from many different sources. They have had billions of years and very short generation times to evolve pretty much anything that can work. And where the fossil fuels naturally reach the atmosphere, they do burn them. They burn naturally occurring methane, inorganic fuels, and of course are expert at using sunlight to drive several different kinds of photosynthesis. Some things they have never used:<br><br>Nuclear energy. Even in naturally concentrated deposits, nothing uses the energy from nuclear reactions to fuel its metabolism. Nor has any microbe ever invented cold fusion. If it were possible, there's no reason why a microbe would not be able to evolve the enzymes and paladium catalysts to power itself on an atom-by-atom scale. Never happened. Biochemistry all functions on redox and electron transfer, nothing nuclear. <br><br>Zero-point energy or any of the many other pie-in-the-sky fantasies about free limitless energy everywhere you look.<br><br>Happy thoughts. All biochemistry functions on physical processes. No magic has ever been detected to yield a net energy gain for a cell.<br><br>So all these innovators, given unimaginably long time scales, have powered themselves by sunlight and geochemistry, including fossil fuels. Nothing else. I take this as a pretty good sign that in the long run and the big picture, nothing else works. They don't even use winds, tides, and rivers for anything but transportation, not for anabolic energy. <br><br>And as for sunlight, they consistently only convert a few percent of it into net usable Gibbs Free Energy. Again, why have they not become more efficient? Probably because in the long run and big picture, with all the feedbacks and externalities internalized, this is the best you can do.<br><br>Why on earth should anyone think we can do better?<br><br><a href=#c2823773807445131953 title="comment permalink">7/1/12, 7:02 AM</a><br><br>

Why "cruise" the neighborhood picking up friends when one can just text them or say hi to them on Facebook? Another reason, and this is my own conjecture, is that driving just isn't much fun anymore with traffic congestion in the suburbs the way it is.<br><br>John, I was musing about your initial thoughts here--the fact that Hubbert's bell curve isn't behaving the way peak oilers have thought it would--and was wondering if the "liquid fuels" statistics are gross or net? In other words, do they account for the (increasing) need to input more liquid fuels in order to extract the same volume as before? (As you have noted, it takes a lot of energy input to turn those tar sands into refineable crude.) If they aren't, and if we subtracted the actual energy cost on energy production, we might be observing a net decline in fuel production, and therefore we might already be on the downslope of Hubbert's curve.

I wouldn't say it necessarily precludes other things being possible though. The reason for this is that evolution can only "pursue goals" (to anthropomorphise a bit) that are advantageous every step of the way. <br>Say, for example, that nuclear fusion was possible but that every interim step to evolve it representated a competitive disavantage to the organism. If this was the case then it would never evolve.<br><br>Having said that, I'm more convinced by those who claim that photosynthesis is the best (whole lifecycle) way to turn the sun's light into chemical energy (eg. better than solar PV, once one considers cost of manufacture, distribution, installation, maintenance, etc).

But I would add one caveat. When humans try to engineer something that nature has never had any reason to design, then all bets are off.<br><br>Not surprisingly, human attempts to convert sunlight into chemical energy haven't gotten much higher than the ~6-10% maximum efficiency of photosynthesis. However, living bodies have no need of electricity (aside from small electrical potentials in cells and nerves), so evolution hasn't really explored possible ways of making it. Thus I wouldn't conclude that just because no other organism uses hydropower or wind power for energy that these technologies are fundamentally incompatible with the biosphere.<br><br><br>With regard to Oregon climate, we are subject to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which cycles between warm and cold phases on the scale of 20-30 years.

The roadrunner runs, the hummingbird flies, and the tuna swims, all driven by electron transfer on a molecular scale. We heat our bodies and fireflies flash their signal lights using the same method. One wonders if the system we use, of converting wind and hydrostatic pressure into electricity, then transmitting it long distances, where it is reconverted to torque, heat, and light, is really a good bet in the big picture. Might it not turn out that in the end (after the salvage economy runs it course) we'll get light, heat, and torque through biology again (i.e. biological fuels and muscles)?

Given the topic of systems from you post, I found the storm a classic example of a system at work that could prove very destructive long term.<br><br>In Mexico, there's a very tight circulating high that has been sitting there for about a week and will be sitting there another week easily. To the north of that there's another high circulating in the opposite direction feeding the hot dry air of Mexico into a loop centered over Colorado, which at this point is an open, fiery oven. Above this is the jet stream, which is pushing this oven in the other direction like a circular gear on alternatively moving gear trains. The Jet Stream picks up that heat and lets it build up just west of Chicago, with the cold wet atmosphere of Lake Michigan acting like a giant wall.<br><br>Last Friday, the dome of hot dry air eventually breached this wall, and came rushing down a pressurized trough towards Washington DC at more than 80 miles an hour. The resulting Derecho, or Land Hurricane, created a swath of devastation across much of Maryland and DC, felling trees, dropping power lines, and frying transformers already straining against the 100F+ degree heat.<br><br>For many of us in that region, we got a cold hard taste of what's coming in the 21st century. I'm from the Pacific Northwest, which is currently experiencing Junuary - temperatures more consistent with March than late June. Air conditioning is pretty much required, though usually most heavily towards the latter part of July, but even without AC, fans can at least help to cool things somewhat. Without electricity, there were no fans, and the two story house we rent became unliveable. You cannot store food, because there is no power to the refrigerators, you cannot cook food, because there is no power to the stove. Houses in the area were designed with air conditioning in mind (at least those post 1980) - these became stifling ovens in triple digit temperatures.<br><br>The Derecho caused a massive power surge in the system because of all of the AC being used, and then compounded this with damage to overhead wires. We were fortunate to get power back in three days - others may wait more than a week. Most of the supermarkets in the area were throwing out all of their perishables - likely several billion dollars in food that depend upon the miracle of freezers. Gas stations started running out of gasoline as everyone stocked up for generators or to insure that they had gas to get away if necessary, and batteries and water became scarce.<br><br>What many people, even those who follow the peak oil movement closely, frequently fail to recognize is the degree to which we are dependent upon reliable energy. We have few ways of storing or preparing feed that doesn't require a power cord of some sort, we lose contact with one another very quickly, we can't even count on the water being safe to drink (the sewage treatment plant's power failed and it was running on generators - when energy ran out for those generators (two to three more days), people would be dealing with sewage tainted water, and cholera would become a real problem again. The storm ended up with a couple dozen casualties, but these didn't account for poor seniors who died of heart attacks and strokes induced by heat.<br><br>The morning after the first storm, people flocked to one of the few coffeeshops that still had power, desperate for caffeine and news in that order. Annapolis tends to be a weird mix of poor black Democrats and upper crust white yachtsmen Republicans, and two of the latter were sipping coffee and staring out at the heat coming off the concrete amidst the downed trees, when I heard one say to the other "You don't think there might actually be something to this global warming stuff, do you?"<br><br><a href=#c5840897028496467025 title="comment permalink">7/2/12, 10:15 AM</a><br><br>

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Annapolis was a thriving town in the days before air conditioning and electric fans, right? If people like you start learning how to live comfortably in summer in your location without a/c and electric fans, you're going to be much better prepared for a future where grid electricity is going to be increasingly intermittent -- that is, of course, before it goes away altogether.

It is actually what happens in an atmosphere that is hot and humid but only moderately unstable, on the north edge of a high pressure ridge, with a well-developed northwest flow aloft but not directly under the jet stream. These situations are generally fairly placid, but they are just stable enough for substantial low-level heat to build up, then when something finally does punch through and go unstable... well, it can set off a chain reaction. The triggering event is often an otherwise unordinary "mesoscale convective complex," known to the rest of us as a "clump of thunderstorms." The energy lines up just right, and it sets off a cascade much like a string of dominoes toppling. This sends a self-propagating wave of convection racing towards the east/southeast/south at phenomenal speeds, heralded by a truly spectacular gust front. It's not really a large-scale collapse of the system, but a mesoscale process; indeed the large-scale conditions often are much the same over the subsequent days, and another derecho can get set off again if the cards fall right. They are a relatively recently described phenomenon, but looking back through history they turned out to not be something new at all, just previously unrecognized. A famous one blasted Memphis a few years back, got dubbed "Hurricane Elvis." There are multiple ones most summers, this was not even the first one for 2012 but was definitely stronger than average and hit many big population centers. June-July is the peak season; they especially like to demolish 4th of July celebrations. <br><br>This is a good example of the "who knows what might happen?" aspect of climate change. The triggering mechanisms for derechos are poorly understood and difficult to forecast, so how can anyone say if they will become more or less frequent? Extreme events are often balanced on a knife-edge, it is all but impossible to say which way they will be tipped by complex changes. <br><br>One of the major patterns that looks like an early manifestation of CO2-induced climate change that is having major impacts on the northern hemisphere was entirely unpredicted. The huge jet-stream meanders that usually move ponderously around the planet are getting stuck in place. These are what cause the shifts between persistent warmth or cold or wet or dry, often lasting for weeks at a time. But now the patterns are locking in place for months at a time, not progressing, causing entire subcontinents to get locked into extremes of temperature and precipitation for very long times. This caused the "Snowpocalypse" in the northeastern U.S. a couple of winters ago, and is causing the persistent and abnormal warmth in the same region for most of 2012 so far. And it is causing the persistent cold and damp in the PNW at the same time. It could easily flip, dumping the eastern U.S. into a suddenly cool late summer and bitter cold winter, and putting the PNW in the furnace. Or it might not. The old well-known patterns seem to be fading.<br><br><a href=#c7800444895204487547 title="comment permalink">7/2/12, 9:18 PM</a><br><br>

This required a drive along I-70 from western Pennsylvania clear to St. Louis. We saw the first derecho damage in Wheeling, West Virginia. From then on we saw it in various places and degrees all the way through Ohio and Indiana to the eastern edge of Illinois. Most of what we saw were trees topped by the strong winds. Had the soil been wet, most of those trees probably would have uprooted. The dry soil kept the root ball in place, however, causing snapped-off limbs and trunks. We also saw a few damaged billboards, two partially peeled-off roofs, and one building under construction that collapsed. All this was just what we could see as we drove along the interstate.<br><br>We've had derechos here too, the last ones in 2006. I know many people in the southern part of the derecho area, such as Maryland and Virginia, are suffering from near 100F heat. But what astonished me was the complaints from folks in Ohio, where highs are only in the low 90s, easily livable without AC. I got to feeling pretty grumpy about it. We hadn't used our AC at all this year before we returned home today, and it's been much hotter here; I wouldn't have turned it on except that our highs have run 100F+ for the last 6 days and we're under an excessive heat warning. I worry about our collective loss of ability to muddle through without AC under conditions where most people can manage quite well without it.<br><br>What upset me more than that, however, was the state of the corn crop. I've lived in the Midwest all but 8 years of my life; I know what healthy corn looks like in early July. I have never seen corn look so bad as it did along I-70 in Illinois, however, not in the whole 55 years I've been alive (and it didn't look much better in Indiana or Ohio). Even if it does start raining normally - and it's not supposed to rain at all until at least early next week - it's hard to imagine getting a crop at all. I wonder if the plants might be dead before we get more rain. Very few farms practice irrigation in the Corn Belt because it rains during the growing season. At least most years it does. There aren't enough days left to the growing season to grow more corn, if you could germinate the seeds to begin with, which you'd have to have some rain to do, which we aren't getting. And this is the material that gets turned into most of our meats and processed foods ...<br><br><a href=#c1339376736572584322 title="comment permalink">7/3/12, 7:38 PM</a><br><br>

I've argued before that the difference between the two is that climate change is a narrative about human power -- look at us, we're so mighty we can destroy the Earth! -- while peak oil is a narrative about human limitations -- oops, all that power we thought was ours was simply pilfered from the planet's carbon reserves, and what will we do once it's gone? Thus it's not surprising to me to see erstwhile environmentalists such as Monbiot jumping onto the peak oil denial bandwagon, the way they jumped onto the nuclear bandwagon a little while back. They're still caught up in the same weary narrative of human omnipotence. <br><br>SLClaire, welcome to the future. As for air conditioning, I'll be discussing that in this week's post. <br><br>Diane, thanks for the perspective. The Monbiot article that, to me, was a dead giveaway was the one where he admitted that his own home leaks energy like a sieve, but fixing it would cost a lot of money, and since it wouldn't add anything to the resale value, well, he couldn't justify th eexpenditure. And this man calls himself an environmentalist!<br><br><a href=#c7954928498586187409 title="comment permalink">7/4/12, 8:01 AM</a><br><br>

Much of this infrastructure represents a sunk cost investment, earning substantial economic rents (or, if you prefer, quasi-rents).<br><br>The shape of the production decline is going to be conditioned on the demands and possibilities of that infrastructure. Filling the "pipeline", so to speak, will remain an economic imperative for a while, even as disinvestment from that infrastructure accelerates. The economic rents of the infrastructure (the "pipeline") constitute a kind of force, an attractor, stabilizing a homeostatic equilibrium, and creating significant economic pressure for a prolonged plateau in fossil fuel energy production/consumption. <br><br>Maintaining an output plateau, against the Hubbert factors, which would, by themselves, lead to gradual decline, are part of what, I think, make the Seneca Cliff model plausible. Maintaining a whole-system equilibrium, in the form of an output plateau, comes at an increasing cost to the whole-system. That cost can be paid, in a financial sense, out of economic rents and the political exploitation of externalities (e.g. frakking poisons ground water; deep-sea drilling kills tuna).<br><br><a href=#c5359546030097709087 title="comment permalink">7/4/12, 11:09 AM</a><br><br>

First off, I want to commend you for all the time, effort, and deep thinking you've invested in this truly outstanding blog. Your success in constructing a persuasive, compelling narrative that binds together peak oil, resource depletion, the ideology of progress, and past, present and future of industrial civilization is truly remarkable.<br><br>Second, I wanted to say something about Monbiot. Yes, there are some problems with his perspective on environmentalism; I think he's far too optimistic that a workable, long-term solution can be found for nuclear waste management. And the personal issues concerning the energy inefficiency of his farmhouse in Wales are duly noted. Environmentalists do need to "walk the talk" a lot more than they have been.<br><br>That being said, Monbiot's voice in the environmental and climate change movements remains a very thoughful and valuable one. After reading an essay of his, I've always come away with a little bit more than I had going in. His latest essay is no exception. Despite the hyperbole about the Bakken oil reserves, his basic point is well taken:<br><br><i>The automatic correction – resource depletion destroying the machine that was driving it – that many environmentalists foresaw is not going to happen. The problem we face is not that there is too little oil, but that there is too much.</i><br><br>The only change I would make is to substitute "fossil fuel" for "oil". Over the past 10 years, the world's political and business leadership has moved to an unshakeable commitment to a fossil-intensive world. While it is true that at some point, the EROEI of extracting unconventional oil and natural gas will reach zero and make it unprofitable to extract, because of "the cussedness of whole systems" we may not reach that point for some time.<br><br>Is there enough fossil fuel remaining in the ground to deep-fry the planet, as Monbiot claims? Yes, basically. The combination of slowly declining conventional oil and just the Canadian tar sands, by themselves, is probably enough to do it.<br><br><a href=#c5736214927191323581 title="comment permalink">7/4/12, 12:03 PM</a><br><br>
