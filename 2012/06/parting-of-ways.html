Chalk it up to an adolescence spent reading such cheerful books as <i>The Limits to Growth</i> and <i>The Coming Dark Age</i>, but it takes quite a bit to make me fret about the future. Even now, as industrial civilization begins to sink down the far side of Hubbert’s curve, and facts and figures come rolling in on a daily basis to sketch the predicament of our time in ever more detail, I usually find it easy to nod and make a note and go on with the work at hand, whether that’s bringing in greens and snow peas from the garden or hammering out this week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> post. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, a series of news items over the last week or so have me worried. No, it’s not the latest news about methane plumes in the Arctic Ocean; it’s not the current round of economic idiocy from Europe, where the bizarre conviction that banks ought to be sheltered from the consequences of even their most clueless investment decisions has become the centerpiece of an economic nonpolicy that will likely tip the entire EU into mass bankruptcy; it’s not the death struggle between two failed ideologies that’s frozen Washington DC into utter political paralysis at a time when avoiding hard questions any longer may well put the survival of the nation at risk. No, quite the contrary: it’s the rising chorus of voices, from all across the political and cultural spectrum, insisting that everything really is all right and that any suggestion to the contrary ought to be shouted down as quickly as possible.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s been one of the less useful habits of large parts of the American right for some time now. Still, the habit of detachment from reality reached new lows this month, as North Carolina’s senate passed legislation forbidding the state <a href=http://www2.journalnow.com/news/2012/jun/13/nc-senate-approves-law-challenges-sea-level-scienc-ar-2353298>from considering scientific evidence for rising sea levels</a> in any policy dealing with the state’s low and vulnerable coastline. Texas and Virginia <a href=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/06/11/2844468/banned-words-in-some-states-rising.html>have already taken similar steps</a>; it’s reminiscent of King Canute, who famously commanded the tide to retreat and just as famously got his royal feet good and wet.  Since all three of these states are in the hurricane belt, and rising sea levels add mightily to the destructive impact of hurricane storm surges, it’s unlikely that this attempt to better Canute’s score will end so harmlessly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Over on the other side of the spectrum, mind you, there’s no shortage of equivalent ideas. My fellow peak oil blogger Jan Lundberg, an activist well over on the leftward side of things, recently posted <a href=http://www.culturechange.org/cms/content/view/841/1>a thoughtful critique</a> of the ideas on display at a San Francisco alternative culture expo. In there with the alternative healers and pop mysticism was a pervasive and contemptuous rejection of the idea that there might be limits to material abundance. That habit’s been popular in the New Age scene for decades—Rhonda Byrne’s meretricious <i>The Secret</i>, with its insistence that focusing on your sense of personal entitlement will browbeat the universe into giving you all the goodies you want, has a long pedigree—but as Lundberg pointed out, it’s become tangled up with frankly paranoid conspiracy theories and frankly delusional notions about the human mind’s alleged ability to repeal the laws of thermodynamics. Lundberg suggests that what’s emerging here is a New Age equivalent to the Tea Party, and he’s quite correct:  there’s really not much to choose between "visualize, baby, visualize" and "drill, baby, drill." </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I had a personal run-in with the same sort of thinking not long ago, in the course of finding a publisher for <i>After Oil</i>, the anthology of peak oil science fiction to which this blog’s readers contributed so many excellent stories late last year. (Yes, it’s going to press; I hope to have a tentative release date shortly.) One potential publisher, who had been enthusiastic about the project early on, rejected it with some heat once he read the manuscript.  He didn’t object to the literary quality of the stories; no, what upset him was the fact that the stories assumed that people in a post-peak oil world would be more or less like people today, living in a world no more loaded with miracles than the one we now inhabit. Why, he asked, couldn’t the authors have written stories in which the problem of peak oil was solved by people sprouting psychic antennae, or creating new forms of kinship with water molecules, or at the very least powering the world on algae fuel? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course there is an answer to that question, which is that the point of the anthology was to tell stories about the kind of futures we’re going to get, rather than chasing pretty daydreams that start by pretending that the realities of our predicament don’t apply to us.  In the real world, my readers will have noticed, there’s a distinct shortage of people who grow antennae, psychic or otherwise; while cultivating a sense of kinship with water molecules seems reasonable enough to me—the human body is mostly water, after all—it’s not going to make water behave any differently than it does today; and there are solid thermodynamic reasons, discussed here and elsewhere, why algal biodiesel will never be more than a laboratory curiosity on the one hand, and a lure for unwary investors on the other.  Still, it became clear very quickly that this answer was not the sort of thing the publisher wanted to hear. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s something a great many people don’t want to hear these days, and the refusal to hear it is getting distinctly shrill in some quarters—consider the angry tone of the latest press releases from the financial sphere <a href=http://www.businessinsider.com/citis-ed-morse-explains-why-everyone-is-wrong-about-peak-oil-calls-for-80-90-crude-in-2020-2012-6>insisting that peak oil is nonsense</a>—after all, it ought to be obvious to any reasonable person that waving around enough money will brush aside the laws of physics and geology, right?  Not too long ago, that insistence used to be expressed in tones of insufferable superiority—think of Daniel Yergin’s dismissals of peak oil, or the airy optimism of Bjorn Lomborg’s <i>The Skeptical Environmentalist</i>. Now of course Lomborg insisted that the price of oil would remain at $20 to $30 a barrel through 2020, and Yergin in 2004 claimed that the price of oil had reached a permanent plateau at $38 a barrel; the failure of oil prices to do as they were told doubtless contributed to the more strident tone such proclamations so often get these days. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, it’s not the shrill tone of the latest round that has me watching with more than the usual concern. It’s the increasing sense that not even the people who are promoting such claims actually believe them any more. The North Carolina legislators who are trying to pretend that sea level rise won’t happen, like their equivalents in Texas and Virginia, remind me of nothing so much as six-year-olds who stuff their fingers in their ears, scrunch their eyes shut, and chant "I can’t hear you, la la la" at the top of their lungs. The New Age equivalent is a little more subtle, but after half a century of failed predictions of saucer landings and leaps of consciousness—and let’s not even talk about what happened to the millions of Americans who tried to use <i>The Secret</i> to make boatloads of money for nothing by investing in the late real estate bubble—there can’t be many people left in the scene who don’t know, on some level, that they’re kidding themselves.  For that matter, if the publisher who turned down <i>After Oil</i> suddenly sprouted a pair of antennae, it’s probably a safe bet that, instead of embracing the event as a welcome miracle, he’d call a dermatologist in a fair state of panic.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If that’s the case—if the incantations being repeated these days to justify doing nothing significant about the crisis of our age are no longer even plausible to most of the people who mouth them—we are a good deal closer to a critical juncture in the downward slide than I thought. Visible ahead of us is a parting of the ways that will define a great deal of what we will experience in the years to come.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To understand that parting of the ways, it’s important to get a good clear sense of how self-deception works. I suspect most of my readers have had the experience of arguing themselves into believing, at least for a short time, something that they knew was not true.  It’s a fascinating study in the corruption of the intellect. To start with, much more often than not, questions of the truth of the belief in question are ignored or actively evaded; what matters is that accepting the false belief will bring practical benefits, or please another person, or identify the believer with an admirable person or group. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As the false belief is affirmed in public and expressed in action, though, the critical space required to accept the belief publicly without believing it inwardly trickles away.  The cognitive dissonance that comes from affirming and enacting a belief without believing it is hard to bear, and the more the belief is affirmed and enacted, the more painful the dissonance becomes.  One way out of the dissonance is to abandon the false belief, but social pressures often make that a costly and embarrassing step; the other option,  to make yourself believe that the false belief is true, routinely comes with equally substantial social rewards. It’s not surprising that a significant number of people make that latter choice. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Once it’s made, though, the pathologies of repressed disbelief unfold in predictable ways.  The believer becomes brittle and defensive about the false belief, affirming it loudly and publicly, and taking on the familiar social role of the strident true believer.  Elaborate arguments for the truth of the false belief take on an ever larger role in his mental life; if books of such arguments exist, you can count on finding them on his bookshelves, while his willingness to encounter differing views—not even opposing ones, but simply those that are not identical to the cherished false belief—drops like a rock. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Convincing the rest of the world of the truth of the false belief becomes a central concern, since every new convert to the false belief helps shore up the believer’s self-imposed conviction that the false belief really is true. Onto those who refuse to be converted, meanwhile, the believer projects not only his own unspoken doubts, but the bad faith and hypocrisy that surrounds those doubts.  Thus, in the mind of the believer, the unbeliever gets turned into a caricature of everything the believer can’t stand in himself, and serves by turns as a straw man, a scapegoat, and the supposed cause of everything evil in the world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
How this trajectory ends is determined by the nature of the false belief itself, or more precisely by the relation between the false belief and the world of objective fact. If the belief does not require the world to behave in a way that it manifestly doesn’t, it’s entirely possible for believers to spend the rest of their lives loudly proclaiming the truth of a belief they know is false, and hating those people who reject the belief for openly speaking the truth the believers are unwilling to utter, without going further into oughtright psychopathology.  It’s when the false belief makes specific, falsifiable claims about the way the world works that problems crop up; the more central these claims are to the belief system, and the more obviously and repeatedly the claims are falsified, the more difficult those problems become. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The most productive way to cope with those problems is to abandon the false belief, and of course a good many people do that after a sufficiently forceful disconfirmation. Much less productive is the option of doubling down on the belief system, insisting on its truth in the face of any amount of evidence, and following it out to its logical conclusions no matter how horrific those happen to be. That’s how mass suicides happen:  back yourself into the blind alley of unconditional commitment to a belief you know to be false, and reject even the slightest doubt about the belief as a failure that’s unthinkable precisely because you’re constantly thinking it, and the temptation to prove your loyalty to the false belief in the one ultimately unanswerable way can be very hard to resist. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Most of my readers will be able to call examples of this trajectory easily to mind, and a fair number will have experienced at least a small part of it themselves. I’ve come to think, though, that in the years immediately ahead of us, it’s going to be almost impossible to miss.  Plenty of belief systems will have to deal with repeated disconfirmation, but the one that’s likely to get hit the hardest, and may well produce the biggest crop of pathological behavior, is the established religion of the modern industrial world, the belief in the inevitability and goodness of progress. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d like to suggest that it’s precisely the failure of the modern faith in progress that’s driving the rush to illusion discussed earlier in this post. Belief in progress has no place for the awkward reality that the wastes we’re pumping into the atmosphere are putting pressure on an already unstable global climate, sending meltwater flooding into the oceans and raising sea level; after all, according to the believers, progress is supposed to solve problems, not cause them. Belief in progress has no place for the hard fact that economic abundance can’t simply be wished into being, but depends on ample supplies of the cheap, concentrated energy that, in this corner of the universe, can only be had in sufficient quantities from the fossil fuels we’re depleting so rapidly. Belief in progress has no place at all, finally, for the unwelcome but necessary recognition that we won’t get far by sitting on our backsides and waiting for psychic antennae or some other miracle to save us from the consequences of our own mistakes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Precisely because it has no place for these things, in turn, the faith in progress is taking quite a beating these days.  As the United States quietly folds up its space program, hands over its infrastructure to malign neglect, allows measures of public health to drop toward Third World levels, and lets what’s left of its economy devolves into a dishonest casino game, the mere fact that a narrowing circle of well-off individuals can buy electronic toys slightly more complex than last year’s equivalents just doesn’t have the cachet it once did. Even the mainstream media has had a harder time clinging to the mythic power of progress than it once did; it’s symptomatic that the Wall Street Journal’s MarketWatch—reread that, and let it sink in for a moment—<a href=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/myth-of-perpetual-growth-is-killing-america-2012-06-12 target=_blank>recently hosted an essay</a> pointing out that the idea of infinite growth is a delusion, and that economics has become a pseudoscience incapable of providing meaningful information about the future. ("What do you call an economist who makes a prediction?  Wrong.") </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The question is how people will react to the increasing disconfirmation of the myth of progress. Some, I am relieved to say, have bitten the bullet, accepted the fact that progress was a temporary condition made possible by extravagant and unsustainable exploitation of the Earth’s fossil fuel reserves, and begun to grapple with the challenges and possibilities of a future where progress no longer takes place and contraction and regression are the rule.  More will likely do so as we proceed—many more, in all probability, than I thought possible when I launched this blog six years ago. Still, I doubt the refusal to give up on the failed myth will be limited to North Carolina politicians, San Francisco New Age aficionados, and avant-garde publishers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I suspect, rather, that the refusal to recognize and deal with the end of progress will become a massive social force in the decade or so ahead of us, and that the great divide in American society during those years will not be the one between left and right, or between rich and poor, but between those who have accepted history’s verdict on our fantasy of perpetual progress, on the one hand, and those who cling to the fantasy despite all disconfirmations, on the other.  Since refusing to recognize the fact of decline is a good way to get clobbered over the head by one or another of that fact’s manifestations—a point that the inhabitants of coastal North Carolina are likely to find out the hard way one of these days—those who choose the path of denial may be in for a very rough road indeed. </div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Most fans of really bad cinema have enjoyed, if that is the right word, Ed Wood’s 1959 opus <i>Plan Nine From Outer Space</i>, the Golden Turkey Award winner for worst movie of all time. I sometimes wonder how many of them realize that the bizarre talking head who opens the movie, spouting preposterous prophecies in a stentorian voice, was once a significant cultural presence—the Amazing Criswell, America’s least convincing psychic!</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Jeron Criswell Konig was a Hollywood figure in the 1950s and 1960s, a close friend of Mae West and a regular guest on <i>The Jack Paar Show</i>. His career as a psychic began inauspiciously enough when he needed material to pad out what would now be called "infomercials" for vitamins he was selling, and decided to put in predictions about the future. Giddily improbable though his prophecies were—he predicted that Denver would be destroyed in 1989 by a ray from space that would turn metal and stone to the consistency of rubber, that an epidemic of cannibalism would devastate Pittsburgh in 1980, and that Mae West would be elected President of the United States—he managed to get three books of predictions into print. (I read one of them in the Burien, WA public library when I was seven or eight years old, and even at that age found it utterly unconvincing.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The end of the world, inevitably featured in the Amazing Criswell’s repertoire. That was scheduled to take place on August 18, 1999. A black rainbow would appear over the earth and, by some means not given in detail, would cause all the world’s oxygen to disappear, suffocating every living thing on the planet. It’s probably unnecessary to point out that, like most of Criswell’s other predictions, this one turned out to be a dud.</div>

As always, I wonder if it might be a bit of confirmation bias, but I agree that it seems the harsh reality of limitation is becoming more known or intuited all the time. I'm lucky in that the social circles I run in tend much more toward the acceptance of this reality rather than the denial of it. But the idea that our future split in ideology will stem more from that acceptance or denial makes a lot of sense to me. There seems also a growing sense that both sides of the political coin we call American politics is full of . . . well, I can't use that term here.<br><br>I have to be honest, I find it fascinating to see the rise in recognition of the limits to growth. And I find it fascinating to see the way more and more people seem to understand that things aren't going to go back the way they were. I realize this isn't everyone, and it's not even a majority, but it most certainly seems to be something of a wave or a trend--kind of how the local food movement has unfolded. I have no idea where it will end up, but I didn't really expect to see so much change so fast, so it does make me happy.<br><br>I've been enjoying the last few points and their forthcoming nature. Interestingly, they've been corresponding with a good stretch of my life. My somewhat solitary life of living on a farm and working as a farm hand while trying to put some voluntary poverty actions into place has suddenly become infused with the unexpected energy of a couple WWOOFers who are now living with me and helping me with my large garden. The weather's becoming nicer and I'm suddenly seeing a real possibility of being able to work out a deal to settle in on a small piece of land, homestead, and do farm work for rent and a bit of cash. Not sure if it'll all work or not, but it's funny how life takes sudden turns and how quickly things can change or fall into place.<br><br>Exciting times. I may regret the future turns that excitement takes--I still imagine it's going to be a rough future for most of us--but it's fascinating to be in the midst of it as it unfolds. I continue to work on taking it in stride, rolling with what happens, doing my best and trying not to become too bogged down in regret or overthinking. There's too much to do, after all. We all have so much work to get going on.<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c8584069854325405484 title="comment permalink">6/14/12, 12:41 AM</a><br><br>

(But there again, Scott Adams was originally a management consultant, so he should know). In this supposed employment utopia, the senior management always insisted prospects for their staff were excellent, when any cursory look at the declining product lines instantly confirmed otherwise.<br><br>The seniors carried on with that ‘line to take’ when the redundancies and relocations came, citing the great prospects for those that chose to move with them and take on a fresh scary mortgage for such a great continued employment opportunity. <br><br>We cynics, who saw things for what they were, politely queried the senior folks in open meetings, but this was most unwelcome as it directly challenged their credibility and authority. I’m still proud to say that I actually informed one Director that I would rather be unemployed than work in his Corporate Worker’s Paradise. <br><br>Later on, the overworked and mostly cynical staff opted to give their leaders a Good Stiff Ignoring, and stopped attending the open sessions altogether, so some were summoned instead on a three-line-whip to provide a sullen audience. I think that moment of truth happened when the top boss was helicoptered in – literally – while the staff were subjected to severe restrictions on modest travel and subsistence allowances. <br><br>Some of the managers – my own cheery optimist senior boss included - actually loved Big Brother, and believed the guff they were writing and spouting forth, really thinking they worked for a wondrous caring employer. Still, we all know ”It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!" <br><br>And then, we cynics all left in droves, and so came our welcome Parting of the Ways. <br><br>Mustard<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c1973674080042274005 title="comment permalink">6/14/12, 1:51 AM</a><br><br>

I was having a discussion about planes of existence and whatnot and I said something along the lines of "You know, I do believe that we consist of uncountable numbers of enrgetically bonded atoms that somehow do their thing just right and make us human, and so is the bench in front of me, but I don't believe I can pass through the bench using the power of my mind."<br><br>To which was replied, "Why not?" with a genuine tone of disdain with my lack of faith; for being "too based on facts." <br><br>As someone who has left a large proportion of my life to the wind, to do what it will, I feel like I have alot of faith. Faith in people to be people. Faith in life to be life. Faith in benches to hurt me if I try to walk through them. <br><br>Later on, after twists and turns in the conversation, I said that basically my vision of our relationship to life is simple. <br><br>In the past their were people, and some were nice and some were not. Some who were nice turned nasty, and some who were nasty turned nice. Some went back and forth, between the two all throughout their lives.<br><br>And in our times, there are people who are nice, and some who are not.

There's very little light pollution here because of the topography and most nights if you wait long enough you'll get to see a shooting star. On some of these occasions other people are with me and they’re also waiting for their chance to see a shooting star.<br><br>Yet, depending on their disposition they have to wait a bit as it is a random event. You can almost hear them wishing that a shooting star would just show itself by sheer force of personality.

Wisconsin's recent recall election and the characteristic manner in which the Democrats brought a rubber dagger to a sword-fight, was the last and greatest example of a string of the sort of disillusioning events you described. (Obviously, I discussed my disgust over the situation on my own blog recently.) This was enough to make me decide to cut myself off from all Democratic-Party-oriented blogs, podcasts, and whatever else because I know what's going to happen. The "Old Rugged Cross" crowd will indulge ever-deeper cognitive dissonance to justify their continuing support of Barack Obama and his dying, clueless, ineffectual party, and any left-liberal who has had enough of what you have correctly labeled "the politics industry" will be excoriated to beat holy thunder. I should have known it would be this way from the very beginning, and I'm embarassed that I had to go through so much unnecessary song-and-dance to arrive at this point. I'm sure you're glad to hear this news because that means I will probably soon stop using the willful codependence of Democratic-Party supporters as examples in my comments. :-)<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c516814142968520538 title="comment permalink">6/14/12, 6:04 AM</a><br><br>

That said, I was looking for a discarded water heater to make into a smoker and stopped by the county dump. I was approached by a rather rude, weaselly man who informed me that the "liberals" in Raleigh had put "layers and layers" of regulations in the way of my removing anything from the "his facility". Turns out the man is the "supervisor of waste management" for the county, and absolutely not interested in promoting the 'reuse' part of reduce, reuse, recycle. Sad, since I had already spotted my perfect smoker-to-be.<br><br>Anyway, while going back home, pondering last week's “Collapse Now” post and some of the comments, and doing an evaluation of our personal adjustments, it occurred to me that the idea of “collapse” doesn't fit our situation at all. While we've been hit hard by the overall financial decline of the last few years, this has been entirely motivational. I've made real progress in another direction; “collapsing in place”, as it turns out, has been a progression in many ways, an exercise in hope building. For me, at least, it has been incremental baby steps, a series of inter-connected small successes, some failures, which, when one steps back and takes it all in, may be realized as huge steps forward. Collapse, it seems, doesn't mean moving backward at all.<br><br>We (my little community) are well into accomplishing a goal I've had for years: bringing a source of potable water to our garden 'complex'. We've been irrigating our large garden by solar-pumping from the adjacent pond, and, while the water is fine for the plants, it's not safe to drink and the inevitable algae growth causes problems in the system. I've been scrounging the materials to tap and pipe a robust spring system in the forest above the garden. Last weekend, the three “roosters” in our little garden group pulled together, tapped the spring and piped 3 GPM of clean, cold, drinkable water to the garden. I'm in the process of burying the lower tank and plumbing it to the solar pump which will send it to another tank buried on the hill above the garden. Gravity will do the rest. Should pumping become non-viable in the future, I've also made provisions to be able to flood irrigate directly from the spring. Unlike the current system, the new system will be resistant to freezing, though I've designed it to be easily drained down in the winter.<br><br>I have reasonably good documentation that a Cherokee Indian used this same spring to make the moonshine that helped him avoid the “Trail of Tears” in the 1830's. Our little valley carries his name. The arrowheads we find while working the garden are proof that we are just another band of humans who found this spot and decided to stay for a while.<br><br>Beyond irrigation, we plan to build a cookout shed for gatherings, complete with a canning center so that we can preserve food directly from the garden, at the garden. I've even salvaged a large stainless sink and commercial food prep table. Initially, propane will suffice until I can get a wood-fired stove in place. The aformentioned smoker is also in the plan, and we've picked a spot for a horseshoe pit. It looks like our little community has found its center.<br><br>So.... fear not collapse, as it can be a way forward. Make your plan, prioritise , be patient, and enjoy the benefits of your diminished reliance on complex systems, and increased reliance on community and things that matter.<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c4489768227327445604 title="comment permalink">6/14/12, 6:07 AM</a><br><br>

Without the dream, the United States is impossible. There would be no common ambition of growth and prosperity to hold us all together.

(I share many of these attitudes myself.)<br><br>We will soon be moving to Virginia (probably not all that far from where you live). We have multiple reasons for moving but one of them is to do with the climate. South Texas has always been hot, but last summer was brutal and the lack of rain was a major problem. And I don’t think that it was a one-time event.<br><br>When I – jokingly - tell my colleagues that we are among the first wave of climate refugees, their reaction has always been one of understanding.

If you look closely, you can begin to see fractures along those lines across various segments of society now: “eco-liberals” who are pretty horrified at the idea of living in a Tiny House; pro-business/foreign expansion Republicans vs the Ron Paul wing; Millennial teens who aren’t buying (literally) the driving and shopping lifestyle. Even our local Garden Club has a fierce rift between organic and pro-pesticide members. The logic of resource depletion says these fractures have to grow, and could well become a defining realignment. It would certainly be interesting in ten years to see today’s staunch “conservatives” and “liberals” holding hands as they coalesce into the “Let’s Keep The Stuff” party. <br><br>It will be passionate. I already get more than a few comments that my behavior (of using less) is what is causing the economic problems (which I suppose is true in a way).

No combination of economic collapse, material scarcity, or environmental chaos keeps me awake some night like the thought of the mass psychopathology of those who have "doubled down" on the continuation of the modern world of progress. It is almost enough to make me think that the survivalist with his bunker full of guns perhaps ought not to be dismissed out of hand. Almost.<br>This is another of the things that concerns me about the more outward forms of collapse-related activism (collpstivism?) like Transition Towns. One gets the impression from some of these people that when things start to get bad, the masses of the unprepared will flock to them, like a messiah, to teach them the gentle arts of permaculture.

Even my own circle of friends and family is becoming split into those who accept the end of growth and are looking beyond it, and those who do not accept it and remain entrenched in the growth mindset.<br><br>I do have a concern that I have not seen addressed in detail thus far on the Archdruid Report (though it does seem to be a consistent issue in Star's Reach). Admittedly I may have missed it, as I only became a regular reader last year. <br><br>My concern is this:<br><br>Humanity has, via nuclear fuel production, churned out millions and millions of gallons of nightmarish radioactive waste, most of which is sitting in pools that may easily ignite if the grid-powered coolant pumps that keep them under control turn off, and diesel generators with sufficient fuel cannot be supplied in time. Much of this stuff, if released into the environment, is toxic for 100,000 years. I am now seeing reports indicating that much more has been dumped carelessly from the 1940s through today that we even know about. There is enough of this stuff to contaminate all the soil and water of the world for a good long time, turning our foods into poisons. There is currently no way of dealing with all of this waste, and our government can't even be bothered to bury it in dry casks. Meanwhile, more poison is produced every day, all over the world.<br><br>In light of such a daunting and unacknowledged - indeed, unspeakable, if the Japanese government's gutless denial in the face of disaster is any preview of what ours' will be - is Peak Oil still our most pressing concern? To be more precise, could the Peak Oil-induced electrical grid failures touch off an extinction event, if without them nuclear cooling systems fail and the radioactive waste catches fire in many places? I am really worried about this; what good is it to garden and grow food if wind- or water-borne fallout from the latest nuclear waste pool explosion will only poison my soil? I live in Seattle, and I worry about the plume spreading from Japan. How do I trust the safety of the soil, air, and water, if the government lies in the nuclear industry's pocket as much as it does in Big Oil's, and it doesn't care whether I live or die as long as the money rolls in? I'd like to believe the reports saying things are still safe here, but, for the reasons mentioned in today's post, I cannot.<br><br>When did money become more important than clean air, clean water, and the ability to grow food to eat? Do politicians and CEOs imagine that they will be able to buy themselves a new earth when ours has died?<br><br>I have never felt so dark about the future, Archdruid. I am happy to prepare for a world without oil, but I wonder if I won't be killed by the irresponsibility of past generations first. How does nuclear waste fit into the Peak Oil equation? What can we do to protect ourselves and the next generations from it?<br><br>I wish mankind had never discovered atoms, much less decided to split them. I'll never forgive my parents' generation for deciding that it was just fine to continue creating a massive mess that it had no idea how to clean up, and leaving my generation to mop it up somehow or die trying. Are we at or near 'Peak Nuclear Waste' or is that just getting started?<br><br>Archdruid, is there anything we can do about this?<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c5012182765795841574 title="comment permalink">6/14/12, 2:41 PM</a><br><br>

She then told us, "I usually teach in California, and in any group there's always one or two women who will raise their hands and say, 'Well, if you BELIEVED hard enough, then you probably could.'"

It's a small group in comparison to the corporate cultists right now, but it is growing and coalescing, seems to be primarily an urban-centric group, and hasn't yet fully materialized. There are signs of it in OWS, but that movement is still too inchoate to shift politics, though again I think this will change.<br><br>Regarding the New Agers: they are dogmaticists with fairy dust and angel feathers. The biggest difference between a New Age Bookstore and a Christian one is generally that the New Age book covers feature nude female angels and fairies, while the Christian ones usually show them clothed with Jesus in the foreground.

I had just picked up "The Myth of Progress: Toward a Sustainable Future" by Tom Wessels from my local library branch. One of things that surprised me is that Chaos Theory was renamed Complex Systems Theory. I highly recommend it to readers who want a good overview on the ideas of Ecology/complex systems and how they apply to economics and politics. Its a short book (122 pages) and an easy fast read, but with lots of things to think about long after you set the book down.<br><br>While so much of the book is relevant to this discussion, one paragraph is particularly relevant: "Just as the notion that ever-increasing growth will generate further progress has no scientific grounding, our current global economic system is behaving in a way that is absolutely contradictory to the way all natural complex systems function. Where natural systems grow more diverse, integrated, and efficient, with each specialized part working to support the other parts in a stable system, our global economic system is moving in the opposite direction. It is moving toward simplification and homogeneity through competitive exclusion, wasteful use of resources, and lack of integration, with each corporate entity looking out for its own interests--profits--rather than the well-being of the whole system.

It's interesting to me that the media do quite often dabble in historic parallels, even though they never take that to the point of learning lessons from the past. <br><br>Thijs, granted! Myself, I tend to think that 11th century Viking kings were probably smarter, as a rule, than 21st century American politicians; in a world in which leading national politicians were expected to lead their armies into battle, sword in hand, the kind of bland blinking idiocy so common these days faced a Darwinian selection process slanted sharply against it. <br><br>Ofthehands, that's promising -- the sooner we start seeing networks of people who have accepted the reality of decline, and are willing to take action to deal with it, the better. <br><br>Karim, that's absolutely classic.

I delivered a sermonette at our church in Vt a couple of weeks ago on that theme. To whit.<br><br>We have been sold a pack of lies in order to keep the economy growing, Its time to admit those lies are killing us. The worst of those lies tells us - we can pretty much ignore the costs of our excesses because our technological ingenuity will always save us. <br>To help me with such understanding, I often to turn to the teachings of St Wendell Berry, whose Agrarian Essays have much to say on the subject. He notes:<br>The higher aims of “technological progress” is our money and ease. And this exalted greed for money and ease is disguised and justified by an obscure cultish faith in the future. We do as we do, we say “for the sake of the future” or “to make a better future for our children.” How can we hope to make a good future by doing badly in the present, we do not say. We cannot think about the future, of course, for the future does not exist: the existence of the future is an article of faith. We can be assured only that, if there is to be a future, the good of it is already implicit in the good things of the present. …….. We have no need to contrive and dabble at “the future of the human race”; we have the same pressing need that we’ve always had–to love, care for, and to teach our children. <br>To truly understand the damage caused by this ideal of technological progress we need to see how it works with it’s sister our much beloved “market system”. Together they have oh so effectively transferred much our wealth from the common populace to the moneyed interests. Together these systems depend on a myth of an “infinite earth” which will keep providing resources long into that dreamed of future. We are learning that this isn’t true --but we are incapable of stopping ourselves from demanding more. Why? Berry thinks this is because we have become quite stupid. He says:<br>After several generations of “technical progress” in fact we have become a people who cannot think about anything important. How far down the natural order must we go to find creatures who raise their young as indifferently as industrial humans now do,? Even the English sparrows do not let loose into the streets young sparrows who have no notion of their identity or their adult responsibilities. When else in history would you find “ educated” people who know more about sports than about the history of the country, or of uneducated people do not know the stories of their families and their communities?”<br>How do we counter this state of affairs? <br><br> Berry would have us all renounce the machines, move back to nurturing the land and re-discover the power of indigenous culture. I would like to suggest that we at least consider a great pause in our pursuit of progress. There is certainly good reasons for considering this. Look at our frightfully early spring, the failing crops around the world, dying fish in the Gulf and the petroleum wars that afflict us.<br>It is time for a bold approach. I suggest a proclamation: Progress is our most destructive product. We’ve got to pause and digest the implications of what we have done already. We must put off the seductive promises of a better future and nurture the world of today. But as good Progressives, That’s not going to be easy.<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c2763822445662052095 title="comment permalink">6/14/12, 6:17 PM</a><br><br>

There's two beliefs that they must have about whatever energy source to take that position. One is to believe in its physical feasibility. The second is that it would be positive to have.<br><br>Almost all the discussions center around the first belief, the technical aspects of what's being proposed. Those are important discussions, of course, but it's worrying to me that the second belief isn't questioned hardly at all. It's just assumed that a major new source of energy would be a positive thing, so the believers can call us the pessimists.<br><br>I do question that belief too. For a thought experiment, lets consider what might happen if against all odds, a free energy source or one at least one that's so cheap and abundant that it's nearly free were to be discovered, and let's say, as some of those theories do, that it's clean and produces no pollution, and would be easily enough to produce that people would have ready access to it. I would think that would not be positive at all, in fact it would be the worst thing to ever happen to humanity and the Earth. The finite amount of energy that fossil fuels has brought has already brought so much destruction to the Earth, not just through direct pollution but through all the ways we use it. Those who think that free energy would bring a utopia have a fundamental misunderstanding of people. If free energy were available, that would also mean, extremists, terrorists, governments, corporations, whoever it is you're most afraid of would also have free energy, It would increase the consequences exponentially of not just evil, but also simple mistakes. People having free energy would be like a group of small children finding dynamite. It would then be possible for a human action to literally end the world. I'd much rather face the effects of peak oil than a world of free energy.<br><br>I used that line of argument recently with someone whom I'd debated the subject with before, who'd into Thrive. I didn't convince him but it did make him think a lot more than talking about thermodynamics and such did. He finally came up with a response that he thought that if people had free energy, they'd be satisfied and conflict would end because people wouldn't be fighting over anything anymore. My reply was that having all the energy from fossil fuels didn't turn people into saints, so why adding more energy do so? People would be the same, the stakes would just be higher.<br><br>I'll definitely be using the "free energy would be undesirable" line of reasoning again, as arguing thermodynamics with someone who has already decided they think they know of an exception doesn't go anywhere. I don't really expect to convince many people, just point out an underlying assumption that they mat never have thought to question before.<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c2493457287057073333 title="comment permalink">6/14/12, 6:19 PM</a><br><br>

They wanted a three year payback on the conservative side, or they wanted the government to pay for the entire cost on the liberal side, and since neither was possible, I might just as well tell them the truth, right?:-)<br><br>Anyway, there is one story that travels along the same lines in that I was instrumental in having Representative Roscoe Bartlett come to my town and lecture on the aspects of peak oil (2007) to the local Republican leaders (mostly environmentalists-types came, packed the place they did).<br><br>Afterward, this Vice-Chairman of the county party made it a point to hand me a ream of paper he had printed off the internet denying peak oil.

Dion Fortune, one of the major magical theorists of the 20th century, suggested puckishly in one of her books that the whole fetish of limitlessness was given to the pop occultists of their time to keep them from hurting themselves; the secret of power, after all, is in concentration, and concentration may be defined as the acceptance of limits. <br><br>Dale, I'm not at all sure that it's valid to confuse anosognosia and denial -- the attempt to reduce psychology to neurology, though it's scored a few hits, seems to me to have racked up a lot more misses of the standard reductionistic type. <br><br>GuRan, thank you. <br><br>Chrisroy, that's a hard row to hoe. I'd encourage you not to push the issue with her -- do what you can on your own, without bringing her into it, and see if she figures things out when she doesn't feel she has to defend her own viewpoint. As for the vellum edition, well, I hope there'll be a letterpress edition on paper before then!<br><br>Mister R., "a rubber dagger to a sword fight" is a nice crisp description. The problem with the Dems these days, as I see it, is that the DNC gets more money when they lose than when they win -- Dubya was a financial godsend to them -- and since they don't have, as the GOP does, an agenda to push -- that's why every Democratic president since 1980 has simply copied whatever the last successful GOP president did -- the temptation to throw elections, and profit from the flood of panicked donations from supporters, is very strong. <br><br>Ghung, that's really good to hear. What you're suggesting, if I may sum up a bit, is that we can fall forward rather than falling back; it's certainly worth a try. <br><br>Stu, nicely put -- and good for you for catching onto the fact that the faith in progress is a form of civil religion. <br><br>Robo, there's more than one American dream, and the dream of limitless economic betterment has always had to contend with the dream of a willing embrace of hardship in service to a high ideal, the way of thinking that brought the Pilgrims and so many other religious groups here. It might be possible to tap into that latter; I'll be talking about that down the road a bit. <br><br>Alex, I've met Chris and read some of his work; we certainly have some interests in common, though there are also some disagreements.

This is one of the reasons why poverty is so useful a tool as we move ahead. <br><br>JP, if you go around telling people that the end of the industrial age is a glorious opportunity, you're lying to them. It really is that simple. It's going to be a difficult, wrenching time with a lot of suffering; there will be consolations and triumphs, to be sure, but it's an embarrassing sign of the sense of entitlement that pervades our culture that so many people think the future has to be sugar-coated. As for inner strength -- er, have you ever had to deal with a real tragedy or an imminent threat to your own survival? Playacting the heroic adventurer isn't a useful response in such times; the strength that matters comes from confronting the full reality of the situation, and going ahead anyway. <br><br>Don, that's pretty much how I expect things to unfold.

There are hundreds of more constructive ways you could face the future, you know. I'd encourage you to consider getting some counseling. <br><br>Allison, it's important to recognize the difference between a real problem and the use that's been made of that problem for propagandistic purposes. Yes, there's quite a bit of nuclear waste out there, and at this point there's no realistic hope that any of it is going to be stored in anything remotely like a safe manner before decline takes away the funding that would have been needed for so huge a project. That means that for many centuries to come, some areas of the Earth's surface are going to be places where you don't go, because those who go there get sick and die. <br><br>That's the ugly reality. That's not the same thing as an extinction event, though, and those who have been claiming that, say, the collapse of Fukushima Daiichi reactor building 4 will bring about an extiction event are engaging in the same sort of hyperbole as those who claimed that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was going to cause an extinction event. As more and more of the waste gets released into the biosphere, there are going to be many deaths, many cancers, and a wide range of other health problems -- but you know, that's equally true of many of the other forms of brainless meddling industrial civilization has inflicted on the biosphere. <br><br>There are things that can be done, if you happen to be downwind of a major nuclear waste release, to limit its impact on your health; you'll find a lot of material about that in the older literature of survivalism, the stuff that focused on making it alive through a nuclear war. Ultimately, though, each of us is going to die sometime, and in the deindustrial age beginning around us right now, it's fairly likely that most of us aren't going to die of advanced old age. Getting used to that, as our ancestors were used to that, is a valuable skill. <br><br>Blackwings, an excellent teaching story! I've had to deal with students like that -- and, yes, it was mostly in California. <br><br>Kurt, good. I see the same sort of realignment in its early phases right now; it'll be interesting to see how it develops in the years immediately before us. <br><br>Mike, thank you. <br><br>Chris, well put. There has to be room for conversation, even -- or especially -- between people who disagree on fundamental issues. <br><br>Bruce, thanks for the recommendation! I'm not familiar with that book, and clearly need to fix that. <br><br>Danogenes, nicely put. This discussion is a good generator of slogans and punch lines!<br><br>Ozark, excellent! I don't usually give out two gold stars in a night, but you get one. Keep on pursuing that line of argument, and see what kinds of responses you get. It's counterintuitive enough that it might just work. <br><br>Richard, wait a few years. Some of them will be seeking you out in a fair state of embarrassment to ask your advice. Others will be joining a fanatic religious cult that claims that Jesus will bring back the oil if they just pray long and hard enough. Still others will turn beet red and fail to look you in the eyes when your paths cross on the street.

But he responds, saying something like, “Well, there may be some challenges and setbacks in the future because of peak oil, but it seems almost inevitable that progress will continue. The exciting part is that no matter how far down the road of progress we travel, we can only see as far as the horizon, and beyond that, the possibilities remain endless. There are really no limits to what human creativity can accomplish.” <br><br>Lately, I have been thinking a lot about human creativity, what it can accomplish and what it can’t, and how the belief in what it can accomplish has become very twisted in this age, due to the temporary abundance of fossil fuels and other non-renewable resources. For the record, I am someone who believes in the power of human creativity, and bemoans a pervasive lack of creativity in this age. I believe that to be fully human is to live a creative life. But to me, human creativity is not synonomous with finding creative ways to (supposedly) transcend natural limits (Kurzweil’s “The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology” is an extreme example of equating creativity solely with surpassing all limits.) The kind of creativity which is really needed in this age, is creativity in living within limits.<br><br>I think we live in a society, so dominated by passive enterntainment and multiple choice tests and the like, where very few people are truly living creative lives that are even close to their potential. Therefore I find it ironic that some suggest that we are living during the greatest outpouring of human creativity in human history (well, there are more humans now than any other time, so in some sense there may be more ideas, but I don’t buy into the belief that other time periods were less creative than the modern era). For the large marjority of people currently living, it is certainly not true. <br><br>Creativity is not always about expanding possibilities, but also creatively recognizing &amp; responding to impossibilities!<br><br>Some people think I don’t have faith in human power to overcome any roadblock in its way. I do have some cautious faith in human power, but paradoxically, I think the most profound human power can only come about when confronting &amp; accepting the limits to human power. That’s a paradox that people in the industrial era have largely failed to grasp. I think a statement of this sort needs to be carved into stone for crowds of passers-by to contemplate…<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c8549804577325980506 title="comment permalink">6/14/12, 10:25 PM</a><br><br>

The current leading politicians in our coalition government have an anti-BBC stance and recently encouraged Rupert Murdoch to become majority owner of TV Channel BSkyB as the main and more powerful alternative. That deal did not happen at the last minute because of revelations of illegal activity at Murdoch's newspapers in the UK. Hacking by reporters into the cell phone of a murdered little girl finally broke through into public awareness and caused a revulsion against the Murdoch Empire, and that stopped the deal. <br>Having said that - in the past the ‘independent’ BBC has soft-pedalled climate change and given a platform for deniers posing as 'scientists'.

To be sure it is not clear how much the presence of so much nuclear contamination will affect the population of a region a few hundred years down the line. On the other hand there is ample evidence that it does pose a severe threat to health. So while we can accept that we are temporary and life is dangerous (which has been a major focus of mine recently, and does not bother me), it would be easy to simply deny the threat especially since it is invisible. <br><br>My namesake ancestor sailed from Holland to Pennsylvania in the 1750's, but all these years later most of his descendants are still in the same small region. That means it's likely most of mine will be too, unless one of us takes some more drastic step. This region is full of nuclear power plants, it's clear the fuel is unlikely to be moved and it will be released in time. The people who live in this region will probably suffer a lot more health problems than they otherwise would have, maybe devastatingly so. So do I adapt in place or flee – not to save myself but to try to get a foothold in some safer region where I might help my children get established? If I stay is that a case of self-deception and denying reality? Accepting one's mortality need not mean staying in obvious danger. These are not trivial problems, and unfortunately the issue of nuclear contamination is a wild card, a new problem that past populations have not had to deal with.

After reading your book, I told my mother about this wonderful author named John Michael Greer, and how his book helped to make sense of the economic situation in the context of human history and civilization. She replied, 'Oh yes, John Michael Greer. That dear boy, I was just talking to him about economics last week'. Apparently the two of you had attended camp together that Summer.

I originally came from the streets and dumpsters of the big city and I have survived my own personal depression. I have been acquainted with hard times and it is difficult to accept going back to that, but in a way those were also the best of times.

You've conveyed the heart of my concern.<br><br>I am 26 years old, and I have not yet had children, any I am not sure that I ever mean to, given the shape of things. But if I do ever have any, through deliberate choice or through unplanned events, I do not want them to be poisoned from their first breath if I can do anything to help, because children are even more susceptible to the effects of food-, air-, and water-borne radiation than adults are. <br><br>Many radioactive compounds which will be released from the pools we have sitting around today have very long half-lives of up to 25,000 years, so they will continue to accumulate in the food chain for generations - and animals do migrate. If there are enough of them, the land in many places will likely become sicker, not healthier, for centuries or even millennia after industrial civilization is gone, and the sickness will spread via ocean currents and groundwater. As Twilight mentions, this is something for which we have no historical precedent. How does this influence the theory of catabolic collapse and successor civilizations? <br><br>I have the greatest respect for the Archdruid's ideas on our predicament and I find him to be the clearest and most sensible voice I've ever heard on these things. But mustn't we include this wild card in our models, too? Isn't this too serious a problem to ignore when deciding to settle in place, if one is fortunate enough to still have a choice in the matter?<br><br>I wish to be clear that I hope that it will not be as bad as this. But without reasons to hope that the waste will spare significant areas of arable land and water, an ecotechnic future begins to look like another comfortable fairy tale. It pains me greatly to suggest this; I want our collective great-great-great-grandchildren to have a shot at a better mode of human life on a healing earth so badly.<br><br>I wonder if there is any credible data on exactly how much of the longer half-life material (plutonium, et al) is out there, and how it might begin to circulate when it leaks or explodes out of those pools. The Hanford cleanup continues to turn up unwelcome surprises, and I don't suppose we know where and how all those warheads in the world are stored, or do we? The fact that nuclear facilities tend to be in population centers (often so situated due to other needed resources nearby) and near coastlines and rivers (or in submarines) bothers me a lot. The nuclear waste might spare some land, but will future humans be able to inhabit the lands that are spared, or will they largely be in the middle of the Sahara desert or atop the Himalayas or something?<br><br>@ JMG - Thank you for your response. I hate to be so dark, but I think we should have this discussion (as rational adults, not survivalists-gone-paranoid-conspiracists!), and I would be thrilled if the Archdruid would consider it for a future post or series of posts, if only to help those of us who are concerned about it to come to terms with the idea.<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c7696560214023734215 title="comment permalink">6/15/12, 11:39 AM</a><br><br>

Few if any large powerful organisations could, at present, stomach promoting a lifestyle of less and I suspect that few consumers would listen if it sounded at all like they would have to give up their luxuries. Of course these changes will be enforced at some point, but until then I suspect that the defectors will only trickle out at the edges of the mainstream.

We humans evolved under certain limits and we express ourselves within the limits of the (admittedly broad) niche we inhabit. Our brains and thought processes are limited as is everything else about us. It seems to me that thinking that any way we humans behave has no limits is an expression of adolescence. Unfortunately too many adults outside of this blog don't seem to have gotten beyond adolescent behavior -- maybe because of the fossil-fueled expansion of what we humans have been able to do for the last few hundred years.<br><br>I also have a response for those who argue that more available energy, or more money, enhance creativity. My experience has been the opposite. It was by accepting severe limits on our household income that my husband and I became more creative, because we had to do ourselves what we'd been able to do the lazy way with money or machines before. I'm not arguing to get rid of all machinery, just that the less of it that you use, the more you have to figure out how to obtain needs and wants without it, and the better you get at distinguishing between needs and wants. And by doing that, you grow out of adolescence into maturity.<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c730937365253393609 title="comment permalink">6/15/12, 2:31 PM</a><br><br>

As for progress, well, far be it from me to try to argue anybody out of their religious belief! Please be aware, though, that I don't share your faith, and I don't see Spengler's vision as any sort of fatalism -- quite the contrary, it refuses to shackle the human future to a linear trend of supposed progress, but leaves each Culture the right and power to envision the cosmos in its own unique (and uniquely human) way. <br><br>Xhmko, thank you!

It's fair point about horses though. <br><br>Of course some developments spread fast.

There is, as JMG notes, a lot of propaganda, and a lot of nonsense. There is also the problem of honest ignorance - we honestly don't know how big of a problem this is. We'd only have 60 years of data if perfect records and measurements were kept, and that tells us nothing about the environmental effects of the longer half-life isotopes.

The Glenn Beck fireside library certainly comes to mind. I have had this thought many times. That being said, that is a very slippery slope to get on. If it's ok to burn books I disagree with, then I can't judge when other parties burn books I think have value. I have an extensive library of books on the history of the Islamic Golden Age that I cherish and feel should be preserved for future generations. There are probably many more people in this country would love nothing more than to see those books be part of a zoroastrian ritual. I also feel that getting rid of a book or idea I disagree with is simply a step closer to having the desire to get rid of the person, espousing said belief or idea. As JMG has so often elequently phrased it, the culmination of all of this ends with people, bound and gagged, face down in ditches. From a more pragmatic standpoint, I generally buy my books secondhand, and I often see books I would love to see used as fire starters. I am on a limited budget so for every book I would buy to destroy, I would be missing out on buying a book I think should be preserved. So it comes down to I am going to being a protector of things I cherish, and feel have value for future generations, or a destroyer of things I don't like. I choose to be a protector. I also feel that some of the stupidity today, that trees have so valiantly died in vain to produce, have value in the sense that future generations can study them to gain insight on how it all went wrong.<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c5400496629633662466 title="comment permalink">6/16/12, 4:40 PM</a><br><br>

This conveys a general message of "be afraid", and I am. But like most readers here, I am also attempting to plan and live my life in a meaningful way, in this context where so many of the systems we know and depend on for constructing meaning and for surviving, are collapsing or overdue to do so. <br><br>To me this begs the question of what, if any, systemic elements we may reasonably seek not only to conserve (in the hope that they will survive the collapse) but also perhaps to develop to greater levels of complexity, interrelation, synergy and beauty.<br><br>As far as I can see the concept and current reality of collapse refers to at least three (intertwined) processes:<br><br>1. "The far side of Hubbert's curve" - the inevitable global decline of energy use as fossil fuel reserves dwindle.<br><br>2. The collapse of ecosystems at various scales, including a devastating wave of extinctions.<br><br>3. The collapse of the human economic, social and cultural systems that constitute civilization as we know it. This side of the coin is perhaps most evident in places like the USA and my home the UK, that have been dominant powers of the industrial age and are by most measures now declining rapidly (while a chasm of inequality still permits the illusion of opulence for those financially propped up by the remnants of the established system). In other parts of the world like China, India or Brazil, a different part of the growth trajectory is in progress - and it is still "progress", despite the wider context of point 1 above.<br><br>These processes of collapse no doubt have shared resonances for those of us experiencing them all simultaneously; but they are not the same process, and the situation as a whole allows a wide range of opportunities for us to respond and intervene in these processes in various ways through our individual or collective human agency.<br><br>Placing the emphasis on "collapse" and its synonyms encourages responses that are focused on conservation / preservation of existing functional elements, with the expectation that the system as a whole will get simpler and lose many of its existing functionalities.<br><br>Such responses certainly have validity and importance. But I do wonder if the current situation does not also have potentials for "emergence" of new complexities and functionalities - which the emphasis on fear, where it excludes hope, may prevent us from perceiving.<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c4118009488981770363 title="comment permalink">6/17/12, 4:58 AM</a><br><br>

The same is true, to varying degrees, for people of many oppressed minorities. Conversations take place every day, on the internet and in all sorts of events and meetings everywhere, between people whose voices would not previously have been heard or had the opportunity to form alliances and begin creating the changes they wish to see. Different modes of expression and creativity allow the emergence of new social forms.<br><br>Yes, there are of course all sorts of nutters forming alliances too - but partly, you see what you're looking for. If you look for hope, generosity and wisdom, there is plenty to be found, and I personally have been staggered by the evidence of positive human qualities that I have stumbled across through my involvement in my local Transition initiative and the alliances it has formed.<br><br>I see a danger in the focus on "collapse" if this puts on blinkers that stop us from seeing what may be getting better, as well as what's getting worse. Perhaps we only see "collapse" to the extent that we identify with the systems that are collapsing. From the 3-point list above, it seems quite correct to me that we should identify with 2 - collapsing ecosystems - because we are, in physical reality, dependent on those systems. <br><br>But in the case of points 1 and 3, it would seem desirable to me that we dis-identify from those systems (fossil fuel dependent economies and industrial civilisations) as quickly as possible. Our identification with them is psychological; to a great extent it is also currently physical, but the sooner we can put in place alternative ways of meeting the needs they currently meet (from energy and food production to meaning and purpose), the less we will experience our lives as being part of those particular processes of collapse. It then becomes more possible to think in terms of development, emergence, and perhaps the "maturity" somebody referred to above - beyond our fossil-fuel powered "adolescence"...<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c5042249588849182324 title="comment permalink">6/17/12, 5:00 AM</a><br><br>

I had it from a specialist physicist at the time that if the Chernobyl 'cloud' had turned over and reached Kiev there would have been tens of thousands of prompt deaths. As it was, it was high enough temperature to widely disperse. There was large enough deposits of radioactive iodine round my house (Scot/Eng border) if the cows had been grazing outside i.e. a few weeks later) then their milk would have needed to be thrown away. Iodine is short lived but I understand did the most damage to children in the USSR, because it concentrates dramatically in the thyroid gland.<br><br>Biological concentration is a significant source of threat more generally. Strontium, for example in young bones was significant after earlier atom bomb testing. UK still must control sheep meat from certain pastures contaminated by Chernobyl Caesium 131.

To my mind, the notion that any belief system can correspond to ultimate reality is the height of hubris, and deserves the shellacking that hubris inevitably brings; the best we can do, I would suggest, is to come up with models that don't stray too far from the way that reality has appeared, so far, to an idiosyncratic set of primate sense organs and nervous system. <br><br>Cherokee, and of course that's the elephant in the room, isn't it? Way too much of the protest against the industrial system in all its forms, including nuclear power, comes from people who benefit directly from that same system.

As it is, though, any modern book that isn't reprinted on acid-free paper or some other durable medium is going to be gone forever in the not too distant future, since current high-acid paper turns back into sawdust in fifty years or so. <br><br>Leo, excellent! After the competition is over, perhaps you could post the essay to a website and put a link here; I'm not the only one who will want to read it. <br><br>Hannah, I use terms like "decline" and "collapse" because it's been my repeated experience that people -- especially those who belong to the middle classes of the industrial world -- tend to brush aside the very personal impact that the end of the industrial age will have on their standards of living and lifestyles. It's easy to talk about replacing what we get from collapsing industrial systems with something else, as you have, but the stark fact is that most of it won't be replaced -- it's going to have to be abandoned and foregone, because renewable systems can only provide a small fraction of the energy inputs we currently get from fossil fuels. <br><br>That means that your standard of living, and mine, and that of everyone else reading this blog, are going to drop precipitously in the years to come. The pervasive sense of entitlement that pervades middle class culture these days makes that concept almost unthinkable, and so I've found that it's necessary to use strong terms to break through the delusive notion that the gravy train will continue to roll, no matter what. Once we can get past that delusion, and accept the fact that by contemporary standards, all of us are going to become very poor in the future, we can start talking about the emergence of new possibilities; as long as thinking about those possibilities is held hostage by the fantasy of middle class entitlement, it's a waste of time, because the only thing people want to talk about is how they can cling to the privileged lifestyles they enjoy today. <br><br>Stephen, excellent! Yes, by the word "progress" I mean the Carl Sagan fantasy of humanity climbing an endless stair of technological complexity toward some undefined but glorious future out there among the stars. That's the great myth of our age, toward which I am a disbeliever and a heretic. Adaptation, on the other hand, is an essential human trait; we're very good at it, and you're quite right that the navies of the 22nd century will use different kinds of sailing vessels than those of the 18th century did. (We could have an interesting conversation about that sometime; the very short form is that once shells replaced solid shot as cannon ammo, the wooden ship became a deathtrap, but steel-hulled windjammers proved their worth as a viable technology in the late 19th century, and will probably be the mainstay of oceanic trade and naval architecture in the 22nd.) <br><br>Phil, all highly relevant. A post or two on the nuclear aspect of the future is probably inevitable, I gather. <br><br>Dltrammel, thank you for the quote!<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c3439996620054903431 title="comment permalink">6/17/12, 10:57 AM</a><br><br>

That which we can accomplish in the present must be better than what we could accomplish in the past. A small example from the textile arts. Compare microfiber hiking socks with a pair of microfiber fashion stockings. The hiking sock is objectively better in certain ways than a cotton or wool sock, as it fulfills the functions of a sock better. It cushions the foot with less matting; it wicks sweat away more effectively, it insulates from cold, it reduces abrasion from the shoe, etc. The fashion stockings resemble the hiking sock in being produced from petrochemicals by complex manipulation and advanced technical processes. But are they in any way objectively better than a silk stocking? they contribute nothing to the safety, comfort or health of the wearer. While oil is cheap they will be cheaper, but better? Not really. Loss of modern cold and wet weather gear will be an inconvenience to those who will have to work in cold, wet environments. Loss of microfiber stockings will be easier to bear.<br><br>As for book burning--I will here confess that back in the 70s I threw away a box of copies of a right wing screed called _None Dare call it Treason_.

The place offered dinner as well, which I took advantage of, and spent an evening chatting with the owners (a retired couple of white South Africans), and the other guests, a young American couple. At some point the conversation turned to standards of living in the country, or some such, and the owner began talking of one of his children being in some successful profession (accountancy, perhaps?) and earning a comfortable wage by first-world middle class standards. I then made the point that the average wage in the country was about R3,000 (about $400) per month. He looked at me with contempt in his eyes, and said "Oh, come on..."<br><br>What he didn't say, but left hanging in the air, was something to the effect of "you mean all those poor (mostly black) people. They don't count." It was fairly clear that his world only really included the middle class (who incidentally cannot make up more than 5% of the country). I left it at that, not wanting to start an argument with the people whose roof I was sleeping under that night, but I suspect the American couple had a brief but educational experience from it.<br><br>What made me think of this story, in the context of this post, is that the parting of the ways will likely be between an ever-shrinking middle class, and a vast less-privileged majority. And it got me to thinking that Apartheid South Africa is a good model for how this might play out. In that case, the classes were split along hard racial lines, but the concept was similar -- the government did everything it could during the 60s to the 80s to maintain a comfortable bubble around the middle class (in this case white South Africans), while carefully hiding the often horrifying lengths they had to take to keep the underclass in line. <br><br>There are differences in the situation, most notably that in most developed countries, everyone gets to vote, whereas under Apartheid only the middle class did, but I can certainly see this as a potential pattern for the future: governments beholden to the moneyed classes, dedicated to keeping them in a contented bubble for as long as possible, while suppressing everyone else. <br><br>To some extent, this is already true, given the degree to which government is beholden to corporate sponsors, who have a vested interest in keeping the middle class comfortably consuming.<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c166152732541698818 title="comment permalink">6/17/12, 5:29 PM</a><br><br>

Catabolic collapse certainly embraces this point.<br><br>However, I have never seen any benefit from delaying the inevitable, other than the fact that it delays having to make any changes to avoid the situation. There always comes a point in time though when the charade can no longer be maintained and either the business slips into a simpler state (ie. administration) or it collapses (ie. bankruptcy).

It was indeed by being in tune with their environment that they figured this out, aided by a lot of time – time during which a lot of people probably suffered. The concentration and variety of radioactive material we've placed in these plants dwarfs what occurred naturally too.<br><br>The basic question comes down to how large the yet to be created no-go zones will be. If they are large enough to begin to span the distance from one plant to the next (which I believe to be true), then whole regions will badly effected. I'm 12 miles from a boiling water reactor, which is certainly too close.<br><br>The Archdruid's post this week hit fairly close to home for me, and as luck would have it the comments brought out the reason. This issue of nuclear waste is the bit of reality I've been refusing to deal with, and while I know it and I'm not trying to pretend otherwise the mental effects are still there. A look at the map on Mother Jones charting nuclear facilities shows the entire eastern seaboard from Virginia Beach to Boston, along with the entire eastern half of Pennsylvania is likely to be contaminated. Not to mention Tennessee and the Carolinas. I know this but I stay, because of family and social ties, because I still have a job and a mortgage on my home, because of a lifetime invested here, because I love this place and there is a tiny chance the fuel may be removed. But really, I know the truth. <br><br>I'm not sure our host needs to spend time on a key post on this topic as it's not that hard to find out the facts. In a general sense, this week's post has already addressed it – it's not a matter of needing someone to tell you what to do, it's more a matter of allowing yourself to perceive what is clear to see, just like peak oil, climate change, rising seas, and so on.

One of the thoughts I had on the parting of the ways is that the complexities both of nature and society mean that most people can’t really picture the changes that are taking place. The “denialist” folk I talk to look around at the acres of local forest and say we certainly have enough forest! They look at the fields and cattle and say the descriptions of agi-business destruction are just sensationalism. Some people almost have to experience some “peak” resources themselves or see it locally, to understand or believe it. I once thought internet would make a huge difference there, but not so much. Yes, there are those who now use the ‘net to “witness” what’s going on elsewhere, but too many people either don’t look, or don’t trust what they see (understandable, given the various lies and biases), or simply can’t fully grasp what they haven’t experienced. It may always be thus. <br><br>I’m getting more involved in my local-food network, and hopefully will have a chance to help present some of this information to the local population, which is strongly conservative and suspicious of “new agers” (which label they apply to anyone who professes love of the Earth). I like some of the approaches suggested. Recently, I had a chance to mention my current contract position as administrative assistant for the state’s Green Schools association to my Limbaugh-Republican neighbors, and of course they howled at such a “lame-brained” (not the word they used) concept – I pointed out that many schools are signing on to recycling, conserving, reusing as a way to save money, because it does! And they admitted that – if it saves money – then it’s a good thing to do in this economy… so there are backdoor ways to get some of these concepts through.<br><br>The Apple pectin link doesn’t seem to work – it’s i-sis, not isis<br><a rel=nofollow>http://www.i-sis.org.uk/Apple_Pectin_for_Radioprotection.php</a><br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c4173754618979951320 title="comment permalink">6/18/12, 8:21 AM</a><br><br>

I live in the Puget Sound region, and the fallout from Fukushima concerned me, especially as reporting by US sources did not seem trustworthy, and Canadian monitoring was actually scaled back during the crisis.<br><br>Geiger counters or radiation meters are easy to acquire, and quite cheap, only a couple hundred $. Unfortunately, this equipment only detects and measures radioactivity per se; it does not identify the isotopes (e.g. of cesium , iodine, strontium, plutonian, etc...) producing said radiation. <br><br>I did not (and do not at this time) worry about dangerous doses of radiation, but I would sure like to know what sort radiactive isotopes are wafting to, or through, my environment. So I did some homework as to what sort of equipment you'd need to measure such: Basically you need a gamma-ray spectrometer; any given isotope emits it own characteristic energy of gamma ray. So measure the gamma ray energy-spectrum of your sample, and you've fingerprinted the isotope. A good way to sample the air is simply to use your car's air-filter to trap any fallout.<br><br>Gamma-ray spectrometers are around $10,000, and not the sort of thing I can just spring for. So I did more homework (I'm a former electrical engineer, now a physician), and learned that you can gin up one with a detector made from a sodium iodide crystal doped with thallium, a photomultiplier tube with pre-amp, miscellaneous commercial electrical hardware and a lap-top computer. I arrived at a cost for this system of around $2000, but what stopped me was having to write the software. I just don't have the time for this task.<br><br>When all is said done, this project still sits at the back of my mind; I think I could actually do it. What I am wondering is: should I? I'm worried that being "blind" to the isotopes in my environment may constitude a big risk in my future. But my time is committed as it is being a physician, being a dad of 2 young kids, trying to pay down student loan debt, a mortgage, and trying to prepare in place for the economically rugged future that appears to be bearing down on us all.

One of the things that's helped create the current dismissal of green technologies on the part of conservatives is that much of what is sold as green technology these days is simply another form of conspicuous consumption, sold to a mostly privileged audience using ecological slogans. The older and simpler technologies that were central to Seventies appropriate tech, by contrast, got a lot of use across the political spectrum because they saved money. (Example -- my dad, who voted for Reagan twice, also installed insulated window covers and drove a fuel-efficient car, for the most pragmatic of economic reasons.) The same pitch can be used by green wizards today. <br><br>Nomad, I don't think so. I think it's partly that progress has become a civil religion and most people are true believers, and partly that most people are scared to death about the consequences if the religion of progress turns out not to be true. <br><br>El, I haven't studied hydroponics -- I tend to aim much lower on the technological scale. <br><br>Lunar, it may not be something in which you can invest a lot of time right at the moment, but you might ask around -- perhaps on the <a href=http://www.greenwizards.org rel=nofollow>Green Wizards</a> forum -- and see if there are others interested in working together on such a project. It would be a very useful technology to have around. <br><br>Cherokee, there's a very delicate dance going on right now between China and the US -- each nation is dependent on the other, even though one is trying to supplant the other and the other is trying with increasing desperation not to be supplanted. One possible future, though the odds against it seem fairly long just now, would see a declining US in desperation cut the same sort of deal with China that Britain cut with the US in 1945, allowing China to take over as global hegemon while the US maintains some scraps of its dignity and its current empire. if it comes to war between the two of them -- even proxy war, which seems far and away the most likely outcome -- it's going to be a much rougher future.<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c7026736276260439690 title="comment permalink">6/18/12, 9:56 PM</a><br><br>

What I'm not interested in pursuing is the sort of radical demonization of opposing views that you seem to be applying to believers in progress.

We needed 'covered cropping' for fast growing plants that never went beyond the juvenile phase, and that also were hungry for NPK and needed constant watering. Large pots or beds of deep soil were 'not on'. However, we did not progress to full 'hydroponics' because of the tricky control systems needed to maintain a constant ionic 'salt' concentration, the proper ratios of a complete suite of dissolved minerals, and also pH control. We used minimum soil/peat/growing medium with limited intermittent use of dissolved NPK etc. The growing medium had a buffering 'ion exchange' capacity and allowed high density fast growth in small pots that could be thrown out; the place to be sterilised and the cycle to be repeated every few weeks. Expensive and daft for food growing and not a lot of use unless you have a very high financial value or illegal crop to maximise through-put in covered space. (Incidentally, the ‘space’ needs other environmental controls. This is not 'closed-loop'; water and gas-exchange is to the air and the dissolved nutrients need constant monitoring and supply with controlled feed-back inputs.)<br>Have a look at some modern 'temperate' indoor tomato systems which use low volume 'soil' and constant liquid 'feed'. And look and taste the product. They look like tomatoes when cellophane-packed but are not, in my view, tomatoes!<br>best<br>Phil<br><br><a href=parting-of-ways.html#c600021664225457795 title="comment permalink">6/20/12, 1:04 AM</a><br><br>

Some "leader" has convinced them that if they succeed in shoving this hulk of aluminum and plastic off the edge of the Grand Canyon, it will fly -- you know, like airliners in the Age of Petroleum once did.

Hopefully the third time will be a charm. My apologies for taking so long after the Age of Limits to find my books on lime plaster. The most informative book I have read on building with lime is aptly titled Building With Lime: A Practical Introduction. It is written by stafford Holmes and Michael Wingate and was published by ITDG Publishing in 1997 and 2002.<br><br>Though lacking in some of the finer details (and much of the obsolete jargon) covered in lime manuals from the 19th century, Building With Lime condenses useful information from various specialty texts in one place. It covers renders, mortars, stuccos, limewashes, brown coats, finish coats, moldings, hydraulic limes, and lime cements as well as giving specifications for limestone, aggregates, and additives. <br><br>I've made it sound tediously technical, but it is actually a pretty good read, especially if you keep in mind the historical context that killed the lime industry and made Portland cement king. A lot of incredible benefits were traded away in that deal.<br><br>For a more polished, photo-filled homage to lime I would recommend Using Natural Finishes by Adam Weismann and Katy Bryce, published by Green Books in 2008. For an historical snapshot try the trade manual Concrete, Cements, Mortars, Artificial Marbles, Plasters, and Stuccos by fred T. Hodgson, printed in 1916 and again in 2003 by Fredonia Books. There are plenty of books out there right now about Venetian plastering and strawbale housing; however, as trendy status indicators, they pass on a lot of disinformation in the form of exaggerated claims and enthusiastically believed myths. For example, most commercially available Venetian plasters do not "breathe" any more than paint due to their acrylic latex base.<br><br>On the subject of this week's post, the nuclear industry seems to be dutifully trying to inflate a new "clean-nuclear" bubble in case the Marcellus bubble can't float the markets to new highs. Several commenters at Naked Capitalism have started an incessant drone about thorium reactors, their untold benefits, and their complete lack of drawbacks. Oddly, they have been garnering breathless support form otherwise sane readers.
