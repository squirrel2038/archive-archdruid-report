I’m not sure how many people outside the writer’s trade realize how much of writing is a cooperative process. That’s as true of those of us who write late at night in the privacy of a silent room as it is of the more gregarious sort of writer, the kind you can expect to find in a crowded café, surrounded by voices and music and the clatter of street noises coming in the door: every writer is simply one voice in an ongoing conversation that includes many other voices, some living, some dead and some not yet born. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As I write this week’s post, for example, it’s difficult not to notice some of the other voices in this particular conversation. The bookshelf an easy reach to my left has a row of brightly colored trade paperbacks by some of my fellow peak oil authors—William Catton, Richard Heinberg, Jim Kunstler, Sharon Astyk, Dmitry Orlov, Carolyn Baker and more. Close by, the rolling brown landscape of Arnold Toynbee’s <i>A Study of History</i>, all ten volumes, confronts the twin black monoliths of Oswald Spengler’s <i>The Decline of the West</i>, while Giambattista Vico’s <i>New Science</i> offers an ironic Italian commentary from one side.  Other shelves elsewhere in the room contribute other voices: biology and ecology textbooks from my college days; appropriate tech manuals from the Seventies brimfull of unfulfilled hopes; old texts on the magical philosophy that forms the usually unmentioned foundation from which all my thinking unfolds; and a great deal more. Poets, as often as not, these days: Robinson Jeffers, William Butler Yeats, T.S. Eliot. Without the contributions of all these other voices, the conversation and thus my contributions to it would not be what it is. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, there are times when the conversational nature of what I’m doing becomes more obvious and more direct than usual, and one of those happened the weekend before last, at the <a href=http://ageoflimits.org/ >Age of Limits</a>
conference I discussed in last week’s post. One of my presentations to that conference was a talk entitled "How Civilizations Fall;" longtime readers of this blog will know from the title that what I was talking about that afternoon was the theory of catabolic collapse, which outlines the way that human societies on the way down cannibalize their own infrastructure, maintaining themselves for the present by denying themselves a future.  I finished talking about catabolic collapse and started fielding questions, of which there were plenty, and somewhere in the conversation that followed one of the other participants made a comment. I don’t even remember the exact words, but it was something like, "So what you’re saying is that what we need to do, individually, is to go through collapse right away." </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
"Exactly," I said. "Collapse now, and avoid the rush." </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Outside of that conversation, I doubt I would have thought of the phrase at all. By the end of the conference, though, it was on the lips of a good many of the attendees, and for good reason: I can’t think of a better way to sum up the work ahead of us right now, as industrial society lurches down the far side of its trajectory through time.  Longtime readers of this blog know most of the reasoning behind that suggestion, but it may be worth walking through it again step by step. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
First, industrial society was only possible because our species briefly had access to an immense supply of cheap, highly concentrated fuel with a very high net energy—that is, the amount of energy needed to extract the fuel was only a very small fraction of the energy the fuel itself provided.  Starting in the 18th century, fossil fuels—first coal, then coal and petroleum, then coal, petroleum and natural gas—gave us that energy source. All three of these fossil fuels represent millions of years of stored sunlight, captured by the everyday miracle of photosynthesis and concentrated within the earth by geological processes that took place long before our species evolved.  They are nonrenewable over any time scale that matters to human beings, and we are using them up at astonishing rates. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Second, while it’s easy to suggest that we can simply replace fossil fuels with some other energy source and keep industrial civilization running along its present course, putting that comfortable notion into practice has turned out to be effectively impossible.  No other energy source available to our species combines the high net energy, high concentration, and great abundance that a replacement for fossil fuel would need. Those energy sources that are abundant (for example, solar energy) are diffuse and yield little net energy, while those that are highly concentrated (for example, fissionable uranium) are not abundant, and also have serious problems with net energy.  Abundant fossil fuels currently provide an "energy subsidy" to alternative energy sources that make them look more efficient than they are—there would be far fewer wind turbines, for example, if they had to be manufactured, installed, and maintained using wind energy.  Furthermore, our entire energy infrastructure is geared to use fossil fuels and would have to be replaced, at a cost of countless trillions of dollars, in order to replace fossil fuels with something else. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Third, these problems leave only one viable alternative, which is to decrease our energy use, per capita and absolutely, to get our energy needs down to levels that could be maintained over the long term on renewable sources.  The first steps in this process were begun in the 1970s, with good results, and might have made it possible to descend from the extravagant heights of industrialism in a gradual way,  keeping a great many of the benefits of the industrial age intact as a gift for the future. Politics closed off that option in the decade that followed, however, and the world’s industrial nations went hurtling down a different path, burning through the earth’s remaining fossil fuel reserves at an accelerating pace and trusting that economic abstractions such as the free market would suspend the laws of physics and geology for their benefit. At this point, more than three decades after that misguided choice, industrial civilization is so far into overshoot that a controlled descent is no longer an option; the only path remaining is the familiar historical process of decline and fall. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Fourth, while it’s fashionable these days to imagine that this process will take the form of a sudden cataclysm that will obliterate today’s world overnight, all the testimony of history and a great many lines of evidence from other sources suggests that this is the least likely outcome of our predicament. Across a wide range of geographical scales and technological levels, civilizations take an average of one to three centuries to complete the process of decline and fall, and there is no valid reason to assume that ours will be any exception.  The curve of decline, to be sure, is anything but smooth; it has a fractal structure, taking the form of a succession of crises on many different scales, affecting different regions, social classes, and communities in different ways, interspersed with periods of stabilization and even partial recovery that are equally variable in scale, duration, and relevance to different places and groups.  This ragged arc of decline is already under way; it can be expected to accelerate in the months, years, and decades to come; and it defines the deindustrial age ahead of us. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Fifth, individuals, families, and communities faced with this predicament still have choices left. The most important of those choices parallels the one faced, or more precisely not faced, at the end of the 1970s: to make the descent in a controlled way, beginning now, or to cling to their current lifestyles until the system that currently supports those lifestyles falls away from beneath their feet. The skills, resources, and lifeways needed to get by in a disintegrating industrial society are radically different from those that made for a successful and comfortable life in the prosperous world of the recent past, and a great many of the requirements of an age of decline come with prolonged learning curves and a high price for failure. Starting right away to practice the skills, assemble the resources, and follow the lifeways that will be the key to survival in a deindustrializing world offers the best hope of getting through the difficult years ahead with some degree of dignity and grace. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Collapse now, in other words, and avoid the rush. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a fair amount of subtlety to the strategy defined by those words.  As our society stumbles down the ragged curve of its decline, more and more people are going to lose the ability to maintain what counts as a normal lifestyle—or, rather, what counted as a normal lifestyle in the recent past, and is no longer quite so normal today as it once was. Each new round of crisis will push more people further down the slope; minor and localized crises will affect a relatively smaller number of people, while major crises affecting whole nations will affect a much larger number.  As each crisis hits, though, there will be a rush of people toward whatever seems to offer a way out, and as each crisis recedes, there will be another rush of people toward whatever seems to offer a way back to what used to be normal. The vast majority of people who join either rush will fail. Remember the tens of thousands of people who applied for a handful of burger-flipping jobs during the recent housing crash, because that was the only job opening they could find?  That’s the sort of thing I mean. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The way to avoid the rush is simple enough:  figure out how you will be able to live after the next wave of crisis hits, and to the extent that you can, <i>start living that way now</i>. If you’re worried about the long-term prospects for your job—and you probably should be, no matter what you do for a living—now is the time to figure out how you will get by if the job goes away and you have to make do on much less money. For most people, that means getting out of debt, making sure the place you live costs you much less than you can afford, and picking up some practical skills that will allow you to meet some of your own needs and have opportunities for barter and informal employment.  It can mean quite a bit more, depending on your situation, needs, and existing skills.  It should certainly involve spending less money—and that money, once it isn’t needed to pay off any debts you have, can go to weatherizing your home and making other sensible preparations that will make life easier for you later on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For the vast majority of people, it probably needs to be said, collapsing now does not mean buying a survival homestead somewhere off in the country.  That’s a popular daydream, and in some well-off circles it’s long been a popular way to go have a midlife crisis, but even if you have the funds—and most of us don’t—if you don’t already have the dizzyingly complex skill set needed to run a viable farm, or aren’t willing to drop everything else to apprentice with an organic farmer right now, it’s not a realistic option.  In all likelihood you’ll be experiencing the next round of crises where you are right now, so the logical place to have your own personal collapse now, ahead of the rush, is right there, in the place where you live, with the people you know and the resources you have to hand. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course the strategy of collapsing ahead of the rush is not going to be a popular thing to suggest. When I’ve brought it up, as of course I’ve done more than once, I’ve inevitably fielded a flurry of protests, by turns angry and anguished, insisting that it’s not reasonable to expect anybody to do that, and how can I be so heartless as to suggest it? Fair enough; let’s take a look at the alternatives. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One alternative strategy that gets brought up now and then has at least the advantage of utter honesty. It has two parts. The first part, while the benefits of industrial society are still available, is to enjoy them; the second, when those benefits go away, is to die. Often, though not always, the people who bring up this option have serious health conditions that will probably be fatal in a deindustrial world. I have no quarrel with those who choose this path; it’s an honest response to a very challenging predicament—though I admit I wonder how many people who say they’ve chosen it will be comfortable with their choice once part one gives way to part two. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The problem with most other proposed strategies for dealing with our predicament is that whatever they claim to do in theory, in practice, they amount to these same two steps.  Consider the very widely held notion that advocating for some alternative energy technology is a workable response to the twilight of fossil fuels.  I have no quarrel, again, with people who are actually doing something concrete to get some alternative energy technology into use—for example, the people whose enthusiasm for the Bussard fusion reactor leads them to build a prototype in their basement, or to help fund one of the half dozen or so experimenters who have already done this—but that’s rarely what this approach entails; rather, it seems to consist mostly of posting long screeds on the internet insisting that thorium reactors, or algal biodiesel, or what have you, will solve all our energy problems. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As Zen masters like to say, talk does not cook the rice, and blog posts do not build reactors; with every day that passes, despite any amount of online debate, more oil, coal, and natural gas are extracted from the planet’s dwindling endowment, and the next round of crises comes closer. In the same way, those who put their hopes on grand political transformations, or conveniently undefinable leaps of consciousness, or the timely arrival of Jesus or the space brothers or somebody else who will spare us the necessity of inhabiting a future that is the exact result of our own collective actions, are not doing anything that hasn’t been tried over and over again in the decades just past, without doing anything to slow the headlong rush into overshoot or the opening stages of decline and fall. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Check out the glossy magazines and well-funded websites dedicated to portraying "positive futures" and you can find the same sort of thinking taken to its logical extreme: soothing pablum about this or that person doing this or that wonderful thing, and this or that deep thinker coming up with this or that wonderful idea, all of it reminiscent of nothing so much as the cheerful tunes the <i>Titanic</i>’s band played to keep the passengers calm as water poured into the hull.  There’s quite a lot of money to be made these days insisting that we can have a shiny new future despite all evidence to the contrary, and pulling factoids out of context to defend that increasingly dubious claim; as industrial society moves down the curve of decline, I suspect, this will become even more popular, since it will make it easier for those who haven’t yet had their own personal collapse to pretend that it can’t happen to them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same principle applies to the people who donate to environmental causes and put solar panels on their roofs in the same spirit that led medieval Christians to buy high-priced indulgences from the Church to cancel out their sins. T.S. Eliot countered that sort of attitude unanswerably when he described salvation as "a condition of complete simplicity, costing not less than everything". What we’re discussing belongs to a much less exalted plane, but the same rule applies: if you’re trying to exempt yourself from the end of the industrial age, nothing you can do can ever be enough. Let go, let yourself fall forward into the deindustrial future, and matters are different. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s difficult to think of anything more frightening, or more necessary.  "In order to arrive at what you do not know"—that’s Eliot again—"you must go by a way which is the way of ignorance. In order to possess what you do not possess, you must go by the way of dispossession." Which is to say:  collapse now, and avoid the rush. </div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who don’t happen to remember where they were on May 5, 2000 should probably be glad of that fact. According to Richard Noone’s 1997 bestseller <i>5/5/2000: Ice: The Ultimate Disaster</i>, a planetary alignment on that day would destabilize the world’s ice caps and send them rushing toward the equator, flattening everything in their path. Before it was swamped in the rising tide of panic around the Y2K computer bug, Noone’s prophecy attracted a fair amount of attention in the American alternative scene, and believers discussed plans to loft themselves into the upper atmosphere via high-altitude balloons to wait out the cataclysm, and then return to repopulate the ravaged Earth. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It would have taken only a few minutes with a pocket calculator and a high school physics textbook to figure out that even the most dramatic planetary alignment doesn’t have enough gravitational pull on the Earth’s ice caps to budge them any distance worth noticing, but none of the believers seem to have taken the time to check that possibility.  In the event, the polar ice caps stayed put that day, as they normally do. </div>

We are _not_ entirely self-sufficient, which means we must go to town; the distances vary from 2 miles to a small store with limited stock and high prices run by charming people, to 4 miles to a chain grocery and gas, 5 to the library and 6 to the school and the feed store. Which leads to the predicament that Wendell Berry summed up as "It is very difficult to live in the country in the U.S. and impossible to be a good neighbor in the country without an automobile" (or p/u truck).<br><br>I have considered what we do here that we couldn't do in town, where we would not need a car. The biggest would be firewood, we are self sufficient in that. Everything else we do would fit on a large city or average suburban lot.<br><br>So we are not in the country because it is a huge improvement, but because we like it. We do have room for change, having 8 acres (about 3 hectares). I can and do bicycle; but unless I logged and milled on site (we don't have trees big enough to mill), I still have to truck in materials (we have a tiny cabin, unfinished, and are a long way from a complete farm infrastructure). We could, if we had to, clear a couple of acres for pasture and keep a large cow which could double for milk and part time ox work; that is definitely for a post collapse future though.<br><br>So, we see our path as becoming more self sufficient, and weaning ourselves from the grid and the economy one step at a time. In a piece of good fortune, a swarm of honey bees took over a hive whose colony had died out last winter.

I expect to live the balance of my life in a society dominated by scarcity industrialism, and it will be much younger people who will have to work their way through even an age dominated by a salvage economy. <br>If that's the case, it seems perfectly reasonable for us to pay our indulgences, putting in enough solar panels, for example, to power a small refrigerator and chest freezer, and to support the younger generations who will have to provide the actual leadership and creativity for the next cycle. <br>I once thought I could change the world, and in my twenties I worked for years as a solar energy analyst. But then morning came to America, and I had to find a different way to pay the mortgage. At this point, I could never muster the energy and creativity I had at that time, but I work with many folks who are 25 to 35 years younger than I am, and I'm always impressed by what they can do. <br>If I sound defensive, it's because I'm rushing toward the very path you warn us against, building a villa in a remote Roman province (metaphorically speaking), but I'm really not prepared to ride the downslope in a high-rise apartment in the center of the city.<br><br><a href=#c3442241307924335254 title="comment permalink">6/6/12, 10:03 PM</a><br><br>

It is good if you can live with the limitations and use very little power over winter eg. right here, right now as I pen this comment by a single 15w light globe on a laptop. You are correct to point out that most people can't. Solar power is no answer for the majority and for people with less winter sun than me it is a waste of time – it doesn’t freeze here at all over winter and plants although some whilst being deciduous still grow.<br><br>Sometimes your magic is strong as I'm unsure where your thoughts stop and mine start. I've been working towards my current circumstances since 1992, but your thoughts have certainly influenced my thinking and actions. I picked up some more herbs today too which was very exciting.<br><br>Living in a rural area is not for everyone. I have to be on top of everything here as errors can be a real drama and I learn from my mistakes.<br><br>One error I made recently was picking up a clutch of chickens at the Seymour Alternative Farming Expo (I thoroughly recommended this Expo for people Down Under). Most of the chickens I purchased there have been a great addition.<br><br>However, one of the chickens turned out to be a rooster. This was a real conundrum for me because being mostly vegetarian, I don't like killing other animals. So, the rooster got a reprieve and I watched to see how he went with the girls.<br><br>To add insult to injury though, he was a silky rooster and as such was a bit smaller than most of the girls who could easily fend off his amorous advances which left a very small pool of ladies for him to mate with.<br><br>The problem is roosters can mate up to 50 times per day and he was slowly killing some of my smaller silky chickens. So, a decision was made to put an end to it.<br><br>So this morning, I got up with his crowing well before dawn, grabbed him from the hen house and separated his head from his body with a ghurka knife. A very unpleasant hands on task to be sure, but the question came down to: Do you keep a rooster which will certainly kill several smaller silky chickens which produce eggs during Autumn when no other chicken does?; or Do you let him kill the egg producing silky chickens?<br><br>Such is life on a farm. Also, it has been my past experience that this would be a short term pain for a long term gain. Without this experience you could easily make bigger mistakes and that experience is very hard won. This is a good analogy for this weeks essay too as it is very hard to work out when to get off the carousel as most people don’t and will hang on until it is too late.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c6312504540934833392 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 1:57 AM</a><br><br>

We went through the arduous process of renegotiating the mortgage to a much more affordable rate (essentially half), but it means 40 years and if we ever sell, we'll owe the $70,000 that was "excused" off the interest payments. She and I met in town a few years ago, and I recently sold my house, which I bought when the market was lower and then fixed up.

Being a long-serving and hence cynical government worker, I saw the writing on the wall in my organisation well ahead of time (2003) and planned accordingly. I worked hard at clearing all debt - especially the mortgage. Planning my 'collapse' - exit on optimum terms - took five years and a lot of luck. Gaining Peak Oil awareness in the middle of that period just confirmed my views.<br> <br>When the compulsory relocations came, I was in a position to accept a redundancy settlement instead, while others, previously or even still cheery optimists, were stuck at the wage slave stage, unable to leave, and obliged to do their employer’s bidding, often at a very severe personal cost. Exit on an acceptable basis has since become a fast receding horizon for those remaining employees, as their employment, redundancy and pension terms are being rapidly diluted, ultimately to something approaching Dickensian levels if the Government gets their way. <br><br>Meanwhile, the organisation itself lurches from one crisis to the next – very much in a stair-step fashion, but already a shadow of its former self. <br><br>Employment is but one dependence - as Stoneleigh rightly advises, gain control over the essentials of your existence – at the very least, that means a modest stockpile of meds, food and other day to day stuff. Doing just that will put you in a better position than most in a short term crisis - more likely than zombie apocalypse, and it doesn’t cost that much in terms of cash or space to do. <br><br>It's simple really. Ask yourself what's likely in your community in ten years, and plan for that, in detail and big picture - rather than hoping for the best. If anything, I wasn't pessimistic enough. <br><br>Finally, John Wheeler might like to note that the UK HM Customs and Excise dept have been shedding tax collecting staff by the thousands.

This is true at all times, but even sharper in descent. All armies, in all eras, are regularly deployed against their own populations. In descent, this will become the dominant role of the military. Few join the service in order to occupy their own country, but many will end up doing so. In intelligence work this is especially troubling... all paths lead to the STASI, and none emerge from that dungeon with their soul intact.<br><br>As a Canadian, there are a lot of additional twists the future might bring: heroic death in futile defence of the tar sands, wasted death as colonial auxillaries in an equally futile US war, moral death in service to a Quisling regime of some sort. What all these have in common is not the 'death' part, but the lack of choice over your own fate.<br><br>In discussing these scenarios with serving soldiers in the past, I have heard "If that happens I can always desert and go underground". Possibly. But in that case why not take a riff on JMGs advice: "Leave now, and beat the rush".<br><br>JMG, I expect this post will be diturbing to some, as there is powerful thaumaturgy in play around the sanctity of military service. Still I think every serving soldier in every army needs to have this inner dialogue, make their choices while they have them, and cast their die with clarity and intention.<br><br>Whatever Castus's choices, I wish him, and all those whose lives he will touch, the best.<br><br><a href=#c2233573246830161281 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 6:07 AM</a><br><br>

With total student loan debt in the U.S. exceeding $1 trillion, it seems obvious that the vast majority of that $1 trillion will not be repaid. So, for those of us with large amounts of student loan debt, who are also looking for a way to “collapse now,” does that translate as “default now?” Should those of us who see mass defaults on the way just get ahead of the curve?<br><br><a href=#c5116285897171567039 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 6:12 AM</a><br><br>

I’m probably crumbling gently, rather than completely collapsing, although if I look back on changes we’ve made in the last few years it’s pretty amazing. But we still haven’t grasped the nettle of complete collapse. We’re running well ahead of the decline, and doing things that reality isn’t yet mandating, but we haven’t catapulted our lifestyle 20 years into a resource depleted future. We’re sort of surfing the wave down, perhaps.<br><br>I’ve found it useful to have a couple of timeframes in mind: the big picture of resource depletion over the next few decades; and the details of how it will all play out year by year. The arc of the bigger picture is easier to see than the details, and it is helping me to plan for the longer-term while staying sane. Since I’m 50, the bigger picture is about how to advise and guide my teenage kids, what skills to invest in now, how re-think about “money” and “wealth” and how to position for our advanced years – where to live and what to do, given that a condo in Florida, funded by government and interest on savings, is not a super good target for 2030!<br><br>The details are much more tricky, of course. We’ve decided to stay put in our little Connecticut town, and do the urban homestead thing for now I love it. It has all of its own rewards. But it’s a little weird to be tinkering with my root cellar and researching herbal medicine, while the talk of the town is how many millions of bond dollars to spend on a new High School. And then there are the inevitable series of neck-whipping news events that trumpet how everything is fixed forever: the shale gas thing or Europeans lending themselves a fortune or whatever. So I guess you have to keep your eye on the big picture, take action, and don’t worry about the details. On that note I found this quote from Ray Bradbury, who died this week: “I don’t believe in optimism. I believe in optimal behavior...Action is hope. At the end of each day, when you’ve done your work, you lie there and think, Well, I’ll be damned, I did this today. It doesn’t matter how good it is, or how bad—you did it. At the end of the week you’ll have a certain amount of accumulation. At the end of a year, you look back and say, I’ll be damned, it’s been a good year.”<br><br><a href=#c2942463665116843889 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 6:14 AM</a><br><br>

That, and a recent encounter with a couple of acquaintances at a wake who asked me about my job situation. I mentioned not having a "Job" but picking up informal work cleaning houses and sous-cheffing for a friend who is a caterer, as well as making a little money selling handmade jewelry. Remember the cool kids in high school? That's the look the two women exchanged: "No fancy house, no SUV, no Alex &amp; Ani bracelets [they are very fashionable around here just now], she is cleaning houses and chopping vegetables, her hair is crazy long and my God, she doesn't even get professional manicures!" It was startling at the time to see how pathetic they think I am. Good thing I didn't tell them that the few new pieces of clothing I need this summer are being made with my own two hands. :)<br><br>It's been so easy to panic and think I need to move someplace and overhaul my life all at once. But reading your essay -- especially the part about staying with the folks you know -- reminded me that I am aready part of a network of people who don't throw anything away if it can be made use of by someone else (that's how I got a vintage all-metal sewing machine for free). I'm realizing that I may only be taking baby steps, but I'm on my way. I'm already living a life that a lot people around me would think of as a nightmare, even though I have a cushy lifestyle compared to most of the world's population.

So many things to consider:<br><br>Transportation may be the most solvable; walking, biking, shared transportation if available...<br><br>Reliance upon centralized services is less solvable. All of your collapse preps will be moot if your neighbors' sewers are backing up into your home. Potable water? Waste/garbage disposal? If been to urban areas worldwide where basic services have failed or aren't available. NOT for me, thanks! More population density means more competition for the basics, more wear on infrastructure.<br><br>Small things can be problematic: Wall-to-wall carpeting without a vacuum cleaner? Too few screened windows in summer? Too many stairs when one lives on the 5th floor and gets injured or old? Ever try to carry several gallons of water up five flights, or up the hill from the water truck?<br><br>How will your neighbors, most who certainly haven't practiced a voluntary collapse, be reacting? Police services?<br><br>Having been in the voluntary pre-collapse mode for many years now, I can say that it's the things one hasn't considered that sneak up and bite you. Assessment prior to commitment is essential. "Collapse now" isn't so simple. Just because one has collapsed ahead of the curve doesn't mean those around you have. It also may mean unknowingly continuing to rely on basic services that will likely be failing over time. If one is already providing these services (all of them) for one's self, one is more free to deal with the inevitable challenges to come, and to help others to provide net positive benefit to the community.<br><br>JMG: I share a sense of urgency (Orlov's post this week seems also to notch up the urgency factor), and it may well be a case of <i>"storm's coming; too late to evacuate"</i>, but if one currently 'lives below sea level' one should certainly abandon any hope of collapsing successfully in place. It's a hard choice, I know., <br><br>I also have some doubt that the decline is likely to be catabolic and slow. Again, this collapse is global, affecting an unprecedented population with unprecedented reliance upon declining resources and complex systems. This time is different in many ways, including shear scale. Humanity has entered uncharted waters.<br><br>Appologies for adding a little yin to your yang ;-)<br><br><a href=#c8486083045621958877 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 7:29 AM</a><br><br>

Across a wide range of geographical scales and technological levels, civilizations take an average of one to three centuries to complete the process of decline and fall, and there is no valid reason to assume that ours will be any exception." <br><br>First of all, I do tire of this doomer apocalypse fantasy stuff. It is a daydream and a distraction.<br><br>Anyways, I believe that there is a valid reason to assume that our civilization's decline and fall will be a bit quicker than that of previous civilizations. That reason is the same reason that enabled our civilization to reach its zenith in the first place, fossil fuels. <br><br>As you correctly point out, past civilizations took an average of one to three centuries to complete the process of collapse regardless of geographical scale or technological know how. However, none of these past civilizations had any where near the amount of energy to work with as our civilization had. <br><br>Previous civilizations using their technical know how to maximize the animal and human energy (wind and water for later ones) available to them took centuries to a millennium or more to reach their geographic, economic and political maximums. And as you point out, one to three centuries to decline and fall.<br><br>Thanks to the energy content of fossil fuels, our civilization has reached its maximums in only a couple of centuries. As a result, I think that our civilization's decline and fall will happen on a shorter time frame. I would put that time frame at two decades to a century. Of course, I'm not saying that there's no way that we can't drag it out (kicking and screaming) for 300 years of slow, agonizing decline. I just think, based on the x factor of fossil fuels that our civilization used for break neck expansion, that will lead to a similarly break neck contraction. <br><br>That's my two cents, anyways...<br><br>Thanks for getting my brain working in new ways. I just finished your book, The Wealth of Nature and found your insights and observations to be very valuable. <br><br>Lastly, thanks for mentioning the Bussard fusion reactor. I had never heard of it before. It was a fun (but dense) Wikipedia read.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>AJM<br><br><a href=#c1952261217676343680 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 7:57 AM</a><br><br>

In my own case, as I've worked to set up an agricultural system, I'm constantly reminded that true self-sufficiency is almost impossible in any technological context, no matter how primitive.<br><br>Beyond hunter-gatherer cultures, there always needs to be a reliable economic infrastructure of suppliers and fabricators to keep a society functional at any particular level.

We are all in this together. The cultural and biophysical interdependencies are far too great to permit any one person, country or region to stand on its own, unscathed, as its neighbours fail.<br><br>Second, there is no way to prevent the now-visible denouement – not one I’ve been able to discover at any rate. As you note, the various suggestions are all variations of impotent talk. If a “solution” to the Predicament were possible (a ludicrous idea in itself) it would require a global level of central direction, since the problems making up the Predicament are all global in scope. Last time I looked there were 7 billion of us on this planet, each of us with a different idea of What Should Be Done. In comparison with the task of organizing that mob for collective, directed action, the difficulty of herding cats pales into triviality.<br><br>The third factor flows out of the second. The future is inherently unknowable, because it depends on the dynamic interplay of the various actions of all 7 billion people, both as individuals and at various levels of collectivity.<br><br>So it looks to me as though the only real option available to any of us is to simply do whatever we think is best. We have no way of knowing whether it will be the “right thing” or not.<br><br>Because of this your two-part “alternative strategy” (enjoy life, then die) is in fact the one that we will all follow, like it or not. There is no real “choice” available, because that process essentially describes what we’ve been doing for the last umpty-thousand/million years. The idea that we have ever had a choice, beyond choosing how to “enjoy” our situation, is a conceit.<br><br>The choice I’ve made is to become as aware as possible of what’s going on around me, and to respond to those events as wisely as I can manage. In the process I try to encourage others to transcend their own emotional/egoic reactivity, to think deeply, and to become as wise as they too can manage as a result. The more of us who can make wise decisions (regardless of what those decisions actually are) the better the unknowable future may be, at least in some tiny measure. At the same time, applying wisdom instead of immature knee-jerking to one’s life makes it more satisfying and productive, and reduces the amount of inner stress we feel while doing our best and waiting for the inevitable visit from the Reaper.<br><br><a href=#c1658953555676135543 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 8:55 AM</a><br><br>

That is a wonderful slogan that really cuts to the heart of the matter. I'll have to meditate on how to apply it to my own life--return to my parents paid-off suburban home, I suppose, but I'm not willing to do that, just yet. No job = no rent money = no apartment. I think that might be part of the appeal of a fast crash to many young people: renters can become squatters the minute the system fails. <br><br>I am one of the little dutch boys trying to stick a technological finger into the energy dike, but... I'm beginning to think that it is too late for silver bullets, at this stage of the game. Say one of the alt-fusion companies, Bussard's heirs or otherwise, stands up tomorrow and says "Okay, we've got it. Our reactor works and we're ready to commercialize." Or Elon Musk stands up and says "Alright, I'm building a robot asteroid base that'll start cranking out power satellites next week."<br>... does that solve our problems? <br>No.<br>We have to build the reactors or rectenna farms. A lot of them. A whole lot of them. That takes energy, resources, capital and vision. All of which are in short supply at this stage of the long descent. <br>...does that solve our problems?<br>No.<br>Even with an ample supply of electrons, we still have to build an infrastructure to use it. Build infrastructure? We cannot maintain what we have. <br>A silver bullet is of limited use when the werewolf is already at your throat. <br>I suspect that we are doomed to suffer the next round of economic and social collapse no matter what technological wizardry we can come up with. That said, thorium or fusion or space resources developed now could be of immense aide in the rebuilding phase that follows.<br><br><a href=#c1194228132169020541 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 9:49 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not trying to single out JMG's blog in particular, especially considering JMG has always been up-front about the slow pace of change and taking the long historical view. Still, on this blog and moreso in other sources I've read over the past 5+ years, there have always been tidbits that proclaim "The end is coming faster than anyone thinks!" And the human mind latches on to drama such as that. So I think a lot of people who understand and agree with you (including, to some degree, me) get nonplussed when we start talking about the current techno civilization persisting in some zombie form for a century into the future. A lot of us ADHD Americans tend to lose patience!<br><br>I have always seen logic in the argument that we're not going to go to bed all Mary Poppins one Wednesday night and wake up in The Road Warrior on Thursday morning. These changes take time. My 2-cents worth... (at the risk of offending foreign readers, I mean no disrespect!)... I've thought for awhile now that the United States will experience at least a couple decades of what I refer to as "Australia", when resources are in short supply, but we still have the tech, we still live in cities and can still find jobs, but we're dealing with natural disasters and a harsh environment, and the dollar just doesn't buy what we think it should buy... <br>...then we would go through "a couple of decades of Mexico", when things are really falling apart, there are major shortages and societal failures and some degree of tribalism, but people can still point to something called the "United States" and be patriotic about it if they choose... (and I write this as somebody who recently spent 3 years living in Mexico; trust me, Mexico is not a bad place to live!)<br>...those two epochs would have to play out completely before we hit "decades of Calcutta". <br>Given the dizzying speed of technology, the Fall could proceed faster than I predict. But I think that it will happen slowly enough that a lot of people whom today we think of as unproductive economic slaves, will have time to get off their butts, adapt and get with the program. There may not be any massive die-off or exodus from cities, certainly not a quick one. You &amp; I might well die peacefully of natural causes and old age before we really see anything we could call "collapse". <br><br>The Great Changeover ends up being very much a mental game instead of an economic or physical one at this point. It just doesn't make any sense to give up certain of our advantages -- a high paying job, for example -- insofar as, and no farther than, we can _use_ them to prepare (instead of the advantages/jobs/comforts "using" us instead). In the end, we have to realize that we are fish that swim in the water of a culture, and few of us can simply jump out and expect to survive. Even as we observe the pond drying up (while others deny it), still the best many of us can do is live a bit more in the shallows, get used to warmer water and the occasional gulp of air. We won't be evolving legs overnight.<br><br>As a completely different analogy, it disturbs me a little that my Peak Oil preparations tend to remind me of that old Zen parable where a student sees a Zen master hauling a load of firewood. The student asks, "Master what is it like to be Enlightented?" The master puts down his heavy burden and sighs with relief. "But what does one do after attaining enlightenment?" the student asks. The master cheerfully takes up his burden again and continues walking. <br>It's often a mental game and the big victory is to understand _WHY_ you're doing what you're doing, instead of just doing it because that's what everyone expects of you.<br><br><a href=#c6587488239569489177 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 10:18 AM</a><br><br>

Especially to be introduced to "catabolic collapse". Thinking about this, I wonder does one's preferred form of collapse say something about one's worldview and values? A person who's prepared to some extent might feel enthusiastic about sudden collapse, if s/he weren't taking the larger view. At least with a long decline, we all have a chance to see the writing on the wall. But, by the end of it, our infrastructure is all gone; at least with a sudden collapse, we'd still have the chance of re-building or re-purposing critical infrastructures.<br><br>Speaking of which, it's not spoken of enough that, as you point out, many people will never survive the fall of industrialism as things currently stand, due to dependence on life-saving medicines. I touched on this on my own blog, with <a href="http://www.indiebiotech.com/?p=135" rel=nofollow>a post on DIY insulin/thyroxine biosynthesis</a>.<br><br>While it won't "replace oil", the potential for synthetic biology to cushion the peak oil crash is considerable, provided it's in the hands of the people who need it. If or when my family someday need insulin, and I have a strain of thistle that produces it, perhaps we can survive on that. When I'm lamenting the loss of coffee imports, perhaps I can get by on genetically-modified caffeinated dandelion root. :)<br><br>It's earned a bad reputation over the last few decades for commercial exploitation, but I think the next real wave of genetic technology will be "peer to peer", a sort of genetic barter economy. And, I think it's going to make life a lot more bearable when "grow your own" becomes the agricultural norm once again.<br><br><a href=#c6595518355540140363 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 12:05 PM</a><br><br>

I'm going to have to link to this for my voluntary poverty series, because you summarized the situation much more concisely than I have in the introduction to those posts. Thank you for this.<br><br>I've been farming since 2009 in some capacity or another. The last three seasons have been internships on organic veggie farms and now I'm working as a farm hand for two farms that produce pasture-raised meat, learning the animal side of things. I had the good fortune of being able to make the choice to walk away from my life to start interning at farms and learning how to grow and raise food. No family dependent on me, no major obligations, still young and fit--and it's proved to be the best choice I've made in my life.<br><br>Now I'm gardening in between my farm hand jobs, paying off my credit card debt, and working on scaling back. I worry about my student debt a bit--I'm in the income-based repayment option and plan to be there for the foreseeable future--but hopefully that won't come back to haunt me. If it does, I'll just have to deal with it.<br><br>I've been thinking a lot lately about how important attitude is to facing the long descent. I see so many people raging against their perceived political enemies. All the troubles that we have seem inevitably to be the evil doing of some bad actor or another, and defeating that person and their ideology is the way to fix things. I've been there, and not that long ago. But I've given up that attitude and one of the best things I think I've managed to do in the last year or so is come to the conclusion that it's about my own personal work, not the machinations of others.<br><br>I've talked to so many people who have so much emotion and worry and anger and fear wrapped up in the election or reelection of that person or the other. And I see these reactions, remember when I felt the same way, and think about how incredibly disempowering that always was for me. The idea that the quality of your life is dependent on the whim of some odd millions of voters is a horrible thought. Now, I think the quality of my life is dependent on the work I do and community I integrate into, first and foremost, with a good bit of luck and happenstance playing most the rest of the role. I can better control that. I can choose to do or not do the work that needs to be done, and then recognize that beyond that I just have to roll with what happens.<br><br>I have to say, that lifts a huge burden. Accepting the idea of collapse is very liberating in that you no longer have to strive so hard to try to hold onto what is destined to go away. You just watch as it slips from view and then reconfigure how you live your life, rather than raging against whatever enemy you've decided has taken the good life from you.<br><br>Even as a farm hand, I realize that a collapsing economy could take away that source of work, or the way I get paid for that work. But then I'll just make the adjustments, and hopefully I'll figure something out. I'm always happy with barter and work-trade. All I really want is good food, good company, good beer, and a place to sleep. I think I'm in a decent position to maintain much of that.<br><br>But if not, then so be it. I'll just have to deal with that when it comes, make adjustments, and do my best. It's more or less how every other species lives on this planet, why shouldn't it be the same for me?<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=#c2405092653624006427 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 12:10 PM</a><br><br>

IMO default should be the last option. There are forbearance arrangements available immediately after graduation and for certain periods of unemployment. Then there are low income arrangements, some of which involve loan cancellation after a given period or under certain conditions. All of these options will protect your income from garnishment and your credit from damage. There is a NOLO Press book on managing student debt and the government web sites provide detailed information. The mistake I see some people make is just ignoring the loans--they will not go away and, as some have learned in the recent depression, unpaid debts may damage employment prospects as well.<br><br><a href=#c4043411586700776255 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 12:25 PM</a><br><br>

"Get out of debt" together with "collapse now" forms a nice paradox. I have no mortgage, only student loans (which in Sweden are entirely handled by the government), and I've been paying them down as fast as possible, but I'll have them for years more.

GHung and Allie, I agree. Prior civilizations took many hundreds of years to reach their peaks, before the one to few hundred to collapse. While I don't expect an overnight collapse, I think even within 10 years life will be very different for us all. Collapse now; beat the rush indeed.<br><br>We are at resource limits everything, and climate change is going to really strain the system. I've read that the very large, fresh water aquifer under the middle of the country is extremely depleted (80-90%?). I know we've killed off much of the edible fish in the Atlantic (90%). We change to eating new species, but we will also deplete them quickly. Desalinization and warm water is impacting them significantly already, as well, as noted in a recent article written by a local marine research organization.<br><br>Desertification is underway; not only will peak oil impact food production, lack of water where we need it will. A dust bowl for the new millenium here in the US; already in Africa. Much of Asia depends on the Himalayas for their water source, yet they are going to run down.<br><br>Back to the US, I recently got a mailer on the latest big energy "investment" opportunity. Not sure how I got on the list, but this one I took home instead of dumping in the trash. Inside was one useful bit of information -- states with new drilling licenses (most for fracking). Only the Pacific Northwest, New England and a few states in the middle will be spared.<br><br>Meantime, I'm working on collapsing in place even while seeking to move to a place less hostile and with more like-minded people, as well as more land and a smaller, more manageable house.<br><br>Maria, I hear you.

As just one very simple example, last year a student from Iran in our Principles of Sustainability unit (running as an elective in a Master of Civil Engineering course) was about to ingratiate himself with his host culture by taking our lead and buying a car. A couple of weeks into the semester, he’d freed himself of the burden that he knew this would place on him (working longer to pay for the car, its operation and upkeep, hence having less time for his studies…etc), and decided to “just” keep riding his bicycle for transport. Why the sudden change of heart? Because according to him we’d helped make legitimate a path that he could see made more sense anyway (the idea that “all those locals doing otherwise must know something I don’t” was pretty powerful).<br><br>I’m finding increasingly though that even amongst very thoughtful friends and colleagues, couching this specifically in the language of collapse often becomes a block to shared understanding—the term “collapse” seems to be bound up with the notion of “sudden cataclysm” (even amongst those aware of Tainter’s work, few seem to have appreciated his efforts at precise definition of what <em>he</em> means by this—and that it’s quite different to common understandings). I make frequent use of the language of collapse myself, but I’m beginning to wonder if another avenue might be available within William Gibson’s famous observation that “the future is already here—it just isn’t very evenly distributed.” I.e. if we look beyond our immediately familiar surrounds, we can see what “collapse” looks like—it might share quite a bit in common with present ways of living in societies around the world that haven’t yet risen to the levels of complexity characteristic of rich world societies. It’s also noteworthy that many of us in the rich world <em>have</em> already experienced life like this—living or travelling in countries less affluent than our own. I spent a little time looking at aspects of this from a “50,000 foot view” a couple of weeks back here: http://beyondthisbriefanomaly.org/2012/05/17/the-distribution-of-energy-wealth/.<br><br>Incidentally, the writing I’m doing there might in a sense be regarded as a companion to some of your work here, for anyone interested in diving a little deeper into the energetics (and into the epistemology behind the energetics). For example, a few weeks back I had a look at where Stuart Staniford went astray in his critique of your discussion on thermodynamics a couple of years ago (details here http://beyondthisbriefanomaly.org/2012/04/19/accounting-for-a-most-dynamic-universe-part-2/#Note-1).<br><br>With best wishes,<br>Josh Floyd<br><br><a href=#c5212290034255701546 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 5:29 PM</a><br><br>

But I can go and find a vast amount of documentation or video and commentary that says there is "no" urgency needed to fear a peak oil decline in any stretch of the near future. <br><br>And I can also find the opposite perspective as well ;)<br><br>Many feel and state with seemingly accurate and factual studies and data that suggest/indicate that we have a great supply of oil, oil shale, coal and natural gas; not only in North America but untapped regions around the globe. Which would or will supply our need for hundreds if not a thousand plus years. <br><br>So I'm wondering what your basis of your view on peak fossil fuel is made determined upon. Is there a particular scientist or writer that has lead you to this opinion and conclusion?<br><br>Many seen to think that the supposed shortage is nothing but political and corporate maneuvering to encourage price manipulation. <br><br>So the downward spiral of post-industrial civilization might be stretch out by as little as 100 yrs or as great as 1000, which really changes the needs and preparation and mindset and expectation one would have over such an event.<br><br>I would be very interested in any sources you could share that lead you to believe one way over the other.<br><br>Thank you very much!<br><br>Best Regards<br><br><a href=#c7037715320118391453 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 6:11 PM</a><br><br>

My friend and Transition cohort, John Bell, had the luck and pleasure of joining you for breakfast at the conference. He started the Transition initiative I have pretty much dedicated most of my unemployed time to. <br>What you describe above is exactly what I've been seeing, what I've also read in the history books (I was supposed to be a social studies teacher, if only the economy had cooperated when I received my pricey Masters), and exactly how I feel but didn't have the poetry to put it into words like you did. <br><br>Ever since I did the math, and I stink at math, twenty years ago, I knew this fossil fuel based system was unsustainable. Psychologically I began what you describe as "collapsing". No one can collapse until they're emotionally and psychologically ready to face the truth. Like an alcoholic, true healing can't begin until one admits their alcoholism and begins to visualize a world without alcohol. <br>Although I disagree with the fossil fuel addiction paradigm, I see it more as an out of control, over active hoarding instinct. We often let our instincts get the best of us. Like eating sweets... <br><br>I think the biggest problem is facing the future with open eyes and open mind, and not worrying what the neighbors think about you when you go out to mow the lawn with a scythe, and reel mower, or when you spend most of your waking hours nursing new perennials (more resilient that annuals), watering them each lovingly... For hours... <br>And replacing parts of your lawn with wheat varieties, you know, to see which grow best in in my region... <br>I don't worry about what most neighbors say, since many of them are asking ME how grow food, and sharing their gardening successes and failures with me. These are exciting times and more and more people will discover there is much enjoyment in going back to the old ways of farming, raising food, living, being together... <br>Sharing the bounty of the earth and making new, wonderful friends doing it. <br>Collapse now and join the fun! :) <br><br><br>Pauline<br><br><a href=#c1915563839319535327 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 7:31 PM</a><br><br>

Great summary of the issue at hand. However, I wish to differ on the following point 'Across a wide range of geographical scales and technological levels, civilizations take an average of one to three centuries to complete the process of decline and fall, and there is no valid reason to assume that ours will be any exception.'<br><br>To begin with, we can say that 'Past performance is not necessarily a predictor for future performance'. More concretely, the past examples of decline and fall are for civilizations that have taken comparable time to rise and prosper. For instance, one could argue that Rome took several centuries to decline and fall because it took several centuries to rise and prosper. On the contratry, the petroleum society we have built is hardly 150 years old. More precisely, one could say that it has been peak only after the second world war ie about 70 odd years and hence the decline should be compared to the same timescale ie it would decline within 70 odd years. <br><br>Further more, there is a Seneca law that states that the time to fall (or ruin) is far lesser than the time to rise or prosper. To give a crude (pun intended) example, it is far easier to climb down a mountain than climb up or far easier for a reputation to be ruined than it is to be built, far easier for stock market to fall than to rise. Probably the second law of thermodynamics at work.<br><br>Summarizing, the collapse would at the very least be less than or equal to the time of rise and most likely far faster than the time spent on rise. Therefore the timeline of collapse (back to the conditions of say 19th century) would be decades not centuries.<br><br><a href=#c5067660474436406469 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 7:39 PM</a><br><br>

Even if your own personal survival is questionable after collapse, you can still work to preserve something you love. In my case I am working to cultivate rare varieties and species in my garden. This also goes to xhmko's idea of learning an art form, if it is something you love.

Since my health is pretty good, I feel uncomfortable arguing with the chronically ill, or pointing out that there's still much they can do; good to hear from someone who's in that situation, and sees the possibilities. <br><br>Castus, thank you!<br><br>Leo, do it! Thermoelectric power should be a lot easier to build and maintain at a modest technical level, and I can think of some fairly straightforward ways to do it on a home scale; I'd like to see that getting more attention. <br><br>Harriett, if you've got the same kind of poor soil we had -- and of course you're only about 80 miles away -- you'll be fine; add lots of compost and use deep-dug beds, and you'll be astonished how well it'll produce. <br><br>M, every person's situation is different, and if you're in a situation where staying in the house is a good plan, by all means do so. As for job skills, that's so totally a function of your personal capacities and the needs of the place where you live that I'm in no position to offer advice. <br><br>Mustard, nicely handled -- and yes, "hoping for the best" is usually the worst possible thing you can do. Envision a realistic future, and then round downwards, hard, and you're much more likely to come through in one piece. <br><br>RPC, it's a difference of definition. If there's a military coup here in the US, for example, the vast majority of government will remain in place; it's just the personnel at the top, and the method of selecting them, that change. <br><br>Andy, an excellent point. <br><br>Guamanian, I think you're incorrect in assuming that militaries will be primarily deployed against their own country's civilians in the years to come. More on this later; the short version is that the world is almost certainly between one and two decades away from a period of major wars, and I'd be astonished if Canada managed to stay out. It may not be on the side you expect, either. <br><br>Chris, if you signed on to student debt, you basically can't default without losing the ability to own anything else for the rest of your life, unless the laws change or the US implodes first. When I said "pay off your debts," student debt belongs in that category. Pay 'em down as fast as you can.<br><br>Yupped, most of us are crumbling rather than collapsing, to be fair -- I only know a few people who live the way they'll be living once the US empire is over and petroleum is a luxury product.

The reason I hammer on it is simply that so many people insist that it's the only choice there is. <br><br>Maria, congrats on the sewing machine! I used to get that sort of treatment all the time -- it's less common now that my books are getting some attention, since writers are supposed to be eccentric, but I used to be on the receiving end of the same kind of contemptuous pity; if I'd only get a corporate job, a haircut, a suit, a McMansion, a fashionably brainless wife, etc., etc., I could make something of myself! I found it exquisitely amusing, since their idea of a successful life could not have interested me less if it had been designed for that purpose, and I was having a good time living my way. <br><br>Lei, good question. There's a good chance it'll be a worthwhile career, but make sure you have at least one other option!<br><br>Ghung, of course those are issues, but collapsing in place should normally be the first option to consider; relocation is what you do if there are reasons to think that plan A won't work. Since I relocated, you know, I do understand the reasons why staying where you are might not be a good thing... ;-)<br><br>Allie, the expansion of Western civilization began in earnest around 1500, with the first major European voyages of exploration, and peaked around 1900, when nearly the entire surface of the planet was either ruled directly from a European capital, owned by descendants of European colonists, or subject to European control. Industrialism evolved in two waves on top of that -- a coal-powered wave beginning around 1700, and the final petroleum-fueled spike beginning in 1900. So it was a much longer way up than you've suggested -- right around the same time frame as other civilizations -- and since fossil fuels aren't going away suddenly, but dwindling by a factor of a few per cent per year, I'd argue that it's most reasonable to expect roughly the same time frame on the way down, too.<br><br><a href=#c7409521136147189138 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 8:20 PM</a><br><br>

The claims made for vast amounts of oil, gas, etc. that can be accessed by fracking and the like simply don't add up, and people I know who work in the oil industry laugh at them.

In part it's the technical aspects, but it's also the cultural ones. My son is fluent in Japanese, and recently spent a year there attending college. To say that the traditional culture does not look kindly on leaving the country is a rather severe understatement. Those who leave (at least in our world's version of reality) will be those regarded as the bottom of society, and no resources will be offered to them. To be more explicit, it will be foreigners, descendants of Japanese who have returned from more than a generation abroad and those of mixed race who will be exiled. Some will survive the crossing, but I think the effect will be much less than those who came here during the 20th century.<br><br>Now, if your scenario also involves severe depopulation in the NW first, the surviving Asians might make up a larger proportion than otherwise.

I don't want to see the fast version.<br><br>What I imagine ahead is the slow, inexorable increase in the price of luxury goods (including goods that most of us no longer realise are luxuries but take for granted), the irreversible curtailment of extravagances (some of which I am really, really gonna miss), the gradual disappearance of formalised "work" and its replacement with (a) subsistence activity, (b) petty crime, (c) informal trading networks, barter, etc. <br><br>As JMG says, the slow collapse is already happening. Our recycle centre was vandalised and copper was stolen: that's the petty crime and the salvage economy coinciding :-) Our islanders do a fair amount of business quietly in cash amongst ourselves; that's the informal economy. Heck, we could go on using the durable plastic and metal money provided by the national banking system for years, even if the banking system itself folded up. <br><br>As for subsistence, almost everyone has a veggie garden. My freezer is half filled with rabbits from a farming neighbour. Someone's starting a goat milk co-op. I can buy eggs from at least 3 different chicken keepers.<br><br>Lots of people here are "not really" employed but cobble together a mosaic of odd jobs. Regular employment is starting to seem a bit old-fashioned, nostalgic.<br><br>What worries me about out-of-the-way places like ours is that we rely so much on tourism for an inflow of cash to balance the outflow to chain stores, fossil fuel, and whatnot (drain on our local economy). But tourism, predictably, is contracting -- even as the governments of almost every mid-sized city on our coast are doubling down and investing more heavily in tourist infrastructure!<br><br>The other thing that worries me is the last-minute, desperate looting of resources by the thrashing remains of Big Capital. We haven't any oil, but we do have trees and some fish left even after the last century of liquidationism. I fear that Great Powers will come and take what little remains to us while the gettin's good. I don't see any way to stop 'em if they do. (Welcome to the third world; we are all Nigeria now.) OK, I'm depressed enough for tonight...<br><br><a href=#c5448490000686041503 title="comment permalink">6/7/12, 10:04 PM</a><br><br>

There is, however, the income based repayment program, which limits payments to 15% of your gross income. If you have stafford loans and a low income, they will absolutely slash your payments. Once in the program, you re-apply annually using your prior year's income, to re-set the rate. In 25 years, the unpaid portion is forgiven and you owe income taxes on that. Regardless of your income, your payments will never be higher than they were originally set, although you always have the option of paying more if you are able.<br><br>It may not be the best option, but is certainly one to consider.

In a similar way I read this post fusing what you wrote with the recent visit of a friend who is a Chinese American and a professor who frequently goes to China. He was explaining to me some of the basic tenants of Confucianism and how for the vast majority of Chinese there lies deep in their marrow as a sacred value two driving forces. Delayed gratification and saving. This results in the singular focus on hard work, saving, value of education for your children. Delaying any gratification for the sake of being better prepared for future calamities. <br><br>As I read your post of already living the collapse the words of my chinese friend where echoing through my head. <br><br>It seems no coincidence that the culture in ascendancy in the 21st century that is heading toward decline would be one with these Confucian sacred values. <br><br>And like almost all readers of this post we are all trying to wean ourselves of what our generation was taught....instant gratification and indulgence. <br><br>Our tribe here on this blog discussing this topic are essentially a baby boomer generation coping with the trauma of transitioning from an unsustainable cultural paradigm of self entitlement toward one that requires some elements of the sacred values my chinese friend was explaining to me. <br><br>He also mentioned the tragedy that inspite of these sacred values of delayed gratification and saving the Chinese offer nothing in terms of a model that could offer a paradigm shift.

The Victorians were big fans. They seem to me to start from the principle that only those who can work have value. They're all mixed up with Calvinist beliefs about your material wealth being a marker of your moral worth. Even if they're not inherently exploitative, they're wide open to abuse given the usually powerless nature of the people who end up there and the vested interest that those who run them often have in keeping overheads down and productivity up. That still holds regardless of how responsible and thoughtful the principles they're originally founded on were. <br><br>It becomes easy for those in charge to convince themselves that their inmates poverty is the result of their own laziness, or that they are capable of more work than they are currently doing. It's usually dressed up in fluffy language about the redemptive power of work for people's dignity and self-worth etc. In Ireland during the famine the same ideology led to starving people being forced to build roads to nowhere in exchange for starvation rations of food. It's not so different in nature to prisons who now use their inmates free labour to run profitable businesses, or the unemployed in the UK who are forced to do unpaid work to receive assistance. All that economically dependent slave labour is an asset that somebody will almost invariably exploit. Nowadays it's often privatized, but the Victorian state did it just as effectively.<br><br>Religious orders aren't necessarily able to resist the temptation to exploit either. In Ireland, nuns up to the 1980's ran commercially profitable laundries using the forced labour of unmarried women who'd had children and therefore been locked up. All justified as penance for their sins of course. <br><br>If it's genuinely voluntary that's a different story. But when it comes to vulnerable people, whether it's old age, disabilities, being imprisoned or just being too poor to support yourself, how can such work be said to be truly voluntary? And given that the kind of people who ended up in these kind of places are often quite alone in the world, or even not welcome in society - like prisoners or unmarried mothers or whoever is currently socially undesirable - who's going to be monitoring these kinds of places for abuse or protecting the inmates from it?<br><br><a href=#c8714971836112516393 title="comment permalink">6/8/12, 6:51 AM</a><br><br>

The basic idea of act first to 'avoid the rush' is at the center of a lot of human activity. Many activities depend trying to see the future and act first to establish a favorable position for yourself when that future comes: stock trading, scientific research, business competition and many more fields work this way. The problem of course is that it is very hard to see the future. I think that you are right that the transition ahead will take centuries, but I expect a different future. I expect that given 100 years to develop, energy conservation, renewable energy sources, and scientific knowledge can sustain a lot more industrialization than you expect.

I would like to single out a few points for which particular gratitude is due: <br><br>* Some weeks ago, JMG shed a bleak and strong light on what we out here in Canada still think of, fondly, as the British "Empah". When JMG remarked that Britain reduced the wealthy society that once was India into poverty, I thought with a shock not only of the economic and cultural power that must have been behind the pre-British Taj Majal, but also of a (medieval?)pre-British Indian observatory that operated, incredibly, at a level of technical excellence not seen in Europe until Tycho Brahe. <br><br>* JMG pointed out this spring that religion provides a seductive refuge from spirituality. His warning resonated, since I note in myself a tendency to substitute the glittering externals of Catholicism for the harder work of inner redirection.<br><br>* One of JMG's commentators last week pointed out last week a Web site that I have found helpful in the task of inner redirection, <br>http://www.innermosthouse.com/. Here we encounter, indeed are confronted with, an example of authentic off-grid living at least as deep as Thoreau's Walden. I was particularly struck by the innermosthouse.com advice on libraries -that we have to select our books with care, making our library (I paraphrase loosely) an externalization of our soul. And thanks, JMG, for this week writing something about your own library! - Surely many share my thrill at seeing those tall www.innermosthouse.com bookshelves, that wrought-iron candelabrum, that hearth, with all the elegance occupying a scant 144 square feet on Earth's surface?<br><br>* Thanks again, JMG, for months ago having underscored the importance of ham radio. I would like to recall this theme for a moment herewith, urging on ham-radio readers of this blog the importance of stockpiling connectors (RCA plugs and jacks, banana plugs and jacks, big 7-pin DIN, miniaturized DIN, spade lugs, PL259for coax, BNC for coax, ... ). Last night, I had to help a sort of survivalist in a radio matter, working with a engineer friend, and we were relieved to find that my not-yet-adequate stocks did include 3.5 mm stereo plugs with accessible solder points (as opposed to 3.5 mm stereo plugs with solder embedded at the factory, entombed in a moulded cylinder of solid plastic). As our decline proceeds, many a worker, notably in ham radio, will be dreading the moment he has to say, "For want of a nail, the kingdom was lost." <br><br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>VA3KMZ<br>www dot metascientia dot com<br><br><a href=#c7012568826796219401 title="comment permalink">6/8/12, 11:39 AM</a><br><br>

I think most of the ones you listed can be argued over, to different degrees. The science of ecology is a good one, though, and fits into my slot of "useful knowledge" - the challenge is to retain that knowledge, which perhaps could be done by passing down wisdom through the generations. Intensive organic agriculture is really just realising that nature's way is the best way though we do try to tweak it to human advantage with things like biointensive and permaculture. Basic sanitation? I'm not totally sure what you're thinking of here but if it's related to sewerage then I think the way forward is not what we've done in the (recent) past but composting toilets and use of greywater. On democratic political systems, I know your position on this but I'm not sure it has worked too well on a long term civilisational scale - perhaps true democracy can only work at the local level (really local).<br><br>Music and literature, I'd agree with but the manner in which they have been published has also been used to "publish" a lot of dross, propaganda and consumerist ideas. However, we told each other stories and entertained each other before civilisation took hold and may have to do so again as pages disintegrate and the last CD player grinds to a halt - a lot will be lost due to the manner in which it was made available. And remember that what you may think of as a masterpiece, another person may think of as not worthy of attention.<br><br><a href=#c766651389679403603 title="comment permalink">6/8/12, 4:07 PM</a><br><br>

For low-voltage (e.g. solar panel, motor/alternator, wind, etc.) systems, there's a new form of electrical connector which has already been adopted as a standard by the ham-radio community. It's called the "Powerpole", and you can see it at powerwerx.com. Compared to the usual coaxial connectors used on consumer electronics, Powerpoles have no male/female distinction, carry a lot more current, snap-lock into place, and have no exposed metal parts. They are keyed to make sure that you can mate them in the dark without getting + and - reversed, too. I've built a voltage adapter for my ham-radio walkie-talkies, and converted my long-range shortwave transmitter to use them, too, whether at home or in the field. The choice of an electrical connector might seem trivial in the grand scheme of crumbling civilization, but these things promise interoperability between low-voltage power sources and equipment, and that could turn out to be important.<br><br><a href=#c9040681063629939356 title="comment permalink">6/8/12, 4:10 PM</a><br><br>

Problem is, and this is an epidemic of incredible proportions (seriously underestimated) most people who never leave the city, never take the mind set to adapt to the future collapse you're talking about - even if they want to.<br><br>My husband and I were raised suburban and transplanted to semi-rural (five acres). We had the kinds of delusions you mentioned don't work at fixing the problem, considering we had a lot of learning to do on the run while paying a mortgage. A shoe in both worlds so to speak. We often hit the wall of this isn't working.<br><br>Yet the absolute message which struck home to us both abut moving to the country, is how incapable city-folk are. To give you an example, we've been killing our excess chickens for food. It's not something we do all the time, but nonetheless a big transition to make. My husband thought to ask online how to kill a chicken properly, as he wants to do it better. The only 2 responses he got was from an environmentalist, who told him to contact the local animal welfare group, to use the most humane method.<br><br>The only other reply said, "why kill a chicken when you can just buy KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) instead?" My husband asked for a practical solution, and got an ideology on killing and straight denialism. This is the kind of city-minded dualism which cannot be undone by the latest tragedy to hit civilisation.<br><br>So I would counter your don't move to the country, with, if you don't move to the country you'll be stuck in the kind of mindset which cannot change beyond ideology and denialism. When you move to the wide open spaces, there's nowhere else to run, no-one to save you as help is further away. It changes the way you think, so you feel the real consequences of idealism and denialism. Both don't get you very far in the country.<br><br>It's not always about rich folk buying into land (I'm sure they still do that) but rather, it's a real practical application no matter who moves to a rural landscape, that you get hit with the reality - "this isn't working!" <br><br>I'm probably in a better position where I am now, than where I was in suburbia. Here I see the *reality* of ideology and denialism failing dismally at providing solutions. In the city, you just buy a bicycle instead of a car, you walk your kids to school instead of driving them - put solar panels on your roof and call it the best you can do. Meanwhile, you're still buying your food (even if it's organic) you've still got electronic gadgets (even if you bought them second-hand) and the cycle of ideological denialism just keeps going.<br><br>No-one is any closer to appreciating that *extraction* of any kind of resources, has limits when it comes by your own hands. In the country, it's that much harder to fool yourself that limitation is just a matter of choice. You can walk in cashed to the hilt, and end up very broke! You can also walk in very broke and stay that way. It's the reality of what happens when you align your life to the land. Natural limitations apply.<br><br>I so get the change where you are perspective, like change in the city rather than moving to the country - but having been there myself, people just don't possess the perspective to grasp how natural limitations apply. You need to experience it to know it, otherwise it's just more ideology.<br><br>I know you're not against people moving to the country, I'm just saying it's downplayed as a lesson in reality people really need to grasp. "Moving to the country," as a concept, is easy to talk about in relation to adapting to de-industrialisation, but in application, you won't get a more reliable example of a future with little means and expensive resources to extract. That's living in the country for you. ;)<br><br><a href=#c5375484779068879308 title="comment permalink">6/8/12, 5:35 PM</a><br><br>

In the meantime, I plan on continuing to offer people advice based on my own take on the future. <br><br>Ntropee, that's nice rousing rhetoric. In the real world, though, what do you actually propose to do? If you plan on nonviolent protest, I trust you realize that any tyrant worth the name can simply have you rounded up, shot in the back of the head, and dumped in a mass grave; there's your protest. If you plan on violent revolution, please remember that this is a public forum and no doubt it's watched by the people whose job it is to watch such things. (A piece of advice from an earlier era: only fools and agents provocateurs go around in public advocating violence.) In either case, since you've already admitted that the central theme of this blog -- making personal changes in response to the end of the industrial age -- is necessary, and most people haven't even gotten that far, let's concentrate on that, and you can pursue the other half of your agenda on some friendly Marxist blog somewhere.<br><br>Michael, excellent, and of course you're quite right. Community is one of the things we can collapse into. <br><br>Brother K., that seems plausible enough; still, the collapse of the mainstream churches wasn't limited to the South by any means. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, true enough. As it is, a lot of our population contraction will likely take place by ordinary demographic processes, just as the expansion did. <br><br>Tom, you can expect to hear something here on ham radio every few months; maintaining some way to communicate across continental distances seems, at least to me, like a very important legacy to leave to the future. As for connectors, though, I think we're ultimately headed back to binding posts and Fahnestock clips -- not to mention a future of low-tech QRP rigs using old-fashioned operator skill to chat with other continents on a couple of watts. <br><br>Tony, anything can be argued over. You asked my opinion, and I gave it; if you disagree, by all means disagree. <br><br>Chuck, thanks for the heads up! It's the little things that matter most in ages of decline. <br><br>Chris, I'd point out that "the city" is not a single place with a single attitude, any more than "the country" is. I live in a small city of 24,000 people in a relatively impoverished rural region; am I in the city, the country, or someplace else? (Your husband would have no trouble getting helpful advice here, btw; this is the kind of town where a woodchuck showing up in your garden isn't a problem, it's an opportunity.) You had the chance to move to the country; good.

You are very wise indeed. I made a similar choice and it is one that I am very grateful for and happy to have made.<br><br>On another note about collapse, I've noticed that language and communication skills have taken a bit of a beating recently. It is only my opinion, but exchanging and employing ideas is kind of central to adapting to any down turn or collapse scenario.<br><br>I've been wondering a bit about this issue recently because there has been a paradigm shift in communications here. Voicemail messages are now being treated as missed calls. I have observed this often enough recently to know that it is not personal. I can only put the change in communications down to the penetration of smart phones in the community (50% in Australia).<br><br>In addition to this I'm observing a shift from email to SMS (mobile phone) messaging. The quality / clarity of the message has also been reduced due to this method being inappropriate to communicate complex or difficult ideas and also the attention that is given by the receiver when these messages are received.<br><br>Getting back to this weeks essay though, sometimes I wonder whether these sorts of factors are influencing peoples abilities to comprehend complex ideas. This is also perhaps, why they look for simple solutions that can be contained in a sound bite?<br><br>Sounds a bit 1984, doesn't it?

And how sad.<br><br>Last week, when you invited us to "wake up and walk away," my first reaction was that many people just can't walk -- literally. They are, unfortunately, too obese and unfit from sedentary lifestyles. They might be better candidates for your "collapse now" option -- but they'd have to be weaned off the teat of television before they would ever even consider an alternative existence.<br><br>Perhaps a pre-collapse bootcamp is needed to reintroduce people to their feet and the benefits of walking. I walk-- I walk a lot. The benefits of walking are immediate. Within minutes you can feel the tension easing; the fog of confusion begins to dissipate; clarity is within reach.<br><br>When we walk we choose to immerse ourselves in our world, in our communities, and we discover truths and sensory surprises that television and the internet could never deliver.<br> <br>Forget the evening news. Take a walk around the block and you stand a chance to get a good picture of the state of the empire. Open your eyes! Compare your experience with others. Outside your door lies everything the powers that be want to keep from you -- the real "reality show" that might just snap you out of your trance.<br><br>I live in a rural community in southern New England. A few weeks ago, during one of my walks, I had an encounter with roadkill that continues to haunt me. Obviously roadkill is a common site around here. Usually it's a bloody mutilation of fur or feathers -- heinous and disturbing.  Usually I'll just wrinkle my nose and try to avoid looking at it.<br> <br>But here at my feet was a dead mid-sized raccoon, fully intact, face down on the shoulder of the road, with the thick white stripe of the road marking painted right across its furry back. I imagine this unfortunate creature was struck by an automobile during the night and managed to drag itself to the edge of the road to die. What disturbed me was the mindlessness of the person operating the road-striping machine the next day who couldn't take a moment to move the creature a few inches into the grass.<br><br>The image of a dead raccoon with the road marking painted across its back could serve as a fitting metaphor for the arrogance of empire. But I'm not interested in metaphor now-- this is reality and reality is where metaphors go to die. <br><br>I believe that right up until the moment it was struck, that beautiful creature was true to its raccoon-ness, living fully in the moment with no death to die. The mindless human operating the road striping machine could live to be a hundred years old and learn to meditate like a zen master, but could never know the richness of existence experienced by that raccoon. This is where the animal world leaves us humans in the dust.<br> <br>Of course I don't believe in the concept of fairness in nature, but when I consider all the life that is erased on just this one road that I walk, and how this is happening on millions of roads across the planet, I can't help but think that there is an accountability somewhere. <br><br>I recall the words that one of my teachers (a Catholic priest) wrote in my high school yearbook. He must have been concerned that I was too young to be so cynical. He wrote "To believe in God you must first believe in people." <br><br>To this day that remains my greatest spiritual challenge. <br><br>But I am certain that one could begin worshipping a God of Absurdity and never be disappointed.<br><br>-Sidd<br><br><a href=#c305881067934215630 title="comment permalink">6/9/12, 5:20 AM</a><br><br>

Here in the US, at least, I'd put it down to the dismal system of pseudo-education we've got -- the US public schools used to be among the best in the world, but at this point they've devolved into a scheme for warehousing children for twelve years while teaching them how to take federally mandated multiple choice tests, and very little else. Most US high school graduates at this point cannot construct a literate English sentence, follow a logical argument, solve a simple "story problem" in basic math, find their home state on a map, or name one significant work of literature, art, or music from before they were born.

Sorry for taking shortcuts. Let me try and be more clear.<br>Free market labor arbitrage leads to the present conditions of wage slavery, indenture what have you. Thus we would want to avoid a revived poor farm economic model that took advantage of the dispossessed, vulnerable and so forth. But there could be different ability levels and charters for different types of "farm" and different types of "poor".<br><br>The vulnerable could be mainstreamed into the re-imagined poor farm to the extent that they were empowered by such integration. In other words we do not want to repeat the mistake of lumping the old and sick in with the criminal and insane expecting functional productive society to emerge. The objective of revived poor farms would be subsistence (amd basic human dignity) for those lacking the land based means to feed themselves. Of course some consideration for balance of the able and less able bodied would be necessary since carrying capacity of any individual farm would be determined in part by the labor burden imposed upon the able to sustain the less able.<br><br>The balance of abilities as well as the inherent natural carrying capacities constitutes a sort of productive limit that is an approximation for the social stability of the individual farm or community system.<br><br>Your concerns about abuse of the vulnerable need to be addressed. The principle that “participation is ownership” would have to be the operational attractor in any “poor farm” revival. WE do not want to revive the dysfunctional examples that were mere labor camps as on your side of the pond. there were some good examples on the west coast. Many poor farms were more like retirement homes that asked residents to pitch in. Probably better than just sitting around waiting for the reaper as they do now. Given the advanced age of their work force these were not high production factories netting huge profits for elites. <br><br>I acknowledge for the critics of government and other cynics that formation and operation of such institutions would require stable and enlightened government.<br><br>Like wise I acknowledge that a fundamental paradigm shift such as implied by "participation is the new ownership" cannot be manufactured whole cloth from the tatters of the existing paradigm. As I noted, enforcing tectonic shifts in the property paradigm was the undoing of the 20th century Communist states. <br><br>But perhaps in the undoing of 20th century industrial capitalism things could be different? In other words perhaps conscious progress of our species is possible. If we are soon to live shoulder to shoulder, all 10 Billion of us, there had better be some kind of change in the narrative of human quality of life. In the current narrative iadolescent notions of leadership and accomplishment determine membership in the corporate and government country club. The club make technological and social decisions that serve their interests. The bulk of the rest of humanity look on enviously and sacrifice the collective dignity in pursuit of the same prizes. But we retain I hope enough self enlightenment to see the value in participating in endeavors that yield tangible results such as dinner.<br><br><a href=#c8937273855483588240 title="comment permalink">6/9/12, 11:17 AM</a><br><br>

When one corporation's "management" owns all of the mineral rights in the county, the miners don't have much choice of employer. When one agribusiness owns all the land, the patents, the machinery, to politicians ... whatever the barrier to competition is, then labor will be in a difficult position. Thus, we consumers should at least choose to consume in ways that promote competition. If the "moral alternative" was also better and cheaper, this wouldn't be something that we need to think about, but when the choice is to pay more, or get less, we need to be thoughtful and look past the pricetag. (What do I mean by "getting less"? Maybe that means getting fruit with blemishes from the local organic grower, instead of picture-perfect fruit from out-of-state.) If you think workers should be paid better, pay more for goods made by better-paid workers. If you want to promote sustainable energy, buy it now (even while you reduce your own demand, and/or arrange to produce some of your own supply).<br><br><a href=#c4172844769254787465 title="comment permalink">6/10/12, 11:26 AM</a><br><br>

I notice that some commentators point out the extreme cost of house sized solar arrays, or the drawbacks of common batteries. This is not an "all or nothing" choice here, as a small solar panel, with a 40+ year lifespan, powering some LED lights, with batteries that have been produced with 17th century technology, compared with the oil powered lamps. The solar system is compact, provides a clean light that is easy to read by, without the fire hazard or indoor pollution associated with oil lamps, and the net cost over its life is a fraction of an oil lamp, wick and fuel. The drawback is that the solar panel and led lamp must be purchased now, compared to an oil lamp made from recycled parts at some time in the future. Moving somewhat up the ladder, a larger solar array can be used to store energy in the form of refrigeration, without significant battery capacity. The freezer is used to make ice during the day, and the ice is used to keep food preserved overnight. It can also be used to pump water uphill to storage while the sun shines, so water is available on demand by gravity feed later. Part of dealing with the long descent is acquiring the most valuable parts of modern civilization now, so that the future is not so bleak.<br><br><a href=#c6606516203572253438 title="comment permalink">6/10/12, 11:32 AM</a><br><br>

I have voluntarily lived around the federal poverty level for all of my young adult life, but I hardly feel poor; my life feels comfortable and free. In fact, because my expenses are low and I’ve never been in any sort of debt in my life (never had student loans, never owned a credit card, never had a mortgage), I don’t worry much about money at all. I find it ironic whenever I meet people making ten times the money I make worrying so much about money.<br><br>I find that pscyhological and social dimensions of voluntarily “collapsing now before the rush” are sometimes more challenging to deal with than the strictly practical dimensions of making these changes. People in certain circles seem to look down at my choice not to pursue some more prestigious career path (even though I was capable of doing this if I had wanted). These people may see my life so far as a “failure,” without looking deeper at what I’m pursuing in my life. (I can totally relate to your recent experience, Maria.) But I find that dealing with this psychological challenge, and not letting popular opinion influence my life, is important preparation for the future. I work part-time in the formal economy, spend the rest of my time doing self-directed study/reading, writing &amp; other creative work, informal household economy work, and learning new skills, and I feel content with my identity. I think inner security is as important as outer types of security. <br><br>So many people’s identity and sense of self-worth are tied to their fossil fuel-dependent lifestyle and the industrial growth system, and titles of who they are on the surface that arise from all that. I think the shattering of that may be as profound as the economic changes over the next several decades. Most people haven’t yet grappled with finding personal meaning in a story of a deindustrializing future.<br><br>When I chose not to pursue a preset middle class career path, it was a jump into the unknown, and there’s still much I’m figuring out. Upon some deep reflection, I knew that my calling in life was multiple things, one which was to be a writer. I looked at my choices: I could choose a predictable career, be successful in the eyes of others (at least before we slide too much down Hubbert’s Peak), or I could risk jumping off into the unknown, and dare to attempt to live a life that was an expression of my uniqueness. I figured that at my deathbed, I would have rather have failed at endeavors pursuing a life that was my own, than have succeeded at a life not mine. And besides, total failure is unlikely. Even if at the end of my life, I will have succeeded at only a few small dreams of mine, that’s immensely preferable to having succeeded in big things in a life that wasn’t me.<br><br>Reading what you have shared about your personal paths (in particular, Maria and JMG) provides needed solace for the occasional times I need to remind myself I’m on the right path, and not to let other people’s judging questions and comments weigh me down. Thank you for your company (in the blogosphere). It helps me not feel so alone.<br><br><a href=#c5640155916335826803 title="comment permalink">6/10/12, 3:35 PM</a><br><br>

The end of the industrial age will not come in our lifetimes if decline is a multi-generational event. Preparing for the end, with the expectation of being part of it, seems like overreach at this time.<br>.<br>2. Even those who have put solar panels on the rooftops without much other dedication to reducing consumption have made a major change - they have turned themselves, their suburban lot, and their house into a place of production.

But I notice there's something cooking in me about agriculture: is it a part of the problem or a part of the solution?

But before that, I'll need to go water the patch...<br>The inner accounting on what kind of life is worth living - what is a rich lfe apart from money - this takes a long time figuring out, and is quite hard. I am still working at this. I know my mother left a reasonably prosperous family farm at first opportunity. That was the time before chemical fertilizers, she still lived at a time when workhorses were used to till the land. But she hated it. Sha has a lifetime grudge about having had to milk cows by hand when she was a teenager. It was not a good life to her.

If you live anywhere near a series of manufactured footpaths, underground street plumbing or road guttering, chances are the collapse you undertake will be blind to the hidden petroleum advantage.<br><br>We tried voluntarily collapsing in the city, only the economy wasn't collapsing along with us. It's not like Cuba where the whole country was forced into a domestic economy overnight (US trade embargoes). <br><br>People can cut spending, but it won't stop Council rates from increasing prices to maintain overheads - especially as petroleum increases in price.<br><br>Cuba is an excellent example of how city and rural weren't too far apart when the trade embargo was put in place. They already had a culture where migration between town and country were common place. Not like how we view them in Western culture today.<br><br>Since Cuba was forced in a domestic economy, we've raised several more generations of kids believing town and country are foreign places. Food comes from a packet, or a fast food outlet. These are the realities we're asking people to voluntarily collapse in.<br><br>Moving to the country, people get a taste of what stepping out of that culture means. I'm with Glenn on the first comment - we aren't self-sufficient either, we still need to commute to the city to purchase stuff, and maybe it's a good thing. Because as the industrial economy slows, migration is going to be common place for a lot more people.<br><br>City folk may have to work for that organic farmer sooner than they realised - to get the skills they need to feed their family, plus derive an income. Because when petroleum starts to exit the economy, it will be food producers and trades that will start to dominate.<br><br>You said at the end of your comments, it's hardly fair to say "sorry you're out of luck", but that's exactly what happens when industrial economies decline. Collapsing where one is helps, but what happens when the economy you've invested in, out-prices your collapse measures?<br><br>I'm not sure if our views are that far apart - we just consider it from different angles. Maybe luck had me in a place where I tried collapsing, in a city that wouldn't stop escalating prices? Doing my sums, I realised no matter how much we collapsed where we were, we had to relocate to reduce the rate of escalation.<br><br>The closer you live to a city hub, (the condensed version of a petroleum based economy) the more State and County will increase their rates, fees and prices, even on such valuable things as public transport.<br><br>Maybe you think my view on country and city is somewhat dualistic? That's only because I've been both and realise if you want the third option, you have to go through a process first. That involves looking where you've been, accepting it doesn't apply any more and moving on with what you've got. <br><br>This is what you are discussing. But it's not harsh or thumbing noses at people to suggest, practical application does more than ideology. How do people go about getting that, when they live so close to hidden petroleum advantages?<br><br><a href=#c7648605265585981980 title="comment permalink">6/11/12, 6:30 PM</a><br><br>

He was very influenced by Tibetan Buddhism and Shamanism, among other spiritual paths.<br><br>As I envision it, "tuning in" is becoming aware of the predicament we are in.

A massive campaign addressed training, transportation and other obstacles to getting workers in the fields. Though there were more than 100,000 potential workers, only three jobs were filled."<br><br>Things weren't any easier in Washington State. There, "a labor shortage for the 2006 cherry harvest prompted an advertising blitz to recruit about 1,700 needed workers, particularly for the much larger apple harvest that was just around the corner. Only 40 people took jobs."<br><br>According to Alonzo's research, things were even worse in the East. "The following year, in North Carolina," she wrote, "farm officials set up a statewide hotline to fill crop and livestock jobs. Two calls were received."<br><br>Things have only gotten worse with anti-immigrant legislation.<br><br>In 2007 more than 90,000 migrants fled Oklahoma, causing a loss of $1.9 billion to the state's economy. Since passage of SB 1070, Arizona has shed 200,000 migrants who fled to friendlier states.<br><br>Agriculture is the largest sector in Georgia's economy, yet lawmakers passed stiff anti-immigrant legislation projected to cost the state $391 million in lost crops.

Long time reader, first time commentator- Just wanted to respond to noxpopuli:<br><br>I'm a veteran Civ Player, read that post as well, and I have to say beyond a shadow of a doubt that as much effort as he put into that game he had to either have deliberately stalemated it or simply not be that skilled in order to reach that outcome. The game doesn't take environmental factors into account through resource depletion so much as pollution, and not in any cumulative fashion at that. Global warming never causes seas to rise, or massive deserts to form and never permanently impacts food production (so long as you have enough engineers), and the pollution can always be cleaned up, never to be seen again. Gold mines first dug in the year 2980 BC still produce at the same output in 1934, and indeed oil, discovered later in the game, never runs out either! <br><br>That is (partially thanks to reading this blog) my main problem with the game. In many ways "Civilization" is a study in the myth of progress, with players beginning from a small agricultural village and marching to the tune of technological advancement all the way up to the space age, with none of the dark ages, collapses, or ecological mismanagement that have proven to be hard upper boundaries to social complexity for so many civilizations of the past. <br><br>As a side note, the developers *did* program a "Dark Age" feature for one of the later versions of the game, but phased it out in beta because all the players thought it was no fun! An interesting illustration of the story people were telling themselves by playing the game, no? <br><br>Anyway, I agree that the post was great! Do you play Civ as well? <br><br>Also, many thanks to you, JMG, for this awesome, I-tell-all-my-friends-to-read-it blog!

The consensus is that modern PV's made at efficient large scale plants, rooftop mounted using simple mounts and connected to the grid show a lifetime EROI of around 8 and improving. The EROI can be quite a bit higher depending on factors such as the arbitrage between the (possibly mostly primary) energy used in manufacture and the efficiency of the local fossil grid (final energy) which can be as low as 25% or even lower. Local insolation is also an EROI driver.<br><br>As the old saw has it, you are entitled to your own opinions but not your own facts :)<br><br>One consequence of this uncomfortable truth is rooftop PVs could make a substantial contribution to maintaining a recognisably western society.

I know you Yanks on average have a bigger household energy footprint than we Yerpeans, but a few solar panels, a couple of windmills, and a much more frugal attitude to power-consumption should see most households through. Just don't expect to run those chest-freezers 365 days a year together with daily full-wash cycles. As for transport - ride a bike, the exercise'll do you good.<br><br>And this is where the "popular daydream" of a survival homestead really comes into its own. We are one of the few lucky ones to have cashed in our 3-bed des-res in London for 39-acres of stunning countryside and a static caravan. We have wood, we have spring water, and pretty soon we'll have enough solar to be net exporters to the grid, and one day enough batteries to be off-grid. We can build and experiment in our barn, modify vehicles and make bio-diesel. Try that in a 2-bed flat in a major city. I am really enjoying my mid-life "collapse-now" crisis - it's the best thing that ever happened to me! And my friends think so too!<br><br>Of course that doesn't help the loved ones we left behind - but solving that problem's what we have planned for stage two. It's already quite clear that organic farming is a pretty labour-intensive affair (and one that quite frankly you are better off learning on the job than by running off to "apprentice with an organic farmer") but also one that we find throwing more labour at reduces the elapsed time exponentially. Here in the UK we have some pretty draconian planning laws to prevent us from just taking up residence on a field with a few like-mindeds. But, over time, by stealth, we will build our little community up bit by bit, person by person. Because community is where it's really at. Community is the only real solution to a world where everything has to be bought-in. The monetisation of our lives is almost as complete as our emptying of the oil-barrels. But friends, colleagues, and people in your immediate community know you'll do your share, and what goes around comes around.<br><br>So, if you can't collapse now to your own field or woodland somewhere remote, then start wwoofing or hanging out and making friends in the countryside, because post-collapse city-life won't be much fun, unless you're happy just writing blogs on "positive futures", of course.<br><br><a href=#c3377964075162266473 title="comment permalink">6/14/12, 7:51 AM</a><br><br>

Should they maintain and extend their grip on power, no one who refuses to drink their cool aid will be safe from persecution.<br><br>However, JMG, over the past several blogs, I’ve noticed your aversion to discussing the political questions some readers have raised about how to resist this dangerous threat to those of us who wish to live in harmony with, and respect for, the laws of nature.<br><br>I truly hope you aren’t one of those people you’ve described so accurately who becomes “brittle and defensive” when people raise issues that don’t fit comfortably into your strategy for coping with collapse. As you point out, ignoring and evading the need to confront uncomfortable truths is a sure path to “corruption of the intellect.” Yet, last week, when NTROPEE said your approach to handling collapse was a completely necessary but insufficient response to ecocide, tyranny and war. You told him to take his political concerns to a Marxist blog--then you told him to "go away." Instead of dismissing him I would like your thoughts, which I so respect, about this issue.<br><br><a href=#c5180199767526574027 title="comment permalink">6/18/12, 8:06 PM</a><br><br>

You're trying to make a slightly more subtle point. On the other hand, you do seem to be discouraging your readers from taking up organic farming... and here's the kicker... because it's too hard. Isn't that the kind of attitude that got us into this mess in the first place? <br><br>Yes, it's hard. All the more reason to start learning those skills now. Start with a garden and orchard. Then get chickens and bees. Start going to crop swaps and talking to neighbors. I've done all of this over the last two years on my 1/10 acre in the city, and surprise, it has been fun! And therefore self-sustaining. And now I'm looking for twenty-odd acres somewhere with a stable water supply and good soil. This will organically grow into a community, over decades. There will be serious meditation to overcome the "me first" habit.<br><br>And good grief, put those solar panels and water heaters up good people! Every little bit helps. Both in terms of replacing fossil fuels and raising awareness (which leads to decreased consumption, for one thing). JMG, please don't discourage people from taking these basic, fun, awareness-raising steps in the right direction. One step leads to another.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c6125143532123594437 title="comment permalink">12/19/12, 10:33 AM</a><br><br>

God, you are a genius :-) Everything is so clear now. <br><br>The only thing I do not agree with, is the fact that the collapse will take time. Although I agree it will be fractal, I think our modern world differs from other collapsed civilizations in that it depends a lot on electricity and planes, two things that did not exist in the past. <br><br>Electricity (the grid) will fail, because electricity needs oil to be built, to function, be maintained and repaired. So when the tipping point is reached, electricity stops. And when electricity stops, everything stops, doesn't it?<br><br>The same with planes, which require spare parts extracted from mines and transported with oil, not to speak of kerosene of course. Again, when planes stop to fly, many things just stop.<br><br>All in all, I think that many tipping points will be reached until what's left just won't be able to stand any longer. And that process will not take centuries, but years, I think.<br><br>Of what I have read, in the past, collapses were always local, so that people could slowly move to other parts of our planet. Now everything is global, so there won't be any other places to escape to.<br><br>Well, anyway, when do you think the "rush" will be?
