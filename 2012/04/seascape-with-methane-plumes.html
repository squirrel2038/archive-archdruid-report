<div class=MsoNormal>
In the wake of last week’s post, I’d meant to plunge straight into the next part of this sequence of posts and talk about the unraveling of American politics. Still, it’s worth remembering that the twilight of America’s global empire is merely an incident in the greater trajectory of the end of the industrial age, and part of that greater trajectory may just have come into sight over the last week. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Some background might be in order. For several years now, it has been possible for ships to sail from the northern Atlantic to the northern Pacific via the Arctic Ocean in late summer and early autumn. In the great days of European maritime exploration, any number of expeditions wrecked themselves in Arctic ice in futile attempts to find the fabled Northwest Passage; now, for the first time in recorded history, it’s a routine trip for a freighter, and as often as not the route is blue water all the way without an ice floe in sight. (Somehow global warming denialists never get around to talking about this.) Last autumn, though, crew members aboard several ships reported seeing, for the first time, patches of sea that appeared to be bubbling, and initial tests indicated that the bubbles were methane.  This was a source of some concern, since methane is a far more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, there’s a great deal of it trapped in formerly frozen sediments in the Arctic, and the risk of massive methane releases from the polar regions has played a substantial role in the last decade or so of discussions of the risks of global warming. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Word of the bubbling ocean up north got briefly into the media, and provoked a fascinating response. The New York Times, for example, published a story that mentioned the reports,and then insisted in strident terms that reputable scientists had proven that the methane plumes were perfectly normal, part of the Arctic Ocean’s slow response to the warming that followed the end of the last ice age. This same “nothing to see here, move along” attitude duly appeared elsewhere in the  media. What makes this fascinating is that the New York Times, not that many years earlier, carried bucketloads of stories about the threat of climate change, including stories that warned about the risk that the thawing out of the Arctic might release plumes of methane into the atmosphere. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Weirdly, this same reversal seems to have guided the response – or more precisely the nonresponse – of the climate change activist community to these same reports.  It might seem reasonable to expect that global warming activists would have leapt on these initial reports as ammunition for their cause; when initial estimates suggested that global warming would melt the glaciers of the Himalayas and deprive India of much of its water supply, certainly, a great deal was made of those claims. Still, that’s not what happened. Instead, a great many people who a few years ago were busily talking about the terrible risk of methane releases from the Arctic suddenly found something else to discuss once those methane releases stopped being a purely theoretical possibility. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Fast forward to this spring. After yet another unseasonably warm Arctic winter, Russian scientists are busy studying the methane releases reported last fall, and initial reports – well, let’s understate things considerably and call them “rather troubling.” Areas of open water up to a kilometer across are <a href=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/vast-methane-plumes-seen-in-arctic-ocean-as-sea-ice-retreats-6276278.html target=_blank>fizzing with methane</a>, a condition that one experienced Arctic researcher, Dr. Igor Semiletov, described as completely unprecedented. Another team of researchers, <a href=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/danger-from-the-deep-new-climate-threat-as-methane-rises-from-cracks-in-arctic-ice-7669174.html target=_blank>flying a plane with methane sensors</a> over the disintegrating ice cap, has tracked plumes of methane rising into the atmosphere wherever the ice is broken. The amounts detected, they comment, are significant enough to affect global climate. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Is this unsettling news being splashed around by the same mainstream media that, only a few years ago, were somberly warning about the risks of global climate change, and trumpeted from the rooftops by climate change activists as proof that their warnings were justified? Not that I’ve heard. In fact, <a href=http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/23/11144098-gaia-scientist-james-lovelock-i-was-alarmist-about-climate-change?lite target=_blank>according to recent media reports</a>, James Lovelock – creator of the Gaia hypothesis and author of books painting worst-case global warming scenarios in spectacularly lurid terms – has just announced that, well, actually, he overstated things dramatically, so did other climate activists such as Al Gore, and global warming actually won’t be as bad as all that. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In order to make sense of this curious reversal, it’s going to be necessary to take a hard look at some of the less creditable dimensions of the climate change movement. I should say first that as far as I can tell, the great majority of ordinary people who got involved in the climate change movement were guided by the most sincere and sensible motives. Dumping billions of tons of fossil carbon into the atmosphere was a dumb idea all along; pretending that all that carbon could be dumped there without disrupting the subtle and complex balance of the world’s climate was even dumber; and the response to those paired stupidities included a great deal that was praiseworthy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Equally, as far as I can tell, the great majority of scientists whose efforts have helped to prove the reality of anthropogenic climate change have produced honest and competent research, and even the minority that hasn’t met this standard rarely managed to rise, or rather sink, to the levels of cherrypicking, obfuscation, and outright fiction routinely found in climate change denialist literature. That being said, there’s more going on in the world of climate change activism than the honest concern of citizens and the honest labor of researchers, and it’s past time to examine the reasons why the climate change movement got so large and accomplished so little. In the process, we’ll be touching on issues that bear directly on the broader theme I’ve been developing in the last few months, because the rise and fall of climate change activism over the last decade or so has an uncomfortably great deal to do with the mechanisms of empire and the balance of power in a strained and fraying global political system. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Until the end of the 1990s, climate change was simply one more captive issue in the internal politics of industrial nations. The political role of captive issues, and the captive constituencies that correspond to them, is too rarely discussed these days. In the United States, for example, environmental protection is one of the captive issues of the Democratic Party; that party mouths slogans about the environment, and even though those slogans are rarely if ever followed up by concrete policies, environmentalists are expected to vote Democratic, since the Republicans are supposed to be so much worse, and willingly play the part of bogeyman.  The Republican party, in turn, works the same good cop-bad cop routine on its own captive constituencies, such as gun owners and Christian fundamentalists, and count on the Democrats to act out the bogeyman’s role in turn. It’s an ingenious system for neutralizing potential protest, and it plays a major role in maintaining business as usual in the world’s democratic societies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
After the year 2000, though, global climate change got coopted on a grander scale, as the rise of a handful of nonwestern nations to great power status put growing pressure on the United States and its allies. China is the most widely recognized of these, but India and Brazil are also emerging powers; meanwhile Russia, which was briefly subjected to an Anglo-American wealth pump after the collapse of Communism and nearly got bled dry, managed to extract itself in the late 1990s and has been clawing its way back to great power status since then.  Faced with these rising or resurgent powers – the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) nations, as they were called – the United States and its inner circle of allies have tried a number of gambits to keep them in their former places. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Historically speaking, war is the usual method for settling such issues, but that isn’t a useful option this time around.  Even if nuclear weapons weren’t an issue, and of course they are, I suspect too many people in the Pentagon still remember what happened the last time the US military went head to head with the People’s Liberation Army. (Readers who have no idea what I’m talking about will want to read up on the Korean War.) That left trade policy as the next logical line of defense, and so the late 1990s saw a series of attempts by the US and its allies to use global free trade treaties to put the rest of the world at a permanent economic disadvantage. That effort ran into solid resistance at the 1999 World Trade Organization ministerial talks in Seattle, and collapsed completely four years later. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who remember how the WTO talks at Cancun in 2003 crashed and burned may have experienced deja vu when the climate talks at Copenhagen in 2009 did exactly the same thing. The resemblance is not accidental. In the years leading up to the Copenhagen climate talks, the US and its allies argued that it was necessary to replace the Kyoto protocols of 1997 – which mostly restricted carbon emissions from the industrial nations – with a new set that would apply to industrializing countries as well. This was fair enough in the abstract, but the devil was in the details: in this case, the quotas that would place China, India, and other industrializing nations at a permanent disadvantage, and grandfather in the much higher per capita carbon emissions of the United States, Europe and Japan. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Environmental rhetoric has been used for such purposes often enough in the past. One of my college ecology textbooks, copyright 1981, mentions ruefully that attempts to pressure Third World nations into enacting strict environmental protections had come to be recognized by those nations as simply one more round of attempts to keep them in a state of permanent economic dependence. While there was more going on than this – the environmental movement in general, like the climate change activist movement in particular, has always included a large number of idealists with the purest of motives – it’s a safe bet that the Third World nations were broadly correct in their assessment, as none of the industrial nations that exerted the pressure ever proposed, let’s say, to forbid their own nationals from exporting environmentally destructive products to the Third World. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The stakes at Copenhagen, in other words, were rather different from those discussed in the media, and the outcome could have been predicted from the debacle six years earlier at Cancun. When it became clear to the major players that the United States and its allies were not going to get what they wanted, the entire process fell apart, leaving China to seize the initiative and offer a face-saving compromise that committed neither bloc to any limits that matter.  Afterwards, since climate change had failed to keep the BRIC nations at bay, the US dropped the issue like a hot rock; the financial hangover of the housing bubble made climate change lose its appeal to the Democratic Party; and activists suddenly discovered that what they thought was a rising groundswell of support was simply the result of being temporarily funded and used for somebody else’s political advantage.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Claims that large-scale methane releases from the warming Arctic would send the planet’s climate spinning out of control played a significant role in both the domestic and the international rhetoric of climate change during the time the movement was coopted, and got dropped along with the movement once it was no longer useful. The same claims, though, also played a broader role in mobilizing citizen activism and scientific concern, and the reasons why nobody outside the corridors of power is talking about the methane plumes deserves some attention as well.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s at work here is the basic structure of contemporary activism itself.  Pick nearly any issue that inspires activism nowadays, and you’ll find that it fits into a strict and stereotyped narrative. It centers on something bad that’s going to get much worse if nothing is done, and the “much worse” generally ends up described in ever more luridly apocalyptic terms as the movement proceeds.  Victory for the movement, in turn, is defined for all practical purposes as preventing the worst case scenarios the movement itself offers up; high-level abstractions such as “peace” and “justice” get a lot of play, but it’s very rare for there to be any kind of meaningful vision of a goal to be sought, much less a pragmatic plan for getting there.  Opposing the bad, for all practical purposes, replaces seeking the good. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who followed the discussion of the tactics of magic in last autumn’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> will doubtless be able to think of several good reasons why this approach is problematic, but there’s another dimension to the problem.  In contemporary activism, the worst case scenarios that play so large a part in the rhetoric are there to pressure people into supporting the movement. In climate change activism, certainly, that was the case. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Read James Lovelock’s more recent and strident books, or any of the good-sized bookshelf of parallel literature, and you’ll find the claim that failing to support the climate change movement amounts to dooming the planet to a hothouse future in which, by 2100, the sole surviving human beings are a few “breeding pairs” – that’s Lovelock’s phrase – huddled around the tropical shores of the Arctic Ocean, with catastrophic methane releases from the Arctic regions among the driving forces behind that lurid scenario. It’s a compelling image, but once methane plumes actually start boiling up through the waters of the Arctic Ocean, you’ve just lost your rationale for further activism – or, really, for anything else short of jumping off the nearest bridge. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the dilemma in which the news from the Arctic has landed climate activists. Having by and large bought into the idea that once the methane starts rising, it’s all over, they have very few options left. It’s a self-created dilemma, though, because methane releases aren’t a new thing in the planet’s history. If it’s true that, as George Santayana said, those who forget their history are condemned to repeat it, it’s equally true that those who forget their paleoecology are condemned not to notice that they’re repeating it – and in this case, as in many others, a good basic knowledge of what happened the last time large scale methane releases coincided with a period of planetary warming. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That wasn’t that long ago, as it happened. The end of the last ice age saw sharp increases in methane concentrations in the atmosphere, the rapid melting of continental glaciers, and a steep rise in global temperature that peaked around 6,000 years ago at levels considerably higher than they are today. A controversial theory, the “clathrate gun” hypothesis, argues that the warming was triggered by massive methane releases from the oceans.  Whether or not that was the major factor, ice cores from Greenland document rising levels of methane in the air around the same time as the stunningly sudden global warming – an increase of more than 15°F in global average temperatures in less than a decade – that triggered the final collapse of the great ice sheets. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first point to grasp from this is that methane releases aren’t the end of the world. Our ancestors got through the last rounds of it without any sign of massive dieoff, and it’s been argued that the nearly worldwide legends of a great flood may embody a dim folk memory of the vast postglacial floods that took place as the ice melted and the seas rose. For that matter, during most of Earth’s history, the planet has been much hotter than it is now; only a few tens of millions of years ago – yes, that’s practically an eyeblink in deep time – crocodiles sunned themselves on the subtropical shores of Canada’s north coast, at a time when Canada was nearly as close to the North Pole as it is today.  Thus Lovelock’s extreme scenario deserves the label of “alarmist” that he himself put on it in the interview cited above. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On the other hand, that doesn’t mean that a methane spike in the Arctic can simply be ignored. Since the dim folk memories that might be embodied in flood legends are the only records we’ve got for the human experience of abrupt global warming, we simply don’t know how fast the temperature shift might affect, for example, the already unstable Greenland ice sheet, which contains enough water to raise sea level worldwide by around 30 feet.  Some theoretical models argue that Greenland’s ice will melt slowly, while others argue that water pooling beneath the ice could cause huge sections of it to slide off into the sea in short order, filling the North Atlantic first with icebergs, then with meltwater. Which model is correct?  Only Gaia knows, and she ain’t telling. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Equally, we don’t know whether the melting of the Greenland ice sheet will make nearby continental shelves unstable, as it did the last time around, and reproduce the same set of conditions that caused gargantuan tsunamis at the end of the last ice age. There’s abundant evidence for these; one of them, according to recent research, <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12244964 target=_blank>flooded the North Sea and carved the English Channel</a> in a single day around 8000 years ago; we don’t know how soon those might become a factor around the Atlantic basin, or even if they will. It’s unsettling to realize that we may have no way of finding out until the first one hits. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All that’s certain at this point is that something potentially very troubling is happening in Arctic waters,  and the possibility that it might have destructive consequences on a local, regional, or continental scale can’t be ruled out. Panic is the least useful response I can think of, so I’ll say this very quietly: if the news from Arctic waters in the months and years to come suggests that things are moving in the wrong direction, and those of my readers who live close to the shores of the northern Atlantic basin happen to have the opportunity to move inland or to higher ground, it might not be unreasonable to do so. </div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
On a different topic, the folks at <a href=http://www.scarletimprint.com/bloodoftheearth.html target=_blank>Scarlet Imprint</a> tell me that they’ve still got a few remaining unsold copies of the handbound deluxe "Black Gold" edition of my book <i>The Blood of the Earth: An Essay on Magic and Peak Oil</i>. I know it’s a chunk of money, but there’s something to be said for a book crafted to standards high enough that it’ll still be readable long after industrial civilization has faded into memory. If that interests you, might be worth considering. </div>

<span style="font-size: large">End of the World of the Week #19</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nostradamus, who’s featured in the last two weekly Ends of the World here, has also had a remarkable track record for inspiring false prophecies in others – and I’m not just thinking of the cheap  tabloids that trot out newly manufactured prophecies with his name on them every few months. Many Nostradamus researchers have embarrassed themselves once they moved from trying to force-fit quatrains onto the past, and attempted to use the French prophet’s writings to anticipate the future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One example is Henry C. Roberts, whose <i>The Complete Prophecies of Nostradamus</i> saw print in 1994. After careful study of the quatrains, Roberts came to believe that Nostradamus had infallibly predicted a dramatic event in the near future: the election of Edward Kennedy as president of the United States. (You’ll find this prediction on pages 210 and 218 of Roberts’ book.)  Any chance Roberts might have had at a reputation for infallibility went away when Kennedy died in 2009, having never gotten closer to the White House than a failed 1980 run for the Democratic nomination.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Oddly enough, a failed Nostradamus prophecy concerning Edward Kennedy also featured in pop musician Al Stewart’s 1973 piece <i>Nostradamus</i>: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the new lands of America three brothers now shall come to power</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Two alone are born to rule but all must die before their hour</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s not hard to figure out who’s being discussed, but Edward Kennedy died at the age of 77. </div>

Since then, he’s mainly written books about it. Early this century, [Lovelock] apparently got tired of being out of the public eye. In 2004, he made a big fuss scolding enviros that they would have to accept nuclear power. In 2006, he warned that “billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where the climate remains tolerable.” In 2008, he said “democracy must be put on hold” in order to respond to climate change. In 2009, he reiterated that “the climate war could kill nearly all of us and leave the few survivors living a Stone Age existence.”</i><br><br>If we were to instead look at what someone like James Hansen, who's pretty universally recognized as a top climate scientist, has been saying and writing for decades, it's remarkably consistent (and <a href=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2012/04/evaluating-a-1981-temperature-projection/ rel=nofollow>a recent look back at his quite sophisticated climate model</a> from a seminal <i>Science</i> paper from 1981 showed if anything Hansen has erred on the conservative side in his projections).

As for Hansen, do you happen to know if he's said anything about the Arctic methane releases? I'd be very interested to hear his comments, if so. <br><br>Joel, exactly! As I commented in another context, if we do get the global warming that seems to be headed our way, the planet will be fine -- she's been through this many times before -- and so will our species, though the postwarming population will of necessity be a good deal smaller. It's industrial civilization that will be crushed, with the inevitability of a boot descending on an eggshell. <br><br>Godozo, two comments. First, have you checked that hypothesis against the evidence from paleoclimatology, which tells us quite a bit about the consequences of ice sheets melting and breaking up? Second, do you ever wonder why it is that so many people are so fixated on finding some mechanism, however far-fetched, that will allow them to imagine the end of the industrial age as a sudden cliff, rather than the long ragged decline that's ended nearly every other civilization in history? <br><br>Bruce, interesting. As I recall, that wasn't the conclusion that Lovelock drew from his research -- in fact, he was claiming in the early 1980s that the Earth was doomed to perish in the near future because the sun's heat is increasing over time (all stars do that); he had to backtrack some years later when it turned out that he'd ignored a major heat compensation mechanism in the atmosphere.<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c6612760999967652900 title="comment permalink">4/25/12, 10:28 PM</a><br><br>

If ice sheet melting picks up, that's going to be a massive challenge for any land close to sea level. <br><br>Barath, I'm familiar with that scenario, but one of the constants in this research is that gradualist scenarios don't hold up well. Do you recall when everyone reputable claimed that the end of the last ice age was very slow and gradual, with sea level rise at a pace that would hardly be noticed? Now they're finding solid evidence of bursts of meters-per-decade eustatic rise driven by the sudden collapse of large sections of ice sheets. The "clathrate gun" hypothesis, whether or not it works as a cause of the end of ice ages, provides a similarly sudden -- and quite plausible -- means for large amounts of methane to get into the atmosphere at once. That being the case, I don't think it's safe to count on gradual climate change as a done deal; the risks of underestimating the possible rate of change, it seems to me, are substantially greater than those of overestimating it.<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c2651593706308445408 title="comment permalink">4/25/12, 11:17 PM</a><br><br>

Hansen convincingly locates the cause. Rising ocean temperatures caused deposits of "methane ice" (a frozen mix of methane and water that gathers on the ocean floor) to melt and release large amounts of methane (a potent greenhouse gas) into the water, and the methane bubbled up to the atmosphere. Once methane release began it necessarily continued until essentially all the methane ice was melted, because the initial release warmed the atmosphere further, which caused further releases, and so forth in a vicious circle.<br><br> The planet has generally cooled during the last 50 My, and new methane ices have had ample opportunity to spread over the ocean floor. CO2 and temperatures are again increasing. We're putting ourselves in danger of another PETM-like event. But unlike 55 Mya, Greenland and West Antarctica today hold huge ice sheets that would eventually melt under a massive methane release, causing catastrophic ocean rise." http://physics.uark.edu/hobson/pubs/10.04.Book.rev.Hansen.html<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c4029190824293071797 title="comment permalink">4/25/12, 11:22 PM</a><br><br>

Activists are always subsumed by the system, only a dunderhead would believe otherwise. It is far more subversive to plant and grow your own produce and build the resiliency of your systems whilst operating both within the system but also being apart from it when you so choose.<br><br>As for Sir James Lovelock, I must confess to reading some of his works and also commenting about them here on this very website. His writing scared me a bit, although the plug for nuclear power kind of lost me a bit. To his credit, he did comment that he'd be happy to live next to a reactor, although I'm unsure that he has actually done so. I would have had a bit more respect for his works if he'd been more honest and stated that nuclear was the only alternative that offered base load power, despite the costs and negative returns.<br><br>On the other hand, he may just have a very big ego and like saying controversial things to get the public’s attention!<br><br>Dr Tim Flannery's summation of the climate science to date, "The weather makers", troubled me far more because as an ecologist and palaeontologist he covers history and the ecology ie. the big picture.<br><br>Still, the conclusion that I've come to after all this reading is that the Earth is a closed loop and whilst we are without doubt causing damage, over the long term it is probably self-correcting. Peak resources will serve to put the brakes on a lot of the more extreme predictions anyway and few people tend to consider this aspect. <br><br>Too many people consider that the environment is in a fixed state, but my readings in both history and ecology plus experience here shows me that nothing is further from the truth and that it is in constant flux.<br><br>Last weekend, I camped in a remote spot up in the alpine area with some friends. What was really interesting is that on the drive in to the camping spot by the river, you could see the different environments change from one fold in the mountains to another. There was even remnant rainforest in gullies waiting for the absence of fire and thus their time in the sun to come again.

Well worth the time. However, the lecturer focused on peak oil as if it were merely a transport problem. It is very hard to find people that have a big picture viewpoint on the world. What was really spooky for me though is that the lecturer voiced something that I'd previously thought and not said aloud. It was the observation that, "we'd be considered mad by the rest of society if we didn't take advantage of the energy available to us".

Like most nonlinear systems (such as any stock exchange) such systems tend to stay seemingly stable for well beyond people's expectations, then can go asymptotic over night. Most people are linearists - while they can recognize that a danger exists, the longer the dire warnings go on with no overt changes the more likely they will be dismissed.<br><br>Fukushima is illustrative here. Tsunamis are nothing new to Japan or anywhere in the pacific basin - Oregon still bears the scars of the last tsunami there in the 1700s.

That linked article on the Channel-opening "tsunami" seems to suffer from a bit of sloppy terminology and hyperbole. This is alas almost universal in science articles in the mainstream press. Though they use the term "tsunami," what they describe sounds more like an ice dam collapse, such as what happened in the inland Pacific Northwest rearranging the landscape there. It's not a trivial distinction, not just because the causal mechanism is entirely different. A tsunami is a wave, not a bulk-flow of water from one spot to another. They can clearly do major damage, but their power to do earthmoving on a sub-continental scale is limited. The ice dam collapses, on the other hand, create massive, sustained one-way flows of unimaginable amounts of water, and they can indeed carry entire islands and mountains with them as they go. But even if you stick with their "tsunami" terminology, a 10m tsunami is hardly unprecedented. The recent Japanese tsunami approached this, and 10m waves have occurred many times in the last few centuries around the Pacific Rim. Some of them have had "run-up"heights where they hit mountainsides of hundreds of meters. Now, nothing like this has ever been documented in the historical record for the Atlantic, of course. Although... I have lost the link, but something like the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles mentions an enormous sea wave washing across parts of Britain in the middle ages, but it was unclear whether this was a tsunami or just a storm surge. <br><br>Do you have any general references about post-glacial Atlantic tsunamis? I'd be curious to read more.

The problem with interpreting the seemingly bizarre things going on in the Arctic in recent years is the relatively short historical record. When you only have 20 or 30 years of good data, it is impossible to know how extreme an extreme event really is. And of course the popular media do their usual hyperbole to give the impression that the entire arctic ocean is ice-free and bubbling like a giant vat of seltzer water (with drowned polar bears floating around in the froth). Some of the recent happenings agree with a priori predictions of the effects of greenhouse warming -- reduced pack ice, stronger warming at the pole than the mid-latitudes, methane releases, etc. Although so far these things are not so pronounced around the south pole. But some of the things that seem to be following from this were not predicted, such as the setting up of unusually persistent blocking patterns in the northern hemisphere that lock huge areas into alternating regions of freakishly warm and freakishly cold, for month after month after month. So it is (a) hard to interpret exactly how far beyond the range of natural variation we might be, and (b) what the heck the extended consequences of this strangeness might be. <br><br>I know we have been around about this one before, but I will repeat that I don't think you will find that there is a consensus among all the various global proxy datasets that there was ever a concerted planet-wide warming of 15 degrees in a short time. There were jumps like this regionally, apparently. And if it hits your region, that is plenty disruptive. <br><br>Finally, one thing about using paleoclimate as an analogy for anthropogenic climate change. A big difference is that the ultimate forces that drove changes in paleoclimate were gradual, even if their effects sometimes consisted of dramatic and rapid shifts between different quasi-stable steady states for the climate system. With the anthropogenic effects, however, the forces driving the change are not slow and gradual, but are themselves rapid. If you push slowly on a leaning dower it will eventually reach the point where it will suddenly topple to the ground. But if you explode a bomb next to it it will fly apart into a million pieces and scatter itself over a wide area.<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c7112565746067713905 title="comment permalink">4/26/12, 6:51 AM</a><br><br>

Too much certainty too early is not an advantage. <br><br>RPC, your homework is to figure out how much sea level rise would be needed to fill each of those. <br><br>Barath, that's true. One consequence is that meaningful contingency planning often needs to go past the current scientific consensus and embrace possible black swan events -- as von Neumann pointed out in his book on game theory, the consistently successful strategy is the one in which you systematically eliminate as many negative outcomes as possible, within the limits of your resources, and then win by not losing. <br><br>Mister R., methane in the atmosphere oxidizes into water and CO2, which is some improvement -- CO2 isn't as strong a greenhouse gas as methane -- but it's still a problem.

One thing about magic -- once you understand it, it's hard to miss how pervasive its effects can be. <br><br>Bill, ice dams produce some pretty spectacular floods, too -- I spent a lot of time growing up crossing the drainage channels of Glacial Lake Missoula -- but this was a bona fide tsunami; look up the Storegga Slide sometime. The bibliography of my book on the Atlantis legend has references to the research on very large tsunamis, and might be worth a look. The giant wave legend, btw, is from the Irish <i>Book of Invasions</i>, and yes, it's been proposed that this is a surviving memory of a very large tsunami that went right over Ireland. <br><br>Stu, excellent! You get today's gold star. It's precisely the lack of discussion of <i>how to adapt</i> -- to climate change, or what have you -- that's the great blank spot in current discussions, and that's because most of the people in the discussions are still trying to use the threat of an ugly future to bully people into joining a movement. <br><br>Mary, it'll be interesting to see if anything actually gets done to move all those fuel rods someplace (temporarily) safer, or if they're just going to sit there until the statistically inevitable accident causes another, even larger disaster. <br><br>Bill, the oxygen-isotope data from the Greenland ice cores, last I checked, was generally held to be a fairly reliable proxy for global average temperature, and one that -- unlike most others -- can be measured in decade-or-less increments. That's the basis for the claim I've offered. Mind you, if it's just Greenland that jumps 15 degrees in less than a decade, that's bad enough, since that much heating would probably be enough to push the Greenland ice cap into rapid collapse. As far as whether non-anthropogenic climate forcing factors are always gradual, well, let's just say I'm unconvinced; the deep causes may be gradual, but there are plenty of nonlinear effects in nature. <br><br>Don, there's a book on that theory -- quite plausible, though it wasn't a tsunami that did it, simply a matter of rising sea levels filling the Mediterranean to the point that sea water could flow through what's now the Bosporus. <br><br>Adrian, of course Britain can still grow food in a warmer climate -- it's been semitropical at various points in the last ten million years, you know. It's getting there that's the hard part. <br><br>Lament, that's an excellent point. Human beings are potentially very tough -- we evolved out of earlier hominids in the middle of the last ice age, for heaven's sake, going mano a mano with cave bears and woolly mammoths. It's only those of us who live privileged lives in the industrial nations -- yes, that means everybody reading this -- who've been pampered enough to go slack. <br><br>Richard, that's doubtless part of it. <br><br>Hereward, Switzerland may not be necessary, but a good couple of hundred feet above sea level probably wouldn't hurt.<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c47232813784140352 title="comment permalink">4/26/12, 9:22 AM</a><br><br>

It sounds like it was already almost submerged from sea level rise, and the tsunami pushed it that last little bit over (rather than scouring out the whole thing in one fell swoop. Continuing sea level rise then finished the job, leading to the English Channel as we now know it.<br><br>This is the other event I was thinking of:<br><br>A widespread flood was reported in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to have occurred in western Britain, from the coast of Cumbria around to Kent, on 28 September 1014. This has been attributed to a tsunami, possibly caused by a comet impact. William of Malmesbury stated that "A tidal wave... grew to an astonishing size such as the memory of man cannot parallel, so as to submerge villages many miles inland and overwhelm and drown their inhabitants." The event was also mentioned in Welsh bardic chronicles. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunamis_affecting_the_British_Isles)<br><br>One thing about potential global climate impact of things like the arctic methane releases -- first they have to notably affect the global atmospheric methane concentration. Methane is oxidized in the atmosphere, and biologically in soils. Methane concentrations did begin to increase again in 2007 after having been flat for about 8 years. So far they have not begun to increase at an accelerating rate, which you would expect to see if there were going to be a "run-away" effect.

Thank you! As for methane issues, I'm less worried about the runaway effect theory, and more about the short-term effects of a sudden injection of lots of methane into the atmosphere above the Arctic. As I recall, gases tend to pool over the poles -- thus the problem with CFCs and the polar ozone layers -- and though methane does photodissociate, if it's being added in enough volume it's going to have an impact over the short and middle term. <br><br>Just for one scenario, imagine a decade-long series of massive methane burps from the Arctic ocean and melting permafrost, putting the equivalent of a nice warm blanket temporarily over the North Pole. This gives the Arctic ten years or so of very warm summers and, more to the point, unusually mild winters. It's a transient and self-limiting phenomenon, but if it's intense enough it could tip the Greenland ice cap into full-scale collapse, complete with jokulhlaups, icebergs filling the North Atlantic, and meter-a-decade sea level increases. <br><br>Not the end of the world by a long shot, but a body blow to western Europe and the United States.

The generally accepted figure by most climate scientists is a 7 meter (23 ft) sea level rise when Greenland melts off, and another 7 meters when the West Antarctic ice sheet collapses. Why should 2 meters make a difference to me? Aside from being a 30% difference, I'm 1.8 meters tall... <br><br>We live 38 meters above sea level, and about half a KM from the sea; the natural angle of repose of the beach and one's distance from it are as important as altitude in these cases.

But not all collapse is the same.<br><br>(This discussion begs the question of what you mean by a "massive dieoff". To my mind, that suggests 50-90% population loss in a generation or two.)<br><br>We both agree that human extinction is not in the cards, but I think of a catabolic decay/collapse cycle as being rather different from a catastrophic <i>and rapid</i> collapse of industrial civilization.<br><br>A catabolic collapse scenario is likely to be punctuated but relatively gradual overall. It is something that an individual can reasonably try to plan/adapt for (i.e. green wizardry). It might even make sense to have kids if you're prepared to train them to deal with the world they are inheriting.<br>On the other hand, this same potential for adaptation to catabolic collapse also means that many of our institutions may survive, including those which are used to concentrate wealth to the elite. A catabolic collapse scenario has a high probability of leading to a century or three of industrial feudalism (with much lower per-capita footprint for most of the population) before it finally runs entirely out of steam.<br><br>By contrast, the potential widespread sharp impacts associated with climate change (or anything else, but climate change seems the likely candidate) could readily disrupt the industrial system in ways that it cannot adapt to, leading to a much further, faster fall and a lot more collateral damage along the way. It's this possibility which I see being discounted by any line of reasoning that says "humans have lived through this before". It's true, as far as it goes, but it neglects the fact that we have historically had both far more flexible social forms (if only because there were many small "civilizations" which were largely disconnected) and a lot more breathing room.<br><br>It's hard for me to see an effective strategy for individual adaptation in that context, other than the stereotypical survivalist stockpiling ammo in his mountain hideout. On the other hand, the catastrophic nature of this scenario means that it's likely to erase most of our social institutions, including those which create a monied elite. In the long run, the catastrophic collapse might actually be preferable (if you assume that a hunter-gatherer lifestyle is better than being a feudal peasant, which I do) but the short term will be much uglier.<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c6064499676273598903 title="comment permalink">4/26/12, 1:18 PM</a><br><br>

I've been fretting -- on the back burner, at odd moments -- about those methane bubbles for a few months now, ever since reading the first coverage somewhere or other (possibly TOD). Not much to say about that other than Yikes.<br><br>But when people talk about the End of the World I often feel compelled to point out to them that the world has ended before, many times, for lots of people. For example, most of the indigenous cultures of the Americas: how did it feel to be Haida or Salish (or any of the S American nations) and in one generation to watch 90 percent of your people die from mysterious never-seen-before diseases? to see your territory taken over by hostile, arrogant strangers -- in some cases to have your kids taken from you and brainwashed, your language banned, your cultural practises made illegal, your sacred objects confiscated... If that isn't the End of the World (for the people experiencing it) I dunno what is.<br><br>I think some of us privileged anglo industrial core dwellers imagine dramatic EOTW scenarios (like the extinction of all humanity, or the end of all life on earth etc) precisely because we can't wrap our heads around the end of *our* world, our little technobubble, our systems of commerce, our domination of the rest of humanity, our amazingly convenient and comfortable (and yet simultaneously alienating and pathogenic) lifestyle. Rather than admit that *our* cultural world must and will end -- that it's not only possible but inevitable for humanity to live in very different ways from Our Way -- we imagine the whole planet going Boom.<br><br>The survival of a species (ours for example) is a very different matter from the survival of individuals. Until you get down to a gene pool too small to maintain healthy variety, the fate of individuals is more or less irrelevant to the fate of the species. Having become as numerous as prey species like krill (despite being a top predator), we imagine that losing, say, 50 percent of our numbers would be The End. In reality, humans could probably lose 90 percent of our numbers in the more populated areas and it would not be The End of the species by a long shot -- hardly "a few breeding pairs" as Lovelock dramatically suggests. But it would be The End Of The World in terms of our culture, cultural continuity, our quotidian expectations and patterns; and it would involve immense suffering, grief, loss, immeasurable pain. I suspect that, as well as commensalist solidarity and beneficial relocalisation, there would be opportunistic predation, all kinds of abuses and injustices. [There's a rather good book, "The Great Bay", which speculates about a several-century period of rising sea levels in central California, the quick and then slow powerdown, and the balkanisation of local cultures across a wide spectrum from brutally authoritarian to creatively communitarian.]<br><br>So yeah, the End of Our World could mean a world of pain. OTOH (and here I revert to my earlier theme) the "successful" history of empire, industry, capitalism, expansion of the Anglosphere etc, that "great achievement" at whose pinnacle we now stand, *has* involved immense, immeasurable suffering, grief, loss, and pain. Whether the end of that system would mean *more* suffering (if some divine accountant were able to tot up all the readings of some kind of universal dolorimeter) in toto, or less than the establishment and perpetuation of BAU... who knows?<br><br>All we can do is try to act with integrity and affection today, I guess.

IMHO, Energy consumption has been pretty much the defining characteristic of the USA for many decades, as far as I can remember, and the US capitalistic / technological / energy system is basically leading the way for most other countries, in terms of planetary consequences.<br><br>In a closely related tangent, I just ran across <a href=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-solar-green-20120406,0,1278620,full.story rel=nofollow>two L.A. Times</a> <a href=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-solar-bones-20120424,0,6193826,full.story rel=nofollow>articles</a> where the rush to build large desert solar energy complexes on the part of the Obama Administration is described with words like "frantic", a "bulldozer", and "on steroids".<br><br>The articles sensationalistically explain that the Administration wants to build these plants in order to "save the world" from global warming, but I trust most readers here will recognize that as obvious PR spin. If anything, I would suggest the Obama administration has its eye much more on protecting the energy-intensive American lifestyle in the face of clear indications of Peak Oil, than any altruistic concern about the environment. If they really wanted to "save the world", then Conservation along the Archdruid's "LESS" model, would enter the picture somewhere. It never, ever does.<br><br>It's a clear example of our discussion in this thread, about how large-scale environmentalism can be used as an excuse to bulldoze over local control and traditional respect for the environment -- hoping nobody notices that corporate coffers are still enriched, and the word "CONSERVATION" just never enters the discourse. The first article explicitly connects large-scale donations with the "co-option" of big environmental organizations. <br><br>I read JMG's column today and I really wanted to write a defense of the environmental movement. 30 years ago, when I first got interested in environmentalism, these movement organizations were much more devoted to conservation on the personal level. At that time, funny co-incidence, it was perfectly logical to be an environmentalist and a political conservative (I'm liberal, I'm just sayin', a lot of conservatives _used_ to be conservationists.) Unfortunately I think the Druid's above critique of environmental movements really hits the nail on the head, at least with respect to the past 30 years. <br><br>The psychosis of Consumerism has infected the environmental movement so deeply that today, most environmentalists reflexively assume that in economic terms, we can purchase and grow our way into sustainability and conservation. The <i>denouement</i> may be slow in coming, but it is on its way, I'm fairly sure.<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c7347211257638229904 title="comment permalink">4/26/12, 5:54 PM</a><br><br>

The problem with sea level rise is that larger waves can travel through deeper water without breaking, ergo the destructive energy of storm-driven waves can assault structures farther inland and/or with more force. A wave breaks (and loses much of its destructive energy), generally speaking, in water that's about 7/8 as deep as the wave is tall. So an 8 foot wave breaks in 7 feet of water, which is significantly offshore, and people build coastal infrastructure at a certain shoreline location, because they're accustomed to the waves breaking offshore. Now consider that many beaches have a gentle slope of about 1 vertical to 50 horizontal. So if the sea level rises 7 feet, that 8-foot wave is going to be breaking right where the dry coastline begins, right on top of coastal structures instead of far offshore. Alternately you could say that with a 1:50 beach slope, given a 7 foot sea level rise, a wave will break 350 feet further inland than it would normally do, attacking structures and infrastructures that today are considered dry. (1:50 is a rule-of-thumb average, but even in the case where the coastline is walled by rock bluffs, those bluffs are going to collapse much sooner if assaulted by large in-shore waves due to rising seas.) The monetary cost of damage to a country from rising sea levels resembles nothing less than damage from a war. That kind of monetary damage creates refugees, topples governments etc., like a war, but because it's happening in slow motion, we just don't see the urgency.<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c4487539115604791956 title="comment permalink">4/26/12, 5:57 PM</a><br><br>

As for your feudal peasant/hunter-gatherer theory, well, I've already explained in quite a bit of detail that I think both sides of that very common trope are inaccurate and improbable -- you can find the arguments in my book <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i>, if you're interested.

Any complex dynamic system can "go nonlinear" quickly, as you and others have pointed out here, and there are many possible scenarios, drawn out or sudden, by which a system can shed complexity.<br><br>As I read it, though, you bring them together nicely in the comment of 4/26/12 11:06 AM: "That's the sort of thing that concerns me -- not the much-ballyhooed global consequences, but the sudden, transient, but (for those caught in them) catastrophic events on the local and regional scale that tend to accompany the slow global changes!" <br><br>I think this is something that tends to get lost in the climate discussion, although it's come up often in these comments: it's not the "slow, even burn" that gets you, it's the "restless energy" that can show up anytime and anywhere. For example, I can imagine that JMG's decade-long scenario of an arctic "methane blanket" could wind up having dire consequences in, say, the Himalayas, the Sahara, the Australian Outback, and the Great Lakes before it fades out.

Seriously, a mountainous area can't support a huge population because the soils are simply wrong for this purpose. The soils in a forest are fungal dominated and as such they favour the growth of trees and the forest understorey. There's plenty of fuel in the trees themselves, but there's not really that much to eat. To grow vegetables in this sort of environment you have to encourage a more bacterial dominated soil and hopefully get a balance between the two. This can be done, even by a subsistence farmer, but you have to know what you are doing and it involves risk.

When glacial retreat is discussed here in Iceland, it has occasionally been mentioned that the thinning of the ice caps would lead to a reduction of pressure on the underlying volcanic systems, which in turn might tip them over to an eruption - if the pressure levels were already high and eruptions imminent.<br><br>It is overly dramatic because a) volcanic eruptions in Iceland happen anyway and b) so what? The largest ones can have temporary, hemisphere-wide ill effects (e.g. 1783 Laki eruption) but threats are mostly local in nature. Icelanders are quite calm overall about their volcanoes because most of our settlements are at a safe distance (as a result of hard-learnt adaptation over the past 1100 years). Besides, without ice caps there's no threat of massive meltwater floods, rendering the volcanoes a lot less disruptive locally.<br><br>However.... the sort of iceshelf displacement being discussed here would constitute a devastating threat. Two thirds of the population live in Reykjavík, a coastal city on the west (Greenland-facing) coast. I do expect that buildup of ice dams and the possibility of this kind of disaster would be taken seriously here, but even with the population safely evacuated we'd be looking at a loss of perhaps 60-80% of the country's housing. The only saving grace is that most of the energy infrastructure would be left intact. But Iceland would certainly face a massive property loss, and that's in the best-case scenario of proper anticipation and evacuation-measures.<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c6766742453378186107 title="comment permalink">4/27/12, 6:36 AM</a><br><br>

The overall trajectory is long slow decline, but closer in, on a decade-by-decade scale, it's a matter of sudden local, regional, or global crises followed by periods of relative stability or even partial recovery. The collapse of the Greenland ice sheet, if that happens, would be one such crisis.<br><br>As for the breakdown of the current industrial system, that's simply another such crisis -- and would be followed by herculean efforts to get some kind of less vulnerable industrial system up and running again in some countries. Odds are that at least some of those efforts would succeed -- that's one of the mechanisms by which what I've called "scarcity industrialism" may replace our current system of abundance industrialism. So it all does fit together.<br><br>Cherokee, AU$1.10 a watt is pretty good! Congrats; of course the economic divergences that make that possible won't last, but you might as well snap 'em up while you have the chance. <br><br>Jonathan, the occurrence of postglacial tsunamis isn't random; they follow the rapid melting of large ice sheets. We're discussing a mechanism that could cause the rapid melting of a large ice sheet -- and no, as I mentioned in my post, it needn't take hundreds of years; there are models of ice sheet collapse (involving meltwater as a lubricant between ice and the underlying rock) that could remove most of Greenland's ice in a decade or two. Are those models accurate? Nobody knows, but there have been very sudden eustatic sea level surges in the geological past, so the possibility can't be rejected out of hand. As for Atlantis, yes, that's one of the theories that gets trotted out every decade or so; not surprising that NatGeo got around to it again. <br><br>RPC, thank you!<br><br>Oskar, thanks for the reality check.

Not many people realize that American left-wing activism has its historic roots solidly in the Protestant Christian evangelical tradition -- it was only in the 20th century that the churches swung to the right, a shift that left all sides doing their level best not to talk about their history.

Until about five years ago, I was willing to discount Global Warming altogether, because the scientists making predictions would always start out "by the year 2100...", and by 2100 I will not be around to care. <br><br>And as Bill P has pointed out, the same puff of gas could be released in a microsecond as a destructive explosion, or it could be released over a few seconds and it's just a puff of gas. <br><br>Also interestingly, geologists' thinking about the Grand Canyon has recently changed -- common knowledge used to be that it was formed by gradual erosion over hundreds of millenia. Now it's suggested that the Canyon was formed in one, or several, of those natural-dam catastrophes. And it's an interesting story about the English Channel. <br><br>JMG, as for João's theory, I have seen a hypothesis (can't remember where it was from) that we would see increased tectonic activity as a result of changes in the weight distribution when big ice sheets melt. But because a volcano affects the climate for around two years, and methane lasts around ten years, while CO2 lasts a century, I don't expect the volcanoes to offset much of the heat load. <br><br>The final negative feedback effect, which will definitely cause the Earth to stop short of becoming another Venus, is an increase in cloud cover. As the tropical oceans warm up, more water will evaporate increasing Earth's albedo. Of course that also means hurricanes. I don't know what it will do for life, but the P-Tr event, 250 mya, was one of the planet's biggest mass extinctions.<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c2205653374645258565 title="comment permalink">4/27/12, 4:59 PM</a><br><br>

I just wish I could make the connection clear to people: sea level rise is real, it's happening right now, it's causing monetary damage, and when your country is spending tens or hundreds of millions of dollars (especially piecemeal at the local level) on the apparently innocuous and "natural" damage resulting from sea level rise, your country cannot spend that money employing people, safeguarding its food supply, improving its education, transportation or infrastructure, etc. <br><br>Sea Level Rise may not be the <b><i>apocalyptic end of the world</i></b> just yet... wait a century or two for that, Kevin Costner... but it is part of a self-inflicted death of a thousand cuts which is exactly what JMG refers to as a 'catabolic collapse'. When you work in coastal engineering, you can just see it happening in front of your eyes, but few others have the patience to notice it.<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c3403829784866057671 title="comment permalink">4/28/12, 12:21 AM</a><br><br>

Modern day activists (be it environmental, socio-political, humanitarian, etc.) all crave attention in order to compete with other causes, and this often leads them to make exaggerated – often ridiculous – disaster predictions to the media, as in: “If something is not done about (insert problem here) then in two weeks/months/years/decades we will see catastrophic (insert disaster here) and millions will (insert consequences here)!!! (insert sound of violins here).” More often than not, these disasters do not occur in the time they predict. Based on the predictions of some environmental activists of the late 80s, both the ozone layer and Amazon rainforest would have already disappeared a decade ago and humanity would now be hiding in the shade and gasping for air. That is not to say that the activists concerns aren’t genuine and based on fact, but just that by only announcing the worst case scenario they make a lot of noise in the short term but rapidly lose their credibility, as their repeated disaster predictions end up sounding like they are just firing blanks, or crying wolf.<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c2208372282471060214 title="comment permalink">4/28/12, 6:12 AM</a><br><br>

The Arctic is surrounded by land, and gets no warm currents. "Warmer" Pacific water comes in through the Bering Straits; but they are both shallow and narrow, the flow rate is not large. Antarctica has been losing ice sheets due to collapse at a greater than historical rate for the last 50 years. So far, snow accumulation inland seems to be keeping the overall ice mass more or less in equilibrium though. There is also the feature that Southern winters are more severe, because earth's orbit is closer during the south's winter, and the north's summer. That should mean a similar feedback during Southern summers, but so far the summer collapses and calving have not greatly exceeded the winter build up at higher elevations.

The others range from a meteor impact to continental drift, so there's a largish diversity of time scales there. It's hard to tell the difference between a day and a hundred thousand years, that far in the past. It's also hard to say how or whether those events are inter-related ... opinions vary. <br><br>Fast-forwarding to the Grand Canyon, I believe that I was remembering a TV show, perhaps on PBS. The geologist/guide pointed to some house-sized boulders and noted that we have never seen enough flow to move them (in the last couple hundred years). Therefore, the boulders must have been moved in a lahar or similar event. The Colorado isn't flowing now, thanks to a temporary piece of concrete blocking its path, but on a geological scale it probably won't matter. <br><br>According to the Wikipedia page, there may have been thirteen different volcanic dam events in its history. It would seem that the Canyon's history, as much of history generally, has been one of extreme boredom punctuated by terrifying catastrophe. And ice is not the only thing Nature makes dams out of. The other thing I learned is that the Canyon shows maybe 1.5 billion years' worth of sedimentary history in its walls, and that its geology, and that of similar canyons scattered around the planet, is extremely complex and interesting.<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c4263775072367326798 title="comment permalink">4/28/12, 3:33 PM</a><br><br>

I am a former member of the left and activist circles. It's not that my views changed, simply my views regarding the left and activism in general. I am certainly a much more jaded individual than I once was. Besides, the left effectively disowned me when I chose the military as my career(2000-present), especially after I willingly stayed in after Bush was elected. I was often asked how I could serve under such a tyrant (or whatever moniker was thrust on him). I always responded, "Which is worse, a military made up of many different political groups, or one of all one political ideology." Very often that argument fell on deaf ears. I have always found it darkly amusing to see anti-war stickers on gas guzzling vintage cars. It seems the car, the stickers, etc. are more about portraying some image than an actual sincere belief. I have had, a few times, anti-war types stop me, when I'm in uniform, and try to explain the whole "blood for oil" argument to me. I often feel that they are simply doing it for some personal rush instead of genuine sincerity. I don't discredit that Iraq was largely (perhaps, completely) about oil, but after several years spent in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan I feel that I get that concept quite vividly and don't need it explained to me.<br>Thanks for the discussion on The Great Lakes.

Over the past few days I put up those solar panels in a very sunny spot. ie. less shaded over winter than the main roof of the house.

I don't know how it will go, but I'm optimistic and also a little bit nervous being in unchartered territory. No one really knows with these sorts of things how they'll go in the real world until they are tested and found wanting. People advocating large scale solar power really should be required to live with it for a while or just keep quiet.<br><br>For 9 months of the year, I'm 100% self-sufficient with electricity albeit with a very low daily requirement - even during the worst weather.<br><br>However, during winter I’ve found that for those 3 months I had to use a small petrol powered generator which used 3 litres of fuel per day. Some may say, that's not much, but 3 litres x 90 days = 270 litres x AU$1.60 per litre = $432 for the 90 days - or about the same price as two new solar panels which incidentally, should get at least 50 years use (well, hopefully) whereas the fuel is a use once option.<br><br>On a completely different note. At a country market today, I purchased a new herb - Herb Robert - and found a reference to it in my books that surprised and delighted me:<br><br>"It is probable that the plant was commonly associated with magic and goblins in earlier times, a fact reflected in the range of names it has been given in various European countries..."

In Miami we are experiencing a problem with saltwater intrusion into goundwater that is the source of fresh water for Miami and the Florida Keys. If the sea level continues to rise (as it almost surely will), Miami will die of thirst some time before the waves consume the city (I write this sitting eight feet above mean high tide).<br><br>Further, while the environmental movement may be guilty of hyperbole in pursuit of converts and money, some of their predictions that were considered strident in the 70's have already come to pass. For example, when I was a youth, environmentalist claims that AGW would lead to collapse of antarctic ice shelves was dismissed as alarmist claptrap. Yet I recall that when the Larsen B ice shelf finally did collapse, it was met in the media by the same defening silence that JMG is noting for the methane releases in the arctic.<br><br>Continuing that subject, maybe five years ago Russian scientists reported finding similar methane "boils" in lakes in Siberia. They showed that these were due to decomposition of organic material in bogs that had been frozen for centuries, but were now warm enough to be microbially decomposed. I saw nothing of this in the mainstream media, but rather reports in scientific publications.<br><br>Regarding tsunamis on the US East coast, I recall reading reports of sediment analysis from New England ponds and bogs that turned up ocean beach debris miles inland.

My primary comment was that by the time that the flooding reaches a stage where humankind is effectively pushed back from their existing cities the other effects of GCC will have already done massive amounts of damage to the societal infrastructure. The unusual March heat, 110 tornados in one storm in April, the likelihood of seismic activity as heat pump cycles quicken, effectively moving more water faster against the continental shelves, all of that is going to impact the highly interconnected society that we have negatively, unpredictably, and generally disastrously. <br><br>What's more, each such disaster weakens the overall infrastructure just that much faster. Before rising waters affect cities they will affect wetlands, destroying ecosystems that are already perilously on the edge and eliminating the buffers that these provide. Chain reactions happen as system redundancy disappears. By 2035, more energy will be spent just trying to stay in one place than will be spent in establishing a new infrastructure to deal with the problems, and that is even before the rise in sea levels itself becomes sufficient that it significantly impacts the United States and Europe. By then of course, I expect that the economic infrastructure will have collapsed completely, possibly to the extent of the United States itself dissolving into its regional nations (just as the EU is on the verge of doing now).<br><br>So, not disagreeing with you about the significance of the danger posed by methane sublimation, just that I believe that the precursor events to flooding will bring much of society to its knees even before the flooding itself occurs.<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c4568746483550296712 title="comment permalink">4/29/12, 8:46 PM</a><br><br>

More smaller tornadoes are being counted because a larger percentage of them are getting detected, not necessarily because there are more. 95% of tornadoes are NOT capable of extensive damage to life and property; many of these were overlooked in past decades, but they do now get counted in those totals.

My take on the differences in GW effect between Arctic and Antarctic hinge on geography. The Arctic is an ocean surrouned by low land. The albedo of the tundra when the snow melts off is higher than that of water, but still lower than ice, so it's easier for the sun to warm the Arctic. The Antarctic is a high land surrounded by sea ice. Even in summer the sea ice doesn't completely go away yet. This keeps the albedo high, and the altitude ensures that all the precip. on the continent falls as snow. According to Wikipedia, the ice shelf collapses are being caused by a warm current; though the high altitude snow accumulation is preventing rapid loss.<br><br>While not a lot of flow goes through the Bering Straits (and the North end of the Bering Sea is pretty shallow), what does come in is "warm" in that it is above freezing. The usual dynamic is this water comes in, freezes and forms sea ice. As it ages the salt leaches out and settles to the bottom as superchilled brine. Since the Bering is shallower than the Denmark Straits, the resulting bottom flow goes into the North Atlantic. As it falls off the continental shelf it gives a boost to the otherwise wind driven North Atlantic drift, boosting it to become the gulf Stream.<br><br>The complete loss of summer ice will eliminate this source of cold saline water, as no multi-year ice will be there to leach out. This should reduce the Gulf Stream to something more like the Kurishio in the N. Pacific, and N.E. North America, and especially Europe will get much colder. This has happened before when freshwater glacial lakes have spilled down what it now the St. Lawrence and diluted the N. Atlantic. The world still warms, but Europe freezes.<br><br>While I think, like Bill Pullian, that most of what we've seen in weather has been the result of more people living in disaster areas due to rising population; there have been other GW effects that haven't changed the weather in terms of storm intensity or frequency _yet_. Though we may look back in a century and say, well it started then, but the noise to signal ratio was too high to see. One change is sea ice loss, which is quite visible in the last 50 years. Now, before anyone goes off about weather variability, it is worth noting that 50 years is precisely the time period that Climate Scientists use to differentiate between variable weather and climate change. So I'd say the sea ice is a good signal.<br><br>Glenn<br>Marrowstone<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c949703941691217373 title="comment permalink">4/30/12, 10:07 AM</a><br><br>

Thanks for the "heads up" about the methane. I would assume boats are having a hard time floating over that area as well. <br> <br>I'm not surprised about the whole political co-opting of the enviro and climate change movement. But, beggars (enviros or women) can't be choosy with who they align themselves with (Dems) to get some paltry work done (clean air act, Roe V Wade). For us libs who embrace our 2nd amendment rights it's annoying to hear Repubs dismiss the rest of our rights... <br>I can imagine there are many Republican citizens who also embrace clean air and water and their women's rights... Time to get the PEOPLE to act together. <br><br>One of the things that strikes me is the lack of memory in people of even recent events, more recent than 6000 years ago, <br><br>(BTW,many of the flood myths came out of seasonal floods, like in Mesopotamia and the Nile area, where even the religions of the area were influenced by the types of flooding that took place. Mesopotamia had unpredictable, destructive floods, and their afterlife myths are dark and terrifying. Whereas the Nile flooding was predictable and lifebringing, and their after life myths are literally heavenly.)<br><br> for example most people often forget the 1800's where the flu took out something like 80% of Europe. <br>The current infrastructure that we enjoy thanks to industrialization and its infrastructure, is a two edged sword in light of disease that could bloom with higher temperatures. Infrastructure speeds transportation, thereby both increasing contagiousness and allowing for medicines to get to where they are needed; that is, if they are available. <br>Recent scarcity of medicines such as antibiotics, antivirals and cancer drugs may be another sign of our industrialized world grinding to a slow halt. It dovetails nicely with the gradual rise in price of gasoline (in the USA). <br>To me, this slowness of the descent of, as you correctly describe it, the US oil Empire, and indeed of the industrial oil age, may be even too slow to perceive. I would think, to most people too drunk on reality TV, beer and chips, or too exhausted from their slave jobs, are unable to even notice it's happening. They might not even care if they knew. <br><br>Again, as you said, people would be fine if they knew how to do things that our grandparents knew how to do. But most don't in the West and they don't want to start digging in the garden or tearing out the electrical from their homes to install wood stoves or root cellars. They certainly don't want to be told they won't be able to drive to work in a handful of years... or in a handful of months!<br><br>I've been working hard to make some of these transformations and joined a Transition Movement hub near me. <br>But it's really hard to convince people the future might be different, though not horrible if only we are better prepared and trained for it. <br><br>It could be a nightmare, and it could be kinda awesome...It depends on us...

Climate skeptics have been quick to jump on this statistic, but satellite measurements have confirmed it was the result of massive flooding in the US, Australia, Pakistan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Japan, Taiwan and Southern China (and possibly elsewhere), which transferred enormous amounts of water from the sea to the land. This was partly due to the ENSO cycle, but global warming seems to be exacerbating the extreme ends of the cycle, resulting in warmer ocean water and greater precipitation. Still I don’t remember anyone predicting that the extra precipitation would result in lower sea levels, so this shows the difficulty in predicting the behavior of complex nonlinear systems, and the folly of focusing on only one variable at a time. (Hopefully some of that water will find its way into badly depleted aquifers, but I expect most of it will eventually find its way back to the sea, possibly resulting in a bigger-than-usual increase for 2012.)<br><br>Last year, I got a sneak preview of what 1.5m (5ft) of sea level rises might look like. A massive polar low (about 870 hPa, if I recall correctly) moved below Tasmania, producing excellent surf and devastating coastal erosion. Most of the damage was done by the storm surge, which resulted in a low tide water level that was higher than the biggest king tides. A lot of houses in my parents’ suburb lost their backyards or worse. Of course, there will still be storm surges even after sea levels rise, and it is this double whammy that will do the most damage.<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c666649970510466293 title="comment permalink">4/30/12, 7:31 PM</a><br><br>

John R. sure ain't kiddin' about the difficulty of predicting complex nonlinear systems. When we talk about Sea Level Rise, we really should be careful to discuss _where_ we are measuring it! Just as John R. points out, I have seen papers that indicate the sea level is falling in various regions of the world, although taken together in the aggregate, the _average_ sea level is rising due to thermal expansion and meltwater. <br>Just for everyone's aedification, when we measure sea level rise at a particular location, first we have to decide if the land is moving up or down due to plate tectonics etc. If the land is rising faster than the sea level, there is a net sea level "fall" of course. Then again due to amphydromic effects... (in English that's kinda the wave caused by swirling water around in a bucket)... because of the lunar and solar tides, and the rotation of the Earth, and the shape of the ocean basins, there are a few places around the world where the sea level is still consistently falling, because the mass of water due to Sea Level Rise is basically sloshing around to some other part of the bucket. <br>It's hellishly complicated, and as many have pointed out, in complicated situations the cavemen with easy polemics ("Drill Baby Drill!" vs. "Florida will be under water!!") tend to carry public debate.<br><br><a href=seascape-with-methane-plumes.html#c1830748589154004767 title="comment permalink">5/2/12, 2:21 PM</a><br><br>
