I apologize in advance to those of my readers who find military history uninteresting. The next part of the story I’m exploring just now, the story of the British Empire’s fall and its replacement by today’s American empire, can’t be understood without a sense of the military realities that drove that process, and the decline and fall of the American empire, the central theme of this series of posts, also has a crucial military dimension.<br><br>That dimension starts out, oddly enough, not with defeat but with victory. It’s too rarely realized that an unbroken string of victorious wars is one of the most dangerous things that can happen to a nation. Plenty of things could have clobbered the British Empire, and plenty of things contributed, but a strong case can be made that the blowback from too much success was the thing that finally tipped Britain over the edge into imperial collapse.<br><br>You can trace that effect at work all through the nineteenth century in the steady drumbeat of bungled crises and minor disasters that called forth one brutally efficient response after another from Britain’s immense military machine but never quite taught it to rethink any of its mistakes. A rebellion in India or the Sudan, a war in South Africa or Afghanistan, or whatever else, wherever else, generally began with a series of disastrous reverses for the British side. Usually, though not quite always, this was the doing of the army, the red-coated stepchild of Britain’s military establishment—you’ll notice that it’s the Royal Navy and, nowadays, the Royal Air Force, but not the Royal Army—whose officer corps for generations was where England’s noble families parked their incompetent younger sons.<br><br>So a regiment or an army would get slaughtered, a city or a province end up temporarily under the control of the people who lived there, and the British press would start baying for blood; Parliament would bicker decorously, and then immense military force would converge on whatever corner of the planet was to be taught a lesson; meanwhile the British army would work its way down through the list of available commanders, throwing them a few at a time into the crisis, until it finally found one who could figure out how to use overwhelming military and technological superiority to win a war. Once the natives were machine-gunned into submission, in turn, the successful general would head home to London and a peerage, the others would be quietly pensioned off, and every lesson that might prevent the next disaster was promptly forgotten. It was all so far away from London, and each generation of officers in training dutifully read Clausewitz and daydreamed of Waterloo and forgot to notice how fast the world was changing around them.<br><br>Not even the First World War managed to shake the serene confidence of Britain’s imperial elite that what worked in the past would continue to work in the future. That time, it wasn’t so far away from London, and the army on the other side wasn’t outnumbered, outgunned, and out of its league.in technological terms. Germany in 1914 was one of the world’s major industrial nations, with a large and extremely competent army. Ironically enough, that army was nearly as hampered by a string of successes as Britain’s was, and tried to repeat its 1870 triumph over France without paying attention to the possibility that the French might be expecting that. They were; the German offensive ground to a halt along a ragged line across northern France and Belgium; Parliament bickered decorously, and then Britain tried the usual trick of overwhelming its enemy with the massed forces of its empire – and that’s when things went haywire, because throwing massed forces against an entrenched enemy equipped with machine guns and modern artillery simply meant that whole regiments were annihilated to gain a few yards of bloodsoaked mud.<br><br>Worse, the British army failed to follow its usual practice of cashiering one general after another until it found one who could figure out how to fight. Instead, the same handful of top commanders kept on using the same tactics straight through the war, even when those tactics consistently failed and cost tens or hundreds of thousands of British lives – as they did. The war on the western front turned into a struggle of sheer attrition, which the Allies won because the United States threw its resources, its wealth, and finally its soldiers into the balance. When the victory celebrations were over and the top British commander retired with the traditional peerage, it was all too easy to forget that without a tsunami of American aid, Britain might well have lost the war.<br><br>As it was, the First World War very nearly bankrupted the British Empire. The wealth pump had been running too hard for too long, stripping wealth from existing colonies, and the expansion of British economic interests into central Europe couldn’t make up the difference because the war had very nearly bled central Europe dry. Ireland’s successful war of independence in 1919-1921 showed which way the wind was blowing. England had crushed numerous Irish rebellions down through the years, but in the wake of the First World War that was no longer an option; after two years of bitter fighting, British prime minister David Lloyd George, scrambling to stave off full Irish independence, used threats of escalating violence to pressure the Irish provisional government into accepting self-rule under nominal British authority. That turned out to be a stopgap, and a weak one at that Over the next three decades, as Ireland cut its remaining ties with the British Empire, politicians in London merely grumbled and looked away; the resources to do anything else couldn’t be spared from other, more urgent needs. Those of my readers who are keeping track of the larger trajectory being traced in these posts will want to take note: when an empire can no longer afford to maintain control over its oldest and closest subject nations, that empire is circling the drain.<br><br>Meanwhile, on the far side of the North Sea, a far more serious challenge was building. Britain’s secondhand victory in the First World War had spared it the need to learn the lessons the war had to teach; Germany’s defeat made those lessons impossible to ignore, and the Versailles Treaty that ended the war fed far too much of Germany’s remaining wealth into the wealth pumps of Britain and France, adding the insult of impoverishment to the injury of defeat. (Since Britain and France both ended the war with huge debts to banks in the United States, quite a bit of that wealth flowed promptly across the Atlantic, where it helped put the roar into the Roaring Twenties.) Through the 1920s, when the German army remained bound by the sharp limits imposed at Versailles, young officers whose names would become famous a few years later talked late into the night about how the war could have been won, and what kind of an army could win it. When they got the chance to build that army – courtesy of a little man with a Charlie Chaplin mustache, whom the foreign press by and large dismissed as a Mussolini wannabe – a frighteningly different mode of making war began to take shape.<br><br>What these officers realized, or partly realized, was that the petroleum-powered internal combustion engine had completely redefined the potential shape of war. Britain had converted its fleet from coal to oil in the years just before the First World War, to be sure, and equipped its armies with tanks, trucks, and aircraft, but the strategic vision that directed all these things remained mired in the 19th century. In the minds of military planners in Britian and France – as well, to be fair, as most other countries – the nature of war remained what it had been for centuries: two opposing armies form up, march toward each other, jockey for position, and then fight a battle, and the army that withdraws from the battlefield first has lost; rinse and repeat, until the army, the government, or the nation of one side gives way. The new way of war Germany’s young officers began to sketch out no longer followed those rules. It’s going to be necessary to take an extended look at that difference, partly because the current American way of war is wholly based on the principles those German officers developed, and partly – well, we’ll get to that as we proceed.<br><br>Some weeks ago, in a post discussing the American Civil War, I mentioned that the European military attachés who followed the armies and witnessed the battles of that war almost uniformly learned the wrong lesson from it. That’s because they paid attention to the two most famous generals of that war, Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee, and to the part of the war that was closest to Washington DC and the port cities of the eastern seaboard, a rough triangle of of eastern Virginia whose points were at Washington, Richmond, and the sea. The battles fought there after Grant took command of the Army of the Potomac were a close first approximation to the useless slaughter of the western front in the First World War, with one crucial difference: they weren’t useless, from Grant’s and the Union’s perspective, because they formed one part of a broader strategy.<br><br>Grant is said to have described that strategy in the homely language he preferred: “I’m going to hold the cat down, and Sherman is going to skin him.” That was exactly what happened, too. Grant’s job was to pin down Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia, respectively the Confederacy’s best general and its toughest army, so that neither one could be spared to the more vulnerable western front. Meanwhile Grant’s opposite number, Gen. William T. Sherman, marched an army from Tennessee through Georgia to the sea, and then north through the Carolinas toward Virginia; his job was to shatter the Confederacy’s economic and agricultural systems, cripple its ability to feed and supply its armies, and make it impossible for the South to keep fighting. That was why Sherman’s “bummers” stripped the country bare, leaving behind memories that are still bitter today, and it also explains a detail that rarely gets mentioned in any but the most technical histories of the Civil War: in the course of a months-long campaign that took him through the heartland of the Confederacy, Sherman fought only two significant battles.<br><br>Grant got the glory, and earned it fairly, but Sherman may have been the 19th century’s most innovative military thinker. When he came face to face with a Confederate army, whenever the strategic situation allowed, he evaded it, slipped past it, got behind it, and threatened its lines of communication and supply, forcing it to retreat in disarray. Long before anyone else, he grasped that it’s not necessary to fight a pitched battle to win a war, and that a force that can move fast, get behind its enemy, and target the vulnerable territory behind the lines can cripple the ability of the other side to wage war at all. Most of a century later, that approach to war came to be called “blitzkrieg;” today it’s the basis of the Airland Battle Doctrine, the core of American military strategy.<br><br>I’ve come to think that those German officers who talked late into the night in the 1920s may have remembered Sherman, and realized that what he did with infantry on foot could be done far more effectively with tanks, airplanes, and infantry loaded into trucks. When 1940 came and a rearmed Germany set out to even the score with Britain and France, certainly, the strategy the German high command chose was for all practical purposes the same one that Grant and Sherman used to shatter the Confederacy. The British and French set out to refight the First World War, moving their armies into northern France to contain an expected German thrust through Belgium. The Germans made that thrust with part of their force, pinning down the Allied armies – holding the cat, in Grant’s metaphor. Then, once the Allies were fully engaged, the rest of the German force drove through the rugged Ardennes hills, got behind the Allied lines, and proceeded to skin the cat with aplomb. Less than two months later, France had surrendered, and the British forces had suffered a humiliating defeat, fleeing across the Channel from Dunkirk and leaving their tanks, artillery, and everything else behind.<br><br>Meanwhile, around the same time that those young German officers were sitting up late at night and talking strategy, another coterie of young officers on the other side of the Eurasian continent was doing much the same thing, with equally dramatic results. Japan didn’t have the advantage of a recent defeat to draw on, but the humiliating events of 1854, when American gunboats had forced Japan to open its ports to American merchants and reverse a centuries-old policy of economic localization, left a lasting scar on Japanese memories. Aware that the alternative was subjugation by one of the existing imperial powers, Japan’s leaders frantically built up a modern military and the industrial economy that was necessary to give it teeth; a short and successful war with the Russian Empire, in which the Japanese fleet crushed its Russian rivals in two flawlessly executed naval battles, duly followed; but the young officers of the Imperial Navy recognized soon after the First World War that the day of the battleship was over, and embraced the possibilities of naval air power at a time when most other nations with navies still thought that aircraft carriers were a waste of time.<br><br>My American readers doubtless remember how these preparations affected the United States on December 7, 1941 and the days that followed, but they may not be aware that British forces in the Pacific suffered a series of equally disastrous and humiliating defeats. Once again, the cause was simply that Japan had noticed and embraced the new military possibilities that petroleum and the internal combustion engine made possible, and Britain had not. Fortified naval bases that were essential to British strategy in the Pacific and the Indian Oceans, and were considered invulnerable in London, fell into Japanese hands like ripe fruit. Perhaps the best display of the mismatch, though, was the doomed voyage of the battleship Prince of Wales and the cruiser Repulse, the two most powerful British naval vessels in the southwestern Pacific, which sailed from Singapore the day after Pearl Harbor to attack a Japanese landing force up the Malay coast. It was a move straight out of Alfred Thayer Mahan, but the Japanese were no longer playing Mahan’s game; the ships were promptly spotted and sunk by Japanese torpedo bombers.<br><br>The war that followed is usually called the Second World War, but it might more usefully be given a different name: the Gasoline War. That’s partly because the stunning initial victories of the two Axis powers that counted came from a grasp of what gasoline engines could do in war – Mussolini’s Italy never did figure out the revolution in warfare that petroleum made possible, and so got the stuffing pounded out of it early and often. It’s partly, also, because a great deal of the strategy of the war on all sides focused on access to petroleum – the two Allied powers that counted, the United States and the Soviet Union, had immense petroleum reserves, while the Axis had none, and the attempts of the latter to seize oilfields and the former to prevent that from happening shaped much of the war. Finally, it’s because victory in that war went to those who were able to bring the most petroleum-based energy to bear on the battlefield. While Germany and Japan could manage that, they remained in the ascendant; once the United States and Soviet Union applied the same methods using their much more abundant oil supplies, the Axis was doomed.<br><br>And the British Empire? It’s considered utterly impolite to talk about what happened to it in straightforward terms, but a thought experiment may be useful.<br><br>Imagine, then, that the twists and turns of history that brought the United States into two world wars on Britain’s side had gone the other way. Perhaps it was the Venezuela crisis of 1895, mentioned in last week’s post, or one of the other flashpoints in British-American relations that were successfully dodged by statesmen on both sides. It really doesn’t matter; the key detail is that in 1914 and thereafter, in this alternate history, the Anglophobes rather than the Anglophiles defined America’s response to the coming of war in Europe, and Britain was left twisting in the wind. Imagine that Germany won in 1918, and that a later German leader – let’s suppose it was the young Kaiser Wilhelm III, son of the conqueror of France – went to war in 1939 against a crippled British Empire and forced Britain to surrender. What would have happened then?<br><br>The potential war aims of any of Britain’s early 20th century rivals are easy enough to imagine or, for that matter, to look up. First, the British Empire would have been dismantled, such portions of it as the conquering nation wanted would have been seized, other parts would have been allowed self-government under the overall control of the new imperial power, and a few token colonies would be left under British control where that suited the conqueror’s interests. Second, the British government would become a permanent and subordinate ally of the new imperial power. Third, Britain’s military would have been reduced to a fraction of its previous size, and the British government would be obligated to provide troops and ships to support the new imperial power when the latter decided on a military adventure. Fourth, Britain would be expected to pay a large sum of money as reparations for the costs of the war. Finally, to guarantee all these things, the British government would have been forced to accept an occupying force in Britain, and permanent military bases would be signed over to the new imperial power in Britain and its remaining colonies. That, by and large, is what happened to defeated nations in the wars of the 19th and 20th centuries.<br><br>Now compare that list to the relations between Great Britain and the United States from 1945 to the present. That’s the thing that can’t be mentioned to this day in polite company: the British empire ended in the early 1940s when the United States conquered and occupied Britain. It was a bloodless conquest, like the German conquest of Denmark or Luxembourg, and since the alternative was submitting to Nazi Germany, the British by and large made the best of it. Still, none of Queen Victoria’s prime ministers would have tolerated for a moment the thought of foreign troops being garrisoned on British soil, which is where thousands of US military personnel are garrisoned as I write these words. That’s only one of the lasting legacies of the Gasoline War.<br><br>****************<br><span style=font-size:130%>End of the World of the Week #17</span><br><br>Since this week’s post is on the long side, this week’s End of the World can be told briefly.

The Royal Navy and Royal Air Force have no regiments in them, or were conceived without regiments, and such is why there's a discrepancy. It's the same in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, all obviously descended from the British tradition.<br><br>I also have some serious issues with your characterization of British warmaking at the operational and tactical level, but that's neither here nor there. You're on the money with their performance at the strategic level, and as a modern soldier in an Army descended from the British Army, if I wanted spot on tactical and operational snapshots of a military I would read a book by an expert devoted specifically to it... which I do. <br><br>As I said - it's an aside, your analysis of the strategic plans and realities of the British Empire are pretty spot on.

This is 206 years and a half after the first year of Michael'S rule, of 1881. This in turn means that the prophecy in this X.72 quatrain could well be related to A.D. 2087." and on p. 368 he relativizes the whole thing saying perhaps it means a great terror will come to the earth polarizing things or perhaps it is just a meaningless verse to satisfy his contemoporaries.

Vicksburg, along with “Stonewall” Jacksons Valley Campaign were the two campaigns most popular for study with foreign military academies. I agree that Sherman is greatly underrated.<br><br>A lot of WW1 history is colored by the overrepresentation of British accounts in the English language history. The big loses were in the frontier battles in 1914. As bad as the Somme was, it did reflect some lessons learned – and included the first use of tanks by the British. The French also developed tanks, and remember that it was France that was in a position to equip the arriving U.S. Army. The U.S. entry was critical, but their early battle performance was very uneven, and we were usually not very cooperative allies. The U.S, effort should not be confused with our much more thorough support in World War 2.<br><br>The term Blitzkrieg needs to be forgotten. It was not a term the Germans used. They had a variety of interesting terms, but the one you are describing the referred to as a ‘cauldron’ battle, and was influenced by the Elder Moltke’s views on the battle of Cannae (Rome versus Carthage) and predates even World War 1. They only used the plan you noted to attack France because the original plans had been captured by the allies.<br><br>The primary difference between the Germans and their opponents early in the war was that they used added improved radio technology to their already existing system of decentralized command and control. At almost all levels they reacted and combined their forces quicker than their opponents. They had less tanks than the French, and the British (and latter the U.S.) were the only fully mechanized forces in the war. All the other combatants made significant use of horse drawn power. The big Achilles heal of the German methods was that they could drive about 300km before their offensives ran out of supplies and had to regroup. That was sufficient in Western Europe, but caused serious problems in Eastern Europe and North Africa.<br><br>The Japanese were using the German WW1 operational methods but with naval and air forces used to greatly increase its reach and mobility. They did extremely well in the early island campaigns, but their record in the big bruising battles on the mainland were more mixed.<br><br>To further emphasis your point about oil. The Japanese essentially went to war because the American oil embargo (over their poor conduct in China) forced them to either attack or surrender. The Germans tried to get around some of their shortages by making synthetic (coal based) liquid fuels. However, as the war went on, they kept conquering, or acquiring as allies, countries who had even greater fuel problems than they did.<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c8009318081148869181 title="comment permalink">4/12/12, 6:36 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not normally a great fan of military history, mostly because much that I've read or seen has been too focused on the proverbial battles between Grant and Lee. While tactics and the personality of leadership are interesting, the strategy and thematic history are much more interesting to me. Thanks for a great summary of the transition from 19th to 20th century warfare.<br><br>Two things come to mind. First is Orwell's reference to Britain as an unsinkable aircraft carrier in 1984. That sounds like as blunt as any assessment of the role of Britain on the world stage post WWII.<br><br>Second is that the US is still behaving like it's fighting last century's wars with last century's technology. In Iraq, we invaded, occupied, declared something like "victory," and left behind an enormous military base (er, embassy), but retained very little control over that remnant of the British empire. I wonder what section(s) of the Pacific empire will be the first to go - the garrisons in Korea or Japan; the string of island-hopping bases; or the petroleum to make mobility between all of them for troops and material feasible.<br><br>Despite the military's experiments with biofuels, some of the brass clearly know that the game of "throw lots of oil at the battlefield and we win" is over. Whether there's a fundamental rethink of US military strategy or not, the current mode of power projection is definitely on life support in the age of extreme oil.<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c5581067748641541055 title="comment permalink">4/12/12, 7:38 AM</a><br><br>

Also, India was the largest of Britain's colonies to be lost just after the war, but I don't really see that India was "under the overall control of the new imperial power" in the postwar era.<br><br>If the US had "overall control" of India (just using India as an example to test your hypothesis, since it was Britain's biggest colony and only gained independence after WWII), we (I'm American) didn't do very much to "Americanize" its economy, which was a textbook case of central planning, state intervention, and protectionism for decades after the war. Maybe more importantly and realistically, in a political sense India set its own policies and made many decisions contrary to US interests in the postwar era.<br><br>Both words in the phrase "overall control" are pretty ironclad in their intent, and I don't see them applying to US-India relations in the postwar era.

And it was certainly supported by the tank army commanders such as Guderian and Rommel, who actually executed the strike to the Channel while repeatedly being told to slow down by their higher-ups. With respect to the latter, JMG is on target in referring to a cadre of 'young German officers' with new ideas.<br><br>Perhaps you are thinking rather of the Battle of the Bulge. That effort to copy the success of 1940, in 1944, was certainly only believed in by Hitler himself, by that time more delusional than ever. Of relevance to JMGs overall point, that offensive failed in no small part due to the Nazi's inability to capture Allied tank fuel supplies.<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c3086286437397110281 title="comment permalink">4/12/12, 10:50 AM</a><br><br>

Thinking similarly here as the Harper Government postures and brags (and shucks and jives and shuffles and lies) about its proposed shiny new fighter jets. Not all Canadians, by a long shot, are keen on handing over this much of our common wealth to Lockheed-Martin. [Headlines referencing the sordid ongoing scandal can easily be googled, if you have a strong stomach and spare time; I'd love to think it might bring down the Harper regime, but kinda doubt it. The "Conservatives" (a wild-eyed bunch of neocon radicals) seem to have got the bit in their teeth for the moment.]<br><br>Canada is surely the most obvious of the ex-colonies of the UK that the US has taken over: the power to the south now commandeers our natural gas and water and dictates much of our policy, just as the UK once commandeered our salmon and furs and ruled us from London... We are now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Empire, which makes me wonder what will happen when that empire starts to crumble. Independence? or annexation by some rising power?<br><br>There's a line of thought -- somewhat convincing to me -- that defunct empires are among the more pleasant places to live: after a nation "gets over it" and stops hankering for that delusional, grandiose role as King of the World and cock of the walk and top of the dogpile, everyone can relax and enjoy spending some of the hoarded imperial wealth more slowly, on things like good food and music and art appreciation. <br><br>It was only after the imperial fall that the UK became known for, of all things, nice pop music and a wry comic sensibility; seems like Belgium is way better at chocolate (an imperial aftertaste itself) than it was at imperial power; the multicultural goulash of old ex-Imperial capitals can be more interesting, cosmopolitan, and enjoyable than the tense, militaristic, swaggering atmosphere of the "glory years" at the top. Maybe the US after its own imperial fall will relax a bit and rediscover some of its more lovable qualities, get over this whole storm-trooper, drama-queen, paranoid tantrum stage.<br><br>If so, it'll probably take longer than my remaining lifespan to happen, so I'm not holding my breath :-)<br><br>Frankly, it's hard to see much good coming down the pike -- despite my brief attack of optimism above. I was reading some old Stephen King stories last night and realising that he doesn't scare me, not at all.

That is, from the non-Western perspective, once a territory had been conquered by Westerners it would almost without exception stay within Western control, at most passing from one empire to another or gaining nominal "independence", with little real effect on the natives' daily lives.<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c280942344164146561 title="comment permalink">4/12/12, 2:22 PM</a><br><br>

Granted, on an operational and tactical level there was more variation, and by and large a great deal more competence as well; the British Empire's armies in the First World War, in particular, combined extraordinary courage and ability in the field with almost unbelievable incompetence back at headquarters. <br><br>Col. Mustard, I hadn't realized that the drawdown had proceeded that far -- the most recent figures I had were from most of a decade ago. Still, it figures; as the US goes bankrupt, closing down foreign garrisons is one way to cut costs. <br><br>Jason, thanks for the recollections!<br><br>Surfer, sure, and you could also use the Muslim calendar, or the French revolutionary calendar, or any other calendar you care to name. Unless there's specific evidence that Nostradamus used the elaborate construction Ovason's built on top of Trithemius' work, it's the same sort of thing Harold Camping used to explain away the fact that the Rapture didn't come on schedule. <br><br>Christine, fascinating.

Good to hear of the physical culture people -- though I have a certain fondness for weights. <br><br>Cherokee, no argument there -- we have a quince tree, planted last spring and enthusiastically in leaf just now. As for tomatoes, drying works well -- if you have a solar or electric dehydrator, they dry well and make a great addition to soups and stews in the winter. <br><br>Phil, it's not the same these days. We're moving into the endgame of the American empire, and the first foreshocks of the next round of major wars are starting to be felt. <br><br>Thijs, nah, Erich von Manheim and a circle of junior officers crafted the 1940 plan and got Hitler to back it, against the judgment of the senior members of the general staff. As for the Dutch empire, bingo; your tax money is going to prop up my government, with the JSF as one more conduit. <br><br>Rashakor, how energy-intensive military technologies will deal with an energy-constrained future is one of the massive questions of our time; quite a few militaries are working on it, but biodiesel jet fuel strikes me as exactly the sort of change in technology without a corresponding change in thinking that landed Britain in so much trouble. <br><br>Bruce, on the other hand, since the quatrain is vague enough that you could find something fitting it in any five year period since the fall of Rome, maybe he was just wrong. <br><br>Dandelion, thank you!<br><br>Russell, the term "blitzkrieg" is useful though inexact; I'll be explaining things in more detail as we get into the military dimension of the decline of the American empire. As for the Germans not using it, er, Erich von Manstein's memoirs (which I happen to be reading) reference the term as one in common use after the defeat of Poland, so I'm not sure you're quite accurate there. <br><br>DaShui, we'll be discussing guerrilla warfare in the not too distant future, too. There's a lot more to the US inability to deal with it than any legacy from Sherman's day!<br><br>William, you could as well call Woodrow Wilson the King of Terror, since he launched America into the First World War and also presided over a Red Scare that saw nationwide, utterly unconstitutional mass arrests of political dissidents. As I suggested above, choose any five year period starting with the fall of Rome and you can find a way to make that Nostradamus quatrain agree with it. <br><br>Mike, that's right -- wasn't that where they sent British officers during the Boer War who had done so badly they needed to be kept out of the way? <br><br>Steve, exactly. You get today's gold star. The US is still trying to fight the Second World War with ever more elaborate variations on Second World War technology. (The V-1 was a drone, after all.)

The parents of the day will remember how they used to be able to fly from here to there for peanuts but the youth of the day will see their memories as quaint. The year 2100 may look a lot like 1900 with a whacky deregulated ways and means. Steam powered cars, solar cars, horse drawn cars, rickshaws and the like will be all valid and a part of the dissensus style of getting by and innovating while you’re at it. 2150 may look more like 1850 with disease and sanitation and politics all resembling their earlier counterparts affects on people in general., and so on and so forth until we reach the point humans have evolved away. <br><br>Of course it won’t be an exact reflection due to the awesome alloys and ideas that have come from this abundance, not to mention the awesome poisons and pollutants. But nevertheless the yaer 2200 is looking very 1800 to me.<br><br>The effect won’t be that noticeable in many parts of the world, as they never got to suck on the candy stick that is fossil fuel energy in any way close to the selfish tongue out methods of those parts of the world that have. For instance, I’ve been to parts of china where the streets are filled with all sorts of machines and wheeled beings all doing some type of job or another but not being homogenised into “car” or “truck”. Sure they will lose their fuel, but they just haven’t had it long enough to have created to cultural memory loss that has occurred in developed ‘I-World’.<br><br>The reason I mentioned this is because these factors are going to play a role in the years to come and the conflicts that will inevitably rear their heads. Also I don’t have a name for this theory and thought it might be up your alley to coin one.<br><br>Cherokee Organics, don’t know how the weather is where you are at the moment, but all I can say is sundry. I’ve been doin it fairly regularly and all I use is an old bed frame with a fairly rigid screen across it, all courtesy of the local verge-side chuck-outs. But I’ve used screen doors before, though I recommend reinforcing them to stop drooping. In good sunny days even in cool weather, cherry tomatoes are done in 2-3 days, larger tomatoes cut in quarters may take five. A friend has converted an old double glazed double door commercial fridge into a dryer with an adjustable airflow that he reckons will dry steak tomatoes cut in half very quicky. I use olive oil only to store them after, but I think you can add vinegar and salt but have never tried it personally. If you totally dry them they can be rehydrated later to make excellent tomato paste. This I’ve tried though mostly I semi sundry and gorge myself on this wicked tasty treat.<br><br>Dandelionlady, ditto!<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c6329779073256131636 title="comment permalink">4/12/12, 7:10 PM</a><br><br>

I'm suggesting an alternative that points out features of it that the standard way ignores. <br><br>Wistful, you might want to look up the size of the war debt Britain ended up owing to the US, and how long it took to pay it all off. It's a remarkable story. As for the status of specific colonies, such as India, that's something we'll be covering next week, because the US had a different agenda than Britain's -- and of course there was the other major empire that came out of the Gasoline War, too. More on this soon. <br><br>Escape, the specific excuses varied; the British public was more amenable to the idea that the Empire would bring the blessings of Christianity and good government to the benighted natives. There was always quite a bit of that, and it became increasingly loud as the empire circled the drain. <br><br>Peter, sure, and given that sort of ingenuity you can doubtless also prove that Nostradamus predicted that Elvis shot JFK. That is to say, er, give me a break. <br><br>Richard, good. You get the point. <br><br>Dltrammel, glad to hear that's going well!<br><br>DeAnander, Harper et al. are already making arrangements to sell Canadian tar sand extracts to your next imperial overlord; they're ahead of the game, which is impressive in a certain sense. <br><br>Bill, I'm going there. Good to see others paying attention to that far from minor point. <br><br>Jess, excellent! How long it will take for China to get bases on the eastern shores of the Pacific is a good question; right now they're busy following Mahan's advice to the letter along the shores of the Indian ocean. As for the oldest and closest US subject nations, that would be Latin America, where US power has been on the wane for decades. More on this as we go. <br><br>Oskar, yes, on the whole those are both good generalizations. Still, China's one exception to your rule about nonwestern nations, and there will be others. The sunset of the West is well under way. <br><br>Xmhko, that's actually the theory I've been proposing for years now: say, 300 years up, and 300 years back down. It's so foreign to the core assumptions of our time that very few people can get their minds around it, which is why it's hard to name. Still, that's my best guess; the fall of the American empire is simply one speed bump on that much longer arc.<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c712049644310575261 title="comment permalink">4/12/12, 8:17 PM</a><br><br>

As an outsider, and I could be wrong, it always appeared to me that the US pursued a relationship with Pakistan rather than India. Certainly more US propping up money (err, sorry, aid money) goes to Pakistan. I never quite understood this as I thought that India would be a better fit culturally, but there is usually more to these things than meets the eye.<br><br>Incidentally, India flexed its muscles with us recently and well and truly did us over. India, I believe, but may be wrong, is now purchasing uranium from Australia, whilst also at the same time not being a signatory to the nuclear non proliferation treaty. <br><br>It may be coincedence, but at the same time there was also an Indian media beat up about the safety of Indian students on Australian soil which had the immediate impact of reducing Indian student numbers (ie. an export for Australia).<br><br>Australia is no innocent either.

There was a real attempt to evade the slaughter of the Western Front in WWI, and that was the strategy to open a second front against Turkey and Austria, which was why you had Gallipoli and Salonika. Also, there was a huge number of British troops sent to aid the Italians, but this is not well known nowadays.<br><br>Obviously this didn't work in the First World War, but a similar strategy was successful in the Second World War, when the British and American armies were preserved by fighting in the Mediterranean, so as to avoid a direct encounter in Northern Europe until as late as possible. This was primarily a British strategy, of course, as the Americans were not really aware of how mediocre their own army was.<br><br>The Germans may have been aware of the possibilites of the ICE, but their strategic understanding of the importance of oil was non-existent. A single sweep into the Caspian, followed by a thrust into British Iran and Iraq, would have taken out all their enemies in one fell swoop. But they thought Leningrad and Moscow and Stalingrad were more important.<br><br>Finally, I don't think that the U.S. conquered Britain so much as induced a strange psychological dependance. The French saw through this very quickly and understood that the Americans had no real power to act punitively against their allies (they were appalled that the British took U.S. threats regarding Suez seriously, for example, and this formed the kernal of their opposition to the UK joining the EU).<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c7682759160772237915 title="comment permalink">4/13/12, 3:47 AM</a><br><br>

Here's a more detailed and updated model:<br><br>First, let's treat all the expanding Western empires as one single empire based on the same model of control, same general motives, a fairly unified economy and unified technological progress. <br>It has various competing power centers manifested in cities, aristocratic families and a class of entrepreneurs. Although those power centers may use military force in their competition, there is considerable interaction and cultural unity at the upper levels of power within the mega-empire.<br><br>The empire has no real competitors that function anything like it - it is the first global empire in human history. It expands rapidly and by the start of the 20th century, there is little left of the world to conquer. The competition between the power centers stiffens and they increasingly rally their local populations by emphasising their uniqueness. Hatred builds and the empire's heartland is plunged into a devastating civil war.<br><br>Now the first notable doctrine of rebellion against the empire takes hold, Communism. It takes over one of the power centers and seeks to spread from there. Also, a non-Western culture, Japan, has successfully copied the empire's strategies and set out with its own ambitions of global empire. The empire is torn by its civil war and facing competition for the first time.<br><br>To make matters worse, a second and even more devastating round of civil war breaks out, this time involving the rebels and the non-Western upstart as well. When the dust settles, the empire's original heartland (Europe) is in ruins, but Japan is defeated and assimilated. The Communist rebels however, emerge stronger than ever and their rebellion has now spread to a major Asian culture, China.<br><br>At this point the empire needs unity more than ever and its newest and greatest power center, the US, brings the whole of it together under its leadership, vowing a crusade against the Communist rebellion.<br><br>However, the colonial subjects are so disaffected and drained after centuries of exploitation that the rebellion spreads somewhat easily. Another major Asian culture, India, breaks away on its own and develops a diplomatic middle-ground between the empire and the rebels. New rebellious doctrines also pop up, such as radical Islam.<br><br>When rebel Russia is finally brought to its knees, along with many of its allies, the empire is quick to announce total victory and the onset of eternal peace and prosperity under its benevolent guidance. But it soon becomes apparent that the sun is setting on the Western empire and its glory days of total domination are fading. Other non-Western powers and even some of its older colonies are catching up with it and clearly do not intend to play by its rules in the long term.<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c1501209887743966048 title="comment permalink">4/13/12, 4:45 AM</a><br><br>

Some of the commenters above have mentioned energy considerations, EROI in particular.<br><br>Here's a hypothesis, based on the notion of the "energy cliff". <a href=http://resourceinsights.blogspot.com/2008/09/net-energy-cliff.html rel=nofollow>This article</a> by Kurt Cobb sets it out well. The essence here is that as EROI declines, the availability of energy for society declines non-linearly.<br><br>Hypothesis: there won't be a "next empire", in the sense of a global "replacement" for the US. This is based on the following assumptions (note that I'm not asserting these, although they seem plausible to me):<br><br>First is that the world in aggregate is near the energy cliff, and so is the US (in terms of the energy sources available to it).<br>Next, that no major nation is far enough from the cliff to be able to "take over" from the US. <br>Also, that the world in total, and the potential candidates for imperial power in particular, are moving toward the cliff.<br>Also, that the global economy is critically dependent on a relatively high EROI -- in fact, it may falter at a significantly higher ratio than the 5:1 that Hall proposes. (A stable society may be able to survive at 5:1, but the current global economy is inherently unstable.)<br><br>Finally, I note that one aspect of Howard Odum's "pulsing" model (which I referenced in a comment to an earlier post) is that the consumption (decline) phase proceeds considerably more rapidly than the accumulation (growth) phase. If this model is applicable here, we're probably accelerating toward the cliff.<br><br>There may well be "local empires", however. China looks like a rising imperial power, as has been discussed here (although India and Russia may make Asia a more complex situation). For large contenders for local imperial powers, however, the energy cliff still looms. For example, will China be able to keep its EROI on its currently available resources above the critial level for long enough to gain cheap access to other relatively high-EROI sources?<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c7132320968595941357 title="comment permalink">4/13/12, 11:17 AM</a><br><br>

I think we should be careful not to be too tempted by the attractions of symmetry; the past trajectory on one hand and the future on the other. <br>Three points come to my mind regarding industrialisation and ‘techno-progress’ (with a small p).<br>Firstly it has many unique features that could be a-historical.<br>Secondly, most people have felt its effects, but only a minority in any real sense participate. I would be very surprised if it was as much as half, world-wide. You can glimpse that from the different per capita use of fossil fuel round the world, let alone access to the stuff by the poor majorities in poor countries.<br>Thirdly, it seems a moot point at the moment whether industrialisation can survive unless it continues to grow, let alone retracts. A serious war with serious interruptions to economic growth mechanisms and complex trade systems must have instant and probably instantly irreversible major effects. This is definitely not WWII era. The catastrophe in Europe in those days was extreme in places, but the systems were relatively resilient compared with anything we have now. I was around during WWII and after, but I simply cannot imagine the effects of ‘total war’ in for example the current Europe. (I do not have to imagine what it is like in non-industrial mostly subsistence rural poor countries – plenty of examples.)<br>We might be close to the high tide of industrialisation, but the future down slope looks to me anything but predictable.

It's about the fall of the Soviet Empire, which I remember well, being in my early 30s at the time. Since the U.

Eastern Europe fell without a shot fired or a life lost in 1989. I could think of a lot worse ways to lose what's left of our empire. I fear this too is unlikely, because we seem so primed to drop bombs anytime the power structure perceives a threat to itself. Certainly the language directed toward various South American countries who wish to choose their own course is not encouraging in this regard. OTOH, so far it's been just talk, and it looks to me like we don't have the people, material, or high EROEI energy source needed for a war against one or more of them.

Unless the loss of knowledge in the next century or so is so drastic that the knowledge necessary to build a large sailing vessel goes away, I think it's far more likely that the US empire will be replaced by other empires, even on the far side of an "energy cliff." (Mind you, I find the energy cliff argument rather dubious, but that's a topic for another time.) <br><br>Phil, that's one of the reasons that I've argued that the form of industrialism we know -- which I've called "abundance industrialism" -- is already breaking down and being replaced by a new mode, "scarcity industrialism," geared toward the realities of life in a declining economy. I don't see it as a permanent phenomenon, simply as a transitional one, but even so it will likely outlive everyone reading this comment. <br><br>Russell, every autobiography ought to count as a dubious source; if I ever write one, I hope nobody will read it uncritically! I gather you haven't read Manstein's memoirs, because he didn't claim to be practicing a novel kind of warfare, as you suggest; he simply mentioned that after the Polish campaign, in which he was merely the chief of staff of one of the army groups, the phrase "blitzkrieg" came into vogue as a descriptive term. His analysis of the Polish campaign, btw, also puts a great deal of focus on the Polish mistakes that made a German victory much easier and quicker than it would otherwise have been.<br><br>Diane, good to hear. Down the road a bit I'll be recommending that readers in the US pick up a specific book from the pre-WW2 era and read it, so you're ahead of the curve. <br><br>Panskeptic, yes, that was a useful straw in the wind -- not that anybody was paying attention. <br><br>Sophie, thanks for the suggestion!<br><br>SLClaire, if you'd have suggested any time before 1989 that the Soviet Union would implode without civil war and the risk of a nuclear conflagration, most serious people would have dismissed the idea without a second thought.

As a consequence when WW1 started it was Britain which had to field the smaller army, and was never in a position to overwhelm the Germans with shear numbers. <br><br>Britain's generalship was very mediocre in the first world war, however, unlike colonial campaigns there was no prospect of do-overs if they lost, so you can understand there reticence for changing generals (at least he's not losing). <br><br>Also were the British generals worse than any others the French and Russian armies mutinied, the Germans logistics at the beginning were a total shambles which may ultimately have cost them the war, the Americans refused to take any instruction on how to avoid casualties, The Turks and Austrians barely put up a fight unless it was home territory being attacked. In short no one knew what they were doing. The failure was higher than that, it was with the governments/kings which muddled themselves into a war which served no ones interest, and then refused to back out.(with the exception of the Americans and the Japanese the two empires which could safely watch at a distance)<br><br>My history's a bit rusty but I thought it was the British expeditionary force which bought the German army to a halt in northern France and Belgium, not the French. <br><br>The failure to suppress the Irish and Russian rebellions was in part money but I believe there were other factors a general war weariness and a public belief that certain ways of conducting war were unacceptable (after they'd been tried in South Africa successfully).<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c6315397973624247855 title="comment permalink">4/14/12, 4:52 PM</a><br><br>

For examples of the differences, note how easily Africa and Asia were taken over by European powers, and who's in charge there today compared to who's in charge in the Americas. Within the Americas, note the demographic and political differences between the temperate areas and the tropical ones. Europeans have difficulty holding the tropics, the disease factor works against us more than for us.<br><br>Our current wars have been a benefit to Latin America and an injury to our empire. Our military is tied up in Asia, and is doing so badly that nations such as Bolivia perceive us as a paper tiger and act independently and in their own national interests.

Which regarding; it makes sense they are setting up Indian Ocean bases. They've been buying farm land in E. Africa; it's a lot cheaper than in the U.S. and the Indian Ocean is smaller and has more base opportunities than the Pacific.

China's MO seems to be somewhat more of a direct trade -- they provide new infrastructure (roads, power lines, etc) in exchange for the natural resources.

Spain's naval technology was the beneficiary of an incrementally building capability for ocean navigation and warfare, which had been growing for a long time. In our situation, most of the technologies that an aspiring imperial power has been relying on for most of its development in the last century or so will be increasingly inapplicable.<br><br>For a particular example, it won't be easy or quick to replace a current fleet of naval vessels with one based on renewables, both for energy and building materials -- the know-how to build them won't be widely available, nor the knowledge needed to sail them in various kinds of weather. (And even the acknowledgment that such a change is necessary won't come easily.) Also, this will have to be done during a time of economic, political, environmental, and energy volatility and instability.<br><br>Of course, by Mister Trey's time, this will all have been sorted out, and the appropriate technologies resurrected or re-invented, but that doesn't help the would-be "masters of the universe" now.<br><br>Re the energy cliff: I'd be interested in a good critique of the model. Here's a more detailed exposition of it: http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/energy-futurist/what-eroi-tells-us-about-roi/361 I think the core quote is "When EROI remains above 10, the relationship between prices and EROI is fairly linear and steady. But when EROI falls below 10, it can force prices to increase at a dramatic and nonlinear rate, to much higher absolute levels".<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c578084325373768292 title="comment permalink">4/15/12, 3:40 PM</a><br><br>

It's likely that even in the post-industrial world, some global trade of the most valuable and transportable goods (spices, tea, coffee, cocoa, gems, etc) will remain. Some of those trade routes will be lucrative enough to support far-flung trading empires similar to 16th c. Portugal.<br><br>Even so I wouldn't dismiss the New World phenomenon too easily. The demographic disaster that happened in the Americas could be seen as an exceptionally large "disturbance", to borrow a term from ecology. Arguably that disturbance event, together with the easy access to African slave labor for use in the new territories, was an enormous catalyst to European overseas expansion and eventual jump to global industrial empire.

I presume the same would be true of metal hulled sailing ships that are trimmed by human labor rather than mechanisms. Most of the world's navies require their cadets to spend a little time operating large sailing ships (though the practice of scrubbing the deck with holystones has been abolished by the US Naval Academy since my father's day--wears out the wooden deck quickly and good wood is expensive).

The quality of lumber available today is generally very poor (sometimes startlingly so, if your memory goes back more than say 20 years and you can recall buying *real* wood for projects), and ship-building timber is increasingly scarce and rare (and costly). Dmitry Orlov speculates that ferro-cement will become the ship building method of choice in a resource-scarce future, because the materials for making cement are still fairly plentiful and scrap steel for armature can be reclaimed from many building sites, cars, etc. Durable sail cloth is another matter; Dacron will be pretty expensive or unobtainable in a post-peak future, so I would guess hemp would be the fibre of choice.<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c1996735111806848214 title="comment permalink">4/15/12, 9:54 PM</a><br><br>

I was buying lumber from old-fashioned lumber-yards for my own projects when I was a teen in the '50s. No comparison!<br><br>There are large old trees here in New England, but there are few of them, and most seem to be isolated trees growing on privately-owned small plots of land.<br><br>As for the skills, here and there on the East Coast there are places that are trying to keep the old skills alive that one needs to build and sail a large wooden ship. I think there is even a operating rope-walk somewhere, possibly in Mystic (Connecticut). The skills are not wholly lost, even now. <br><br>Even the US Navy has to keep some of these skills alive, I dare say, to maintain and operate the USS Constitution in Boston Harbor. That ancient ship can still make its way under sail, at least in the Harbor. I have seen it do so, and the sight brought tears to my eyes.<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c4538629313396222720 title="comment permalink">4/16/12, 8:41 AM</a><br><br>

No, it's not as good as what was available when I was young (30 years ago). But there's enough here on the West coast. We're still building and repairing wooden ships and boats here. At least half our fishing fleet is still wood, and it's more economical to repair them then replace with steel. And we have quite a few schooners and a couple of reproduction square riggers (Hawaiian Chieften, Lady Washington). Several of my neighbors still navigate with sextant, log and lead. The knowledge, infrastructure and skills needed are mostly available. It's cordage and cloth that will be the hardest to replace. Before the fossil fuel age, sails were half the cost of a ship and only lasted a few years. Cordage wasn't quite that expensive but might need to be replaced after only one to four years, depending on conditions.<br><br>Now limits in the future, say 100 years down the road. We can build steel sailors in the age of salvage. After that? Even the big wooden 'Down Easters' depended on a fossil fuel industrial technology for their construction and materials. I'd look at 1800 for the largest possible ships without fossil fuel input. Look at the goods traded in that period, and what empires looked like for political patterns. And I do think the difference in disease pools and technological knowledge then compared to now will make a huge difference. In that respect the world is a bit more of a level field now than it was in the past. This may change, but it will take considerable time.<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c8428852476930260826 title="comment permalink">4/16/12, 11:40 AM</a><br><br>

I suspect Dmitry's right, and the next Age of Sail will be ferro-cement-hulled. oh well. there's probably enough good-enough wood left to make small oar/sail craft for quotidian use in coastal communities; you'd be amazed at the distances people used to *row* in BC before motors and boats were introduced to one another!<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c2482286724079666967 title="comment permalink">4/16/12, 1:13 PM</a><br><br>

Which is more important, the size of the wood or the tightness of the grain?<br><br> New England has greater forest cover than it had one hundred years ago, when large portions of the aboriginal forest had been cleared for small farms. It's a different forest now with a different mix of trees.<br><br> There's still a fair amount of standing timber in virgin forests west of the Rockies, on Forest Service lands. A great deal has been lost to clear cutting and beetle infestation due to drought, but some remains. It's mostly conifers, though.<br><br> Coast redwoods grow really, really fast. I've been attending a camp in a second growth redwood forest that was logged in the aftermath of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. A large open meadow that was sunny most of the day in 1989 is now almost entirely shaded by trees that are at least sixty feet tall. Stargazing is no longer possible on most of that land. <br><br>Fast growing trees generally have a coarse grain which makes them softer than old, slow-growing hardwood trees.<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c1804795084935570089 title="comment permalink">4/16/12, 2:59 PM</a><br><br>

They made reference to the ‘Hister’ is ‘Hitler’ non sequitur. I’m sure you’ve heard the logic that allows one to turn Hister into Hitler. It involves applying heuristic rules of prophecy; one letter can be substituted for another and two letters can be reversed. The ‘s’ becomes ‘l’ and the ‘st’ becomes ‘tl.’ What I realized was that two out of six letters were changed. That’s 30 percent. 30 percent of the word was changed in order to find a match with something suggestive of a current historical person or event. In reality, they only have 60 percent in common. By this logic, you can take any word in any encyclopedia and expect that 30 percent of the other entries can be potentially decoded from this word.

The Portuguese had to circumvent the whole African continent just to reach the Indian Ocean!<br><br>The Islamic empire is a fascinating one though. The Middle East has the geographic advantage of being able to act as a commercial (and cultural) nexus tying together the Mediterranean, the Sahel (West Africa), the East African coast, Central Asia and the Indian Ocean. It is no wonder that commerce is so prominent in Middle Eastern history or that Islam spread so fast and widely on the back of all those trade routes.<br><br>@Deborah Bender,<br><br>I didn't at all mean that in the future we'd be too nice to exploit slave labor the way the Europeans did. However just because you <i>may</i>, does not always mean that you <i>can</i>. In other words, easy access to a large pool of slave labor is a condition that does regularly come up in various times and places but it can not be taken for granted. <br><br>European explorers unknowingly caused epidemics which depopulated two entire continents and by coincidence, they happened to have a third continent nearby with an enormous pool of disease-resistant slave labor for the taking. Without the labor to run plantation colonies, the gain from the colonial enterprise would not have been as great. That might have slowed down European expansion enough to let some of the American cultures recover properly from the societal breakdown, which again might have slowed European expansion even further.<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c8239602639138345888 title="comment permalink">4/17/12, 10:41 AM</a><br><br>

Castus got the first one.<br>I think it's unfair to single out the military as a place to 'park' incompetent sons. Some younger sons were quite brilliant, but they had to go somewhere respectable when they couldn't inherit a title. But the Peter Principle is not limited to the military, and all large organizations suffer from it. Most of the time, it doesn't get recorded in history books as no one dies as a result.<br>It was not the military, but public opinion and the leadership in London that never really learned the lessons it needed to.<br><br>While it's true to say every army is always preparing for the last war (the first action between British and Germans in 1914 was a mounted cavalry skirmish at Casteau), note few people in any walk of life can readily adapt to, or predict the effects of, technological changes. See the same confusion today with traditional newspapers struggling to get a handle on the internet. Every war since 1800 had new technology that required change: the minie ball, machine guns, breech-loading gun &amp; rifles, aircraft, tanks, bombers, &amp;c. The U.S. army is superbly trained for a main-force battle 1945-style between opposing field armies, as in Kuwait, yet utterly unable to suppress insurgencies from Saigon to Baghdad.<br>The Western front stalemate was inevitable, due to the technology. The 1914 race to the sea unfolded exactly like Grant's Richmond campaign: both sides dug rifle pits and trenches, the Union moved to flank them, the Confederates dug new trenches, &amp;c. In the 1960s it was very fashionable to blame "bloodthirsty incompetents" for trench warfare, but no serious critic has demonstrated any other possible outcome. Air power made WWII fluid.<br><br><a href=america-gasoline-war.html#c4895022042777375660 title="comment permalink">4/17/12, 2:33 PM</a><br><br>
