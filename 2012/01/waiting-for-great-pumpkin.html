With the coming of the new year, predictions of what’s in store during the next twelve months are showing up here and there in the peak oil blogosphere: a feature of the season, really, as reliable as the icicles that hang from the roof’s edge outside the window of my study. Like the icicles, they’re enticing to look at; like the icicles, equally, a great many of them are guaranteed to drop to the ground and shatter at some point in the months to come.<br><br>That’s all the more remarkable in that, by and large, the peak oil community has been pretty much spot on when it comes to the general shape of the future. Five or ten years ago, it bears remembering, nobody else was predicting the sustained oil prices on the far side of $100 a barrel and the global economic gridlock that have become fixtures of the contemporary scene; the peak oil scene had that one nailed. A healthy skepticism toward whatever the current speculative bubble happens to be—tech stocks back in the days when the peak oil blogosphere was first getting under way, real estate in the runup to the 2008 crash, shale gas and shale oil now—has also been a common feature in the peak oil scene throughout its history, even when almost everyone else was cheering along the bubble du jour as the wave of the future.<br><br>Why, then, all the annual predictions that misfire—and in particular, why the <i>same</i> annual predictions that have misfired for years in a row? Why, for example, the relentless annual round of claims that the coming year will finally see a sudden and total economic collapse? That one’s been made time and again, often by the same bloggers, and the fact that each year goes by without anything of the kind happening somehow never manages to affect the next year’s confident insistence that this time around the wolves really, truly are about to eat all the sheep. It would be funny, really, except that pointing out the long string of failed predictions has become a standard rhetorical trick in the arsenal of those—either madmen or economists, to use Kenneth Boulding’s useful taxonomy—who want to insist on the possibility of limitless growth on a finite planet.<br><br>Now of course it’s only fair to point out that there are at least as many predictions on the other side of the picture that are still being recycled this year after an equivalent track record of failures. Hope springs eternal—or rather, as I suggested in last week’s post, the facile optimism of the privileged that masquerades as hope in too much of contemporary culture springs infernal—in the minds of the many bloggers who expect some shiny new technological gimmick to overturn the laws of thermodynamics and give us a glossy new future straight out of <i>The Jetsons</i>. The technological savior du jour, to be sure, changes even faster than the bubble du jour; we’ve seen ethanol, big wind turbines, and now shale gas touted as game-changing developments; neither ethanol nor wind turbines changed much of anything, of course, but when shale gas lands in the same category—as it will—there will be another candidate for the role <br><br>For that matter, those who insist that petroleum can’t run out because we want it so badly have had just as dubious a record, if not more so. I’ve reminded my readers several times already about Daniel Yergin’s 2004 prediction that new petroleum discoveries would keep the price of crude oil at a plateau of $38 a barrel, and he’s far from the only pundit who’s made claims that absurd and still had the media fawning at his feet. More generally, have you noticed that every couple of years, we get to hear some new claim that a vast new oil discovery somewhere is about to solve the world’s energy troubles? They’re as regular as clockwork or, these days, as speculative bubbles; the actual results, once the hype gives way to the business end of a drilling bit, range from modest to none at all; still, none of that slows down the missionaries of the religion of limitless petroleum.<br><br>It’s all uncomfortably reminiscent of the <i>Peanuts</i> character Linus, with his enduring faith that this year, despite all previous disconfirmations, the Great Pumpkin really will show up with candy for all on Halloween. Still, as I look back over the last dozen years or so, I notice a feature common to the predictions I’m discussing that Linus’ lonely vigil in the pumpkin patch doesn’t share. Is it just me, or do my readers also catch the note of increasing desperation in a good many of the latest round of familiar predictions?<br><br>On the cornucopian side of the picture, certainly, that note is hard to miss. One measure of this is the extent to which the most remarkable evasions of fact have been finding their way into the media of late when the subject of US energy production comes up. The example I’m thinking of just now is the claim, recycled by any number of supposedly serious pundits in the last few months, that the United States has become a net exporter of petroleum. As it happens this is—well, let’s be polite and call it an inaccuracy; a less courteous though arguably more accurate phrase would be "bald-faced lie." The US last year imported around two-thirds of the crude oil it used, just as it did the year before, and exported very little crude oil. Follow the footnotes, though, and they lead in interesting directions.<br><br>What has happened over the last few years, in fact, is that the US has become a net exporter of refined petroleum products. For many years before then, along with the vast floods of crude oil shipped in from abroad to feed domestic refineries, the United States imported a modest amount of petroleum products that had been refined overseas, and shipped a smaller amount of its own refineries’ products to other countries. As the current depression has tightened its grip on the country, though, consumption of gasoline and other petroleum products has dropped by more than ten per cent, and US refineries have found it profitable to sell more of their products overseas as the domestic market contracted. The total shift is not that large, and since what’s driving it is the ongoing contraction of the US economy, it might be better treated as a warning sign than a reason for fatuous misstatements.<br><br>Still, beyond the misinformation and disinformation, fatuous and otherwise, there’s a common thread running through all the various predictions I’m discussing here, and it’s a thread worth tracing. All of them—the claims that a crash is imminent, or that a technological breakthrough is imminent, or that an abundant new source of fossil fuels is imminent, or what have you—are at bottom claims that the troubled situation in which the industrial world currently finds itself can’t continue in anything like its present form. I’d like to offer instead the counterintuitive suggestion that it can, and most likely will.<br><br>What that would mean in practice can best be judged by thinking back a year or two, to the early days of 2011. The year that had just ended was a troubled time, with political turmoil, economic crises, a larger than usual number of natural disasters, and a pervasive (and in many cases quite accurate) sense on the part of many people that life was getting tougher and the solutions being offered by politicians weren’t solving much of anything. Once we got past the annual flurry of predictions about game-changing events of one kind or another, what actually happened? The game didn’t change at all. Instead, each of the difficulties I’ve just noted got a little worse. There was more political turmoil; the economic crises became somewhat more frequent and more severe; the number of natural disasters went up again—there were, as I recall, 32 weather-related disasters causing more than US$1 billion each in damages, which is a new record—and across the industrial world, people’s faith in their government’s capacity to do much of anything declined further.<br><br>That’s what happened in 2011. I’d like to suggest that when we take a backwards look in the early days of 2013, we will most likely see that that’s what happened in 2012, too: a slow worsening across a wide range of trends, punctuated by localized crises and regional disasters. I’d like to predict, in fact, that when we take that backward look, the US dollar and the Euro will both still exist and be accepted as legal tender, though the Eurozone may have shed a couple of countries who probably shouldn’t have joined it in the first place; that stock markets around the world will have had another volatile year, but will still be trading. Here in the US, whoever is unlucky enough to win the 2012 presidential election will be in the middle of an ordinary transition to a new term of office; the new Congress will be gearing up for another two years of partisan gridlock; gas stations will still have gas for sale and grocery stores will be stocked with groceries; and most Americans will be making the annual transition between coping with their New Year’s hangovers and failing to live up to their New Year’s resolutions, just as though it was any other year.<br><br>That is to say, nothing much will have changed, if by the word "change" you mean exclusively the kind of dramatic break with the existing pattern of things that so many people are predicting just now. From any other perspective, plenty will have changed. Official US statistics will no doubt insist that the unemployment rate has gone down—do you ever get the feeling that when the Soviet Union collapsed, the people who used to churn out all those preposterous propaganda claims for their government got hired by ours? I do—but the number of people out of work in the United States will likely set another all-time record; the number of people in severe economic trouble will have gone up another good-sized notch, and public health clinics will probably be seeing the first wave of malnutrition-caused illness in children. If you happen to have spent the year in one of the areas unfortunate enough to get hit by the hard edge of the increasingly unstable weather, you may have had to spend a week or two in an emergency shelter while the flood waters receded or the wreckage got hauled away, and you might even notice that less and less gets rebuilt every year.<br><br>Unless that happens, though, or unless you happen to pay close attention to the things that don’t usually make the evening news, you may well look back in the first days of 2013 and think that business as usual is still ongoing. You’d be right, too, so long as you recognize that there’s been a stealthy change in what business as usual now means. Until the peak of world conventional petroleum production arrived in 2005, by and large, business as usual meant the continuation of economic growth. Since then, by and large, it has meant the continuation of economic decline.<br><br>And the repeated predictions that the situation can’t go on? I’ve come to think that what motivates such predictions, and gives them their present popularity, is the growing sense of apprehension that it <i>can</i> go on—that the troubles currently pressing in on the industrial world could just keep on getting worse, day after day, year after year, for decades to come, following the same gradual curve that the industrial world followed in the days of its growth, but in reverse: descending into impoverishment and relocalization along some broad equivalent of the same bumpy course that brought the ascent to prosperity and global integration back in the day.<br><br>When you think about it—and in the back of their minds, I suspect, most people have thought about it—that’s really a terrifying prospect. What makes it most unnerving is that it’s not simply a matter of, say, having your standard of living ratchet down by five per cent every year, though there will be a fair amount of that. It’s far more a matter of never knowing when your number’s going to come up and land you out of work, out of money and out on the street, next to the others who landed there before you. How much of the popular sport of blaming the poor for their poverty, I wonder, and how much of the current pseudoconservative fad of insisting that the poor aren’t actually poor, comes from people who are desperately trying to convince themselves that their jobs are irreplaceable, their retirement funds secure, and the sudden dizzying fall into the ranks of the impoverished can’t possibly happen to them?<br><br>If the downward arc of business as usual in an age of decline is what we’re facing, though, that sort of tortured logic is a pretty fair guarantee of final failure. The only way out of the trap, as I’ve argued here rather more than once, is to accept a steep cut in your standard of living before it becomes necessary, as a deliberate choice, and to use the resources freed up by that choice to get rid of any debts you have, get settled in a location that has a fair chance of keeping a viable degree of community life going, and get the tools and learn the skills that you will need to manage a decent life in an age of spiraling decline. To those who cling to the idea that they can maintain their present lifestyles, admittedly, it’s hard to think of any advice less welcome, but the universe is in no way obligated to give us the future we want—even if what we want is a sudden blow that will spare us the harder experience of the Long Descent.<br><br>********************<br><span style=font-size:130%>End of the World of the Week #3</span><br><br>When it comes to comedy, timing is supposed to be everything. The same could be said about apocalyptic prophecy, except that nobody seems to be able to get it right. The example I have in mind just now is Sulpicius Severus, who was a close friend of St. Martin of Tours. In his biography of the saint, written not long after Martin’s death, Sulpicius mentioned that seven years previously the holy bishop had told him privately that the Antichrist had already been born, and would begin his unstoppable rise to world power as soon as he reached adulthood. "Ponder," wrote Sulpicius, "how close these coming fearful events are!"<br><br>You might think that a saint of Martin’s caliber—he was a major figure in the church of his time, and has been credited with an impressive roster of miracles both while he was alive and since his death—must have had a sufficiently clear hotline to the Almighty to get such an important detail right. Still, that’s not the way it turned out. St. Martin died around 400 CE, and Sulpicius’ biography seems to have been written not long thereafter. The Antichrist would have been able to buy his first beer, in other words, around 414 CE at the latest; some 1600 years later, the faithful are still waiting for him to man up and put in an appearance.<br><br>—story from <a href="http://www.vivaeditions.com/book_page.php?book_id=25">Apocalypse Not</a>

I actually just had a friend of a friend make this claim to me on Sunday and I must admit I was a bit flummoxed. I insisted it wasn't true and he insisted it was--"You really should look it up," I believe he said. I knew it couldn't be right for the simple fact that I know we burn more oil than we produce. Therefore, there's simply no way to be a net exporter. I tried to tell him this, but he seemed certain that China was being dastardly and buying up our gas, keeping prices unnecessarily high. After a bit of research, I found what you noted, that it was actually about refined fuels and that it has little to no bearing on anything of importance.<br><br>After reading your three peak oil books in reverse order of publication--as well as lots of reading of this blog, and now I'm reading Sharon Astyk's Depletion and Abundance--I eventually wrapped my head around the simple idea that we need to learn to be poor. Not that this is a new idea to me, but it was always wrapped up in so many other details and predictions related to our predicament. Once I managed to boil it down to that simple idea--and despite that you often state it in such plain terms, it still took time to clear out all the other clutter in my brain to fully grasp it--I began to better be able to plan my way forward.<br><br>The other thing I like about that simple idea is it's easier to explain to others (though that's often a lost cause, anyway.) But it's nice because other people can understand the idea, either because they've had a stretch of bad times themselves or because the idea of poverty is at least something our society recognizes, even if it has a lot of odd and messed up associations with it. Plus, poverty encompasses a whole lot of our issues: peak oil, yes, but also a dysfunctional economic and political system, increased climate disasters, and so on. And if you're talking with someone sane enough to embrace thrift, you can even work within simple moral values.<br><br>So that's the core of my project for this year: thrift and voluntary poverty. I'll be doing spot work for farms, hopefully work trade for rent, growing my own veggies, regularizing a series of homesteading activities, writing, studying, meditating and attempting to build some things out of salvaged materials. It won't all play out as planned, of course, but the core philosophy of continuing to learn how to be poor--something, thankfully, I've already started--will be there no matter what. I'm excited about it.<br><br>That's my prediction for the new year, as well. It's basically the same as yours: most all of us are going to become poorer. The farther you're ahead of that curve, the easier it'll be. Honestly, I think that's a really exciting challenge--one I find hope in, as a matter of fact. Here's to 2012: likely a harsh year that I'm hoping will prove one of my happier ones. I think it's a solid likelihood, but who knows? That's part of the excitement.<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c9125403205024277526 title="comment permalink">1/4/12, 4:26 PM</a><br><br>

I have to disagree with a certain point of yours, that is, that you believe that although life standards will continue to decrease and BAU continue(even if the definition of BAU changes radically) that there will not be a sudden collapse as forecasted by many doomers. Stress can be applied slowly to a beam, but after a certain buildup, the stress will be so great that it causes the object to snap violently and suddenly. Eventually, S#*^ will hit the fan, even if it occurs after years of incremental declines in living standards etc.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c4938590660677088941 title="comment permalink">1/4/12, 6:31 PM</a><br><br>

On the other hand, the gloom of many doomers seems to underestimate the human capacity to muddle along, even as the structures we rely on fall apart.

Perhaps in a way the now common annual prognostications of cataclysmic apocalypse serve somewhat the same purpose; their very diversity is self-lampooning. <br><br>Though the enormity and complexity of the global enterprise suggests a certain fragility, a vulnerability to the unanticipated, it also demonstrates serious momentum, or inertia, if you prefer. So while a rapid catastrophic collapse remains plausible, it seems rather unlikely. But for smaller parts of the enterprise the same is not so true. An additional failed state or two won't necessarily torpedo the world political and economic order, but it could certainly mean abrupt and unwelcome change for many who happen to live there. By the same token even the orderly contraction of capital enterprise, whether defined as private or public, can wreak havoc on lives dependent on the jobs eliminated.<br><br>Just as C.M.

It's a fun and tasty tradition, and supposedly it arose during the years after the War Between the States, when the South was devastated, and black-eyed peas or cow peas (a main ingredient of Hoppin' John, formerly thought to be fit mainly for cows) were just about the only meal to be had. Similarly to other societies that Mr. Greer has pointed out, the South survived what must have seemed like the end of the world (or the beginning of the world for the newly freed) and even went on to prosper and improve.<br><br>Mr. Greer, I think you hit the nail on the head again when you discussed the phenomena of blaming the poor for their situation. I've always marveled at that way of thinking, since my father's family experienced going from a comfortable, privileged existence to being university-educated sharecroppers in the 1930s. All it took was one bad decision - cosigning a loan. So I've always been more concerned with how society aids the poor than how it unencumbers the rich, since it's so much easier to fall downward than upwards. But I suspect you're right - blaming the poor for their lot is a way of convincing yourself that it can't happen to you. <br><br>On another topic, I just did something I haven't done in a while - read a whole book in 24 hours - Apocalypse Not. It proved to be a potent antidote to a bout of debilitating doomerism I was going through. It really did put some things in perspective for me, and allowed me to focus on adaptive behaviors. Thanks!<br><br>Speaking of adaptive behaviors, I'm thinking a good project for me this year would be to scour the used bookstores of the internet for classic engineering and mathematical texts, in support of building a private library. I did see the idea of a private library on your linked Cultural Conservers Foundation website, but I've seen the idea before - apparently, from what I've read in a Harper's article a few years ago, opposition Cubans have built their own private book collections that they lend out, in order to maintain the currency of ideas unpopular with the government there. <br><br>I'm an environmental engineer, kind of a cross between civil and chemical engineers, and I'd focus my library on texts that show how to design things without computers or calculators. Not that I think those tools will disappear overnight, but working things out on paper definitely leads to deeper understanding than relying on a computer model. Once you learn to read a pump curve chart, you can simultaneously see all the trade offs between pumping power, electricity consumption, efficiency, impeller size, and how much lift the pump can do on the suction side. A computer model just takes your input and spits out a model selection for you. And who knows, that body of knowledge which is slowly being discarded or digitized, those tables of functions and information-packed charts laboriously calculated decades ago might be useful one day.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c339987954611790347 title="comment permalink">1/4/12, 9:49 PM</a><br><br>

You do, obviously. It's a pretty natural conceit for anyone to assume everyone else pretty much kinda sorta thinks like they do, but it's not necessarily the case. I don't think most people are that reflective. They don't think things through. They're not anywhere near rational. In all honesty they generally don't need to be. You're not out of the mainstream because hardly anyone wants to hear what you have to say, you're out of the mainstream because hardly anyone really cares to think ahead as far as you do. Again, for all practical purposes, they don't really need to.<br><br>While you with a long-term outlook save up for a new greenhouse, some drug addict within walking distance from you is currently in their 6th ICU stay on the public dime, any one of which would have easily paid for a greenhouse with healthy room to spare, because that's what we do. I say that as a simple of statement of fact, you can add your own judgment as to the wisdom of it. Nobody dies when we can stop it, making sure they really have much of a life worth living afterwards, eh, not so much, we can't really be bothered. It's where our priorities are. Short-term heroics everyone involved can give themselves pats on the back for, good, long-term solutions to the problems causing the need for short-term heroics, eh, too boring. It's pervasive, and to ignore it to keep the comforting idea that everyone else could and would think as deeply as you do, "on some level" anyway, is to ignore reality. They just don't.<br><br>A not inconsequential amount of our abundant resources have been devoted to idiot-proofing our society. Every stupid law or regulation out there was enacted for a reason, and probably not really for the facile reason of ensuring some bureaucrat's job or somesuch, even if that's the end result. Somebody really was that stupid, to the point of someone else saying "there oughta be a law". I can tell you numerous accounts of just how difficult we've made it in this society to die from your own sheer short-sighted stupidity. We really will call down heaven and earth to save you, and then swoop down over and over and over again as you slowly self-destruct, even if you don't particularly want the help. And then of course let you go back into the world to start the same process over again, since we so cherish autonomy. It's beyond absurd. All for the sweetest intentions, seriously.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c5618308998351665390 title="comment permalink">1/4/12, 9:50 PM</a><br><br>

Unfortunately, you've nailed my mindset until recently to a tee. "It can't go on forever ... can it?" <br><br>Fortunately, my grandparents were Outback farmers and stubbornly clung to habits of saving scrap metal and making new gear, even after moving to the city. Their back yard is distinctly countercultural, resembling a large scrap yard, allowing me to use old fencing, steel beams and timber in my 'new' place, which is a patchwork of old bits, most with stories attached.

So - good work! It is extraordinarily and increasingly rare to find such quality of discourse, clarity of thought, and clever prose all in one place, especially on the internet. <br><br>I suppose I do have a request, if you will - I would love to see you do something specific in some way to a younger generation. My partner and I are 27, and I often feel that most peak-preparedness writing is directed towards those citizens lucky enough to have had a chance to amass something, anything, before it all started collapsing (we've got books and skills, but nowhere to garden...and people aren't quite up to buying all-handmade socks all the time just yet). There doesn't seem to be much out there for those like us, who got...stuck...by being unlucky enough to be too young to capitalize on the growth economy while it was still around. We're already impoverished - many of our peers have five high figures in college debt, yet ten years after graduating are still stocking groceries or shelving books, and not for lack of applying to jobs. We are also fortunate to be the children of 70's-back-to-the-landers, raised with the knowledge that extracting infinite growth from a finite planet is not possible.<br><br>I would love to see something from you written for us - I born was two months after Reagan pulled the solar panels off the White House. We did not participate in the Great Checking-Out of the 1980's, nor did we have much of a choice about the Grand Consumption of the 1990's and 2000's (and ongoing). Many of us are doing what we can, but when you've never been able to afford more than ramen and thrift stores, how do you cut back? When you've never owned a TV or paid for internet service, when you eat beans and rice as a matter of course, and spend your evenings working Mechanical Turk tasks for $3 an hour, from whence does the extra income to eliminate debt and set yourself up in a community-rich environment come from? <br><br>I'll never forget the evening when my father, born smack in the middle of the Baby Boom, had a few too many single malts and sat me down to apologize for what his generation did to the world, and my generation's (and my children's, and their children's, ad infinitum) chances for survival in it.<br><br>Of all the people to whom we could cry in anguish, "What do we DO?! How do we live in the world we have inherited?"...I think you are the most likely to give an honest answer. Should we organize a mass agrarian occupation of BLM land and just go ahead with alternative social structures? Should we throw our Obama-electing generational weight behind the voluntary extinction movement? <br><br>In the words of the ever-so-fleeting Internet Picture of a Cat Stuck in Venetian Blinds Whose Owner Says "Hey, Get the Camera Instead of Helping This Creature Which is Obviously in Pain and Afraid, so We Can Exploit Its Fear for Cheap Entertainment"....HALP!<br><br>Cheers,<br>Celine &amp; Patrick<br><a href=www.wanderingdogsdesign.etsy.com rel=nofollow>Shameless Shop Plug</a><br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c766719190703234421 title="comment permalink">1/4/12, 11:24 PM</a><br><br>

Unknown, knowns - is that the technical terminology?<br><br>I've followed your long term strategy for years now, but stupidly moved into an area that is at risk of major wildfires... On a 40 year cycle too... Risk has benefits though - cooler climate and deep fertile volcanic soils. There is no perfect place here and you can reduce your risk with a lot of hard work.<br><br>In Australia, the building standards produce quite poor outcomes for mass produced housing, but are technically very complex for any one-off non-standard dwelling. Also, after the Black Saturday bushfires back in Feb 2009, complex construction standards were introduced for new houses in bushfire prone areas (which is about 80% of the state to varying degrees).<br><br>The first point to note is that disasters can sometimes be responded to by the authorities introducing even more complex regulatory regimes. This is an energy intensive response.<br><br>So, after building (myself, hands on) my complex (yet small) fire retardant house (note I didn't say fire-proof), I thought I'd go travelling recently to have a look at the areas most affected by the Black Saturday bushfires to see how people are coping with rebuilding with the new complex building regulations. <br><br>So, off I travelled to Kinglake (there's no lake - it's actually named after a 19th century politician) and Marysville and you know what. I didn't see a single new house with any of the required fire prevention systems. Sad, it was a wasted opportunity. My thinking is that if they have been in the direct path of a bushfire once, well it'll happen again.<br><br>Then I recalled, that the insurance payouts on the previous houses probably weren't enough to cover the cost of reconstruction under the new more complex (read more expensive) bushfire regulations. I also remember reading at the time that half of all of 2,000 odd buildings damaged or destroyed at the time had no insurance. <br><br>I think what happened is that a lot of people who rebuilt may have received special dispensation from the regulatory bodies. This response is good politics short term, but bad in the long term.<br><br>So, it's kind of like what you say. A disaster hits a place. Some people can rebuild, but others won't be able to. Those that can't will move on to easier pastures. Eventually, the population concentrates and is widely dispersed at the same time. This is simply a snapshot of how it was 100 years ago. Everything old is new again!<br><br>Just for interest, it might be worth mentioning that the death toll in major bushfires is quite high, but the overall number of properties damaged is actually quite low, although the extent of land damaged can be massive.<br><br>When you compare this to flood events (cyclone, hurricane, tornado etc.), it's the exact opposite. The death toll is quite low, the area affected is quite small, but the number of damaged houses is quite huge. In the floods in Brisbane last year, I think almost 35,000 houses were either damaged or destroyed.<br><br>More people live near rivers or the ocean I guess. Still I understand why insurers rarely offer flood insurance...<br><br>Decline is like death by a thousand cuts.<br><br>Perhaps in these types of areas it may have been a better response to build less permanent and more easily replaceable housing? Still, what would the Joneses think?!

The idea of a long, lingering decay is almost intolerable in some ways – having to wait and wait before getting to something better is just very hard to take. Until you accept that life is short, and we aren’t going to be getting anywhere at all by waiting. It isn't us that will live in whatever comes after, it's people who won't be born for a long time. THIS is our time – this time of transition is the straw we pulled. We've been conditioned to think we last forever, but we don't. <br><br>There's no point in being upset about that, nor in waiting for some game-changing event to make everything different and take away our responsibility to be the change we want to see. The world is actually changing very fast, it's just that our lives pass in the moments in between. Don't wait to live the life you think you should or make the changes you believe in, within the limits of what you have to work with. <br><br>In that context it will be a blessing if the decay is long and drawn out, as few of us are ready to survive without the products of the industrial age we were born into. I'll certainly need more time to adapt. If/when I get caught in one of those step changes, it will probably feel like total collapse, but having some vestige of a functioning society somewhere will still be a help.<br><br>If you look back a dozen years, the pace of change has been truly breathtaking, and I expect that to be even more true for the next dozen. But for each of us those external changes are overlaid on the arc of our own lives proceeding from birth to death, and that distorts the picture you get. Which is changing faster? For me the pace of change in my own life is usually faster, which tells me that when my time is up I will have changed more than the world will have.

A gradual change can be difficult to see. For most of us our daily life continues much as ever. I work in the offshore oil and gas business where depletion issues are front and center; yet few of my colleagues seem to see the bigger picture, which is that every year oil is harder to find and more expensive to produce. Inevitably the focus is on day-to-day issues.<br><br>The one change that I do perceive (and this is necessarily a subjective statement) is that many people no longer have the easy confidence that the current economic malaise is just a phase. Increasingly they seem to recognize that some fundamental and permanent changes are taking place. One of the predictions that I read (from Sharon Astyk, I believe) is that Peak Oil may enter mainstream discussions in the year 2012, and that one of two individuals will become well-known spokespersons. I think that this prediction could indeed turn out to be correct.<br><br>On a personal front I am trying to raise awareness in the engineering community. I believe that engineers can make a significant contribution to our understanding of what’s going on and what we can do about it. For example, engineers and technical people in general have no trouble understanding rate and ratio concepts such as EROEI, and they are all trained in the laws of thermodynamics. And by nature they are problem solvers.<br><br>So far what I have done in this regard is to start a Peak Engineering blog. Also I offered a paper called <i>Down the Hubbert Curve</i> to a leading chemical engineering conference. They did not accept it, but put it in the poster session. Normally I would not bother going forward, but I may do so with this topic. (The purpose of the presentation is to examine what Dr. Hubbert actually said in his seminal paper of 1956.)<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c1137507025377510807 title="comment permalink">1/5/12, 7:27 AM</a><br><br>

Either way, our strategy is the same. A program of reduced consumption, greater local self-reliance and community, minimizing exposure to economic artificialities, and an awareness of things as they are, not as we would wish them to be, all seem like win/win tactics, regardless of how things play out.<br><br>I expect that there will come a point when the global economic camel's back breaks, when credit and capital aren't capable of supporting the massive, complex systems that are essential to our current civilization. The repercussions of this are unknowable, though I also expect that this will be a major step down.<br><br>Regional/civil war in the MENA area over oil and religion (what a volatile combination) seems inevitable. Should this go nuclear,,, God help us all.<br>The Iraq/Iran/Afganistan/Pakistan/India crescent, combined with the Arabian Peninsula, Israel, Syria, and North Africa are in an extreme state of imbalance, politically, socially, economically, religiously and environmentally. <br><br>Globally, the social, economic, and physical threads that bind us grow weaker. Europe's economic union is in deep trouble, and political divisions in the west prevent meaningful solutions, even as the problems and predicaments compound themselves. Rationality is in short supply, while rationalizations saturate our culture. Expecting the center to hold is false hope at best. Best to hope that these threads unravel a few at a time, that these challenges present themselves incrementally, and act accordingly. Avoid complacency.<br><br>The path that has been laid out here seems to be the only sensible one.

(The term 'prosperous' New Year seemed a little questionable given the subject matter of the column.) <br>While in a general sense I have come around to "your" way of thinking on this -- that waiting and hoping for an Apocalypse is kind-of like waiting for Godot -- I wonder whether the idea of "Black Swan" events deserves a mention. For example, a good strong earthquake here where I live in Southern California is a constant, though very small yearly, risk. If such a temblor took the Ports of L.A. &amp; Long Beach offline for awhile, it would sideline something like 15% of the Nation's economy, with the added possibility of turning San Onofre into the next Fukushima. I can't help but imagine that the national emergency response and recovery/rebuilding would be only slightly better than what we witnessed after Katrina. (I'm sure people here in California are much better prepared from a personal safety perspective -- we have larger stocks of affluence to draw down, and there wouldn't be the lingering flooding and pestilence we saw post-Katrina -- but) I should think the whole U.S. economy would take a very noticeable, sudden, sharp downward turn. <br>Have you ever read John Robb over at the Global Guerrillas blog? The way he models it, these over-complicated systems (like our whole society) will limp along for awhile, but each year the cumulative probability of a "Black Swan Event" keeps adding up. (A Black Swan Event is a very unlikely, low-probability, but very damaging emergency coming out of left field -- an earthquake, an epidemic, etc. Pretty much by definition it's impossible to predict or prepare for one, and it would be economically wasteful to try. Bringing it back to _your_ terms, it's an emergency which cannot be prepared for efficiently; only with general resilience.) According to Robb's model, a complex system under general threat will limp along for years at a lower level of performance, in response to the general threats of decay and resistance; but the longer it limps along, eventually, some kind of unforseeable Black Swan disruption shows up which either overturns the system or else drops it down to a far lower level of performance; at which time its enemies, its rebels or competitors can more easily overturn it themselves.<br>Any thoughts on John Robb's theories?<br>(Robb, in general terms, seems to agree with you on the solution/defenses: only flexibility, broad resilience, and decentralization can work as defenses in this model, but a system's elites will always oppose those things, so the centralized systems and their elites will eventually fall.)<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c986408304545889976 title="comment permalink">1/5/12, 8:16 AM</a><br><br>

As for Nero, that's certainly one theory; as I'll be mentioning later on, though, much of the belief system surrounding the Antichrist was of medieval manufacture. <br><br>Alan, yes, I'm familiar with the analogy. Show me examples from history, paying attention to just how long the changes actually took.<br><br>Andy, while you're considering the effect of human ingenuity, please also consider that of human stupidity. Those are equal and opposite forces, you know. <br><br>Lloyd, exactly. People who were in New Orleans when Katrina hit experienced a very sudden collapse of their living standards, one that a lot of them didn't survive; a few hundred miles from the Gulf coast, life went on as usual. That's the sort of pattern that real-world collapse follows. <br><br>Steve, I've heard much the same thing from other parts of the country. Things are definitely tightening up. I'm delighted that your wife is teaching kids how to raise livestock -- that's a skill that will stand some of them in very good stead. <br><br>Penumbra, no, though you were fairly early on. Welcome to the conversation!<br><br>Bret, until you've made the relevant changes in your own life, you have no business trying to tell other people how to live. If you've already mastered the skills of green wizardry, are growing a noticeable fraction of your own food, get by on a small percentage of the energy most Americans use, and have gotten good at a couple of skills that will give you something to trade with your neighbors as the financial end of the economy comes unglued, then you can talk about organizing. Until you've done that, you pretty much guarantee yourself a place in the very large list of "do what I say, not what I do" activists. <br><br>Daniel, you're quite correct -- I think a very large part of the longing for a sudden catastrophe that shows up in the peak oil scene is the hope that this will finally make people admit that we're right and they're wrong. Me, I expect that to happen when pigs sprout wings and we catch our breakfast bacon with butterfly nets. <br><br>Kevin, an aqualung, and plenty of spare tanks. As for getting America "back on track," the thing nobody realizes is that the people who say this actually mean "tied to the tracks in front of an oncoming train." <br><br>Brother K., we did indeed -- I know, I'm only five miles south of the Mason-Dixon line, but I studied old-fashioned Southern rootwork with Cat Yronwode (yes, archdruids do things like that) and got thorough instructions in the proper way to bring in the New Year. As for your plan to gather books -- do it! This is a crucial step, and the more people pursue it in their own ways, the more likely we are to get something of value through the next century or so.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c2161938612996734532 title="comment permalink">1/5/12, 8:20 AM</a><br><br>

Something to do with my Dad (who worked for the government) being put on a three-day week and having no savings. Or something. It all sounded quite bad. But, the next day I still had to get up and have breakfast and go to school. Life carried on. I mentioned this to my (now 90 year old) father a couple of weeks ago who only vaguely remembered it. He had been through much worse in WWII, as had my mother in the Blitz. <br><br>Point is, history is happening all around, sometimes quite noisily, but life moves forward anyway. The trajectory is going to be down into material poverty (unless of course we discover twenty years or so of miracle grow – actual, not headline fodder). But some of the events on the way down will be very loud indeed. For example, the US could launch a preemptive war for petroleum resources that leads to hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded, billions in borrowed expenditures and utter failure. Or entire nations could go bankrupt, completely unable to pay their bills, with social unrest and spontaneous street riots. Or there could be massive ecological disasters with entire areas destroyed and uninhabitable. Oh, wait…<br><br>And during all this, for most of us, we’ll just keep on trudging along. Personally, I’m going to aim to be quite cheerful as I do so, possibly annoyingly so. It did hit home for me, over the holidays, that despite various diligent attempts to save for my retirement, I won’t have enough to live on when I stop earning income, even with the various cost-cutting and homesteading efforts currently in progress. In other words, I will never "retire". Never. Except maybe for a very little while prior to popping my clogs.

This is not communism or a negation of responsibility, it is communalism and interconnectedness. It is a recognition that no part of the whole can exist in isolation; psychologically or physically. When we see the truth of our being, we no longer seek only for personal gain or personal longevity. Instead, we see the emptiness of being and move into actions that bring harmony in the physical and psychological realms. We cease looking for external justifications or reifications of a fixed self that needs material wealth to find meaning. And we are freed to live with the bare awareness and bare essentials of a human life on a fragile planet.

My parents live in one of the Florida towns hit by Hurricane Charley in 2004. They've lived there since 1988 and we visit them every year or two. What I see is that while much has been rebuilt since Charley, some has not, and the older, poorer neighborhoods that suffered more damage are also those with a higher proportion of razed land and current economic difficulties caused at least in part by the impaired recovery from Charley added on to the current economic woes hitting poorer neighborhoods harder.<br><br>Similarly, the St. Louis metro area was struck by a tornado last April 22. If you didn't hear about it, it was because no one died or was seriously injured, thankfully. But that tornado took a 22 mile long path through a variety of neighborhoods. Again, the probability of a rebuild having been completed or at least being in progress is higher for neighborhoods of higher wealth. Poorer areas in some cases look almost as damaged as they did right after the tornado went through. A local monthly paper, the Ferguson Times, has an article in their Jan. 2012 issue about a study of the tornado's aftermath in Ferguson, one of the harder-hit communities. The study identified a lack of adequate homeowner insurance, prevalence of vacant land, low investment in public infrastructure, and absenteee landlordism as among the factors contributing to a local neighborhood's inability to recover rapidly from the tornado. The important point here, I think, is that as decline continues, more and more of us will live in neighborhoods with one or more of these factors. My own neighborhood has two or three of them right now. This means more and more of us, me included, are or will be vulnerable to the effect of a local or regional disaster leading to long-term damage. Thinking about ways to prepare for that might prove useful.<br><br>Like you, John, I see 2012 as bringing what 2011 did, in incrementally larger terms. One of the things that struck me when I was working for pay is just how resilient a large corporation is. They are designed to be that way - to survive major changes in personnel, shifts in demand, and so forth. Coming up on my 55th birthday, I now see that resilience in political and economic structures as well. As you've pointed out, the powers that be have a lot of ways to ensure that things continue on more or less the same for quite awhile, and they will use them when needed. That doesn't mean they or we can escape the laws of physics, but we live in a political and economic ecosystem, and like an ecosystem, it can take a lot of shocks and still go on pretty much as before. But the shocks do accumulate and change things substantially over long time periods. I can see a lot of changes when I look from the 1960s forward. I expect a lot more change, in the same downward trend, for the rest of my life. I'm doing the best I can to prepare for that, psychologically as much as physically. Fixed ideas can be the biggest barrier to responding gracefully to the needs of the moment.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c1566760783178055988 title="comment permalink">1/5/12, 9:28 AM</a><br><br>

It seemed like placing five Silverbacks (excepting Nicole, perhaps ;) in the same little glade and expecting something other than chaos. Dimitri Orlov likely came to the same conclusion as expressed in his post: <a href=http://cluborlov.blogspot.com/2012/01/dismal-public-affair.html rel=nofollow>A Dismal Public Affair</a>. One wonders if this had anything to do with his early departure, and later in the session as the moderator went back to Richard Heinberg on the phone, there was a dial tone in the background as if someone had hung up on the conversation. JHK?<br><br>Anyway, I think I enjoyed the discussion, more than some of the participants perhaps. The forum eventually deferred to the more elderly Silverback (Chomsky) who took his time expressing his disdain that peak oil will be a long, slow process rather than a sudden decline in the availability of all things fossil fuel; <i>"a disaster for the planet</i>". IMO, he was expressing his belief that the planet can't afford another three or four decades of dig, drill, slash and burn, that, no matter how horrific a sudden collapse may be for humanity, it may be the better choice for the long term prospects for the biosphere, and indeed, our own species. I must admit that my inner sociopath has considered this point of view, as I'm sure many of you have. Not that we, collectively, have much choice in the matter.<br><br>One wonders, if some impartial supreme being came and announced that 80% of us must die in the next decade in order to save the planet, how many of us would step up? Perhaps not all who advocate, even hope for, a swift decline are as selfish and sociopathical as some would assume.

In a sudden collapse, he has written, shocked citizens rush around seeking to conserve what elements of their civilization can be conserved. In a slow decline, he has written, things by contrast slide, unaccompanied by salutary heroic reactions, with the final loss potentially higher than in a sudden catastrophe. (JMG: Might you possibly consider giving us a reference to that earlier writing?) <br><br>Thanks, Brother K, for raising the question of conserving technical books. I am myself trying to amass a set of books in practical radio, especially from before 1970. I have found it useful to go to ham-radio flea markets ("hamfests"). From hamfests one learns what people were using and valuing decades ago, and this then gives one pointers into followup researches on the Internet. It was through a combination of initial-hamfest and followup-Internet investigation that I learned, e.g., of the high repute of A.A.Ghirardi's "Radio Physics Course", which I hold in a 1932 edition or printing. <br><br>I have devised a simple modular library tool to help conserve books and documents. This tool is a stackable box, its dimensions selected to accommodate not only most books but also USA letter-length filing folders (for loose papers) and the equivalent European "A4" folders. <br><br>The design includes some drilling of holes, so that boxes can if necessary be fitted with rope handles (should the Visigoths, Huns, and Vandals suddenly invade the Toronto conurbation, forcing a library evacuation ahem ahem), and so that they also can if necessary be bolted together, to make a rigid book wall.

The round wooden box with pull handle was made by my late relative ZZ in a Displaced Persons Camp around 1945. <br><br>ZZ's life is itself a lesson in surviving darkness. Facing, as a young Estonian engineering student, conscription into the Wehrmacht, ZZ trained in Morse code to the requisite 24 words/minute. He was thereby able to work in radio (as opposed to assault duty) for the army of the Big Fooey, and nobody in Uncle Joe's army shot him. I additionally suspect ZZ, being a radio specialist in a comms-monitoring taskforce, was not required to shoot anyone on Uncle Joe's side. <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>www dot metascientia dot com <br>VA3KMZ (mainly 40 metres, 20 metres, Sundays, mainly PSK31 and CW)<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c2311376754444105597 title="comment permalink">1/5/12, 11:01 AM</a><br><br>

On average, Portland has trimmed $1.5 million a year from its paving budget for the past five, bureau spokeswoman Cheryl Kuck said. The city stopped repaving residential roads in 2009, for example.

While your point about idiotproofing society is well taken -- every time you think something is foolproof, somebody invents a better fool -- the habit of insisting that the average person is an idiot has always struck me as one of the more graceless affectations of the intellectual class. <br><br>DeAnander, it's important to acknowledge the grief and the pain of the process we're in. It's all too easy to run away from that into the sort of reflexive demonization of contemporary life that's so common these days, but to my mind, that's a cop-out. Every human culture is problematic in one way or another -- but every human culture is also a unique way of experiencing the cosmos, and when it dies, a part of the universe of human possibility dies with it. <br><br>J9, by "course" do you mean a new sequence of posts, or something else? I do have a couple of projects in the works, yes...<br><br>Kfish, thanks for the references! Sara's already got <i>Respect the Spindle</i>, iirc, but I don't think she's seen the other one. <br><br>Revenge, that's an extraordinarily thorny question, and it's not at all easy to come up with an answer, either, not least because it's been a good quarter century since I was in your shoes. Let me think about that and consider a future post -- and I'd like to encourage you, and other twentysomethings, to think about it, too, good and hard. You know the model of the future I've sketched out -- what options do you see for people in your situation? <br><br>Cherokee, there's much to be said for simple nomadic dwellings and other very inexpensive forms of shelter in a land that gets hammered by disasters. I suspect you'll see a lot of that as the money starts running out. As for Jack Vance -- now <i>there</i> was a brilliant writer!<br><br>Lizzy, no, what happens when a government can't pay its debts is that it defaults on them, either overtly -- the way Russia did in 1998, for example -- or covertly, by debasing the currency until the interest on the national debt will just about buy you a gallon of milk. Buyers of government bonds are simply gambling that it won't happen to them. <br><br>Seeker, I'd encourage you to look at what's happening in the former Soviet Union, which is losing population at a rate that will drop the numbers by 50% before 2100. That's a very steep drop in demographic terms, but you'll notice that it's not happening via some apocalyptic event; it's simply that more people are dying than are getting born, year after year. We're approaching that in America, by the way. <br><br>Sofistek, understood. One of the massive problems with a slow decline is precisely that people can talk themselves into believing tht it's not happening. As far as Occupy, well, how much did the protests actually accomplish? It's going to take a lot more than some people camping in parks to make change happen -- and again, it's got to start with people changing their own lives. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, I was a guest on the man's program; I wasn't going to be rude to him. <br>Lee, excellent! I'm going to evade my usual rule and give out two gold stars today, and you get the second. Yes, this is what decline looks like.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c1125578674752000605 title="comment permalink">1/5/12, 1:10 PM</a><br><br>

Simple as that...<br><br>Hapibeli, and a happy new year to you and yours!<br><br>Mike, well, to begin with, a rapid decline in what? A lot of the so-called wealth in circulation these days is basically a collection of consensual hallucinations, and can evaporate into pixie dust without anything real going away. It will be interesting to see just how things pan out as the economic situation lurches onward. <br><br>Chris, thank you!<br><br>Twilight, it's supposed to irritate a few people -- or more than a few. The interesting thing is that nobody questions the possibility, or the likelihood, that improvements can build over time to amount to major change, but if you suggest that, well, "disimprovements" can do the same thing, the howls of protest begin. <br><br>James, most of us will not leave any genetic heritage behind -- on a planet that can support maybe a billion people indefinitely, the vast majority of today's seven billion are going to draw the short end of Darwin's stick. It's purely a matter at this point of doing what we can to make sure that something of value survives this mess. <br><br>Chris, that's a large part of it, but there's also the collapse of meaning. A sudden catastrophe can be seen as a 'reset' button -- game over, start again, and progress again becomes an option, even if all you can hope to achieve is something better than you've got at the bottom of the catastrophe. Slow decline means that progress is over, and when the only sense of meaning you've got is fixated on the hope of material improvement, that means the game is still on but you lose, forever.<br><br>Michael, good. Yes, that's an important point. <br><br>John, I'm glad Maryland doesn't have an early primary. It must be a circus up your way. <br><br>ChemEng, that's excellent to hear! If the engineering community can get its head around the idea that peak oil is the ultimate problem solving exercise -- not because peak oil can be "solved," but because it's going to heap up problems by the dozen, many of which could be solved -- some very constructive work could be done. I'd encourage you to dust off your slide rule, though, and pick up a few old books on nomographs; low tech methods are going to be important tools, and worth preserving. <br><br>Adrian, if more people are waking up to the fact of decline, that's excellent news.

All we need to do, he said, is to keep the tax base growing faster than the growth of the debt, so we can just keep making our minimum payments on the national credit card.<br><br>Well, gee, if I'd known it was that simple, I'd have bought more of those Greek bonds... The problem seems to be that you gotta have economic growth in order to increase the tax base, and in order to have economic growth you need... oh, wait, that particular commodity peaked back about 2005... <br><br>At some point, our whole economic house of cards will come tumbling down (maybe when our national debt is larger than the total money supply of the whole world?). Will this happen in 2012? Hopefully not. Will it happen before I'm old enough to start collecting Social Security? I'm afraid it will, with absolute certainty.<br><br>Personally, I think 2012 is going to be one of those crazy, pivotal years, like 1968, where lots of weird stuff will happen, and everything is different afterwards. If the Supreme Court upholds ObamaCare, if Obama is re-elected, if the Euro collapses, if the crazy mullahs in Iran really ARE crazy, if the Federal Reserve keeps printing money because nobody else will buy our debts, if ... Well, if any of those things (or lots of other things) happen in 2012, they'll have at least one good effect: they will make it more obvious to even the most casual observer that things are getting worse, will continue to get worse, and will probably never get significantly better.<br><br>THEN, maybe, more people will start to sit up and take notice, and start to pay attention to prophets like the green wizard.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c1299913294646942930 title="comment permalink">1/5/12, 2:02 PM</a><br><br>

My humble container garden produced a good set of vegetables, and this year I intend on adding the 100 square foot patch my neighbour has given me to grow even more (I will be trying out a three sisters garden in part of it). I canned tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers, and made three kinds of jam. Not from my own produce, mind you, but at least from produce grown locally. This year I plan on brewing my wife some gluten-free beer from sorghum. It's been many years since I last brewed beer, and it was always from a kit.

Socrates, for example, didn't actually have a problem with idiots because there were very, very few of them (I think this was briefly mentioned in Plato's Dialogue of Euthydemus, or maybe it was the Dialogue of Protagoras), and if you were one of those rare people who really didn't have the biological capacity to think that was hardly your FAULT, now was it?<br><br>No, "idiocy" is not the problem.<br><br>No, the real problem, according to Richard Paul and Linda Elder, whose standards of critical thinking I use to come to my conclusions, is that the average person has the capacity to think things through and chooses to NOT USE IT in favor of draconian punishments for people he doesn't like, or selfish accumulation of wealth for himself, or some of America's war policies you've been criticizing, etc. To Paul and Elder, it's not that the average person is "stupid" but that the average person is "unsophisticated". It's not that they're "stupid," it's that they're intelligent but deliberately choose to NOT USE IT, in order to justify abusing humans in ways such as child swimsuit pageants a la Jon-Benet Ramsay for example.<br><br>Jeez, Greer, you've even talked about this yourself! You've talked about that 25-year-old you saw on TV who had "no inner life worth mentioning;" you've criticized Americans for refusing to admit the Soviet Union wasn't the only one committing evil actions, you've criticized Americans for simply ignoring library books instead of burning them, which you called one of the most ghastly features of our time.

Still, there will doubtless be some similarities. <br><br>Thomas, what Robb misses is, first, that successful elites tend to be very resilient, and to build a lot of resilience into their critical systems -- that's why they're in power and their more brittle rivals aren't; and second, that the immediate response of everybody in the aftermath of a black swan event is very often to pitch in and try to salvage as much as possible. A sudden crisis or catastrophe can very often provide a society in deep trouble with something to rally around. <br><br>Mike, er, poetic license. <br><br>Yupped, yes, that's precisely what I'm expecting -- and I don't expect ever to be able to retire, either. <br><br>Andy, I'd noticed that as well. I figure we're maybe five to ten years from the point when electricity companies start charging people up front to have their homes reconnected to the grid after a big storm -- and those who can't pay, don't get back on the grid. <br><br>DW, I certainly can't argue against approaching all this from a spiritual perspective -- I have my own, about which I've dropped hints now and then -- but the readers of this blog come from every point on the spiritual compass from mainstream religions through any number of alternative visions to agnostics and atheists.

Thanks for the tip. <br><br>SLClaire, that's a very important barometer to watch: when a society can no longer repair the damage it takes from ordinary disasters (and in the midwest, twisters are pretty ordinary), it's in catabolic collapse, pretty clearly. <br><br>Ghung, I'll check it out. I'm not a great fan of Chomsky, but the others are usually entertaining. <br><br>Tom, I'll have to look it up -- I've got a couple of hundred posts in the archive at this point! For what it's worth, btw, I think your model for the decline of the internet is very plausible, especially if you factor in a gradual shift to packet radio as the infrastructure starts to age out. <br><br>Cathy, five years of no resurfacing will leave a fair number of Oregon roads unusable.

Any chance you're in the Austin, TX area? I would love more friends who get where I'm coming from. <br><br>To answer JMG's request for thoughts from other 20-somethings, here is what I am doing:<br><br>I first took up cooking from scratch, then added a balcony garden to cook from, then took up sewing. My mother gave me a worm farm for Christmas this year so that I could compost more effectively in my tiny space. I have been learning and practicing what I can of food preservation techniques, focusing particularly on no-energy types like lactic acid fermentation and solar dehydration.<br><br>I have been reading about techniques for energy efficient and inexpensive homebuilding methods, animal husbandry things, herbalism, and I have been doing a lot of mental/spiritual work inspired by the series on magic here. My husband is learning smithing and considering how to build a life out of some sort of salvage metallurgy. When we have some money, we will probably also get him a decent bike for his work commute.<br><br>All that said, I find myself in the intensely dispiriting position that all of the above is simultaneously too much for me to handle properly (given my disability) and also not nearly enough to satisfy either my ambitions or my realizations about what the future is going to require. <br><br>The main thing I want to be doing, but cannot right now due to my situation, is forging mutually beneficial relationships where my youth and home-economy development might be exchanged for some of the things I lack. For instance, an arrangement where someone else had land and I had the desire and knowledge to garden it, to split the produce, or perhaps an older person who needed caretaking for themselves or their land who could provide housing in exchange. There are even sites that coordinate some of those things:<br><br>http://www.sharedearth.com/ - a site that links people who have land with gardeners who don't.<br><br>http://www.wwoofusa.org/ - connects organic farmers with young people willing to stay with them and intern/help with the farm work.<br><br>There is also a movement among our generation towards much greater sharing and finding ways to work around or change the laws that restrict it: http://www.shareable.net/<br><br>I have to say, I do hope for a financial system disruption great enough that all the vacant lots and properties can be "homesteaded" in a way, whether within or without the legal system, because I don't see many other ways most people in my generation (including my husband and I) will get land of our own.<br><br>In terms of a gradual decline that does not include such a drastic disruption, I think the most likely thing will be for people to combine resources and households - either by pooling together with other young couples or, in families that are compatible with it, going back to a multi-generational housing arrangement. Our best hope until recently was to combine households with close friends, but in their process of house-shopping, the husband of that couple became much more seduced by the siren of American middle-class autonomy, and it doesn't look like that's really on the table any more...and so it goes. That was very frustrating; after that conversation I was sobbing to my husband that my parents should have named me Cassandra.<br><br>So my plan for my generation: Learn all we can, practice whatever is possible in our circumstances, forge relationships with like-minded people, reject whichever laws and customs are not useful (such as laws against sharing things or norms of single-family petroleum-dependent autonomy), and if circumstances get really desperate, work on making the life of a freegan nomad feel like a transgressive protest against the establishment instead of looking at yourself as a dumpster-diving hobo.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c3883128585831422862 title="comment permalink">1/5/12, 8:35 PM</a><br><br>

In my view the matter of predicting by precise dates is likely to be beside the point and distract attention from other aspects of what is foretold which may be more useful. An interesting example of this is D H Lawrence's response to the announcement of the end of World War One: he did not join in the general rejoicing but said sombrely that war would come again - because of the hatred in men's hearts. Which it did, with even greater violence. If that hatred had been addressed the conflicts that led to World War Two may have taken a different course. In that context dates are irrelevant. Lawrence did not set himself up as a prophet; it was his deep understanding of how people function and affect each other which gave him that insight. He didn't need a crystal ball - it was obvious to him.<br><br>Regarding the situation of the poor, life is full of surprises, some pleasant others not: perhaps fifteen years ago I was working in a well-paid, reasonably prestigious job with no inkling that my life would soon change almost beyond recognition. I got ill and had to resign, and one way and another have not been able to get back to paid employment since. It's been a shattering experience, but... I've learnt a heck of a lot, and I know that being poor has certainly got me ahead of the wave of what others will need to learn as I've practised thrift and resourcefulness through sheer necessity, every way I can think of to enable me to manage on a fraction of what I used to. And it does take practice, years of it - what grows well and when to plant, figuring out preserving methods work, where to get things most cheaply - or even for free when few others are bothering to do so. This is what I've been writing about in my Chronicles - to encourage others to have a go and describe what isn't so difficult after all and doesn't require special brains or equipment, just an understanding of some basic steps which are simple enough in themselves. I have loads more articles to be added to my collection of writings as time and energy permit. <br><br>Regarding oil, really, the sooner we run out it the better off we will be, the better our chances are of not creating further ruin of our incredibly beautiful planet. It's been cheap oil which has enabled the foolish globalisation of the world economy which requires so much transportation of materials and goods from one part of the globe to another, and back again. <br><br>On a lighter note, this week I tracked down a delightful cartoon by Dan Piraro about 2012 and the (possible) cause of all the doomsday forecasts...<br><a href="http://www.bizarrocomics.com/?p=2358" rel=nofollow>Mayan Mayhem by Dan Piraro</a><br><br>Thanks JMG, for keeping the ball rolling, and I'm delighted to hear that the tip jar is doing well.

Such events which cannot be discounted can really accelerate decline from which recovery would be partial and temporary. A long descent does not rule out bouts of accelerated declines for all given the interconnectedness of modern civilisation.

This is the growth of individualist thinking at the expense of community thinking. This I think is primarily the result of the pervasive affluence that the era of cheap abundant energy has bought us. It's easy to think you can take care of yourself in a society that pours wealth and abundance on you from every direction. No matter how often we forget this, the majority of Americans still live in a world of affluence beyond the dreams of earlier centuries. The chant ought to be "'We are the 99% of the top 5% of the wealthiest era in human history!" Don't expect to hear that one anytime soon. Of course we have a sense of entitlement and a pervasive delusion that "You should be able to take care of yourself, I am not responsible for your poverty." <br><br>I have wondered, and still wonder, when this might really begin to shift and what might start it. I suppose the obvious answer is "creeping pervasive poverty." I expect, though, that Americans are more likely to look for scapegoats to blame this on rather than question their own sense of entitlement or accept that the era of affluence was fundamentally unsustainable and thus irrevocably over. It might not be able to shift until all currently living generations and our attitudes of affluence have passed from the earth.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c4121802759789114686 title="comment permalink">1/6/12, 6:35 AM</a><br><br>

The most common interpretation of the Antichrist myth throughout the history of the Christian tradition has been that Antichrist would be every bit as much an incarnate figure active at a specific point in history as, well, Christ. Myself, I think your interpretation of Antichrist as an eternal reality rather than a historical one is far more useful, but the fact remains that it's a minority view, and Sulpicius Severus among many, many others saw things differently.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c9022682935820151108 title="comment permalink">1/6/12, 12:55 PM</a><br><br>

Since discovering peak oil and digesting some of JMG, Heinberg, and others (not least, readers of this blog!), I've changed my career tack entirely, from computer engineering to alternative healthcare. I am now saving for an education in naturopathic medicine, with an emphasis on herbal medicine. I've been cooking from scratch since early college, and I do know how to do a bit of sewing (mending, mostly), and crocheting, but nothing to be particularly proud of. I realize that I need to step it up, while also trying to get my partner on-board (he realizes that the resource crises will happen at some point, but does not realize that the first round has already started, and that time is running short).<br><br>I wish I had a house with a garden plot to call my own, weatherstrip, fit with solar heat, and begin composting at. Instead, we have a poorly-insulated "modern" apartment, a commute to work, and little practical experience producing real goods (just like the other 20-somethings here). I think that viable trades will form an appropriate bridge, as suggested by JMG in The Long Descent - things as disparate as medicine, alcoholic beverages, specialty clothing (wedding dresses and work boots, anyone?) and tools will still support a body of professionals, since no one can possibly provide all of these things at decent quality at once due to the time these skills take to master. These sorts of professions will (I hope!) give those of us too young to have acumulated many real assets yet an opportunity to continue earning an income - probably as a blend of currencies and goods - and building wealth in preparation for householding later in life, while picking up basic householding skills as we go along.<br><br>I agree with Breanna that getting over the single-family-on-a-grass-patch idea is an essential process. Townhomes and apartments with shared common cultivation areas may be a good option, and not hard to achieve with existing structures, given a little insulation and digging-up of silly fountained courtyards.<br><br>It's hard not to feel like a nut for thinking this way while many our age run out to buy iPads and plan extravagant weddings with no recognition of declining resources whatsoever. But I am more concerned about making sure my partner and I are okay and able to help our community when the time comes than about being cool, I guess :)<br><br>I'm in WA but I look forward to hearing from both of you here - I've been fretting about what our age group should do for a while now!<br><br>~Allison<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c4569023349089351532 title="comment permalink">1/6/12, 3:55 PM</a><br><br>

I have physical constraints too as well as financial ones. However, it sounds as if you are nonetheless achieving a considerable amount. When I get stuck I always repeat to myself Theodore Roosevelt's advice to "Do what you can, where you are, with what you have" which is all any of us can do. That quote is from a military handbook, by the way, so I can visualize a war weary and probably physically deprived soldier camping out and making the best of things, which eases the loneliness of it somehow. Lately I've been unable to keep up with all my gardening and have had to satisfy myself with sitting quietly and watching the weeds grow, of which there are rather a lot. But if the day is beautiful, I can enjoy the garden for its own sake...<br><br>Regarding the shortage of garden area, do you have any community gardens near you? There are quite a few of these in New Zealand, which you can see here:<br><a href=http://good.net.nz/magazine/community-gardens rel=nofollow>Community gardens in New Zealand</a><br>I haven't been involved with them directly but have toured some of them and they are GREAT! Some are even in the back yards of people who have space but aren't using it and are happy to make it available for that purpose. I remember coming away from that tour wondering why everyone didn't do it as it seemed so obvious. <br><br>I'm in my 50s now but remember well the dilemmas of my 20s, which were not all that dissimilar to yours. As we say in New Zealand, Kia Kaha, which is Maori for Be strong / I wish you strength, and here's a hug from me.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c8078060243168857666 title="comment permalink">1/6/12, 4:11 PM</a><br><br>

I've always refrained from commenting but I enjoy the discussion among this group as it is largely devoid of the blowhards you find in MSM discussions (except for perhaps zogboy last week.) I was deployed to Afghanistan last year and you kind of became my chaplain. I'm not religious but I appreciated the straightforward sincerity in your words. Besides going to see the "real" chaplain involves a hefty dose of God and country which does very little for me. <br>What my deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan provided to me was a look at what societies can look like post collapse. Granted the situations there are quite different from here but they certainly provide good learning points. I will admit I do lose sleep worrying about sectarian violence here though due to the fractured nature of our society. If it does happen I don't think it will manifest itself on a national scale but will be confined to city level violence and be more akin to gang warfare than structured violence. <br>Another intersting thing, to me, is the fact that in both countries a lot of the ancient traditions have been preserved, particuraly <br>in regards to agriculture. I was always amazed at what the people were able to grow in such an unforgiving environment. In Iraq they actually use the exact same irrigation canals that the babylonians used many eons ago. The funny thing is (as in funny like the plague and World War I) that we are sending people over to Afghanistan to teach them "better" ways to farm. Ahh good ol' imperial hubris.

I'd encourage you to make sure you have a fallback plan, though -- and you might think, hard, about how to maintain your activity in your field if the academic industry comes apart, on the one hand, or simply has no place for you on the other. <br><br>Gail, we're in ecosystem collapse -- or, to be more precise, the rapid simplification and reorganization of existing ecosystems under stress. That's not an "if." The point I'm trying to raise is that what you're seeing around you may not be the run-up to the collapse; this <i>is</i> the collapse, and if it continues to unfold at the present pace for another couple of decades, we're going to be in a very different world. <br><br>Joel, granted! The problem as I see it -- and of course I speak as an outsider -- is the tendency to shoehorn the eternal principles into the standard issue apocalyptic myth. <br><br>Sofistek, the ancient Mayans are among the many societies that got hit with the double whammy of resource depletion and climate change; it's a fairly common mix, actually, since soil fertility is a common resource to deplete, and the consequences of depleting the soil often include things like deforestation, which can drive climate change by changing albedo and decreasing the rate at which water is returned to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration. I've long thought the Mayan collapse makes a fairly good model for the one we can expect...and it took around 150 years from beginning to end. <br><br>Croatoan, if what I'm writing makes sense to somebody in a combat zone, that's high praise -- thank you! I hope the people in Afghanistan have the common sense to tell the American agronomists to go home; the latter generally try to replace localized smallholder farms with big plantations feeding the global economy, which is a very bad idea at any time and particularly so now. <br><br>Jeff, thank you for the seed reviews, and also for getting the point of the last year and a half of posts here!<br><br>Morrigan, I find Lewis well worth reading -- some of his arguments are forced, but that's a standard occupational habit of apologists.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c4860005811890236688 title="comment permalink">1/6/12, 10:46 PM</a><br><br>

There was even a mention about arable land. It might be worthwhile mentioning that at this stage of the game, no land is perfectly arable. Industrial agriculture and housing reduces the productivity of land considerably (it is sort of like strip mining). So, I would suggest to these people that they start learning about building top soil using organic methods. At some stage in the future, top soil will be the real wealth - not that anyone would recognise it as such though.

As an agricultural scientist (albeit in a narrow speciality in plant quarantine) with an interest in 'resilience' I was keen nearly 20 years ago on the strategy proposed by Geoff Hawtin (then Director-General, International Plant Genetic Resources). Much of the indigenous farm saved seeds adapted to localised subsistence in Afghanistan had been lost due to persistent war. (A small farm economy under exacting - "harsh" - environmental constraints is highly adapted to local conditions and generates just enough surplus to support a small local craft/trading urban economy.) Not a good place to be in the cockpit of geopolitics of so-called 'cold war' etc.) Hawtin said that there were small collections of appropriate local seed lines (grains &amp; legumes particularly) that could be distributed to re-build the degraded ancient systems. Situation was bad enough 20 years ago but I guess that his idea has not progressed since 9/11. <br>Congrats BTW to Croaton for keeping his head in the ongoing disaster, and a nod to JMG for helping.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c7887251853698151360 title="comment permalink">1/7/12, 3:15 AM</a><br><br>

I suggest some research in a few more mainstream sources. Of the apocalyptic signs you mention, only the coral bleaching is really as severe as you describe (not that this isn't bad enough!). Forest declines are a localized phenomenon not a global pandemic (so far). Healthy trees DO shed branches and always have, it is a part of their hard-wired physiology and it is how they keep their leaves in the light and shed unproductive or damaged limbs as they grow. If dead and dying wood had not always been a major component of forest ecosystems, we would not have two dozen species of woodpeckers native to North America, nor the thousands kinds of amphibians, insects, fungi, etc. etc. that depend on this resource for their livelihood. There has been no increase in seismic activity; methane outgassing in the arctic remains an uncertain phenomenon that no one was even looking at a few decades ago so no one actually knows the long term trend -- there is no baseline to know if it has shifted or not. The hypotheses of possible calamities and mass climate-destabilizing outgassing events are just that -- hypotheses. Remember that this planet has had functional global ecosystems and climate stability in its geological history under many drastically different temperature and atmospheric chemistry regimes that what we see at the present. <br><br>JMG - as for "ecosystem collapse," I think you are also falling into an apocalyptic trap by using the word "collapse." We are seeing shifts, but "collapse" suggests fundamental breakdown of basic function, which is not happening by and large (except for coral bleaching) on a global scale. In North America, the populations of most native birds have actually been increasing over the last five decades, not decreasing. Forest cover has also increased in that time. <br><br>Not saying that ecosystems are not being stressed and greatly altered by human activities. But so far they are not flat out falling apart and collapsing in most areas even in response to some major blows -- eastern forests survived the effective extinction of the American Chestnut 80 years ago, they are surviving the gypsy moth. Western rangelands have been drastically altered by grazing and fire suppression, but they are still functional ecosystems. "Ecosystem collapse" just conjurs up images of, well, eco-apocalypse, that are not happening over most of the planet. Kind of like the difference between economic collapse versus economic decline. Economic decline could well even lead to long-term improvements in overall ecosystem function!<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c801172026950326681 title="comment permalink">1/7/12, 6:49 AM</a><br><br>

At the end of your post, you advised people to clear their debts, among other things. <br><br>It seems to me that, for the vast majority of people, this is not an option. As Michael Rowbotham, Paul Grignon, and others have pointed out, nearly all of the money in circulation originated as a loan--meaning that all of it has interest demanded atop its repayment. Because the interest to pay off these loans was not created along with the principle, interest can only be paid off with one thing: more loans--which means more debt. Thus our present situation, where the amount of debt in the system far exceeds the amount of money available through barter, employment, etc. Even those who manage to extinguish their personal debts still live in nations, states, and municipalities that are themselves heavily in debt, and will demand taxes to pay for it. <br><br>So, again, those lucky few who can pay off their debts are certainly well advised to do so. But, perhaps in a future post, will you address what everybody else might do with debts that are--quite literally--impossible to extinguish?<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c7060671552322397528 title="comment permalink">1/7/12, 7:41 AM</a><br><br>

For all the wrong done to American troops and to the peoples of Iraq, the world will still see very good reasons to avoid a similar incursion onto their own soil. No good comes from inviting war.

The range and scope of material possessions we will be able to possess in the future will be limited compared to today and a greater percentage of our physical lives spent in labor to support ourselves, i.e. gardening rather than shopping. But that is not a reduction in a standard of living where your standard of living is not wholly tied to your material wealth. Your material wealth will always play a part in your living standard, but if other things like sense of self as tied to personal actions in agreement with whatever philosophical, ethical, moral, religious, communal, artistic or other frameworks for meaningful behavior begin playing a larger part in your standard of living calculation, then life goes on, as it will, but standards could either rise or fall depending on our emotional and cognitive reactions to them.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c5040841128098245406 title="comment permalink">1/7/12, 11:16 AM</a><br><br>

This is where we have come unstuck. In funding short term goals, collectively we have improved or maintained our standard of living without the unnecessary difficulty of increasing our incomes.<br><br>It is the difference between paying for a night out on a credit card versus borrowing funds for a house. One will provide long term benefits - even if the value of that asset drops - whilst the other is just partying. We have been partying for too long now.<br><br>A simple way to get out of debt is to reduce your expenditure and have a lower standard of living. I know plenty of people that kept on partying and they are paying the price for that now. The longer you leave off making a decision, the harder it will be for you as an individual. A company or a country is no different either.<br><br>In the US debt has been used to fuel the increasing inequality in wealth and you guys are all paying for it. Well done you guys! I find it to be very amusing when you get grass roots groups calling on lower taxes for the wealthy. It is a purely aspirational goal for the people involved and the dream is now over. It would help them if they accepted that.<br><br>As to government debt, it will be resolved by either: repayment; devaluation of the currency; or default. Although I'm sure there are other methods (quantitive easing comes to mind which will lead to an eventual devaluation anyway - no one wants to be repaid in paper!). None of these outcomes will be good for people. Someone commented that fuel in the US is considered expensive at slightly over $3/gallon (it's almost double that here).

The groups that get their funding to `fight`poverty keep raising the bar on what constitutes `poverty`. My wife and I are in our late forties, and when she grew up, she lived on a farm in Canada, and was considered middle class. At the same time, her family lived in a house built by her father with `walking` water until she was 16 (walking water is where you walk out to the well with a bucket, lift up some water and walk back to the house with it). Today people in poverty wonder how to pay the cell phone and cable bills. The Wikipedia site has a good explanation on the difference between absolute poverty and relative poverty, where relative poverty is where you are at a percentage of the median local income, in the developed world 60%. This definition guarantees that someone is always in poverty, and this is where the backlash is targeted.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c8821260736619110435 title="comment permalink">1/8/12, 1:23 PM</a><br><br>

I don't know about "collapsing" - they are still recognizably forests - but they are becoming much less species-diverse, much younger, and more fragmented, and wildlife populations follow predictably. The baseline is constantly being lowered, but I remember. I've been keeping records here on my place for 2 decades, as well as simply paying attention, and I'm here to tell you that things are very broken. I remember going out on a May morning and being practically deafened by the massive thrush concert (wood thrushes, hermit thrushes, veeries, and assorted warblers for counterpoint). No more - now it's "cool, I heard a hermit thrush!". Same thing with frogs. And of course, the bats are destroyed by the white-nose fungus. I saw 1 (one) bat this past summer. Just a few years ago, the summer sky was full of bats - how I loved them! I could go on, but I'm depressed enough already.<br><br>Back to trees: We have lost the chestnut to the blight, of course. The elm sort of sputters along, but more as an understory tree, until it gets nailed by the dutch elm disease. The butternut is just about completely gone from a fungus very similar to the chestnut blight. The beech, a very important wildlife species, is suffering from a scale insect/nectria fungus assault. The hemlock is being hammered by the wooly adelgid - it's been extirpated in southern NE, and heaven help us if it moves north. Global warming, anyone? The ash is being hammered by who-knows-what? Some bizarre syndrome of mycoplasm, fungus, virus? "Ash Yellows", some call it. I can tell you they're dropping like flies all over. I'd say at least 50% of the ash component of the forest around here has gone away in the last 20 years. What's next? If the oaks get taken out, things really unravel. We have maple decline already. Birches seem to be hanging in there, but they are an earlier successional species around here.<br><br>I'm talking here about wild forests, not stressed city parks. And these are not simply successional changes as some have suggested (beech, hemlock? Give me a break!) I've been watching this thing unfold since the 70's (indeed, it's partly why I became a forest ecologist). <br><br>So maybe you don't want to call it collapse, but something really terrible is going on. <br>Some people notice, some don't. You know, the old 'boil the frog' thing.

It may sound hypocritical, coming from someone sitting on more acres than I could ever personally farm, but I have a few things to offer from my position (which basically amounts to voluntary rural poverty.)<br><br>What JMG and my best judgement tell me is the most likely long collapse scenario involves a series of shocks, resource and environmentally based for sure, but primarily felt economically. Now, during hard economic times, what group of people fares the worst? Well, until the post-war years in the developed world, and all the way through today in the rest, poverty has had a rural face.<br><br>Prior to the industrial age, the countryside was always the location of the greatest poverty. Sure, ancient Rome and Louis XVI's France had urban poverty, but I'm pretty sure they didn't hold a candle to rural poverty in those societies.<br><br>For one thing, wealth concentrates in urban areas due to trade and industry. For another, political elites always fear their concentrated urban populations, and will, by force, distribute the produce of the country to the cities. Ancient Roman farmers were taxed so heavily that they couldn't afford to keep farming, but were compelled on threat of death to continue doing so. All to keep the bread and circuses going. In more modern times, Stalin starved the grain farmers of the Ukraine to feed his cities, knowing all too well what a hunger-induced urban revolution looks like.<br><br>Some day, the world of humanity will probably devolve into agrarian societies, a process that will take generations. And yes, in the meantime the resource sectors, including agriculture, are likely to play a much bigger role in a nation's economy than they have in our time. If you have the right skills, or are young enough to learn them, moving to a small town in an agricultural region might be a good move. Know how to factor cotton, or grade wool? Work on diesel engines and implement hydraulics? Write commodity contracts?<br><br>To be sure, outside of agribiz, a few people are making a pretty good go of it selling arugula and pastured poultry to urban elites. And this is allowing some of them to develop the skills and knowledge that will be necessary to grow our food and fiber in the future. I believe it's vitally important that there are people doing that, and that's pretty much what I've devoted the latter part of my life to. <br><br>If I could, I would try to recruit you to this life, but please don't think it would be an escape from the troubles ahead. People who think they can jump to 10, 25, or even 40 acres of rocky, hilly country -and that's all you're going to find, friends. All of the good bottomland is growing corn and soybeans for Cargill- and live in anything but the most abject poverty in the sort of future we're discussing here are kidding themselves.<br><br>Bottom line: You have many more options than you think. But you're going to have to look at the hand you're dealt and make your choices. As ever, there's no simple out, and I think that's the point of this week's post.<br><br>The suggestions JMG has already made in the Green Wizards posts is an excellent start. And you're young enough to avoid some of the debt traps that your elders are caught in. It may not be the easiest time in history to be coming along, but I think it's pretty damn exciting.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c7483541522118476269 title="comment permalink">1/8/12, 11:43 PM</a><br><br>

There are hypotheses. Evidence is hard data documenting real, ongoing processes, not mathematical models being extrapolated beyond the limits within which they have been validated. The data document changes that in most of the globe have only just begun to exceed the range of documented historical variation. There is broad consensus that anthropogenic climate change is real and will have global ecological impacts; there is no consensus at all that this will lead to apocalyptic consequences. This conclusion is far from "irrefutable."<br><br>Gail and sgage -- you'll get no argument from me or JMG that humans are not having huge ecological impacts that are adversely affecting many aspects of ecosystems locally and globally. But this has been going on since we invented tools and fire all those millennia ago. The pan-boreal megafaunal extinctions of the late pleistocene were more likely caused by us than by the glacial cycles -- why did these critters survive ice age after ice age until organized hunters with advanced weaponry spread across the northern hemisphere? Much of Britain was deforested and converted to moorland in thousands of years ago by overgrazing. Native Americans' use of controlled burning altered the landscape here long, long before Europeans ever set foot on these shores. The arrival of the plow and the crosscut saw in the New World led to massive ecological upheaval centuries ago. Sure the rate of change has accelerated; but this acceleration happened in the 19th Century and one could argue that ecological decline is not happening much faster in the 21st than it did in the 19th in the industrialized world. This the era that lead to the second wave of megafaunal extirpations (remember the American Bison? Seen an Ivory-billed Woodpecker lately? Noticed any wolves recently?) and enormous soil degradation from deforestation and large-scale agriculture. <br><br>There's also a lot of confirmation bias going on among environmentalists (which I most definitely am one of myself). Declines and catastrophes are noticed much more than recoveries and successes. Yes the populations of the brown thrushes with the astounding voices have declined, and this is tragic. But meanwhile the populations of avian predators have ballooned (probably a combination of the DDT ban, better protection, and changes in attitudes among rural people with guns), and this is cause for celebration. Likewise most non-migratory forest birds in eastern North America have shown large region-wide increases in numbers -- the forests may be more stressed, but there are actually more of them than there were a hundred years ago in the eastern U.S. <br><br>Maybe apocalyptic predictions serve to motivate political change, though it has had no success at all in climate science where it is clear there is no global will for any meaningful action. I prefer reality rather than misrepresentations for political gain. But the fact is that we have been wreaking major change on global ecosystems for a very very long time. There is nothing new about this. The present always seems more vivid than the past, but that does not mean it is really more chaotic. I would repeat my own hypothesis here, that peak environmental degradation will coincide with peak fossil fuel consumption, which is more or less the era we are living in now. Beyond this peak I would think it is likely the degradation will slow down, to the point that it might even begin to reverse, even with climate change figured in to the equation. Hopefully the resulting global cooling will be slower than the preceding warming, or it will just restress the ecosystems that have finally begun to adjust to the warmer world.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c7296866641326149083 title="comment permalink">1/9/12, 5:51 AM</a><br><br>

I think the important point is that there is an unmistakable trend, just as you described, and absent any forces to change it, it WILL continue in the same downward spiral.<br><br>When I first noticed that trees are dying (August 2008) it was after 2 months of no rain, and I thought I would go crazy if one more person said what great weather we'd been having. I called the NJ DEP and asked them about the drought, and they said, there is no drought because the reservoirs are full. That's how they measure it, but of course it's very different for trees if they get heavier but less frequent downfall. So at that point I started reading up on climate change, and trying to find out if there were any snowpack measurements over time. And it became very obvious to me that by the very process of evolution - genetic adaptation - there is no way that all those complex interdependencies between species that develop over generations can be maintained if the environment they are in - temperatures and/or precipitation - is altered. Climate change is always followed by mass extinction, it can be no other way.<br><br>As if this wasn't depressing enough, ironically the next summer I observed that young trees being watered in nurseries, water plants, and annuals being watered in pots were exhibiting the same signs of foliar stress, and so I very reluctantly concluded that it couldn't be drought, and the only thing all this vegetation has in common is the composition of the atmosphere.<br><br>Since then I have learned some facts that are very well known to scientists and foresters and certainly to government agencies like the Forest and National Park services, EPA, and Dept. of Ag, facts established from decades of studies but rarely discussed - which is that ozone is even more toxic to vegetation than to people (which is potent considering ozone gives people cancer, heart disease, emphysema, asthma, allergies and is linked to diabetes, autism, ADHD - all epidemics).<br><br>Controlled experiments have demonstrated numerous times that plants exposed to ozone are more susceptible to insects, disease, and fungus, so when you see all those things attacking trees, except for some invasives (like the chestnut blight) those are naturally occurring species that lived in balance with trees until the trees became more vulnerable, like a person with AIDS. It has been proven that trees damaged by ozone allocate less energy to their root systems so they are more likely to fall over in wind.<br><br>I would love to talk to you more about your impressions of NE forests. I've been further down the eastern seaboard, out to the west coast and even Costa Rica - the same injured foliage is everywhere now. If you want you can email me through the same address as the blog: witsendnj at yahoo.<br><br>thanks<br>Gail<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c643976614806424237 title="comment permalink">1/9/12, 6:10 AM</a><br><br>

So its presence is dependent on ongoing sources of ozone precursors, mostly from fossil fuel burning. Thus its concentrations will rise and fall almost instantly as fossil fuel burning does likewise. So in the post-peak world, ozone will tail off too. The same is true for nitrogen, sulfur, mercury, CFCs, and heavy metal deposition as well. Methane is more complex with all its natural sources; but the big thing we are stuck with is CO2 for centuries to come. <br><br>Most (probably all) apocalyptic atmosphere/climate change scenarios assume unlimited growth in fossil fuel consumption. This just ain't likely to happen. I think we will be lucky (???) if we can push the fossil fuel economy far enough to get CO2 much above 500 ppm before it begins to tail off. It has been FAR higher than this in the geological past without destabilizing earth's climate or rendering it uninhabitable. All that fossil carbon used to be in the atmosphere, along with a whole lot more that is now tied up in carbonate rocks. <br><br>There's also a negative feedback here if climate and air pollution stresses really begin to get far enough out of whack to affect economic activity. Economic distress means less industrial activity which means cleaner air and lower CO2 emissions.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c2179457031473189937 title="comment permalink">1/9/12, 10:02 AM</a><br><br>

My husband is probably at a similar place as your partner - he recognizes the problem and agrees with me about much of what will be necessary, but right at the moment he has a decent job and he feels too despairing about the future I talk about, so he focuses on things continuing as they are, while cultivating hobbies that could turn into future income. As far as townhomes and apartments go, I walk around the lawns at my apartment complex and apply permacultural principles to them in my mind, noticing where the water runs and where the sun shines and wishing I could plant fruit trees and imagining that I could convince the apartment management to start up a community garden for residents. But it doesn't seem like the sort of thing they'd do.<br><br><br>@Leigh: That is excellent advice. My disability is a major mental illness, so my function is just extremely inconsistent. Sometimes I can do quite a lot, sometimes nothing at all. I have looked into community gardens, but I can't drive, so most of them are inaccessible to me. One is associated with a nearby church, so I am working on overcoming my interaction issues enough to see if I can be involved with that. Thank you for your well-wishes.<br><br>@ChrisBalow: Debt is a problem that has plagued me. I contracted 60k worth of educational debt back when I thought I could have a nice normal career. If I can get the disability discharge for that, all will be well. If I can't, I will never be able to earn an official income (garnishment) - though that's not a likelihood anyway for me, and I will never hold any property under my own name (liens, though I don't know if it's legal for them to be placed for an unsecured debt), so if we buy a house it will be entirely under my husband's name. My worst fear is of the harassment associated with debt collection, but if I don't have a telephone and don't have my name on anything official, perhaps they won't be able to find me. When the student loan bubble pops, I think there will be even more people in my situation. That will probably be the single biggest impetus for the coming increase in the gray economy - because one of the penalties for student loan default is loss of professional certifications, I am sure there will be doctors and professionals of all stripes trying to eke out a living on the margins, and plenty of other people who can't afford to pay a doctor who has to pay their student loans supplying business for them.<br><br>@EchosRevenge: Your situation sounds pretty great - I wish I'd met you before I left the Seattle area last spring.

My husband and I actually did/do have the opportunity to effectively homestead a piece of family land, but it is so far away from the nearest town that working off of it was not a reasonable option and working on it would be a particularly grim sort of poverty. But that is our fallback. What I want is an acre or two near an urban area - for my husband to commute to for now and to be a market for his smithing and my cheese-making in the future, should the future work out for us according to my dreams. I don't expect an escape from the troubles; mostly what I hope for is to be in a position where I don't have to stare at my life saying "I knew exactly what I could have done to be more okay, but it simply wasn't possible." The future is exciting except where it leads to that sort of bitter frustration! I want enough land to produce my own eggs, milk (goats), fruits and vegetables, both for health and ethical reasons as well as to be a little store of security for the future, but I agree that the self-sufficient mountain-man ideal isn't the best approach (for an Alaskan, it is sort of a cultural ideal and so was hard to shake).<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c2303147080466409122 title="comment permalink">1/9/12, 11:43 AM</a><br><br>

Dying and dead trees are of course a normal part of the ecosystem, but when I see places where the majority of trees are unhealthy, of many different species and ages, that seems to indicate there's a problem going on. Where I've noticed this the most is in the Appalachians. I have lived briefly in Vermont and also in the NC Mountains. It's not nearly as bad in Missouri, although we have our own issues out here such as black oak decline, I don't see many forests where the majority of the trees of many different species are clearly unhealthy.<br><br>Often, the invasive species move in when the natives are already unhealthy, and then they take all the blame. There are certain invasives that I've seen taking hold in what seems to be pretty healthy forests, a notable one being oriental bittersweet, but even there I wonder how much of that is due to shifting baselines of what we consider healthy. Even when there's no invasive involved, one or a couple natives that are better adapted to the changed conditions will take over what used to be more diverse woods.<br><br>When in NC, I repeatedly saw areas where mountain laurel and rhododendron were the only species that were healthy, with the trees above in decline and no seedlings or wildflowers under the dense evergreen thicket. If the current trends continue, the trees above will die and leave a monoculture, which was already happening in some places. Mountain laurel and rhododendron are acid lovers, so I think the acid rain that's hit the Appalachians hard favors these monocultures.<br><br>I've heard that many experiments have shown that adding nitrogen to an ecosystem decreases diversity, as the weedier species that can take advantage of it choke out the others. Air pollution adds extra nitrogen to the system, and we also happen to be seeing a decline in diversity and increase in weedy species in many places. Of course there's other factors involved, but I think nitrogen is one that few know about.<br><br>The book "The Dying of the Trees" by Charles E. Little investigates these trends all across America. When I read it a few years ago (at the same time I was living in NC and the same trends were staring me in the face) it was the first time I had found anyone who noticed the same thing I had, and more. One of the things he reports on is that the hemlock adelgid epidemic might have been caused or at least greatly exacerbated by nitrogen pollution, as experiments show that giving hemlock trees extra nitrogen causes them to concentrate more of it in their needles, which in turn greatly increases the growth rate of adelgid populations. The adelgid was first found in Virginia in the 1950 and considered a minor pest, then three decades later started spreading like wildfire and killing so many trees.<br><br>While ozone and nitrogen pollution will decline along with the descent of industrial civilization, I am still quite concerned about all the more persistent pollutants that abound, and many will get worse before they get better because there is a lot that is locked away right now but may leak into the environment during the decline.<br><br>One thing I'm not sure about is how long the effects of acid rain would last in vulnerable environments, as they are to some degree cumulative. The acidic rain depletes alkaline minerals such as calcium, and even if the rain somehow returned to normal immediately, the effects in the soil would linger, but for how long I don't know?<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c5466237295658163760 title="comment permalink">1/9/12, 2:57 PM</a><br><br>

The central and northeastern U.S. and central Europe have been big (and well-studied) problem spots for decades; in the U.S. there are also some areas in the western mountains near big cities (S. California, Colorado front range, Wasatch front, etc.). I'm sure it must be happening in the rapidly industrialized parts of Asia too. As I mentioned before, add this to the long list of ongoing strains and stresses that humans have been putting on ecosystems for at least the last 10,000 or 20,000 years. Long-term effects -- certainly; but the world we live in is already a palmipset of the long-term effects of layer upon layer of human impacts stretching back far into prehistory.

As I recall, there's some evidence for drastic changes in forest cover during the sudden temperature shifts at the end of the last ice age 11,500 years ago. Again, this is what rapid ecological change looks like; I'd encourage people to get used to it -- and to look into what they can do to help maintain the resilience of local ecosystems. I'll be posting something about that in a bit.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c8073355479770027306 title="comment permalink">1/10/12, 7:35 AM</a><br><br>

If I was your age today, I know I'd be in your shoes, too, because I was in your shoes back in the 80’s. In college, most fellow alums saw their degree as a ticket to maintaining affluence; my graduate school was a horticultural program, and all I wanted to do was farm.<br><br>But with neither land, equipment, nor development dough, farming simply wasn't an option for raising a family under Reaganomics. House flippers got rich and farmers all but disappeared. So each wave has its challenges.<br><br>New farmers today have a wealth of help simply unavailable even just a few years ago. County extension programs and classes, on-line courses, and work/trade options on working farms, all add up to a horticultural support system very often overlooked. Oregon State University Extension has a “farmer incubator” program that’s phenomenal. And of course there’s been a steady growth of organic outlets, farmers markets and CSA’s everywhere.<br><br>But where to find farmland? As JMG has mentioned here before, it is vitally important to revive the moribund safety-net institutions, in particular the Grange, or Patrons of Husbandry. While many local Granges have been sadly shuttered, many more are still hanging on by a thread. Though your average Grange may appear to be nothing more than a social club for a handful of old-timers, they've at least managed to keep their buildings somewhat intact. With new membership, these kitchen/halls can and will support a vast array of community feeding efforts, both socially and nutritionally. Occupy the Grange!<br><br>But the pertinent point here: this is where the old-timers ARE, and they’re the ones with the land. Here's an excerpt from Joel Salatin’s excellent new book Folks, This Ain't Normal (inspirational, wizardly and funny) describing a wannabe farmer’s search for land:<br><br>“…He wrote three farmers in the neighborhood where he grew up, explained his situation, and asked each if he could rent a few acres to get started. He reported to me that not only did all three write back to him, but all offered him their entire farm “because my kids aren't going to do anything with it…”<br><br>“…I routinely receive letters from elderly farmers wanting to rent or give away their land to some young person who will love it and care for it. These aging farmers say their children will just sell it for development…”<br><br>And now at the end of the housing bubble, even that automatic assumption is under drastic review in the rural areas. Here in Oregon, a group called Friends of Family Farmers has a matchmaking service for those seeking land and land-owners seeking stewards. <br>Perhaps other regions have something similar?<br><br>I raised five kids as a renter for over 30 years (not farming), and just bought a house on 6 acres last spring. <br><br>There are so many ways it can be done! Good luck!<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c6480393900270208709 title="comment permalink">1/10/12, 9:05 AM</a><br><br>

I think most people can read the tea leaves and understand, on some level, that change is coming (whether or not this is admitted is another problem entirely). Most people do not enjoy prolonged periods of instability or uncertainty and very badly want a resolution to the current crop of problems on the horizon. This manifests itself as either a miracle cure or a catastrophic failure. Either way, the after-world is seen as fundamentally different in some way, but stable.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c4365071304146048166 title="comment permalink">1/10/12, 1:19 PM</a><br><br>

We as a species have consistently killed and sometimes eaten the megafauna that move through these forests. Particularly those that pose a threat to humans even today.<br><br>The megafauna have a very big role to play in these forests - it's not just the trees. Think clearing, fertilising, spreading seeds. If you take these out of the ecology, then the ecology will change to a new equilibrium which will inevitably be simpler and less complex. Don't go looking for complex factors - it is our fault we upset the equilibrium. Bill mentioned this as well. Take out the megafauna and you'll find that you have to manage the forest environments yourselves.<br><br>I'll note that there is nothing new to this situation and it has occured historically with indigenous peoples as well. It is one of the steps along the road to a sustainable culture and it has to be addressed. There are very good reasons the Aboriginals here used to be so excellent with fire practices after they ate the megafauna. Think diprotodon.<br><br>What I'm noticing here is that through this mountain range as well as the usual marsupials, we now have escaped deer, pigs, foxes, rabbits and goats as well. They all contribute individually to the forest ecology.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=waiting-for-great-pumpkin.html#c2059993060726817882 title="comment permalink">1/10/12, 2:19 PM</a><br><br>

The first speakers were a couple who started organic farming by working farmers markets and taking over a kitchen garden spot in the backyard of a farmer who'd grown too old to farm and wanted the quarter-acre put to use.<br><br>For two years this couple lived in an old travel trailer, and were never more than 32 feet apart!. The woman described taking quick sink baths at Lowes Hardward. Reminded me of my early thoughts on mapping my city: know where to forage, know where the restrooms with showers are located. Sadly, the ones i know (office building, public television station, community college chem labs) are all now under lock and key.<br><br>The couple saved $110 thousand dollars and bought land in the center of our state. $50K from saving and $60K from forming an LLC and selling stock to friends and family. I offer it as the other side of the debt discussion here as the ungodly amount of up-front money and sacrifice it seems to require at least one couple in order to go "back to the land." Motivation is everything. <br><br>Am reading Gaia's Garden by Toby Hemenway. He states the largest rainwater collector is your roof, so take the freebie tip! to offset the ginormous money topic above.<br><br>It was announced last week the farm incubator that's been running now for five years is in a position to expand and offer 2-5 acre plots to lease for continuing use.

Still, if the goal is learning to be poor, you're actually in a great position, right?? The most I can add is, network with your neighbors; you don't have to have the same ideology as they do to set up mutually beneficial arrangements.<br><br>As far as debt is concerned, I like to recommend the "debt snowball"; it worked well for us. Pay the minimum amount on everything but the debt that can be paid off first; pay as much extra on this as you can. When the first one is paid off, put all the money that was paying down the first debt into the second every month, and so on. If you don't have much extra money each month to use to pay down debts, that's okay; you just start with a very tiny snowball. Whenever you get a windfall, take 1% of it and treat yourself; then throw the rest at your current debt snowball. Paying off debt, like collapsing a society that has overshot its resources, takes a long time. Be patient, and take comfort in the idea that at least you have a plan.<br><br>@Candace: the Germans (of course it's the Germans) have a related word: "Lebensluege," the lie of your life, or the lie that lets you keep living. Many people's Lebensluege is that some new technology will save us, or that we'll continue to progress forever.
