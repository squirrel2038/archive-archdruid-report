Some of my readers have wondered aloud why it is that I’ve devoted so much time in recent weeks to the current flurry of 2012 prophecies and their close equivalents. One reason is that there’s good reason to think that we’re going to hear quite a bit more about these prophecies in the months to come; unless I miss my guess, the apocalyptic bubble that’s inflating now, and will pop this coming December 22, is going to be one for the record books. Still, there’s at least one more reason to pay close attention to that bubble just now.<br><br>It’s not often remembered these days that the literal meaning of the word "apocalypse" is the revelation of something hidden. The term got its modern meaning because most of the prophecies that have been so labeled claim to reveal one hidden thing in particular, that is, the imminent end of history; but there’s another sense in which the word is even more appropriate, and that sense seems worth exploring just at the moment. The presence and popularity of apocalyptic beliefs, I’ve come to think, reveal something important about any society in which such beliefs occur.<br><br>Apocalyptic thinking, after all, doesn’t come out of nowhere. It has an extensive history behind it, a point I tried to make in my recent book <a href="http://www.vivaeditions.com/book_page.php?book_id=25">Apocalypse Not</a>, but it also has roots in the collective psychology of any society in which it becomes popular. Epochs awash in apocalyptic beliefs are also full of intense social stress, but there are stressful periods in which very few people spend their time feverishly getting ready for the end of the world. What seems to do the trick is a particular kind of stress—specifically, the kind that happens when the narratives a society uses to make sense of the world no longer work.<br><br>I’ve talked more than once in these essays about the immense role that narratives play in our mental and social lives. As human beings, we think with stories as inevitably as we eat with mouths and walk with feet; the stories we tell ourselves about the world define the way we make sense of the "blooming, buzzing confusion," in William James’ phrase, that the world out there throws at our sense organs. In what we are pleased to call "primitive societies," a rich body of mythology and legend provides each person with a range of narratives that can be applied to any given situation and make sense of it. Learning the stories, and learning how to apply them to life’s events, is the core of a child’s education in these societies, and a learned person is very often distinguished, more than anything else, by the number of traditional stories he or she knows by heart.<br><br>More technologically advanced societies often, though not invariably, move away from this, consigning their inheritance of stories to children—think, for example, of the role of fairy tales in nineteenth- and twentieth-century industrial societies—while narrowing down the range of stories adults are supposed to think with, until all that’s left are variations on one narrative. Serious thinking in these societies is by definition thinking that follows the accepted narrative. To be a respectable thinker in the heyday of the Roman Empire, for example, was by definition to filter the world through a narrative that described how original chaos was reduced to order, peace and prosperity under the paternal rule of a benevolent despot. Roman religion applied that narrative to the cosmos, Roman philosophy applied it to the relation between mind and body, and so on. The difficulty, of course, came when the world started throwing things at the Roman world that couldn’t be made to fit the narrative.<br><br>We’re in much the same situation today. Our core narrative, the story into which every serious thinker is required to fit his or her thoughts, is the narrative of progress—the story that defines all of human existence as a single great upward trajectory from the caves to the stars, and insists that the present is better than the past and the future will inevitably be better still. The problem with that narrative, of course, is that for most people the present is significantly worse than the past—standards of living for most Americans, for example, have been declining for more than thirty years—and the future promises to be even worse than the present. The narrative of progress has no room for that perception; in public life, the only way in which it’s possible to bring it up at all is to suggest that someone or something is to blame for the temporary lack of progress, and then offer a plan to get the obstacle out of the way so that progress can get under way once more.<br><br>Politicians, pundits, and serious thinkers of every kind have been making exactly this argument for a good many decades, though, and it’s started to sink in across a very broad range of the social spectrum that something has gone very wrong. There have been, so far, two main responses to this recognition. The surge in apocalyptic prophecies is one of them; the logical response when one narrative fails to make sense of the world is to look for another narrative that does a better job, after all, and the narrative of apocalypse—more precisely, the religious narrative of paradise, fall, and redemption in which apocalyptic prophecy has its natural habitat—is one of the very few alternatives that most people in industrial societies are willing to take seriously.<br><br>The second response to the recognition that the narrative of progress has failed is to rehash it over again in an even more extreme form. The poster child for this second option just now is a video titled <i>Thrive</i>, which is doing the rounds in the alternative scene as I write this. Those of my readers who are connoisseurs of meretricious nonsense may find it of interest, but I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone else; we will all be hearing far too much like it over the years to come.<br><br>The basic message of <i>Thrive</i> is that we all ought to be living in a wonderful Utopian world, and would be doing so if evil corporate conspiracies weren’t suppressing the inventions that would have given us limitless free energy, cures for cancer and, well, pretty much anything else your heart desires. Evidence? We don’t need no steenking evidence—and of course, in an entirely pragmatic sense, <i>Thrive</i> doesn’t; all it has to do is hammer over and over again on a set of emotional hot buttons until the viewer’s ability to reason is overwhelmed, and if the video fails at this, it’s certainly not for want of trying. It’s a pity, in a way, that <i>Thrive</i> wasn’t yet in circulation when I wrote last year’s posts on thaumaturgy; it would have been educational to go through it scene by scene and talk about the crassly manipulative tactics it uses to get its effect.<br><br>Anyone interested in a thorough critique of <i>Thrive</i> should read <a href=http://transitionculture.org/2012/01/09/film-review-why-thrive-is-best-avoided/ >Rob Hopkins’ cogent essay</a> on the subject. For our present purposes, the point I want to make is that <i>Thrive</i> is an all-out effort to uphold the narrative of progress in the teeth of the facts. The narrative of progress says that we ought to have cheaper, more abundant energy with every passing year; in fact, the industrial world’s supplies of cheap abundant energy are running out fast, with predictable effects on price and supply, but those effects and their causes simply can’t be squared with the narrative of progress. Enter a flurry of accusations of conspiracy, which make it possible to insist that progress is still continuing but its fruits are being withheld from the people. The claims that cures for cancer are being suppressed has the same role with regard to the ongoing collapse of public health in America and elsewhere: we ought to be getting healthier, but we’re not, so a scapegoat has to be found to justify the widening gap between the narrative we prefer and the reality we get.<br><br>For all the problems with apocalyptic thinking, then, the prophets of apocalypse have at least gotten the first step right; having noticed that the narrative of progress doesn’t work any more, they’ve gone looking for an alternative, and it’s simply their bad luck that the alternative they’ve chosen doesn’t work either. Of course that raises a challenging question: if the narratives of progress and apocalypse don’t fit the world in which we’re living or the future that’s looming ahead of us, what narratives do?<br><br>Mulling over this question a few days ago, I started making a list of the more obvious features of the story in which we find ourselves at this point in the turning of history’s wheel. I encourage my readers to follow along, and see whether or not the answer that struck me occurs to them as well.<br><br>• We live in a world dominated by a vast, slowly decaying empire that gets quite literally superhuman powers by feeding on what we may as well call the blood of the Earth;<br><br>• That empire is ruled by a decadent aristocracy that holds court in soaring towers and bolsters its crumbling authority by conjuring vast amounts of wealth out of thin air;<br><br>• Backing the aristocracy is a caste of corrupt sorcerers whose incantations, projected into every home through the power of the blood of the Earth, keep the populace disorganized, deluded and passive;<br><br>• Entire provinces of the empire are ravaged by droughts, storms, and other disasters caused by the misuse of the Earth’s blood, while prophecies from the past warn of much worse to come;<br><br>• Meanwhile, far from the centers of power, the members of a scattered fellowship struggle to find and learn the forgotten lore of an earlier time, which might just hold the secret of survival...<br><br>It was more or less at this point that the realization hit: we have somehow gotten stuck, all seven billion of us, inside the pages of a pulp fantasy novel.<br><br>Those of my readers who are significantly younger than I am, and missed the vast outpouring of cheap fantasy novels that played so large and disreputable a role in shaping my youthful imagination, may benefit from a bit of history here. The runaway success of J.R.R. Tolkien’s trilogy <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> in the late 1960s inspired publishers, who are after all in business to make money, to look for ways to cash in on the same market. One obvious gambit was to dredge up older fantasy fiction, and much of what was readily available was the pulp fantasy of the 1920s and 1930s, when H.P. Lovecraft’s overheated prose and Robert Howard’s overheated gonads filled the pages of <i>Weird Tales</i> magazine and the imagination of teenage America with musclebound barbarian heroes, tentacled horrors from three weeks before the beginning of time, and most of the other modern conveniences that have furnished fantasy fiction ever since.<br><br>Lovecraft and Howard were, alas, both dead when the late-Sixties fantasy explosion arrived, and so their ability to produce new works was somewhat limited. For a while, accordingly, it was possible for almost anybody who could write a literate English sentence to get into print as a fantasy novelist. Most of what flooded onto bookstore shelves in the years that followed was remarkably atrocious, with two-dimensional characters, engagingly bad prose, and utterly unconvincing plots duking it out in a loser-take-all contest. At the time, I wasn’t a stickler about quality—I was in the market for anything more colorful than the two-dimensional blandness of an American suburban childhood—but I did prefer those who could write well; Tolkien’s trilogy was one of those favorites, and so were the products of the busy pen of Michael Moorcock.<br><br>These days Moorcock counts as a serious novelist, having clambered up out of the mosh pit of pulp fantasy fiction into the rarefied balconies of literature. Back in the day, though, he was among the leading figures in the pulp fantasy revival. Better than any of his rivals, perhaps, Moorcock recaptured the flavor of the gloriously trashy <i>Weird Tales</i> era, penning sprawling sagas about a succession of heroes who were all iterations of one Eternal Champion, destined to hack his way forever through an infinity of parallel worlds. And the backgrounds against which Elric of Melniboné and Corum Jhaelen Irsei and Dorian Hawkmoon and the rest of them suffered, swaggered and fought? More often than not, they were vast and crumbling empires propped up by supernatural powers, ruled by decadent aristocrats who conjured various things out of thin air, full of corrupt sorcerers, whole provinces ravaged by disasters, and—well, I suspect you get the point by now.<br><br>Aside from the colorful details just mentioned, though, there was something else woven into the pulp fantasy of that era, Moorcock’s and otherwise. The worlds of pulp fantasy are by and large worlds in decline, strewn with immense ruins and scattered with artifacts no one can duplicate any more. The heroes of pulp fantasy are caught up in the undertow of decline, and their battles and quests are generally defined by legacies of the pre-decline past that have to be preserved or destroyed before the future can begin to take shape. Interestingly, that was as often true in the <i>Weird Tales</i> era; Conan the Barbarian, who was placed by his creator Robert Howard somewhere in the conveniently undocumented past between the fall of Atlantis and the beginning of recorded history, spent much of his time dealing with the half-remembered legacies of the assorted drowned continents that Howard borrowed from Theosophical literature.<br><br>J.R.R. Tolkien, whose name I’ve invoked a couple of times already in this essay, worked with the same theme. There’s been a great deal of literary criticism of Tolkien’s work down through the years, but I don’t recall seeing any that’s talked about the extent to which Middle-Earth was influenced by the pulp fantasy of the 1920s and 1930s, which Tolkien (like his friend C.S. Lewis) read eagerly. One of the things that makes Tolkien’s work so inventive is the way that he plopped a bunch of hopelessly middle-class Englishmen dressed as hobbits into a world full of pulp fantasy clichés, complete with heroic survivors of drowned Atlantis—excuse me, Númenor—and an evil wizard-king who rides a tame pterodactyl into battle. Framing this arguably satiric dimension and the story as a whole there is, once again, the theme of decline: the twilight of the elves, the last hurrah of the heirs of Númenor, and the end of a sad and tangled story that had been winding down since the Elder Days. Middle-Earth is not a place where progress happens, any more than Conan’s Hyborian Age or age of the Young Kingdoms in which Elric wielded the black sword Stormbringer.<br><br>A brand of fiction commonly dismissed as sheer escapism, in other words, provides narratives more useful to the current state of the industrial world than the supposedly serious narrative of progress that still shapes every detail of contemporary public discourse. I’m not sure how far to take that point, though I have to admit that if Mabelrode the Faceless, Demon Lord of Chaos, were to be named as CEO of Citibank, I’m not sure I would be surprised. (On the other hand, maybe he already has been; it would explain a few things.) It would arguably have been better for us all if, when Edwin Drake and his men went to drill the first commercial oil well at Titusville, Pennsylvania back in 1859, they had found an ominous standing stone there carved with glowing runes:<br><br><div style="text-align: center">THE BLACK GOLD IS THE BLOOD OF THE EARTH<br>THE FORCE IN THE BLOOD IS THE FLAME OF THE SUN<br>TO DRINK OF THE BLOOD IS TO MASTER THE WORLD<br>BUT THE FATE OF THE EARTH AND ITS BLOOD ARE ONE<br></div><br>Still, we missed that warning, and so have never quite gotten around to noticing that the world around us has much more in common with pulp fantasy fiction than it does with what passes for serious thought these days.<br><br>By this point, though, I suspect that you, dear reader, are wondering about one detail. If we’re actually stuck inside the pages of a trashy fantasy novel, as I’ve suggested, and all the details of the setting and the plot are in place, where is the protagonist? Who is the hero or the heroine who will turn the pages of the long-lost Gaianomicon, use its forgotten lore to forge a wand of power out of the rays of the Sun, shatter the deceptive spells of the lords of High Finance, and rise up amidst the wreckage of a dying empire to become one of the seedbearers of an age that is not yet born?<br><br>Why, you are, of course.<br><br>************************<br><span style=font-size:130%>End of the World of the Week #4</span><br><br>Some apocalyptic prophecies have a more embarrassing outcome than others, but for sheer anticlimax it’s hard to beat the end of Thomas Müntzer’s prophetic career in 1525. Müntzer was a defrocked Catholic priest who converted to Martin Luther’s newborn movement in the heady early days of the Reformation, then went right on past Luther into that peculiar region of thought where it seems as though divine omnipotence needs a helping hand.<br><br>In 1520, Müntzer became convinced that the Kingdom of Heaven would appear promptly just as soon as the righteous, whom he identified with the peasants, rose up and slaughtered the wicked, whom he identified with everybody else higher up the social ladder. He spent five years wandering through Germany preaching his bloodthirsty gospel and publishing a series of pamphlets—the 16th-century equivalent of conspiracy websites—in which he denounced everyone who disagreed with him as slaves of the Antichrist. Most people dismissed him as a mental case, but he built up a small following.<br><br>In 1525, though, peasants in much of southern Germany rose up in revolt against the local barons, and Müntzer suddenly found himself in command of an army. After some preliminary skirmishes, his army and that of the nobility came face to face on May 15. In his speech to his troops before the battle, Müntzer insisted that he would catch the barons’ cannonballs in the sleeves of his coat. Moments afterwards, a rainbow appeared in the sky, and the peasant army cheered wildly, convinced that this omen proved that God was on their side.<br><br>The other side chose that moment to open up with all their artillery. In a matter of moments, those of the rebels who weren’t killed or wounded took to their heels and ran. Müntzer himself was caught hiding in somebody’s basement a few days later, and died an unpleasant death.<br><br><div style="text-align: right">--story from <a href="http://www.vivaeditions.com/book_page.php?book_id=25">Apocalypse Not</a></div>

I chuckled multiple times and love the idea of all of us being stuck in a pulp fantasy story. Perfect ending line, as well. I think the somewhat lighthearted take on a very serious subject is good for me this week--I've been feeling a bit melancholy the last few days, thinking of the future we face. I worry for my friends and family, for my community, for this entire odd collection of people we call humanity. Not to mention the rest of the earth and its inhabitants.<br><br>I still have yet to read The Lord of the Rings, but I have seen the movies. I realize that won't warm the cockles of your heart, given your respective opinions of the books and movies. I'll make it a point to read the books this year. Somehow, I never really got into fantasy. I was too busy reading trashy young adult horror, which I loved. (Christopher Pike being my absolute favorite.)<br><br>I'm curious about your expectation of apocalyptic mayhem over the course of this year. I haven't really seen much of anyone who is taking any 2012 doomsday scenarios seriously. It gets talked about on an abstract level, yes, but no one is really running with it yet. But I'm not as plugged into regular society these days, either. Are you seeing much of this happening already around you or is it something you expect to kick in later, as we get deeper into the year? Anything in particular you expect to trigger it? Say, a certain presidential election or some new economic chaos or just the general stresses and harsh realities of our decline?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=#c8370612322774685270 title="comment permalink">1/11/12, 9:53 PM</a><br><br>

For countless generations, their cultural narrative told them that the Messiah would lead them to the promised land. Instead, he was tried, convicted, and executed, leaving them right where they had always been, with the same Romans and Pharisees in charge. No other choice but to think the world must be about to end, I guess?

For example, in discussing peak oil, years into the discussion, the focus continues to be whether peak oil is true or not. The discussion hasn't really moved onto identifying the leading indicators, what are the risk areas, evaluating risk mitigation actions, or reviewing potential public and private policy reactions regarding security and well being.<br><br>It's almost as though the reason to discuss a problem is not to try to understand and evaluate potential solution, but rather, to gather followers by invoking widespread fear. <br><br>Hence the conclusion that the apocalyptical movement serves to fulfill a spiritual void... To allow a gathering of people to express vague ramblings over a commonly (mis)understood event that potentially could change the future of mankind.<br><br><a href=#c7375633142011583314 title="comment permalink">1/11/12, 10:20 PM</a><br><br>

People who expect the world to end, so long as they don't think they're supposed to end it, tend to be fairly passive about it all. <br><br>Echo, your skills were useful a lot less than 400 years ago -- my father-in-law and his brother helped get their family through the Great Depression by hunting and fishing in the swamp back behind the tarpaper shack where they lived -- and they'll be useful again in a lot less than 400 years, too. Sounds like you're fairly well prepared, in fact. <br><br>Bill, Judaism was awash in apocalyptic prophecy long before the time of Jesus -- the great contradiction there was between a theology that insisted that Israel ought to be the most important nation on Earth, and the historical reality that it was just one little nation among hundreds. As I see it, it would have taken more clarity than human beings generally have for the early Christians, many of them raised in a Jewish setting, to shake off that background. <br><br>J. Vorwald, you're almost certainly right -- and it's one of the things I've tried to get past here, by talking about causes, consequences, and appropriate action, rather than rehashing the non-question of whether peak oil is real or not. <br><br>Sean, many thanks for the link -- it's been a long time since I've read that story. <br><br>Joel, nobody who grew up reading fantasy fiction in my generation will be confused by "flesh golem." I was playing Dungeons and Dragons when it still consisted of three staplebound pamphlets.

In a sense industrialism *is* a kind of death-cult (a worship of dead, manufactured stuff as more intrinsically worthy and valuable than living beings who, increasingly, are considered strictly as feedstock or pseudo-machines).<br><br>I've been haunted the last week or two by an axiom that seems to sum it all up -- inescapably, I fear -- "Industrial wealth equals biotic poverty." And that's where we are right now. Industrially wealthy, though maybe not for much longer... and biotically so impoverished, pathetically impoverished, and with so little preserved knowledge that we don't even realise what we have lost or how poor we are. Scary.<br><br>LOTR weaves so many themes together -- some of which, as an adult and more critical reader, I find less palatable than I did at 10 or so on first reading. But one that still resonates strongly for me is the cost of industrialism, as represented by Saruman who had "a mind of gears and wheels" (or wtte) and cut down trees with a real modernist ferocity. Saruman's attempt to bring fossil-powered industry to the Shire is foiled, and repairs (tikkun olam as some would put it) are made, biotic wealth is restored: The Scouring of the Shire, one of the most moving and satisfying moments in the story (and one which the film version glibly omits, which irritated me almost as much as turning Legolas into a skate punk / surfer-elf).<br><br>Rather like those returning hobbits, I think we find that the work before us -- not so much old fogeys like me, though we should do our share, but the next generation -- is all about cleanup, repair and healing of trashed biota. Topsoil building is perhaps the most obviously urgent need (it hits us in the tummy, which generally gets our scatty primate attention) but *everything* needs cleaning up, bandaging and feeding and freeing and restoring.<br><br>Repair and cleanup are just not as exciting (particularly to average adventurous young males) as Boldly Going and Expanding and Discovering and Conquering and whatnot. Boring stuff, maintenance and repair and first aid; "women's work" in patriarchal terms -- but it desperately needs doing. Those who do it best will thrive best.<br><br>While we're on the Tolkien nostalgia theme, I just need to air a pet peeve. Why, oh why, is it that almost no one can resist *mis*quoting the pivotal poem about Aragorn? Note to all those manufacturers of fridge magnets and other imprinted tchotchkis -- what dear old JRR wrote was "Not all those who wander are lost" -- not "Those who wander are not always lost" or "All those who wander are not lost" or "Those who wander are not all lost" or "The peripatetic are not coterminous with the disoriented" for gosh sakes. OK, sorry, I just had to vent. Civilisation may be collapsing, but for some reason I still want people to quote accurately.<br><br><a href=#c6724308691698647752 title="comment permalink">1/11/12, 11:45 PM</a><br><br>

Must remember not to mention it to them.<br><br>I've always had to clean up after myself and it has made me disinclined to make the mess in the first place! Oh well.<br><br>I've enjoyed both the stories of Tolkien and Moorcroft. You're spot on - they are both set in a declining phase of a civilisation. The last hurrah of Numenor and the elves is so true. The background tales to the Lord of the Rings story (and there are quite a few) about the elves tell of paradise lost (corrupted really). Heroic efforts keep their civilisations grinding along, always at a slightly lower level than previously, but never on an upwards trajectory. The wolves (err Orcs / trolls / Balrogs etc.) were always at the door just waiting for an easy snack.<br><br>I always assumed that Tolkiens experiences during WWII and the decline of the British empire were what gave his writings their melancholy tone?

So far his suggestions seem too optimistic, and to assume far more political will than I think we'll be able to muster, but his focus on our narratives and on the spiritual side of the descent is really refreshing. <br><br>For my own part, I'm reminded of a theme I've seen in some fantasy worlds. If the decline is portrayed to its end, in many cases the loss of the accustomed powers is followed by the return of more primal forces.<br><br>You alluded to this when you mentioned the "forgotten lore of an earlier time," but the thing that stands out for me is the spiritual nature of the powers in the examples I'm most familiar with. The emphasis in <em>Sacred Economics</em> on spirituality in the sense of the consciousness expressed in our personal lives and our society is part of my attraction to it despite its more questionably optimistic ideas. If, as I think and he thinks, our progress- and material comfort-worshipping society is making us miserable, its demise may provide opportunities for (shorter, more arduous, far less comfortable but) happier lives.<br><br>As a Type I diabetic, I'm acutely aware of the hardships that we're going to face in the hopefully-distant-enough-that-I-can-die-of-something-else future. I am, in a sense, a dead man walking, born in just the right flicker of history that I don't have to die.

WOW! That's a grand idea! I dare not ask who the author of that novel might be! Our collective selves surely. Or is it? We are both writer and character. Interesting situation. <br><br>What interests me also is that in my little country of Mauritius, there is so little concern for the 2012 fantasy. I guess this is because we are still, collectively, in the grips of the narrative of progress. Furthermore given that the financial crisis since 2008 has had so little impact here and that standards of living and consumption are still rising the narrative of progress is still alive and kicking. No need of apocalyptic fantasies yet. I guess that I ought to watch out for the emergence of such fantasies as it could be a maker that the previous narrative is running out of steam here. <br><br>A few years back when a group of friends and myself began trying to raise interest in energy issues here, we realised that we would achieve little in way of change (the narrative of progress being too strong a spell!), however it was still important to talk and act because we were, in effect, sowing seeds of change that might or might not sprout when the rains came. <br><br>We came to believe that our world which we called the ancient world had begun to die away, the world to come, the new world was yet to be born, the transition would be difficult but not impossible!<br><br><a href=#c9109801230013714809 title="comment permalink">1/12/12, 2:14 AM</a><br><br>

Peak oil cognoscenti, including astronomers, astrologists, neo- and meso- and plain pagans, passive solar fans, etc., will no doubt find the suggestion that solstice is insignificant painful in the extreme.<br>With some help from Wikipedia,here are some alternate suggestions, as we seem to be in the mood for deep winter humouring:<br><br>January 7, 1800, Millard Freemore, 13th President, was born. After serving his term, he joined the "Know-Nothing" Party. Works well with contemporary mainstream media.<br><br>January 11, 1919, Romania reincorporated Transylvania. Works well with a vampire theme.<br><br>February 6, 1911, Ronald Reagan was born. He is "credited with generating an idelogical renaissance on the American political right". Unfortunately, Americans had forgotten the Depression era humourist Will Rogers, who correctly observed that wealth trickles up, not down; and elected Reagan and "voodoo economics". Works well with a zombie theme.<br><br>My proposal, however, for Nothing Happened Day is October 21. Ignore please Tokugawa's victory in 1600, or Nelson's at Trafalgar in 1805, both significant events. Focus rather on the birth of Kim Kardashian on October 21,1980.<br><br>A sleekly groomed form devoid of ethical and intellectual content is, I contend, a perfect symbol of the nothing (good) that is happening in the BAU oligopolies around the world. Works well with black hole and vampire squid themes.<br><br><a href=#c1683215434215527493 title="comment permalink">1/12/12, 3:28 AM</a><br><br>

Putting this in the context of some of last week’s comments, it seems that increasingly my generation (I just turned 50) will be looking to the next generation of teens and 20-somethings as those protagonists of change. To some degree my generation got stuck in the bogus political narrative of which side (liberal or conservative) could run industrial society most justly or efficiently, and how the spoils should be distributed. Most of us decided to hang in there a while with the system rather than drop out. Only a few were willing to look at a naked emperor. If anything comes out of 2012 it would be nice if this election year showed decisively that the old political story isn’t fooling anyone anymore. Well, I can dream.<br><br>So the next generation will have to be engaged in the more bracing narrative of leaving the old system and starting to build up new ones that could actually work for our resource constrained future. I spent some time yesterday getting my teenage son enrolled in a permaculture course for this coming summer, and was really inspired by the reality-based outlooks. Not much pining for a dead system; mostly just a lot of focus on hard work and working with what nature offers readily. <br><br>So for those members of the younger generation frustrated by a lack of resources, perhaps the bright side of that dilemma is that you may at least be more free to think anew and write the next chapter without one foot being stuck so firmly in the old system. You can rewire your expectations a lot more easily than my lot can.<br><br>Finally, while the apocalyptic way of thinking will surely attractive for many, there are going to be plenty of people who cling to the progress story hand over fist. Perhaps the various Titanic narratives might have some applicability here as well - refusing to believe in ice bergs, rearranging the deck chairs and going down with the ship.<br><br><a href=#c5322703282385153971 title="comment permalink">1/12/12, 4:15 AM</a><br><br>

That is how old world stories are remembered today, rambling, characters come and go, divergent events, non linear storytelling.

We are going to try to outlast their failing, artificially propped up bodies and we'll likely never be any more visible to them than ants are to us. I guess what I am saying is that the dangerous thread you left dangling here is to give the idea that they can literally save the world if they work hard enough and get widespread credit and recognition for our work and effort in reward, which is how fantasy is structured, but not how reality works for the vast majority of us.<br><br><a href=#c6607743359478960700 title="comment permalink">1/12/12, 5:47 AM</a><br><br>

That is, they are living lives that are poor in the material but rich in community. <br>Even where people haven't explicitly renounced the vision of progress, there is nevertheless a good-sized pool of resourceful individuals, craftsmen and women, artists, performers who have the skills to build the world that follows the one of progress.<br>For instance, I work in a large space, a former gatling gun maintenance facility on a decommissioned Navy base. I share the space with other craftsmen, welders, aritsts, blacksmiths, machine repairman etc. We seldom or never have discussions about progress or the apocalypse, but we are doing what we do, which is making a variety of things and in the process, inspiring each other and building our confidence that we can make just about anything with the limited means at our disposal. By anything, I don't mean satellites or smart phones, but certainly more simple, practical things like hammers, nails, shelter, boats, bicycles, hand carts and so on.<br>On the other end of the spectrum, my daughter is a musician and one of her jobs is as the piano player of a circus troupe. If the smart phones would stop working, her troupe would certainly be able to entertain and bring laughter to an internet-less world. <br>What I find encouraging is that there are already a good number of people out there choosing simpler, poorer lives by choice and not necessity and in the process working out the details of how to lead satisfying lives without the benefit of the fruits of progress.<br>Let the new narrative begin.<br><br><a href=#c4065349042871094280 title="comment permalink">1/12/12, 6:51 AM</a><br><br>

The difficulty, of course, came when the world started throwing things at the Roman world that couldn’t be made to fit the narrative.</i><br><br>Another interesting point, Roman history also conformed to this narrative as it was recorded. It was, by definition, a narrative history that couldn't handle the things being thrown at it that the rest of the Roman mind couldn't grasp. This would be an interesting explanation of why the fall of Rome is such a mystery and subject of debate. All of the source text and history was written at a time when the historians were strained past their breaking point to explain what was happening. Those who found new narratives were inaccessible and unpopular, if they existed at all. Their records are lost.<br><br>Consider the Huns. We remember Attilla as sort of the King Hun, the one guy you have to remember to know the huns because he was so vicious, savage and tough. He more or less singularly stands against the Roman Empire. I've read about the Huns, they sound like fierce, tough people with no clear leadership structure, most similar to my mind to the Comanche Indians. They were probably all more less like Attilla physically. <br><br>One problem the Europeans had with Comanches and Indians generally was an inability to understand there was no master commander. They would make treaties with a big chief that they assumed would be honored by every member of that chief's tribe, but that wasn't how it worked. He spoke only for the people who agreed with him, which meant those who disagreed would 'violate' the treaty conditions whenever expedient. Nonetheless, we wrote the history of Indians selecting specific individuals who gave us the most problems and we imparted upon them great and mysterious powers of influence over their people. We conquered the Indians though, so the narrative of progress works well enough. Compare the coherence of that history to the incoherence of our war on terror. <br><br>No matter the subject you choose, none of the major narratives make much sense. The environment, world events, domestic situations and so on are full of self-contradictory nonsense like Green Technology, or Rehabilative Incarceration. <br><br>Imagine trying to piece together why we fell apart in a few hundred years, using bestsellers like The World is Flat and Newsweek as primary documents that talk about stuff like that. You'd come away believing that we were engaged in some kind of all out, existential threatening war against an invasive , monolithic, global enemy with a constantly changing master mind and top heavy structure, yet hardly any mentions of the enemy actually carrying out any successful strikes, every 10 years or so some thing happens. You could argue based on reading our popular history that the war on terror is an existential threat that we are constantly losing or that its really nothing more than an afterthought, something that actually affects us less frequently than getting hit by lightning, and far less frequently than getting hurt and killed by our vehicles. Both would be right. You could also focus on our diets and related health problems and use that as the explanation, the industrial lead in our water so to speak.<br><br><a href=#c2756770606901483020 title="comment permalink">1/12/12, 7:09 AM</a><br><br>

While the idea of absolute choices: heaven or hell; progress or collapse; "the best and the rest"; eat or be eaten, is something I rejected early on, it seems to be an artifact of our evolution that still dominates our narrative. Over at TOD, we often see incremental and imperfect changes being rejected as inadequate. Folks are still looking for a silver bullet to replace fossil fuels rather than admit it is their world view and behavior that must change. The prevailing idea, the false choice between business (growth) as usual and total surrender seems to leave little room for the idea of a partial withdrawl. The western narrative especially, presents the concept of "giving ground" as a false choice.<br> <br>There are, however, some signs in this political cycle that reality is creating cracks in the armor of progress. While I in no way endorse Ron Paul, and share few of his views, his following so far is indicative of some acceptance of his message of falling back and regrouping. Too bad that those who embrace the changes he's espousing also seem to be those who think they will be the least affected.

By this definition you are, arguably, one of the most apocalyptic writers of our time (and I say that sincerely, not sarcastically). <br><br>Your writing today about how modern narratives are created/supported reminded me of something French social critic Jacques Ellul wrote in "The Technological Society" about propaganda. In this quote he notes how propaganda--which he felt was as big a problem in democratic societies as well as totalitarian ones (he wrote in the Post WWII period):<br><br>"Propaganda technique, moreover, creates a new sphere of the 'sacred'. As Monnerot puts it: 'When an entire category of events, beings, and ideas are outside criticism, it constitutes a sacred realm, in contrast to the realm of the profane.' As a result of the profound influence of the mechanisms of propaganda, a new zone of the forbidden is created in the heart of man, but it is artificially induced, in contrast to the taboos of primitive societies. When there is propaganda, we are no longer able to evaluate certain questions, or even discuss them. A series of protective reflexes organized by technique immediately intervene."<br><br>Keep it up and thanks.<br><br><a href=#c4726293088361828371 title="comment permalink">1/12/12, 8:38 AM</a><br><br>

It seems to be particular popular with teenaged girls, and, if the Twilight books/movies are anything to go by, tends to involve weak female characters winning the hearts of very teen pop culture vampires (or werewolves, ghosts, zombies, etc). <br><br>And this is not just appealing to Goth kids (who I think mostly have better taste in their supernatural literature).

When I read your description of the narrative, what I thought of was the first Star Wars movie, the one that premiered in the mid 1970s when I was in college. It doesn't exactly fit the narrative form as you've described it, but it's close enough that it might explain at least in part why the Stars Wars franchise was so successful.<br><br>The fantasy narrative I preferred as a girl wasn't any better. I loved the Pippi Longstocking books. Pippi was a girl of about 10 who possessed superhuman strength - not up to Superman's level, but she was quite capable of lifting very heavy objects, for instance. She lived alone in a city or suburb. If she had a mom, she never mentioned her. She loved her dad but for the first couple books he was out of the picture, living on an island in the Pacific. Pippi's two friends were the very conventional children next door, a boy and girl of about her age. The books describe their adventures together and in the third book, their trip to visit Pippi's father.<br><br>What I remember most about these books was the childrens' perception that the adult world was one that was completely unappealing to them. They wanted no part of it. In one of the books, Pippi concocts a spell to keep all three of them from becoming adults. I saw the adult world in much the same way at the time and wished I could take the same spell. <br><br>Perhaps this narrative, in the form of not wanting to grow up and face adult problems, is also one of the narratives that some people are caught in which create trouble for them and others. I think I've freed myself of it; in fact I enjoy my fifties much more than childhood and generally find life gets better as I become older. I think coming to grips with our current situation and acting from that perspective actually enhances the enjoyment. But it seems to me that part of the thaumaturgy of our time intends to keep most of us as powerless children, unable to make hard decisions and act on them.<br><br>Verification word: hooke<br><br><a href=#c6478405214709814375 title="comment permalink">1/12/12, 9:59 AM</a><br><br>

I was sort-of waiting for you to bring up this awful film. When I saw the trailer a while back I literally laughed until I cried -- I couldn't believe the hokey nature and finger pointing.

Several nights ago I found myself at a horrible music venue, and I spent most of my time thinking about the narrative that brought folks there, inspired the terrible music, and what narrative convinced me into the mix... Thank you JMG.<br><br>Also, to tag along on a comment I saw last week about what 20-something year-olds ought to do. I am one of those 20 somethings. I had a hell of a time extricating myself from the momentum and noise of progress, which ended me into the noise of apocalypse, and then onto something new... The hero of this tale, I suppose. I see in my friends and peers so much confusion. Most go to college, gleaning some hope, but then graduate and find that the future that was promised doesn't exist. I see a lot working like its a religion and spending like its salvation -- fancy phones, gizmos, and cars.<br><br> I work for myself and scrape by, doing as much as I can to need less and less money, but being an entrepreneur affords that... I wouldn't call it luxury, but maybe, perk? Instead of college, I opted to stay home and work on my mothers property, trading small rent and sweat labor and investing in a family project. I encourage my friends to at least get out of debt, stop drinking crappy beer and soda, and grow a garden at the very least. Most live in apartments or rented homes and don't have the ability I do. Luckily a good number of the folks that I know are in the farming and food world already, and are not afraid of getting dirty or sweating. The most important aspect I've observed in creating a more hopeful, resilient narrative is to watch the money flow and invest in local resources -- food, soil, wood, etc. That's my 2 cents, for what its worth.<br><br><a href=#c7563509696310282171 title="comment permalink">1/12/12, 11:34 AM</a><br><br>

Interesting. I also find it interesting to note that within fandom, fantasy overtook hard sf in popularity at least a decade ago. Perhaps this shift was more prescient than escapist after all? I'm not sure how to read the current popularity of steampunk, though -- a desperate re-casting of Progress in less realistic terms, so people can still enjoy it for awhile longer? Or a useful enshrining of a Can-do, Build-it-yourself ethic? I've seen several potential narratives told within a steampunk aesthetic, but I'm not sure if a canonical one has emerged.<br><br>Also, if the 1970s saw a brief emergence of the pulp fantasy narrative, but the 1980s saw the re-emergence with a vengance of the pulp science fiction narrative -- I wonder how much this clash of narratives subconciously influenced the Satanic Panic of the 1980s. I was born in 1980. My family was very mainline Protestant, yet the Satanic Panic still influenced my childhood. Too much involvement in "utter fantasy" was considered, not demonic, but vaguely "unhealthy". ::snort::<br><br>The mention of the Blood of the Earth put me in mind of Stephen Donaldson's Thomas Covenant series (which I didn't much like). Drinking the Earthblood would give the drinker the power to command the world, even to break natural laws. The human who does, instead of setting things right, breaks the Law of Death and makes things worse in the process or some such. Fairly apt.<br><br>As for fantasy novels, I actually suggest Christopher Paolini's Inheritance books. There are some interesting explorations of themes like the role of religion in a world rich with objective knowledge, the preservation and transmission of knowledge, the nature of power and responsibility, and the causes and effects of war, from a post-Boomer perspective. Sometimes a thinly veiled perspective, but it's still a good read.<br><br>@SLClaire: You're exactly right. George Lucas was explicitly inspired by the narrative of the epic hero as described by Joseph Campbell. As for the narrative of perpetual childhood, yes, I've noticed something similar: the abhorrence of any kind of child work-for-pay as "robbing them of their childhood"; the fascination with child prodigies; the enshrining of the twentysomething years as the pinnacle of life; the idea of "cougars" as older women who can still act like twenty-somethings; the beauty products to make you look and feel younger. And I don't get it. Perhaps it's because my own teen and twentysomething years weren't particularly bucollic. But I've found my life to be a string of phases, each new and different and full of things to learn and do and be and not a phase has gone by that I didn't appreciate in some way.<br><br>word verification: waygar.

I'd suggest that it's more useful to think of ourselves as cells, and not especially important ones, in the body of Gaia -- and thus utterly dependent on her life for our own.<br><br>***<br><br>JMG, you perform amazing feats each week; first writing a post, then reading all the posts linked in the comments, and responding to them.<br><br>I found Eisenstein's article to be <i>very</i> interesting. The key point to me is that rituals are meaningful only when they are seamless expression of our worldview--the ancestors watch over us, this wafer is the body of Christ.<br><br>My work is very involved with behaviour change and cognitive frames. Frames are certainly stories, as Eisenstein describes, but I had never considered behaviour as an <i>expression</i> of a frame. Eisentstein points out recycling is a ritual of a certain worldview. Insulating your home is a ritual of a certain worldview. So, when we do those actions, we are, for a while, living in a different world.<br><br>After reading your comment I re-read Eisentstein. My initial thought was that he had not expressly valued the human relationship with Earth over, say, the ant relationship. But I don't think that is what you mean. I think you mean the notion of a relationship with Earth is too grand for the reality--which is that we are just a few of the cells in this organism. That would be like E. Coli writing blogs about the relationship with our gut. Have I understood you?<br><br>If I have understood you, are you aware of any cultural stories which place humans in the relative position of intestinal fauna?<br><br>And, apologies for the long post, but I have another question. Again, I found the notion of rituals losing their power if they are not seamless expressions of worldview to be very interesting. Eisenstein says:<br><br>"I hope that the reader someday has an opportunity to be in the presence of someone who can invoke the ancestors for real. Such a person will never say, "I would like to invoke the ancestors...," which is two steps removed from a true invocation, or even "I invoke the ancestors, " which is one step removed. He will address them directly, and in his invocation you will hear truth. You will feel the ancestors' presence, and while your mind may doubt your heart will not. That feeling is unmistakable."<br><br>Since you are an expert in magical and lodge ritual, can you tell me if there is any practice to not give people new ritual until they believe in it? Don't give them the wafer until they know it is the body of Christ. Don't ask them to address ancestors until they know the presence of ancestors.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br><a href=#c5761860295987148822 title="comment permalink">1/12/12, 12:29 PM</a><br><br>

She also wrote a book about Quakers founding an interstellar colony -- Penterra -- which I can't remember too well; it didn't grab me like the Hefn novels.

Same old manure pile, different shiny tarp thrown over it. I wish someone would compost that manure and grow something good from it, instead of just shoveling it around from one heap to another. I like the secret formula shown briefly in the trailer, which is of course the formula for the volume of a torus, familiar from high school geometry. Apparently, though he believes in free energy, he does not believe in free information, as he is aggressively pursuing anyone who tries to circumvent his $5 fee for viewing the movie.

I was hearing today about the incredible future of the automobile, where it will become eternally connected to The Web and The Cloud, learn to anticipate your every need, be constantly aware of everything around it, the routing and traffic conditions, the weather, the positions of all the motherships of our benevolent alien overlords. Eventually it will drive itself of course -- though we at least seem to have given up on the fantasy that it will fly. Even those who were critical of this vision (safety, connectivity, all lost of little techie issues) never even hinted at the one big question that to my mind underlies all of this: What will these cars run on? Unicorn poop and faerie farts, apparently.

They are all set in mythical worlds that contain all of the elements of the classical fantasy fiction but allow personal interaction with that world through gameplay that can be highly immersive. 10 million people play World of Warcraft. Over one million people (including me) bought Skyrim (the latest chapter of the Elder Scrolls) at the end of last year. <br><br>To me, one of the most fascinating aspects of these games is the ability of the player(s) to change the storyline by making choices within the games. In Skyrim, for example, the ultimate stated goal is to rid the world of the dragon threat. There are however, literally infinite variations in the way one might reach that goal, revolving around how you develop your character and how you interact with the pre-existing characters and factions. Stated simply, the player is empowered to control their destiny in a way that seems unlikely to ever happen in the normal “apparent” world. In the multiplayer games like WOW, your ability to reach the stated goal (kill the most powerful enemy) is entirely dependent on your ability to learn your skill set and then work cooperatively with a fairly large group of others to accomplish that goal. Down the years, I have belonged to guilds in WOW and Dark Age of Camelot, that were comprised of hundreds of people scattered all over the world who came together to slay mythological creatures.<br><br>If one accepts the proposition that the current “opium of the people” is the thaumaturgically supported culture of television, mass consumption, and endless growth, I wonder how these games might be classified - in either a positive of negative sense .

In Hindu schools of thought and Tibetan Buddhism the word "kaliyuga" is used while in Buddhist East Asia the expression "dharma ending age" (the Buddha's Dharma slowly fading from the world and the world falling into chaos and hardship) is employed.<br><br>This is naturally quite the opposite of the religion of progress. Oddly enough in Asia people have abandoned such a perspective in favour of rampant industrialization and a supposed bright future of consumerism and progress.<br><br>Still, I've found that adopting a perspective of degeneration puts a lot of the world's history and social developments into a narrative that makes more sense than seeing things as being from caves to extraterrestrial colonization. It also makes life a lot easier because with such a perspective, particularly in our present day, one won't be emotionally invested in the mainstream narrative which is highly unstable and bound to end up a disappointment for most of us.<br><br>As you said some months ago, there is no bright future ahead.

Donaldson. It won't be everybody's cup of tea, but it has a lot of relatively unique aspects that set it apart from fantasies in the pulp model, and those differences may be worth considering if we are modeling our own era on that of a pulp fantasy. <br><br>(Who was it who said "We live in the materialized fantasies of our forefathers"? I think that was Philip Slater.)<br><br>Thomas Covenant, like Elric, is a very early and iconoclastic example of an "Anti-Hero". Somebody who does exactly the opposite of what a Conan-type pulp hero would do. But Thomas Covenant does so in a completely different way than Elric.<br><br>(Like Justin, I believe times today call more for Anti-Heroes than Heroes. The Hero narrative, as Justin says, is about progress, and also about individuality and autocracy; we need to focus more on community and harmony, especially harmony with nature. In fantasy novels you rarely see the lone musclebound hero starve to death in a famine, or freeze to death in a snowstorm; and those sorts of challenges ought to be nearer to our minds during the Fall of our culture, than hacking monsters with swords. Famines and snowstorms happen to Anti-Heroes much more often, they certainly happen to Thomas Covenant several times.)<br><br>Thomas Covenant tries his best to refuse and reject both political and magical power, whenever it is thrust upon him. Plus, you have whole societies of people who revere Stone, or Wood -- and all magic comes from the Earth itself.

Particularly when I'm running a game, I notice that the story is structured so there is always a solution, always a way forward if you work hard enough. I worry that real life doesn't always do that: I read one blogger who described reality as a 'broken MMORPG' because of this feature, and thus I fear that most gaming reinforces the idea of endless progress.<br><br>Ironically, when a player generates a character in D&amp;D, they're usually asked to invent a reason why they went adventuring, rather than staying safe and peaceful at home.

Does it belong on the same shelf as <i>The Warrior and the Sorceress</i>, probably the worst of David Carradine's many bad films? <br><br>Justin, no, not at all! Progress doesn't simply mean that somebody manages to survive, and achieve something in the process. The narrative of progress demands that the world at the end of the book or the movie must be better than ever before.

They were a nearly random assortment of people gathered around a very successful leader, including Greeks, Romans, and Visigoths -- "Attila" is a nickname, in fact, meaning "Daddy" in Visigothic.

Another way of thinking about it that I've come to over the last few years is recognizing that we are but one of many, many species on this planet, and we occupy a presence of similar importance. Yes, you can get into long debates about how much we've effected the world in comparison to other species and other such ideas, but that's largely irrelevant. We're not special. We're not better. We're not worse. We're just another species and, as a species, we have engaged in a wide variety of behavior both good and bad and, I suppose, neutral. But in the end, we're just a species here on this planet.<br><br>If we could collectively wrap our minds around this idea, I think it would help tremendously. We might be more realistic about our place in the world. We might engage in more responsible behavior. We might realize that we are imminently expendable and that there's no higher presence whose job it is to guarantee our survival. We can fall, we can thrive (ahem) we can most certainly die. It's a matter of how we act within the world as it exists, not as we want it to exist or hope it exists.<br><br>This mind frame has helped me tremendously and once you settle into it, it becomes all the more clear how insane and entitled we tend to be as a society. We think we can't fail, that the cards must, in the end, fall in our favor. That's a weird way to think about things and it provides the base from which we can evade responsibility. At the end of the day, though, that's bound to come back and bite us because we're <em>not</em> special or better or the golden species. We're just another one amongst many, dealing with the same world all the others are dealing with.<br><br>As such, one of my <a href=http://ofthehands.com/2012/01/08/a-new-years-plan-death-poverty-and-the-household-economy/ rel=nofollow>plans</a> for the new year over on my blog is to write a series of posts on encounters with and observations of other species in the hopes of promoting this world view. I think we have a lot to learn from the other species on this planet, who seem to deal with our world on much more realistic and wary terms than we do. Observing that behavior, learning from it, and mimicking it would serve us well, I imagine.<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=#c7857673315900813044 title="comment permalink">1/12/12, 6:50 PM</a><br><br>

I'm more interested in moving on to new and more useful narratives altogether. <br><br>Ghung, Kunstler's warning is a good deal more dire than I think even he realizes. We'd better get some stories of our own before the future hands its own picks to us, because its choices are not likely to be welcome at all. <br><br>Farmer, nicely put. "An' to hear duh lamentations of duh Democrats" just didn't cut it, after all. <br><br>Lucas, I think the call has been sounding with deafening force for years now -- it's just that most of us are wearing headphones cranked all the way up in an attempt to pretend we don't hear it. Thing is, there are no collective heroes; it's up to each individual to answer the call, or not. <br><br>Robb, one of the issues I have with Ellul is that he seems to forget that it's possible to refuse to submit to propaganda, or any other form of thaumaturgy. There was a lot of defeatism around totalitarian social systems back in the day, with people assuming that their triumph was inevitable. In the wake of the collapse of the Soviet bloc, those ideas need rethinking. <br><br>Lewis, of course! And then you'd have the classic backstory of the pulp fantasy novel, in which someone dabbled in powers far too great for them and unleashed a terrible evil on the world...<br><br>Susan, I expect to see a fair amount of the business with the credit cards, not to mention people quitting their jobs, defaulting on their mortgages, etc. December 22 is going to be an interesting day. <br><br>Bob, heh heh heh...<br><br>Cathy, excellent. I wasn't a great fan of Lindholm's novel, but that was mostly because I lived in Seattle at the time. As for endings, don't worry about them -- the ending of this story is far off, and none of us will be around to see it. It's just our part of the story that we have to attend to. <br><br>Sunbeam, the only possible response to that is "Mrifk!"<br><br><a href=#c5861806004994741671 title="comment permalink">1/12/12, 6:52 PM</a><br><br>

When you think about it, after all, <i>Twilight</i> is basically about a young woman who has to choose between bestiality and necrophilia, and opts for the latter.<br><br>SLClaire, that may well be true. I loathed <i>Peter Pan</i> when I was young; when it came down to it, what kept me going through childhood was a clear sense that I'd grow up -- if I'd believed back then that childhood was the best time I'd ever have, I'd have thrown myself under a truck. <br><br>Edward, no -- the one big evil master was Tolkien's contribution to the genre. In most pulp fantasy, the decadent aristocrats are in it for themselves, just like, oh, Lloyd Blankfein. <br><br>Don, I expect we'll start hearing about Nostradamus again as soon as 2013 comes around. <br><br>Lewis, Tolkien read Finnish fluently, and you're quite right -- he drew heavily on Finnish legend; the story of Turin Turambar is based on that of Kullervo, for example. <br><br>Justin, congratulations twice over! Once for helping to support a membership-based library -- we're going to need a lot more of those -- and once for pursuing a ham radio license. <br><br>Matthew, I used the "blood of the earth" metaphor precisely because it's the kind of over-the-top thing you'd find in pulp fantasy fiction. If you don't like it, well, that's not really my problem, now is it? <br><br>Twilight, good! Very good, in fact, and of course you're quite right -- Norton loved stories that centered on the secrets of the Old Ones, of one kind or another. I must have read everything of hers in print in my teens. <br><br>Mark, it's very good to hear from someone in your generation who made those choices, and is continuing to make them. Keep at it. <br><br>Laura, I'll have a few things to say about steampunk down the road a bit. <br><br>Ruben, you've understood exactly. As for magic, the sequence is exactly the opposite: first the student goes through the ceremony of initiation, then he or she practices the rituals and meditations that work off its symbolism and meaning, and finally he or she understands -- and it's <i>not</i> about belief; it's about integrating a new way of seeing and understanding the world, which is not the only way, simply a new way that allows new things to be understood and done.<br><br><a href=#c4347742081425004897 title="comment permalink">1/12/12, 7:20 PM</a><br><br>

In fact, it's the other way around. . . . . . Stories etch grooves deep enough for people to follow in the same way that water follows certain paths down a mountainside. And every time fresh actors tread the path of the story, the groove runs deeper. . . . . . This is why history keeps repeating all the time."<br><br>A wise man, that Pratchett!<br><br>Myself, I grew up on the Old Norse sagas and similar stuff. Here the master narrative is one of slow, inevitable decline. The oldest swords, the work of long dead master smiths, are stronger and sharper than any sword a smith can make in the protagonists' current age; the same holds for armor. The land is littered with traces of a greater past, even ruins of great stone buildings beyond the ability of anyone to match today. The warriors of the present cannot, as a rule, hold a candle to the heroic ancestors from whom they are descended. And the protagonists usually have died by the end of the saga, died without permanently solving any problem they faced, or securing any lasting peace for their descendants. All their best efforts merely slow a little the approach of mankind's inevitable doom. Indeed, the gods themselves will perish in a great final battle.<br><br>So much fantasy and science fiction seemed wrongheaded to me, with its narrative of progress. But I must except Tolkien from this judgement, for obvious reasons. Also, I must except Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover novels. I am surprised than no one else has mentioned Darkover here.

It's a point I'd like to communicate more widely. <br><br>Leo, indeed it does -- but notice that it assumes that culture now is somehow better than culture in the past. That isn't even remotely true, of course, and most people recognize it, which is why current iterations of the myth of progress stress all our technological toys and ignore the extent to which our arts and literature, to say nothing of little things like basic literacy, have been sliding downhill for a while now. <br><br>Bill, if Americans ever realize right down to their socks that they aren't going to have their cars any more, you will see a national nervous breakdown on the grand scale. Those mechanized metal penises are nearly the only thing propping up the national psyche these days. <br><br>Adrian, except -- as I pointed out to Justin earlier -- they're not. Most pulp fantasy heroes are on the defensive full time, trying to keep a worst case scenario from happening, and only just succeeding. (When they do succeed; they don't always.) One of the things that makes the old pulp fantasy so fascinating to me is that it stands so many of our expectations on their heads, taking the figure we expect to be a conqueror and putting him on the losing side, replacing progress with decline, and so on. <br><br>Wvjohn, heck of a good question. I haven't played any of those, nor expect to, so have no basis on which to make an educated judgment. <br><br>Pat, that's a fascinating analysis. I'll have to see what I can find from Koester. <br><br>Taranaich, but that's exactly what I'm suggesting. Progress isn't just temporary improvement; it's the notion that improvement is always additive and the future will always be better than the past. The Hyborian age follows a cylical theory of history -- I wonder if Howard might have read ibn Khaldun? -- in which kingdoms and civilizations rise and fall more or less in place.<br><br>Lady I., many thanks. <br><br>Shady, now find a third option to resolve that binary into a ternary!<br><br><a href=#c3292913878182865945 title="comment permalink">1/12/12, 7:36 PM</a><br><br>

In this narrative, growth and progress have usurped the god/gods of the past. I think people are unwilling to admit that progress and growth are over because that would in effect be denouncing their god. Much like the early Christians, they would rather die than betray their faith. <br>As far as the 2012 phenomenon goes a common belief I see is the idea of some global awakening and a birth of spiritual utopia. I wonder if when Nothing Happened Day happens and nothing happens, if it will be a wake up call for some (I am sure plenty of people will be angry/depressed). Perhaps those who heed it as a wake up call will tighten up their boots and get to work. At what point did Gilligan and the castaways give up on being rescued? At some point they had to accept that they either had to build a really good boat or give up on getting off the island and fully embrace island living.<br><br><a href=#c8711135696922797749 title="comment permalink">1/12/12, 7:37 PM</a><br><br>

Hesiod gives a parallel account in his <i>Theogony</i>, with ages of gold, silver, bronze, and iron, the latter being ours.

I've read the last few weeks, but felt little need to comment. You're saying what needs to be said. <br><br>I've been doing a bit of writing, as a bit of a cure for pulp non-fiction, I've been reading Shirley Toulson's book, <b>The Celtic Year</b>, and writing poems about the listed Celtic saints. It's amazing how easy it is to find druids in each story. The Celtic landscape seems absolutely *littered* with hermits and monastics who are running schools or monasteries or solo programs of various sorts, ready to take in the children of nobility and foundlings alike. I've begun my year by writing poem-prayers in honor of some of them, and maybe your readers will like them:<br><br>• <a href=http://andrewbwatt.wordpress.com/2012/01/08/poem-for-nathalan/ rel=nofollow>For Nathalan</a><br>• <a href=http://andrewbwatt.wordpress.com/2012/01/09/poem-for-saint-fillan/ rel=nofollow>For Fillan</a><br>• <a href=http://andrewbwatt.wordpress.com/2012/01/10/poem-for-saint-dermot rel=nofollow> For Saint Dermot</a><br>• <a href=http://andrewbwatt.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/poem-for-kentigern-january-13/ rel=nofollow>For Kentigern</a><br><br>I plan on keeping up with this for a while. It's good mental exercise, and while Shirley may be pablum, she's helping me to think back to another era of revival, when Ireland and England and Scotland were pulling themselves out of the collapse of Roman Britain. The lessons are instructive so far — an abundance of bad men doing bad things, while claiming leadership by right of force; and an abundance of good men, resisting through poetry, ethics, and placing insistent demands on 'good-ish' men with weapons. It seemed to work in favor of the Light, at least until the vikings showed up. <br><br>Anyway, enjoy!<br><br><a href=#c4700935695186119100 title="comment permalink">1/13/12, 8:01 AM</a><br><br>

Donaldson... here are a couple more of the relatively infrequently-copied memes from that series which have interesting applications to our modern times. (Very, very minor SPOILERS for those who haven't read them.)<br><br>At the end of the third novel of the first trilogy, the main bad guy, Lord Foul, is revealed to be not so much "Eeeeeevil" as he is simply a "perfectionist". The Land is filled with beauty and wonder and miracles, but it's just not quite <i><b>perfect</b></i>, and for that reason alone, Lord Foul wants to kill everyone, wipe away everything and replace it with something <i><b>he</b></i> believes is perfect. There's certainly an interesting lesson there about the Myth of Progress, and about the meme of the strong-individual, iconoclast Hero fighting for his own personal "Vision".<br><br>(Me personally, I really hate that aphorism about "The Perfect is the enemy of the Good", so I prefer to draw the lesson that no one person is entitled to define unilaterally what Perfection -- or even Good -- is for everybody else.)<br><br>I also note in the second trilogy, that it turns out not to be magic <i>per se</i>, but simply the sheer power of verbal propaganda and tradition -- what JMG basically calls "thaumaturgy" -- that has prevented the long-suffering people of the Land from healing themselves with Aliantha berries, or entering the healing land of Andelain. Lord Foul simply taught everyone to fear those things; anyone who wants to try is considered crazy and suicidal, so almost nobody tries, and when the protagonists do try those things, they are not believed when they tell everyone else. No magical mind-control compulsion involved (or rather, it's JMG's "thaumaturgy").<br><br>(No, JMG, I haven't read the third trilogy either...)<br><br><a href=#c126523406275028925 title="comment permalink">1/13/12, 9:10 AM</a><br><br>

The result is that members of the middle class continue on autopilot with extravagant behaviours they can no longer afford, while being frugal with aspects of their life they should not be (e.g. compromising their diet for the sake of luxuries).<br><br>And breaking free of that script is a painful but quite necessary process, which much of the middle class historically have not managed to do in times of crisis. Instead they become a kind of "walking dead" -- maintaining outward appearances, but barely alive (physically and psychologically) inside. And this because making the transition is more painful than the wretched existence they create for themselves.<br><br>I see Green Wizardry as a means of facilitating that -- an alternate script, with an alternate community to reinforce it. And making the (painful) change in scripts while still comfortable financially is likely to be far less painful than trying to do it at short notice in a time of need, as you often point out.<br><br>As an aside, it's also interesting to apply the "dead great-grandfather test" to Green Wizardry. (Are you doing anything better than your dead great-grandfather?) Components of it (conservation) do not pass -- your dead great grandfather uses far less energy than you ever could. This does not make energy conservation intrinsically a bad thing, just insufficient on its own, which is much in agreement with your points about SUV environmentalism. But the parts of Green Wizardry that revive the home economy most certainly do pass the test, and are in fact "generative" behaviours, as the author of that essay calls them.<br><br>Anyway, the article is worth reading, if coming from quite a different perspective.<br><br><a href=#c6441951036754711625 title="comment permalink">1/13/12, 1:33 PM</a><br><br>

I can't help seeing this as Tolkein's reaction to England when he arrived from South Africa, where he'd grown up, and where English-speaking society lived surrounded by the peoples, both Boer and black, that they had conquered and displaced within living memory, where no one was ignorant of the price that society paid for its survival.

Well, I thought to myself, these things have happened before. I remember visiting the Tuol Sleng prison in Phnom Penh in Cambodia where the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge regime described it's female victims as "she animals".<br><br>People, be warned, it's a slippery slope. When you begin to use words to describe other people as non-human (ie. zombie), then you are one step away from wickedness yourselves. Shame on all who promote such thoughts.<br><br>This is an old trick. Have a look into the Rwandan dramas. I think "cockroach" was the word there and I'm pretty certain it's a trick that's been used plenty of times before.

I've been fascinated for years by why people do what they do and I looked to things like cognitive sciences and sociology to understand. Your blog has filled in all kinds of gaps that they never even addressed, the biggest for me being the sense of responsibility, the morality of using what I'd learnt to influence people in one direction or another. I don't know if I'd ever have confronted the unease I felt about that if you hadn't challenged me to. <br><br>More than that though, when I first read the idea that progress was the religion of the world I live in, I thought that I understood and happily applied it to people I know and how they react to things like peak oil and climate change. Now though, it's finally sunk in that it was my faith too. It took actually experiencing the pain of that loss of meaning to really get that. I've been doing all the practical things to prepare for the future for myself and for my family, who don't get peak oil, when they need it. But now I realize I'm in no position to help anyone if or when they face this kind of crisis.<br><br>I'm a little lost now basically. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for that because it's usually a sign that some certainty that needed to go is on its way out, but I need some direction. I'm not sure exactly what my problem is but where I think I'm stuck is - it feels strange to consciously choose or create a new story, a new meaning for my life. It's like picking a religion from a menu. Surely whichever one I choose is arbitrary at the end of the day. They're all no more real than any other thought in my head and just as fragile and changeable. I could pick a new one every day. It feels lonely too because everyone around me is likely to have a different story. Somehow that doesn't feel real to me. <br><br>I guess I want the universe itself to have a meaning, I want it to come from outside of me, or other people. It's almost like having too much freedom - it's paralyzing me a bit. I hope this makes some sense to you. Where do I go from here?<br><br><a href=#c1748815102059322798 title="comment permalink">1/14/12, 6:38 AM</a><br><br>

This morning a peachy light suffuses the trees, all is quiet, and it’s not quite as hard to step out of the modern narrative and see all our stories as small windows into the greater Mystery.<br><br>@Thijs Goverde :<i>Our culture is pervaded by the feeling that things should and will get better than they were - but that's not actually a narrative is it? Not what you'd call an actual mythology.</i><br>Myth can be subtle – the Greeks didn’t see their stories of the gods as “myths” the way we define the word – they told those stories as truths. Just so, we tell the stories that “science will lead the way out of this mess” and “we deserve a break today” until they have the ring of unshakeable truth… but they are myths that in the length of time will vanish with our culture.<br><br><br>@Yupped: <i>To some degree my generation got stuck in the bogus political narrative of which side (liberal or conservative) could run industrial society most justly or efficiently, and how the spoils should be distributed.</i><br><br>I think to some extent every generation gets “stuck” in some similar difficulty – I have begun to see it as waves washing up a beach… it’s a smaller progress than we ever thought we’d make (I’m 56) and then we wash back out again… and the next generation begins its surge… but waves do sculpt a shore eventually.<br><br>@Justin: <i>One thing to keep in mind as an individual is that the narrative for the hero in our fantasy fiction also conforms to the narrative of progress. The hero fights, struggles, defeats his enemies and gets to win fortune and fame. Things go as expected in a progressive material advancement.</i><br><br>Well said – and that reminded me of LeGuin’s wonderful Earthsea series, where the individual hero is in fact remedying a grievous wrong he himself brought into the world! It’s a brilliant counter-story to the “individual glory” tale… again, I need to re-read that.<br><br>@Kieran: <i>It is a most curious sign of our times that a good part of today's teenaged girls are fantasizing not about living celebrities (sports stars, musicians, royalty, etc) but about the undead.</i><br>Not just teens! I know several middle age ladies who are in the same boat! ;-) Truly, that yearning after an all-powerful animus figure (the term is Jungian, think <i>Logos</i>) and/or the yearning to just put the problem in someone else’s hands is a strong one these days.<br><br>@Pat: <i>Koester is a theologian translating from the original Greek who stresses that 'apocalypse' means 'disclosure' and the prophets were actually trying to get the people of their era to wake up and see things as they really were so that hope for dealing and coping with things could be realized.</i><br>That doesn’t jive with the words of John’s Revelation- he definitely was seeing a huge upcoming final battle! See the possible consequences? But not “things as they are”…<br><br>@Odin’s Raven:<i>(Let's remember that the third member of the Inklings along with Tolkien and Lewis was Charles Williams.)</i><br>I have most, if not all, of his novels! I thought I was the only fan. :-} They are odd but very interesting, and certainly seem unique in their approach. Unless you know of other novelists like that? And the group bio “The Inklings” is a great history if you can get your hands on it.<br><br>@JMG: <i>Kieran, it concerns me deeply that so many people are trying to work out ways to project fantasies onto being dead.</i><br>Undead is just a new way of saying “immortal”, IMO, and the fantasy of being immortal has been with mankind from the start.<br><br><a href=#c7694707231461332557 title="comment permalink">1/14/12, 8:21 AM</a><br><br>

Surely the watering down of the sacrifice diminishes the whole impact of the story?</i><br><br>No, in the <b>original</b> story, it ends with her turning into foam, because the oaf prince still married the princess in a typical merger of noble domains. The movie has nothing of the real story in it, to my mind… and it grieves me to see my niece and nephew so fond of it… it’s like brain candy.<br><br><i>If they had coherent policies and vision surely they would not need such low tactics?</i><br>Good point. There did used to be a time when presidential elections had long debates full of information… but now they are choreographed advertising. I’ve stopped watching them.<br><br>@Don Stewart: <i>In short, if a person were addicted to such foods, or anything else which can cause harmful addictions, what methods can one use to bring to mind the proper world view?</i><br><br>As someone who’s recognized the addictive substances in junk food and strives to stay off them, I notice that I have to put new rituals into my life to replace the old ones (the old ones like “now it’s time to relax on the couch with a book and some potato chips”) I can’t just take the substances out of the ritual – in my case, I move to absorbing activities that don’t allow eating (ex: I spend the evening making fun art or crafts) until I have grounded that new ritual in my life. And I recognize that the chemistry of the junk food can compel a relapse simply by eating it once or twice - so I try hard not to! Probably the same with other addictions – avoid the substance and make new rituals.<br><br><a href=#c3615189544497030483 title="comment permalink">1/14/12, 8:23 AM</a><br><br>

Apologies if its duplicated.)<br><br>I'll take a shot at thinking about the zombies and vampires. It doesn't have to mean anything or be completely right to be interesting for speculation, we're all just inventing constellations anyway.<br><br>Zombies represent masses of people. In our fiction, they represent the unruly, dangerous and mindless mob. Vampires, at least as they are represented now in crap like Twilight movies/books or Blood Dawn on HBO, are young, sexy, mostly white, wealthy, sophisticated and eternal. There is also a conspicuous lack of technology in their power, it originates from magic. They seem to me like a projection the recurring search for the fountain of youth, and in our current iteration has been promised by science and demanded most vigorously of late by the wealthy in the form of Singularity type fantasy. The deliverance of that gift has been treated as an inevitable outcome until recently.<br><br>The Singularity movement actually believes that humanity will converge with technology and allow infinitely long lives with technology enhanced levels of activity and unending physical comfort. The worst part is that this their version of utopia! And the 'they' in question are all the people many of us also consider super genius visionaries like Steve Jobs and numerous lesser smart guys that are on Mensa lists and read Science magazines. <br><br>The one problem is that they/we didn't count on running out of energy to power all of this into eternity, but now that they are, that we are, our fiction is reflecting a different sort of vision.<br><br>The immortal beings in these new stories are either elite archetypes, or mindless masses, but they are all human. Take in the fiction of the 80s-90s that had immortal beings, they were primarily cyborgs, robots and humanoids. The utopia and dystopia of those pieces hinged on how it turned out the singularity turns out for humanity, a Matrix like dystopia or a Star Wars like awesomeness. All those movies accepted the premise that whatever the outcome, good or bad, we would achieve singularity. Those type of movies are no longer awesome, they are schlock like Transformers. Schlock is not necessarily bad. There is popular schlock, which is what Terminator was and True Blood is now. There is marginal schlock, which is what Transformers is now and Willow was back in the 80s. <br><br>What is the difference between marginal and popular schlock? None save the difference in our expectations. Our interesting or good fiction is beginning to more realistically reflect a fundamentally human future of earth bound creatures rather than space racers. They still contain ridiculous plot elements though, magic supernatural powers rather than magic technology like a death star that can blow planets up with a laser. Our fiction only seems to be doing supernatural powers without magic technology more interestingly now because that is what our changing expectations of the future are becoming as a result of growing awareness about our less energy dense, less technologically advanced, future. As you say, the subtext of all the techno, political movements promising energy salvation is that there is no energy salvation. <br><br>That it resolves into survival as a means of enduring teaming masses of humanity or being one of the few ultra awesome, successful, benevolent and conflicted about their superiority and wealth elite persons is kind of interesting.<br><br><a href=#c7357485623747732670 title="comment permalink">1/14/12, 8:45 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you for getting it. <br><br>Jason, true enough -- there's bad, and then there's <i>The Beast Master</i>. I think of the latter as the <i>Plan Nine from Outer Space</i> of schlock heroic fantasy. <br><br>Justin, what you're saying amounts to the claim that you can't be powerful, capable, and able to have an effect on the world around you. Insist on that, and no doubt it'll be true, for you. Still, may I suggest that there are other ways to approach the world and your potential place in it? <br><br>Maria, you're welcome -- and it's entirely appropriate to think like that. It's ironic that your comment came in the stack right after Justin's insistence that he isn't willing to imagine himself as a hero! It's those who are willing to see themselves as capable and potentially powerful who will go on to accomplish things in the world. <br><br>Honyocker, synchronicity or not, it's a much more common experience than most people nowadays let themselves notice. Enjoy it -- and learn how to use it. <br><br>Don, the first thing to do is to ditch the modern medicalization of behavior that redefines habits as "addictions" and insists that you have no power over them. Next, spend some time exploring what role in your emotional economy the habit fills -- for example, do you reward yourself with the foods in question, and for what? Do you use the habit of eating such foods as proof of your own unworthiness, and if so, why? Do they have a different role entirely? How has your relationship to them changed over time? Finally, having understood what role they play, make a single change -- not a global one, just one single change, such as replacing one food you don't want to keep eating with something else that fills the same emotional role, and stick with that change. Rinse and repeat until you've brought your life into harmony with your will. That's the magician's way of dealing with it. at least.<br><br><a href=#c2724772175962134185 title="comment permalink">1/14/12, 2:57 PM</a><br><br>

That's by no means impossible, and indeed it's going to be necessary. <br><br>Cherokee, I suspect it's because if you live in the desert, nature is usually your enemy. <br><br>Joan, that's one of the reasons why, as I pointed out to RPC, we aren't living in Middle-Earth; the fantasy novel we're stuck in is something far closer to 1970s pulp, in which there's no one gimmick that'll solve the whole problem -- just one crisis after another that the hero or heroine and his or her merry band of sidekicks have to slog their way through. <br><br>Robert, fair enough -- that's not a move I saw. <br><br>GuRan, that seems like a far more useful narrative to me, too. <br><br>John, my guess is that they're waiting for us to prove that we're smart enough not to need limitless energy -- then they'll go back to Zeta Reticuli and take their toruses with them. ;-)<br><br>Barath, oh, I think it's entirely possible that there's something behind the whole electroweak reaction theory -- I've suspected for years now that that's what alchemy was originally about, with electricity from simple chemical batteries triggering the reactions that converted mercury (atomic number 80) to gold (atomic number 79). Still, another source of energy with its own problems and challenges is not equivalent to a free ticket to limitless energy!<br><br><a href=#c4145729757150195958 title="comment permalink">1/14/12, 3:15 PM</a><br><br>

I tend to think that part of the popularity of zombie movies is that watchers get to wallow in fantasies of mass murder without feeling uncomfortable because, after all, the zombies are already dead. <br><br>Mallow, if I may put on my archdruid's hat for a moment, it's the human habit of imposing our own culturally or personally manufactured meanings on the universe that keeps us from perceiving the meaning the universe itself creates. To begin to catch that latter meaning, it's necessary to let go of our assumptions about what that meaning ought to be, and wait for the universe to show us what it means. That requires a fair amount of patience, and an ability to tolerate the "feeling lost" you describe. So you're most of the way there; all you have to do is wait patiently, and not let yourself get decoyed either by some new human-manufactured pseudomeaning, on the one hand, or by the delusion that there is no meaning on the other. <br><br>Cathy, I'm by no means sure that's all there is to it. <br><br>Justin, that's most interesting! You're quite right, of course, that the glossy finish has worn off the fantasy of technological empowerment, and the recognition that real power doesn't have to depend on manipulating machines is coming back into fashion.

In reality, you can dispel them for yourself alone. I'll leave off after this, but if you still insist that what I am saying amounts to saying that we are powerless, then I will try to reconsider the thread and my thoughts to see if there is an implication to them that I am overlooking.

My point of view is different in that I see progress simply as movement and change, a dynamic which is always going to include good times as well as difficulties, rough as well as smooth. I see success as simply doing the best I can according to the resources and circumstance of my life. Success is not a goal. <br><br>In this brief presentation, Alan Watts illustrates this point using the parallel of musical compositions: <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERbvKrH-GC4" rel=nofollow>Music and life, a brief presentation by Alan Watts</a><br>He says that "In music one doesn't make the end of the composition the point of the composition..." <br><br>The challenge of living out one's life as usefully and 'successfully' as possible remains with each of us despite prophecies, cataclysms, international collapse and World War Three. We have to have the will to do what we can; that's all we can do. <br><br>The other evening I watched a lengthy television documentary about the Norwegian explorer <br><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fridtjof_Nansen rel=nofollow>Fridtjof Nansen</a><br>He spent three unbelievably gruelling and isolated years exploring the Arctic in the hope of reaching the North Pole. The story of his and his shipmates survival staggers belief. The years were 1893-96. He in particular could so easily have given in to madness or certain death, but he and the others all soldiered on! Their will to problem-solve and live was extraordinary... <br><br>Like others who have commented I find the theme of vampirism in contemporary culture deeply disturbing. It seems very death-ist, and likely to be linked to the alarming rise of the culture of dis-embodiment and what looks like an increasing disconnect with our physical bodies and the natural world. <br><br>I see the greatest danger to us all as being complacency, the hiding behind the belief that someone else will fix things or that the people who gain the most news time must be right because they should know or say they do. <br><br>I don't think we have yet moved on from feudal times: we still have the emperors and the barons, just in different guises, and until we break free of that we are going to be stuck with it. <br><br>Democracy as we know it is far from perfect and it's difficult, but if we expect it to function at all, we all have to be involved in it to some degree. If we leave it to the power-hungry we are always going to be subject to their whims and selfishness. <br><br>The complacency I see probably arises from weariness, or in being just comfortable enough to make believe that the good times will continue based our limited life experiences. A lot of people are just plain tired. Just going from day to day is all many people have time or energy for. <br><br>Regarding apocalyptic fantasies, the ones I've read, Philip Pullman (Dark Material series), for example, and even Susan Cooper, who I regard as first rate and a better writer, all seem to be somewhat unconvincing in their depiction of the climax of 'end game' scenarios, which seem either simplistic or hopelessly confused. This may be because we are in times of acute crisis, but naturally don't yet know how we will come out of it, or if we will come out of it at all. <br><br>Well, in the meantime it makes sense to build good practical skills and help others where possible, and to enjoy and care for the natural world as much as we can. Life passes. <br><br>I do my best to bear in mind the following quote:<br><br>'Life should NOT be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in an attractive and well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, chocolate in one hand, wine in the other, body thoroughly used up, totally worn out and screaming<br>"WOO HOO what a ride!"

I cannot answer for anyone else. I like the way C. Dale Brittain explains the relationship in the (silly) fantasy, "The Witch And The Cathedral" -- that nobles, wizardry, and the church rule. The church protects the soul, wizardry manages the magic, leaders lead. Or something like that.<br><br>Green wizards might *save* a small bit of a corner of a lucky neighborhood. But leaders ultimately serve at the will of the people, even tyrants. And Americans of late haven't seemed ready to notice the differences between those in leadership roles and actual leaders. So saving the world in absence of leadership is a real poser, and taking over the world would likely only be a momentary reprieve.<br><br><a href=#c2907299013195938407 title="comment permalink">1/14/12, 9:20 PM</a><br><br>

I think they are also saying that you need to do things that feel and are productive.<br><br>I think it is an important part of the balance of Green Wizardry that a person be engaging in productive activities (home economics, productive/marketable skills in a tougher future) while practising LESS.<br><br><a href=#c5022765305662675060 title="comment permalink">1/15/12, 3:51 PM</a><br><br>

The political infighting destroys the remaining food supply and prevents any kind of collective response to the crisis. The declining sunlight is also drawing eldritch horrors out of the woodwork, but the educated class refuse to seriously discuss the evidence, while the political class are either in outright denial or think their woefully underfunded border guard will rescue them.

This is my final post for the week - promise.<br><br>Today, I have had time for reflection and have to admit that I am in fact very grumpy which is an unusual state for me. I apologise to yourself and your readers if I have offended with my many posts ranting on about the world in general. I appreciate your measured responses too, it does you credit and me shame.<br><br>In the past week or so, I have been in the process of dismantling an illegally built shed which the local council has ordered me to demolish. Add in a hot summer and truly this is among one of the most disheartening jobs that you can undertake. Fortunately, I'm also saving the materials to resurrect that same shed (albeit a little bit smaller and thus not captured by certain legislation) at a later date not too far into the future. I'm thinking of building some WWOOF accommodation.<br><br>I agree with your post, particularly the final bit. The actions of individuals are certainly important - they are the heirloom seeds of the future. A collective response is now too late. I've never joined Green activist groups because their visions of a renewable future with this many mouths to feed in an industrial setting are implausible. If we don't save ourselves, who will? Certainly no one that I personally know.<br><br>Therein lies the real difficulty for me with the final bit of this weeks post. I've spent the week in denial and anger about this very issue. <br><br>During my late 30's, my friends scattered to the wind because of economic reasons and their domestic situations. Not fearing change, I moved to a rural area hoping to find a more cohesive community and it is to be found here in only small pockets and only for some of the time.<br><br>The truth is that you are right and that most people seem to be in some sort of denial.<br><br>Yet I'm still looking for community and am actually a bit lost on that front. I look to you for some spiritual guidance. I would appreciate some help.<br><br>I'll also note that I read today that in the Detroit motor show, vehicles with engines as small as 1.4L were being feted as the hero vehicles. Surely, if ever an indicator was available to show that we are on the downward side of the peak that would be it. Interestingly too, over here, insurance premiums for houses in flood prone areas (5% of the state) are being reported to have increased by as much as 1,000%. Yes, you read that number correctly. The federal government legislated that insurance be provided in flood prone areas (historically flood damage was not covered for obvious reasons) and so up go the premiums (as much $5,000 per house, I have read) with no option to opt out of that type of coverage (because of recent ex-gratia payments made by the insurance companies out of the generosity of their hearts).<br><br>Chop wood, fetch water... It would be nice sometimes to have someone to talk to face to face about it all though.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c1177685129559506138 title="comment permalink">1/16/12, 12:24 AM</a><br><br>

We had over 50 WWOOFers come through our farm this year and it was a real joy. Most of them were fantastic people, eager and optimistic, quite curious to learn. They provided a lot of good energy. While there were challenging aspects at time, it was no doubt worth it. And if you're searching for a bit more of a social aspect to life, that's certainly a decent way to go.<br><br>One of the WWOOFers we loved this year, in fact, made clear he wanted to come back this summer and stay for a few months, which the farm owner was perfectly fine with. Sure enough, he intends to follow through, having contacted us recently to confirm that he still planned to come in June.<br><br>I think most WWOOFers are intrigued by the farming/homesteading world and eager to learn more, to get a bit of experience with it, but then intend at some point to go back to something resembling "regular" life. But they're still a joy to have around, to give you a new perspective, to provide a bit of renewal in helping you to remember all the wonderful aspects of the life you've chosen. And you'll get the occasional one who may just be as committed as you and perhaps you'll fine someone who might have a place in your place.<br><br>Again, highly recommended.

In his day it was a quaint village some distance from the industrial city of Birmingham, but today it has been consumed by urban sprawl and is part of a hinterland of run down graffiti sprawled estates, pollution choked ring roads and some areas where the main spoken language is Urdu. It's not hard to see where he got his inspiration from if you visit.<br><br>By the time I had turned into an annoying teenage goth I could quote Lovecraft to order - and still retain a certain fondness for the Necronomican (and have almost finished a Lovecraftian short story based on peak oil).<br><br>And of course, I'd read any Michael Moorcock novels I could get my hands on and read them almost as fast as he could write them (apparently he wrote his quickest in a single day).

I think that with the popularity of certain young adult series (Twilight) and the fascination with vampires and so on, turning to the darker side of fantasy and looking at the original fairy tales in more of an adult light is a fairly natural step. I think there's also this society-wide awareness of something that we've lost, a little bit of mystery and nature in our lives, that's helping to make these things popular. I think it goes along with the increase of people interested in paganism and wicca, and even older crafts, as well. I haven't seen the TV shows but learning to go back to these older stories, not all with happy endings, will surely do good in the years ahead...<br><br><a href=#c2253133983937117289 title="comment permalink">1/16/12, 2:18 PM</a><br><br>

"<br><br>I have read and explored various systems of human-manufactured meaning for decades, including several magical systems.<br><br>The hermetic magic of western tradition was based on the understanding (including science) of the universe of the ancient and classical worlds. <br><br>What if magic got an update?

If you want to ponder the meaning of vampires and zombies in pop culture, you ought to read Stephen King's <i>Danse Macabre</i>.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danse_Macabre_(book)<br><br><i>[King] creates a template for descriptions of his macabre subject. Entitled "Tales of the Tarot," the chapter has nothing to do with the familiar tarot card deck. Rather, King borrows the term to describe his observations about major archetypal characters of the horror genre, which he posits come from two British novels and one Irish: the vampire (from Dracula), the werewolf (from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), and the "Thing Without a Name" (from Frankenstein)...<br><br>King then turns to two separate chapters of horror in the motion pictures. In "The Modern American Horror Movie—Text and Subtext," the "subtext" he refers to consists of unspoken social commentary he sees in the films.</i><br><br>The archetype continually shifts with the subtext. The meaning of the vampire, the werewolf, or the zombie/thing with no name shifts from writer to writer, reader to reader, era to era. Laurell K. Hamilton wrote 20 volumes of the <i>Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter</i> series in eighteen years, and I think I can count at least three shifts in the subtext of "vampires."<br><br>Early on they were monsters, plain and simple--though some of her vampires were victims/simple schmoes who remained schmoes... In the middle books, Jean Claude and the performers in his nightclubs echo the history of Middle European Jews who fled persecution at the beginning of the 20th century and went into movies and theater. And as that story arc progressed, we had the classic American story of the talented, boot-strapped immigrant (vampires) rebelling against the corrupt, blood-sucking European aristocracy. And in the last books there has been on the one hand, a battle of all Hamilton's sapient creatures against eons old forces of Chaos, and, on the other hand, deep questions about who exactly is the Monster. <br><br>In the series <i>Vampire Earth</i> series by E.E. Knight, it's easy to see heroic survivalists pitted against our blood-sucking, tax-and-spend "guv'ment." The vampires in Cronin's <i>The Passage</i> are more like The Thing with No Name: mutants created by the dread Military-Industrial Complex. <br><br>Likewise, the "werewolf" is always shifting. I don't think you need to read deep into the <i>Twilight</i> books: nice Mormon lady writing about romance with sparkly vampires and big hairy wolves... Yes, there is still a fate worse than death--ooh!<br><br>In Patricia Briggs Mercy Thompson books, the werewolves are basically mercs--paramilitary types--some for Truth, Justice, and Corporate America and some just for fascism or anarchy. Rambo was an '80s embodiment of the werewolf archetype.<br><br>On the other hand, in the early Anita Blake books and in the Harry Potter series and fear of the werewolf is subtext for AIDS/the fear of homosexualty!<br><br>And the zombie? In the 50's the Pod People were code for the threat of communist mind-control. In the Stepford Wives, fear of Patriarchy... These days the zombie seems to flip between media brain-washing/mindless consumerism and unidentifiable "dis-ease", a fear that we have poisoned the earth and unleashed some kind of wasting contamination that will consume us. Killing zombies is about detox...or mockery. <br><br>To say that this current fascination with vampires and werewolves is about "embracing death" misses the mark.<br><br><a href=#c6491880647641453934 title="comment permalink">1/16/12, 3:30 PM</a><br><br>

Forget it. It's like trying to explain the concept of wetness to a fish, and then, expect them to understand how they'll be flapping around in the mud as they'll have to adapt to bouts of dryness.<br><br>You may recall that old joke about the guy who went on vacation and left his brother home to watch his cat? The cat fell off the roof and died. When the brother called to ask how his cat was, his brother said, “I’m sorry to tell you that your cat just died.”<br><br>The brother was really upset and said, “You don’t just come out and say something like that. You should have prepared me. You could have said, ‘The cat’s on the roof, I’ve called the fire department, we’re trying to get him down’. That’s how you prepare someone for bad news: something like that.”<br><br>Then he asked his brother, “By the way, how’s mom?”<br><br>“She’s on the roof…” <br><br>***<br>As the protagonist in my pulp non-fiction story, I feel more like Zorba The Greek in a world of Willy Lomans! <br><br>But you JMG, as a calm voice of reason, bring the same dignity, grace and respect to our present dilemma as Atticus Finch did with the problem of racial inequality. And I admire how you're masterly preparing us for a very different future in a way similar to how Atticus brought Boo Radley out of the shadows -- not to be feared, but to be understood and accepted for what it is.

One man is lauded for bringing "efficiency" to the milling of flour; amassing a fortune while others are put out of work.<br><br>It also strikes me that there will be no going back, at least not with this generation.
