The strategy discussed in last week’s post—that of walking away from energy-intensive lifestyles before the waning of the age of abundant energy brings them grinding to a halt—is a viable response to the crisis of our age, but it’s also a great way to poke a stick at some of the most deeply entrenched of the modern world’s dysfunctional habits of thinking. Suggest it in public, for example, and you’ll very quickly learn why all that talk about saving the planet has turned out to be empty air: everyone’s quite willing to watch someone else make sacrifices for the good of the biosphere, but ask them to make sacrifices themselves and you’ll see just how far their love of the planet extends.<br><br>In honor of the ongoing failure of global climate talks, let’s call the resulting dance the Copenhagen cha-cha—one step forward, three steps back, run in a circle making squawking noises, and then point the finger of blame at somebody else on the dance floor. Over the years to come, you can expect to see that number done on a scale that would make the ghost of Busby Berkeley turn green with envy. Yet there’s more going on here than simple hypocrisy. To make sense of the reasons why so many people who know perfectly well that their own lifestyles are dragging the world to ruin still can’t bear the thought of living any other way, it’s going to be necessary to explore some of the murkiest crawlspaces of the modern mind. We can start, once again, with the automobile.<br><br>I suggested last week that the private auto is simply one way to get people and light cargoes from one place to another. Strictly speaking, that’s true, but it’s true in much the same sense that sex is simply one way to distribute the adult population among the supply of available bedrooms. Especially but not only in America, the car has been loaded down with so much in the way of powerful cultural fantasies and emotional drives that it’s almost impossible to talk about it in purely practical terms. I dislike cars, and not just on principle—chalk it up, maybe, to a family habit of long pointless Sunday drives with the smoke from my father’s cheap cigarettes pooling like a miasma in the back seat—and I’ve never owned one, or had a driver’s license. I’ve still felt, while catching a ride with friends to some Druid gathering or the like, the lure of the open highway that plays so huge a role in America’s collective psyche.<br><br>That’s a major theme in our national character that I suspect many people elsewhere in the world simply don’t get. The vast majority of white Americans are descended from people who turned their backs on the static ways of the Old World to chase the dream of a better life on the other side of the ocean, and that pattern of seeking a new life elsewhere has repeated far more often than not with each generation. One of the many factors that make white Americans so clueless about nonwhite Americans, in turn, is that that experience isn’t shared with the other peoples of this nation. For us, that first journey beyond limitations has always defined the American experience, but for African-Americans, their encounter with this continent was a bitter exile into bondage; for the Hispanic population this side of the Rio Grande, the defining experience was dispossession—white Americans like to forget that the southwestern quarter of our country used to be the northern half of Mexico, before we stole it from them at gunpoint—and for the first inhabitants of this continent, it was not merely dispossession but very nearly annihilation. A road leading into the far distance means something very different to the descendants of pioneers on the Oregon Trail than it does to the descendants of those who survived the Trail of Tears.<br><br>Still, even among white Americans, the dream of freedom somewhere on the far side of the horizon could at least theoretically have expressed itself in many different ways. It so happens that nowadays, at least, it almost always expresses itself through the automobile. This is why Americans cling to their cars with such frantic intensity, and why Republican politicians—always a better barometer of the American mass psyche than their Democrat rivals—so reflexively treat any alternative to the private car as a threat to America’s freedom. On any rational level, of course, that’s the most vacuous sort of hogwash, but on a nonrational level—on the level of collective passions and mass fantasies where most human motivation takes shape—it’s a potent reality. If freedom consists of being able to turn the key, put the pedal to the metal, and go zooming off to a new life somewhere else, a future of buses and trains lumbering along fixed routes with somebody else driving is a future where freedom no longer exists, and a future in which nothing speeds along on wheels—in which life plods along at a walking pace—doesn’t bear thinking about at all.<br><br>The cultural processes that condensed the experience of a people into the dream of a perpetual quest to catch the receding horizon, and then bound that dream into a talisman perched on four rubber tires, are hard to discuss in any meaningful way without using words like "spell" and "enchantment." Part of the magic involved, to be sure, was the work of the sorcerers of Madison Avenue, who flogged the dream into a bloody pulp in order to sell yet another round of otherwise uninteresting products, but there’s more than that to the misplaced concreteness that confuses freedom with a machine.<br><br>Glance over at a different technology and the same misplaced concreteness appears in even sharper relief. The technology I have in mind here is television. I don’t own one of those, either; I grew up watching TV, of course, like everyone else in my generation, but got heartily bored with it in my teen years and haven’t had one in the house in my adult life. Mention this to most Americans, though, and the reaction you’ll get is considerably more violent than the one you get if you admit that you don’t use a car. There’s a defensive quality to it, the sort of brittle edge you only get when the mere fact that you don’t share somebody’s habit flicks them on the raw.<br><br>If you’ve ever walked past a suburban neighborhood at night when some much-ballyhooed show was on, and seen the blue light flickering in perfect sync in the windows of house after house, you might have caught some sense of the reason why. If the automobile is America’s talisman of freedom, the television is its talisman of community, of participation in a world of shared activities and shared meanings. Notice how often casual talk in a social setting veers at once in the direction of something that was on the television, or how hard it is to find a tavern these days that doesn’t have half a dozen big television screens blaring inanities from all sides. We stare at the screens, because that makes it easier not to notice the world around us, or each other.<br><br>For most Americans, television has come to represent the experience of collective participation, and yet the flickering lights in the suburban windows serve as a reminder that few activities are more solitary or more isolating. In precisely the same way, the freedom represented by the car moving down the open road is a pathetic illusion; from the immense government programs that build and maintain those open roads, through the gargantuan corporate systems that produce the cars, to the sprawling global network of oilfields, pipelines, refineries, and the rest of the colossal system that transforms fossil hydrocarbons into the gas that keeps the car going, there are few human activities on Earth that depend more completely on the vast and faceless bureaucracies that most Americans think they despise. Isolation packaged as participation, dependence packaged as freedom: there’s much to be learned here about the power of thaumaturgy to twist the meanings of things—but I want to go one step further here.<br><br>Americans by and large accept an extraordinary degree of dependence on a machine—the automobile—in order to invest that machine with the feelings and dreams that cluster around the concept of freedom. We accept an extraordinary degree of dependence on another machine—the television—in order to give that machine the emotional charge that other societies give to participation in collective meanings and activities. Sort through any of the narratives that play a central role in contemporary American culture, and you’ll find a machine at the center of each one. Thus it’s absolutely predictable that when Americans try to think about finding some way out from between the narrowing walls closing in on our future, nearly everything they come up has some kind of machine at its heart. A solar panel, a wind turbine, an electric car, a thorium reactor, a supercomputer, a flying saucer or a nuclear bomb, take your pick, but it’s got to be based on a machine.<br><br>A good many years ago, Lewis Mumford wrote two hefty volumes under the joint title <i>The Myth of the Machine</i>. It’s vintage Mumford and thus by definition well worth reading, but it’s also very much a work of its time, a well-aimed blast against the superlative technological efficiency and utter ethical failure of America’s pursuit of the Vietnam war. Since I first read it, I’ve wished that Mumford could have found time to pursue the promise of the title in a good deal more depth. There is indeed a myth of the machine in the strict sense of that much-abused word "myth," and I’ve come to see the extraordinary fixation on that myth as one of the major barriers in the way of a viable response to the crisis of our time.<br><br>Let’s start with the basics. What is a machine? There are plenty of ways to answer that deceptively simple question, but I’m going to propose a provocative one. It requires a bit of background, though, and so I’m going to have to approach it in a slightly roundabout way.<br><br>As human beings our experiences fall into two broad categories. One of these comprises what we might as well call the outer world—the world we experience in the form of sensations perceived by the five senses. The other comprises what we might correspondingly call the inner world—the world we experience in the form of thoughts and feelings perceived directly by the mind. Those two worlds overlap in the body, which we can explore as a sensory object but which we can also perceive directly as a locus of thoughts and feelings. Outside that overlap, for each of us, those two worlds are distinct; we can’t perceive our own personality, for example, as a sensory object, or experience directly what’s going on in the inner lives of the other beings we encounter.<br><br>Developmental psychologists noticed a long time ago that the process of growing up involves a curious double movement in the way each of us experiences these two worlds. It takes the infant a great deal of time and exploration to figure out the difference between the inner and outer worlds and sort out what belongs on which side of the boundary. It then takes the child quite a bit more time and experience to realize that both worlds exist on both sides of the boundary—that he or she is an object in the outer world of others as well as the subject of the inner life of his or her own, and that others have their own inner lives. Arriving at this realization is one of the core things that’s meant by the word "maturity," and entire worlds of human experience are closed to those who refuse it.<br><br>Everything we do as mature human beings thus falls along a continuum between what philosopher Martin Buber called "I-It" and "I-Thou" relationships—less obscurely, between those interactions in which the individual can simply deal with other things as objects, and those in which he or she must deal with other beings as subjects with their own inner lives and their own capacities for interpretation and choice. Getting stuck in the sort of useless binary that treats the spectrum as a total opposition and labels its ends "evil" and "good" respectively is as useless a move as it is inevitably popular, since the universe of human experience embraces the whole spectrum, and it’s entirely possible to fall into absurdity in either direction—on the one hand, for example, by treating other human beings as objects, and getting blindsided by their responses to that sort of treatment; on the other, by convincing yourself that you can ignore the laws of nature by applying to the cosmos the sort of means that induce changes in the behavior of a human subject. (The cosmos may well be a subject—there’s a long and by no means unsophisticated philosophical tradition of seeing it in such terms—but the chance that it will respond favorably to your wheedling are no better than your chances of responding to the desires of any one of the dust mites living on your skin at this moment.)<br><br>A machine, though, can never be a subject. Machines imitate the actions of persons, but they have no subjectivity, no inner world; they’re always and only objects, and so the only relationship you can have with them is an I-It relationship. That wouldn’t be a problem, except for the torrent of cheap abundant energy that transformed the world of human experience over the last three centuries. The breakthroughs that set that torrent in motion were precisely methods of using fossil carbon of various kinds to power machines. Before then, power consisted almost entirely in the ability to express the will of the individual through I-Thou relationships—the human relationship of monarch to subject, general to soldier, lord to vassal, and the like were quite simply what power meant.<br><br>With the coming of the industrial age, that equation changed. Power exerted through a machine is defined purely by I-It relationships, and that’s become the modern definition of power. I suspect that, as much as greatly improved technologies of killing, had a great deal to do with the extraordinary scale of mass murder in the 19th and 20th centuries. Tamerlane may have had his soldiers exterminate the whole population of a city now and then, but the methodical annihilation of entire peoples by national governments as an ordinary element of peacetime policy was, if not new, then at least unusual in the scale and the casualness with which it has been applied.<br><br>That’s a very specific effect; there are many broader ones. One of those is the democratization, at least in the industrial world, of the experience of domination. A modern American climbing into the driver’s seat of a large SUV has more sheer physical energy under his direct control than your average Southern plantation owner had before the Civil War. Talk of "energy slaves" isn’t simply a metaphor; the one difference between power exerted by dominating machines and power exerted by dominating human slaves is again that the machines don’t have an inner life; they won’t slack off when the overseer isn’t looking, head north on the Underground Railroad, or join Nat Turner’s rebellion and cut your throat some fine Virginia night.<br><br>So the role played by machines in the modern industrial world, in large part, is as the primary focus for the very common human craving for power. The fact that the appearance of power is purchased at the cost of total dependence simply makes the irony that much richer; people nowadays cling to their autos and their televisions all the harder because they know perfectly well that the sensation of power as the engine roars is an illusion, and that a community that goes away when you change the channel doesn’t actually meet their needs for participation. Take a hard look at any other technology that has a central role in contemporary culture, and you’ll find the same nexus between an illusion of power, a reality of dependence—and a large and increasing cost. How that nexus might be unraveled in the twilight of the industrial age will be the subject of next week’s post.<br><br>***********************<br><span style=font-size:130%>End of the World of the Week #6</span><br><br>The mere fact that a belief system’s proponents claim that it’s a perfectly rational scientific theory doesn’t prevent that belief system from being yet another example of our old friend, the apocalypse meme. There are plenty of examples that show this in action, but the most colorful of the last century and a half has to be Marxism.<br><br>Back before it imploded under the strains of its own internal contradictions, Marxism was among the ideologies that most loudly proclaimed the superiority of science and reason to superstition. Behind the rhetoric, though, the historical structure of Marxist theory is point for point identical to that of evangelical Protestant Christianity There’s a real point, in fact, in suggesting that Marxism was simply the furthest extension of one end of the spectrum of Christian heresy.<br><br>Follow out the historical trajectory and the parallels are easy enough to track. Primitive communism is the Garden of Eden; the invention of private property is the Fall; the period between the rise of property and the coming proletarian revolution, divided into various stages, is the period between the Fall and the Second Coming, divided into various dispensations; the peasant revolutionary movements of the feudal and early capitalist periods play the role of the Israelites; the life of Marx fills the same role as the life of Jesus, with the doings of the First International as the Acts of the Apostles; the horrors of late capitalism followed by proletarian revolution are dead ringers for the horrors of the Tribulation followed by the Second Coming; the era of socialism, finally, is the Millennium, the thousand years before the final descent of the New Jerusalem of communism.<br><br>Of course this colorful trajectory has something else in common with such offshoots of evangelical prophecy as the career of Harold Camping; its predictions turned out to be completely wrong. Marx insisted that the great proletarian revolution would break out first in the most advanced industrial nations; instead, Marxist revolutions only succeeded in nations just beginning to industrialize, where Marxism played the same role of convenience that Puritanism played in the English Civil War and Enlightenment rationalism in the French Revolution. Furthermore, and far more significantly, the first Marxist revolution wasn’t followed by the gradual overthrow of capitalism around the world; instead, Marxism reached its high-water point in the 1950s and then receded, as the golden promises of <i>Das Kapital</i> gave way to gray bureaucratic inefficiency and, in time, total systemic failure.<br><br>—story from <a href="http://www.vivaeditions.com/book_page.php?book_id=25">Apocalypse Not</a>

You've thrown a couple new ideas at me, JMG, that are intoxicating. I'm going to have to think on the I-It/I-Thou concept for awhile, but it makes a massive amount of sense at first glance. Furthermore, the idea that a southern plantation owner had less power available to him than a modern day American with an SUV was one of those fine comparisons that really brings home the absurdity of our situation today.<br><br>The freedom of the car is very alluring, indeed. I've been thinking for years now how I would like to get rid of my car. It was a very viable option back when I lived in Portland, and I did drive it very little. Now that I live on the northern Oregon coast, though, and have a 30 mile round trip commute to one of the farms I work on, it feels much less a viable option. I'm still trying to figure out some solution to that. I don't like that the car represents one of the greatest threats to my ability to live a low-energy and low-money lifestyle. It needs a good amount of both those things. I worry about repairs.<br><br>But that's part of the work, too--figuring out how to restructure my life, how to make do, how to make the changes I know need to be made.

My parents never really got why I don't connect driving with freedom, or why I'm so selective about what TV shows I spend my time and attention on.<br><br>On the other hand, I'm forced to face up to the fact that I'm deeply dependent, emotionally, on computers. That includes video games and smartphones. That dependence is going to be hard to kick, too, for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that I teach computer science.<br><br>Worst of all, it reminds me of my many failed attempts to kick my Facebook habit…<br><br>Still, the more I understand the nature of that dependence the easier it will make it to give it up when I'm ready.

It is much worse these days, with cars equipped with more electronics than most living rooms. We've evidently become a bit bored with our primary machine and now festoon it with all manner of diversions, from cell phones to talking GPS to THE INTERNET on the DASHBOARD.<br><br>Despite taking my 2-year-old son everywhere by bicycle, he is fascinated by cars. Car was one of his first words. And why not? They utterly dominate a good portion of our landscape. Even the few who tend to realize the absurdity can quickly explain why they need to drive--if only.<br><br>I have a car that I rarely use--mainly to drive it back and forth from the repair shop these days. It sits in the driveway (which I am in the process of tearing up by sledge hammer--I've only torn up a section about 20 feet long and taken it to the asphalt recycling plant--4 tons! And there is a second driveway under that, and I've done less than a third of the drive.) in case my current job search takes me beyond a combination of bike/train distance.<br><br>Right now I am trying to gently help my community realize the benefits of cycling into town--it's an old mill town on the Hudson River, the perfect layout. I'm taking the economic tact, pointing out that a bicycle costs a few hundred a year at most to operate, while a car averages $7,000.<br><br>I've been aware of peak oil for a while now, intellectually. But it was only after reading through your entire archive that it hit me on a more visceral level.(Reading it over five years might have been a dawning realization. Cramming it into a week is decline and fall shock therapy.)<br><br> I have been out of work for a while, and our finances are precarious. I'm battling a sense of real dread about the future, and I worry for my family. I'm heading down a conservation lifestyle (though with plenty still to do) but with no money currently coming in, I'm starting to feel trapped in a coming historical tsunami. I'm coming to realize this will be the defining aspect of my life, and I'm looking for the strength of soul to stay calm and focused for my family, and not to get swept away by dark thoughts even before the storm crashes over us.<br><br><a href=#c6617528626557158569 title="comment permalink">1/25/12, 9:51 PM</a><br><br>

And the reason the Department of Defense was the prime designer.<br><br>WWII had just shown the vulnerability of rail lines and other transportation and economic choke points, in the face of aggression and hostilities. America's Interstate Highways were intended to widely disperse major transportation nexuses around the country, eliminating single major hubs as inviting military or economic targets. <br><br>The strategy of dispersal suited defense planning and economic planning as well. Decentralizing build in multiple redundancies for fewer single points of failure and more options to respond to opportunities and crises. Thus the highway collapse in Minneapolis/St. Paul was a regional crisis, not a stroke that paralyzed the part of America on one side of the Mississippi or both.<br><br>And, as you point out, everything was based on the WWII lessons that security, defense, and military and economic strength is measured in and derived from fossil fuels.

"These two lanes will take us anywhere," "the highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last-chance power drive," "with faith in your machine off you scream into the night." As a sort of flipside to these automobile-as-key-to-freedom anthems, "Racing in the Street," from his follow-up album <i>Darkness on the Edge of Town</i>, is narrated by a soulless, despondent racer whose girl "stares off alone into the night with the eyes of one who hates for just being born." But for all of Springsteen's songs about the American experience, this verse from "The Price You Pay" cuts deep in light of our current predicament: "Now with their hands held high they reached out for the open skies / And in one last breath they built the roads they'd ride to their death."<br><br>Speaking of energy slaves, have you seen <a href=http://s8.postimage.org/3p5ru36id/bucky_map.jpg rel=nofollow>this beautiful thematic map</a> by Buckminster Fuller (originator of the energy slave concept)?

So I have never owned my own TV and make efforts to avoid them in public places (airport terminals are particularly difficult.)<br><br>Television acting as a stand in for community is a very interesting idea. When people talk about some television series to illustrate a point, and I tell them that I don't watch TV, they invariably describe the premise of the series so I can be informed and included. It has always struck me that they are trying to establish common ground, to include me in their circle no matter how much of a freak I may appear to them. I take it as a compliment that they even try to reform me rather than just making the sign of the cross and dousing me with holy water. Since I have no interest in television programming and believe that any point could be better expressed without referencing a TV show, the desire to connect through a television referent is theirs. <br><br>How does the glowing box make people feel so isolated that they can think of no better way to connect with others than through the instrument of their own disconnection? That’s a very powerful tool -- like a priest nurturing one’s fear of hell and then selling indulgences to alleviate that fear. Television represents access to community about as much as a fear-baiting priest represents access to God.<br><br><a href=#c3488873894241069321 title="comment permalink">1/25/12, 11:31 PM</a><br><br>

So, that's where community went. I've been wondering about this for a long time now. Thanks for the explanation, I'd never considered this angle before, but you are correct, it smells right to me. I switched off the television over three years ago and haven't looked back. I'm waiting and will assist rebuilding when it is required.<br><br>It's kind of weird too, because when I built my house up in the forest, I had to rent a house in an outer suburban housing estate. With 1% vacancy rates, it was the only place I could get. This was a new experience for me having spent so many years at part time study in the inner city. At night, I used to take the dogs for a long walk which is great to unwind after a day’s hard physical labour. I always noticed that we were alone on the streets, night after night. If ever we were noticed we were treated with suspicion and fear. Sad.<br><br>Still, I've said it before and I'll say it again that the divide and conquer strategy is as old as the hills. Truly, we are all giving away our common-wealth.<br><br>As to objectification, when societies have considered that some section of that society is an object, then that is when real trouble sets in. I'm watching for this change, that's why I commented about politics last week.<br><br>As ever you are insightful.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c5752479129499591857 title="comment permalink">1/26/12, 12:26 AM</a><br><br>

They will be the ruin of us, I suspect. But I have seen both sides of this. In the 1970s, I lived in Stockholm for half a year. Didn't have a car, and didn't miss it at all. It was an immensely liberating experience, facilitated by Sweden's excellent public transport. Walked a lot, took the buses, ferries, commuter RRs, and other transport as needed.<br><br>Living as I do now in California, a car becomes an essential. It is possible, but very difficult, to live without one. As you say, it very much limits your life. Most jobs are not available to you.

It can be argued that increasing use of the computer leads to the decline of other information methods such as memorisation or books. It seems that in each of the three examples - car, television, computer - dependence is caused by allowing competing (skill-based) alternatives to that technology to atrophy. So you end up with one object which is infused with value, which is insufficient to carry or sustain that value, but no alternative carrier that you can see.

Those who give it up sooner must accept a degree of powerlessness yet they will be better prepared than those who won't.

In particular this, and your previous post, have brought many of the issues that I face in setting up my low-energy, community farm into perspective. I had been wondering why I felt so very “on the outside” of things, despite being surrounded by people who are involved part-time in my project. I could see that what I was doing was a rational response to the world around me (as far as I understand it) but delivering food with a bike trailer? I can feel like a freak, and it doesn’t always feel good.<br><br>Yourself, and many other US-based writers, often mention that many resource exhaustion issues are particularly amplified in the US. I’d like to offer a perspective from the UK. In the past few decades people here have sought, on some level, to emulate the US. Much of our TV was from the US, a vacation to the US was considered “better” than a vacation to Europe, and pop singers would sing with a US accent (with the notable exception of Kate Bush). We know we drive smaller cars, and movies are released in the US first… we feel inferior on some level. So perhaps the lure of the car, and the TV, also offer the UK citizen the promise of being “more American” and therefore cooler, as well as all the other phenomena you so eloquently describe. <br><br>There is an accompanying backlash, namely stereotyping Americans (read US citizens) as loud, unsubtle, and even possibly even not very bright. I hasten to add this is absolutely not our general experience when we actually meet or read Americans!!! But you know how stereotypes are.<br><br>Perhaps I’m just jealous. Americans enjoyed the upside of abundant oil better, and even now they are ahead of us in the peak oil descent (I’m joking!)<br><br>Joanne Mudhar<br><br><a href=#c4560753232309755605 title="comment permalink">1/26/12, 2:15 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you for once again giving us some more in-depth ideas to ponder.<br><br>When I discuss the art of persuasion in my composition classes, I usually talk a little about advertising (i.e., what you call thaumaturgy). When I do, I always use this example: I ask students to describe the typical TV auto ad where an auto is actually being driven. They always recognize that the car is found navigating some quiet road with no other traffic whatsoever, and while surrounded by spectacular scenery--e.g., mountains or coastline. I then ask them how many of them drive under such conditions. Of course, none of them do. Why, then, I query, doesn't the ad portray the car being driven under more normal situations, such as in bumper-to-bumper commuter traffic where nobody is moving more than five miles per hour? What, I ask, is the advertiser really trying to sell? Normally, after a bit of prodding someone will give me the answer I'm looking for: "Freedom!" I reply, "Exactly!"<br><br>But then I ask them how much freedom auto ownership actually offers us. Most of the students, especially the younger ones, recognize the huge dependency under which owning an automobile places us, given the cost of the auto itself, plus maintenance, fuel, insurance, etc. And most students recognize that such ownership actually places restrictions on our freedom, despite the ability to go where and when one wants that auto ownership affords us and that the advertising tries to capitalize on.<br><br>I do have a TV, though I hardly ever watch it. About the only things I ever watch are sports events that I'm interested in, or maybe a presidential speech (no, I didn't watch the state of the union address this past Tuesday). Every time I turn on the TV, I'm disgusted by the advertising I see. My spouse and I have debated getting rid of it; maybe we will. We didn't have a TV at all for the first four years or so of our marriage, and I never missed it.<br><br><a href=#c3881030462572019714 title="comment permalink">1/26/12, 6:13 AM</a><br><br>

Glad you are pointing out the nature of internal awareness (or lack of it), thoughts and feelings with external experiences, What a useful lesson in applied developmental psych! I appreciate your ability to explain it, and relate it to how people act towards our automated life. <br> <br> Your blog is a much anticipated weekly mental meal. This particular post was, to me , a double heaping helping of heavy thought and analysis. One that required an extra cup of coffee ;). But I enjoy such toothy analysis.. Pass the biscuits please!<br><br>This blog also reminds me of an article I read some 20 years ago, regarding 10 inventions that have changed human society.. I think it was in Psychology today. The inventions where, as I recall- automobile, TV, Phone- and to my initial surprise.. central heat... That author was not pointing out any of these as any cultural advancement , but rather, more akin to this post, asked us to examine how they have changed the fundamental way we understand ourselves, relate to our families, communities, societies- that these inventions can, in effect, interfered with our abilities to develope emotional/social mature relationships. <br> I was particularly impressed with central heating's role, likely because we were living in the country with a single propane heater in the dinning room, at the time. I enjoyed How many evenings and cold days were spent with neighbors and family near the warmth and light- dinning, studying. Even"idle time" was spent together playing boardgames, reading, storytelling, listening, whittling, mending. <br>Now we can run off to our bedrooms and close ourselves off with any number of E ( electronic) toys, babies can be sequestered half a block away and monitored, granny can be stuck in bed with her TV stories. Mom can be glued to her kitchen TV while cooking, Let's not miss the TV News for dinner! No wonder so many of us are resistant to the thought of intergenerational housing. Well, if it gets too frustrating, I can always hop in the car and drive to the mall.. no,wait, I'm outta gas<br> <br>Final thought.. relating to stories that deal with the shift from pre-industrial to post industrial culture... I know you have no TV but it may be available free online.. Masterpiece Theater;s Cranford? have you ever seen it? I think others may enjoy this well crafted British Series. I think those of us preparing for a long decent might find this story a rich example of the reverse- a Rural town resisting accent of the new industrial England, and may have some useful glimpse into how things worked- or didn't a century plus ago.<br><br><a href=#c6252330753163699022 title="comment permalink">1/26/12, 6:13 AM</a><br><br>

The importance of understanding the mechanization of 'freedom' is oft underestimated. As machines come to mediate so much experience, our own responses have to become increasingly machinic, too, as we access the world on the machine's terms. It's a nasty entrainment cycle, like an an enormous and efficient Skinner box. Soon enough, we start to mistake the machine for nature itself.<br><br>I do find Marxism an awkward fit for the apocalypse discussion, though. It's not so much that I think you are wrong about there being an influence of apocalyptic thinking on it, but I don't think that the apocalyptic thinking is the driving force behind the shape Marxism took, whether you mean it within Marx's work and within the development of Marxist states.<br><br>Marx's driving insights (at least as I took them to heart) aren't so different from yours, for one, and his analyses, too, aren't far afield from yours. His convictions, though, definitely led him to project hopes onto the directions the processes would go in ways that deformed his analysis.<br><br>Marxist states...those were amazingly cynical things, even in the early decades. There wasn't rampant belief in Communist doctrine but rather rampant disbelief joined to an overwhelming sense of being unable to do anything about it. Alienation seemed the rule. The famed Soviet humor and corruption are part and parcel of this.<br><br>I do wonder how much more like that our situation is, right down to our tendency to reach for cynical humor (though, admittedly, ours is a different flavor than Russia's). It seems, too, like it is that situation that helps fuel apocalyptic thinking rather than the other way around. Apocalypse as one form of fleeing from this visceral, cynical, alienation.<br><br>That seems like an important distinction to maintain: between the concrete historical, material, political situations that fosters Apocalyptic thinking and the Apocalyptic thinking itself. Using Marxism as an exemplar of apocalyptic thinking conflates these to my mind.<br><br><a href=#c6213460140562486926 title="comment permalink">1/26/12, 8:17 AM</a><br><br>

Of course, this is incorrect, human beings have a full spectrum of internal motivations as you correctly pointed out, including the very irrational ones you described. Thus economics tends to completely break down, and many of its conclusions are absurd. The fact this pseudo-science is used as a rationale for anything is deeply disturbing, and explains a lot of what is so messed up about the world today. I’m also thinking of a quote I saw today on Naked Capitalism linking to a story to an effort to make grief into a malady to be “cured,”: “So people are supposed to be happy robots all the time so they can work at Foxconn productivity levels. I think we had better hope the Singularity comes soon. The human race is desperately in need of new management.” In fact machines have made it easier to dominate people than ever before.<br><br>An interesting story of how our desires are manipulated to sell products is told in <a href=http://www.economist.com/node/21541706 rel=nofollow>this story from The Economist about Erenest Dichter:</a> <br><br><i>This was a big idea. Dichter understood that every product has an image, even a “soul”, and is bought not merely for the purpose it serves but for the values it seems to embody. Our possessions are extensions of our own personalities, which serve as a “kind of mirror which reflects our own image”. Dichter’s message to advertisers was: figure out the personality of a product, and you will understand how to market it. Soaps could be old or young, flirty or conservative. Ivory, Dichter inferred, had a “sombre, utilitarian, thoroughly cleansing character”. It was the mother-daughter of soaps, whereas a brand like Camay was a seductress. Such insights led to the slogans “Be smart and get a fresh start with Ivory Soap” and “Wash your troubles away”.<br><br>But the innovation that put Dichter on the marketing map involved a problem Chrysler was having with its relatively new line of Plymouth cars—which consumers were shunning. Dichter headed out to Detroit, conducted extensive interviews with a couple of hundred people, and deduced that the company’s first problem was its existing advertising, which boasted that its cars were “different from any other one you have ever tried”. This evidently triggered an unconscious fear of the unknown among buyers, for whom familiarity in a car meant safety.<br><br>He also learned from interviews that whereas convertibles made up only 2% of sales in 1939, most men, particularly middle-aged ones, dreamed of owning one. When convertibles were placed in the windows of dealerships as “bait”, more men came in. But when they returned actually to make a purchase, they typically came with their wives and chose a sensible sedan (the Plymouth line offered both).<br><br>Dichter gathered that the convertible symbolised youth, freedom and the secret wish for a mistress: an idle bit of temptation. He suggested that Chrysler beef up its convertible advertising—and, in recognition of spouses’ role in the final decisions, begin marketing cars in women’s magazines. Meanwhile, a new and more reassuring campaign emphasised that it would take “only a few minutes” to feel at home with the new Plymouth.</i><br><br><a href=#c6771175441035032316 title="comment permalink">1/26/12, 8:21 AM</a><br><br>

Of all the changes we've made in our lives since we began to practice voluntary simplicity, going TV free has been the only change we've made that creates the sort of defensiveness in other people that you describe. Some people we've told say something like, I only watch public TV, as if that makes it acceptable. I suspect most people know deep down that TV is co-opting their thoughts and actions, but they don't have sufficient desire to break free of the habit. Maybe they are too scared of what they'd have to confront about their lives if they didn't have TV to distract them.<br><br>We've gone car-free for about 2 months twice, when our car was damaged in minor accidents and required repair work that took that long to complete.

Compare the entrapment of a fuel-sqaundering, stress-inducing urban commuter traffic jam with the operation of a light rail system carrying the same number of people on the same route, and the use of the car for that purpose looks like an exercise in mass stupidity. <br><br>Sticking malls on the edge of sluburbia so that people are practically forced to drive in order to go shopping also doesn't help, especially when said malls feature stores with cheap imports that undercut and ruin local mom-and-pop stores that might provide a viable and walkable alternative. So much for domestic manufacturing. <br><br>In California at any rate, we seem hardly capable of making a public transit system that people aren't ashamed to ride. My local bus route into the nearest big town seems willfully designed and operated to make riders feel as though they're being subjected to an exercise in degradation, like being in a rolling ultracrowded welfare office with the additional risk of getting a dirk in your ribs. <br><br>I don't worry for a moment about the difficulty of breaking my computer habit.

Science is the tool of I-it control we ended up creating. We are running into the hard limits of the control strategy. In domesticating the world, we are exhausting it. <br><br>The difference of empathy identification is that you are part of the environment you are in rather than above and in control of it. The only part of your environment you can truly control is yourself. Is it too much to say that the I-it relationship is most readily applied to oneself and oneself alone? That the all consuming empathy of self that we think is so much a part of defining ourselves in youth is a necessary stage of development, but one that should be moved on from at some point in life?<br><br>I don't know when, but I am sure that we will begin trying empathy/I-thou full stop soon, maybe not within our lifetimes, but soon. I feel confident in saying that empathy will supplant control as the dominant mindset simply as a matter of necessity and survival. If we don't begin to see ourselves as members of an ecology working within it as one piece of a whole rather than its owners who are working it to get our piece of the whole, we simply won't be around for much longer during the anthropocene age. <br><br>Computers and the internet are an interesting bridge here, although you interface with a machine, the interface is a portal to the mind of another human.

What kind of terrible things will be done by so much desperate humanity cooped up in cities and suddenly, terrifyingly forced to realize that they are alone, in a box, stacked on another box, surrounded by strangers, without having learned to interact with other humans and solve problems, or even converse?

Standing on a plateau in Colorado I could see the highway unfolding for hundreds of miles in front of me – there is just nowhere in my whole country where you can see that much of a single road. And as for picking up sticks and heading off somewhere else to reinvent yourself, forget about it – no matter where you go you’re going to trip over someone who knows you. Freedom here is associated with enough money for a plane ticket to somewhere else.<br><br>Our household has been car free for some years now. I’ve noticed this often elicits a peculiarly defensive reaction when this comes up in the conversation – on finding out that we don’t have a car, people immediately begin telling me why they couldn’t possibly do without theirs, even though I haven’t suggested they give it up. The car advertising here also relies heavily on open roads and beautiful scenery – one particularly improbable sequence involves the driver travelling along a road by the sea accompanied by some obviously faked leaping dolphins in the water, and stopping for an impromptu picnic on the grounds of a vineyard, which in reality would get you chased off the property <br><br><a href=#c3599481751639688812 title="comment permalink">1/26/12, 12:36 PM</a><br><br>

When I was little I played with toy cars, when I was a bit older I built model cars. I could tell you the make, model and year of any car from a glimpse at the tail lights, and a good deal about the engine. I was working on them before I could drive, and a good deal of my adult life was spent thinking about, driving and working on cars. How I wish I could have back all the time and energy I wasted. <br><br>Eventually I began to see the cost, first in the damage we've done to our town and city-scapes and countryside with our roads. How ugly everything has become. Then understanding the environmental damage, and finally peak oil and climate change. I simply could not ignore the cost – it wasn't worth it. But so many have too much invested in their cars, and not just the money. Their cars are a big portion of who they are, and their confusion is evident in how they presume an “I-Thou” (to use your term) relationship with their cars. For some their cars really do seem to be the extent of their personalities!<br><br>I still drive the econobox I've had for 13 years. I've got computers and cell phones because I must still function in the present world and deal with the infrastructure available. But these things are objects, simply tools. They don't matter to me, they're temporary ties to a fading reality. <br><br>The machines themselves are not really the problem, if they were regarded as the tools they are instead of objects in which to place our hopes and dreams. People use tools, it's part of who we are, and in an age where (for example) a tradesman might have a more appropriate level of tools, they might even have a certain fondness for their tools and some considerable interest in them. They'd probably better if they want to survive. Tools and machines that require energy sources and infrastructure that cannot be maintained or create dangerous byproducts are not viable and will be discarded. How do we discard the fixation on machines and get people to see the role the human plays as primary?

Many people defend radio (including myself) because one still had to think in order to imagine the visual behind the spoken words one was hearing. Yet it still controlled lives, creating a machine one had to sit around, typically in the living room away from outside noises, at fixed times of the day in order to catch particular broadcasted news or stories. Can we have degrees of machine acceptance - radio instead of television, public television and commercial-less movie channels instead of commercial television - or are machines truly an all or nothing in concept?<br><br>And what would you save about travelers? I am thinking here of both the continued existence of Gypsy and Irish travelers, but also the more modern replacement with the fuel-powered RV or caravan. On the one hand we are talking about a culture or society based on vagabond travelers, but on the other hand we are talking about a group or society dependent on some level of machine for that mobility. Granted, horse-drawn carriages, to the extent they still exist, aren't a machine to the same extent as diesel-powered RV monsters.<br><br>I've often longed for the idea of a traveler existence, despite all the ridicule it brings. John Steinbeck's "Travels with Charley" is a favorite book of mine, an nearly annual read. Minimal trappings of stuff and moving around as work or pleasure might dictate. But in the States, such a lifestyle, even if public property laws would suddenly change, would be very tough to do in post-oil times.<br><br><a href=#c4496138071755544014 title="comment permalink">1/26/12, 1:37 PM</a><br><br>

My lovely wife and I would spend our winters traveling all over the south. We rarely spent more than 3 days in one place. <br><br>All this time I was well aware of the huge infrastructure necessary to keep my nomadic lifestyle going. For the last ten years, I've slaked my conscience by driving old vehicles converted to run on waste veggie oil, knowing it was a limited and partial fix. <br><br>I accept the nomad in my soul. Recently I took up sailing on a small 19 foot boat. Rarely is the motor ever used. 3 -4 mph is enough movement to keep me happy. I smile the whole time. The natural world surrounds me. Passengers can easily talk and visit without the noise. It's more than a machine -it's a home. We can easily live a week or two without getting off the boat -even a boat this small. Allow for some time on land and resupply, we could travel for a long long time. <br><br>Sure, I've used marinas, but more often then not, we live at anchor, independent of those systems.<br><br>There is a long standing infrastructure for water travel, canals, coast guards, draw bridges, improved harbors and so on, but if that all goes away, the ocean, lakes and rivers are still there. <br><br>My boat is an old retrofitted fiberglass production craft, but it doesn't have to be. Wood and hemp will do the job. <br><br>The sense of freedom is more real in a small sailboat than it ever was in a private vehicle. It does what people hope a big RV camper will do -provide a mobile home that allows a person to feel free. <br><br>As for TV, pretty much gave up on it in my teens. It's more fun to meet people and do things. <br><br>The pull of travel is strong in some people. Most are tethered to real jobs and try to stuff that feeling into weekends and vacations. To keep the dream alive, they have their cars. Replace the car with something better and then change is possible.<br><br>I know no solution is perfect. Relying on public transportation doesn't make much sense to me either. Governments and businesses can change routes, fees, and services. That supplies no sense of freedom at all.<br><br><a href=#c1511407674025272426 title="comment permalink">1/26/12, 1:41 PM</a><br><br>

Taking, as JMG does, white America's history as descending from a bunch of groups wanting freedom from European persecution/repression, Slater also identifies "freedom" as a major national obsession which people from other cultures don't fully understand. However, Slater postulated that the American desire for freedom has metastasized away from "freedom to achieve" and into the more negative "freedom _FROM_ my fellow human beings", so we turn towards machines and faceless bureaucracies to give us personal autonomy and power without having to negotiate same from other people and from our communities. <br><br>In other words, JMG seems to be arguing that Americans became indifferent to the environment and to the suffering of others, after being educated to use science and machines. Slater seems to be arguing the reverse, that Americans turned to rely on machines much more than past or foreign cultures, _because_ we became indifferent and inured towards our fellow man -- a pathological reaction to our ancestors' persecution.<br><br>I just bring that up because I liked Slater's quote, regarding machines and faceless bureaucracies: that "Their indifference is a reflection of our own." Works either way.<br><br>(Slater seemed like a firebrand of a writer back in the 60s and 70s, but unfortunately, in the recent past I've read his writing on the Huffington Post, and he seems today much more like a plain partisan shill.)<br><br><a href=#c2669585290082004612 title="comment permalink">1/26/12, 6:17 PM</a><br><br>

And I've spent countless hours just clicking around pointlessly, going on to the next thing simply as distraction and avoidance, rather than as research or anything close to productive.<br><br>I'm not entirely sure what to do with that. I've had periods in my life when I spent much less time on the internet, and those were good periods.

I'm hesitant to give it up, and I dare hope that at some point I'll actually be helpful to some people with what I write.

It just seems so contradictory.<br><br>Yet, I think attempting to balance those contradictions is good. That's part of the work, and part of the process.

I grew up in the Deep South, in a family that was very prejudiced and set in it's ways. It was the medium of television, beaming images into our living room of black and white people relating in fairly egalitarian manners, of the civil rights movement, and later of the anti-war and counterculture movements that I have to credit with my not being today a very different person than I would have been otherwise. I'm not saying it's all positive. The TV is probably at least partially responsible for my ADD and no doubt other shortcomings of character that have made me in many ways less competitive than I might have been otherwise.

When I hear that people conflate the auto with freedom, it almost makes me want to laugh. The auto not only represents a major ceding of power to outside entities, it is a real burden. when I left home in 1974 to express my freedom, it was with a small backpack and a blanket. I hiked to the nearest highway and stuck out my thumb. I know I was just as dependent on the auto and its infrastructure as anyone, but I was not burdened by its demands. And when I could, I also jumped trains, though I suppose that just made me dependent on a different structure.<br><br>Today I own two vehicles. How the mighty have fallen. One is a truck I justify as necessary for farming and hauling produce to market, and the other is a old economy car. I try to limit my trips to town, but there always seems to be some need. And twice a year I and the dog hit the road in the truck and drive to California to be with my kids.

If I can swing my stable as I envision it, it would eventually end up being a way stop for travelers through the valley, breeding and training stock dogs &amp; a few horses, as a livery stable and a small farm.<br><br>Horses would be essential here, not so much for going down to California but for livestock and between stock dogs and horses that's the best way to gather and move cattle, at least as long as the railroad lasts. And as a hub for dried fruits, wine and liquor, this being orchard country. Also once that goes it would be cattle drives either north or south and most likely south. Otherwise this area will transform back to basic wilderness as the small towns dry up and blow away and the freeway crumbles and falls into the canyon.<br><br>I was always one of those silly girls with the romantic idea of a rougher way of living. Even with the 'modern conveniences' as I was growing up there were a few times when the modern world took a holiday and the lumber camp I grew up in had to depend on stored food and electricity-absent-without-leave during particularly hard winters. It was lucky that a gas line followed the power lines and those houses with lines could use gas to heat and cook, but being a lumber camp there was always plenty of wood to burn too. I can still remember carrying buckets of hot water across the road so my horses had something to drink! When that road was bladed off what snow remained was firmly packed and almost as slick as wet glass! Oh what fun! But that's a faint taste of what life will be like without some of our toys and conveniences.<br><br>I believe we're less likely to experience an urban panic unless we lose electrical power early and unexpectedly. OTOH food riots are more likely when things start to go south which is why I want to offer garden plots to my renters prior to things falling apart. Add in canning parties in the 'snack bar' and I'll have a ready made community support network for the stable if things get 'interesting' before they fall apart completely.

No that automobilism is not a problem here nowadays, but still, if you do not want to have a car, you simple do not need one. Public transportation is still amazing (though under pressure and not what it used to be especially in the country), except of new suburbia, which have been bulit for a decade or two, all towns and cities have the trraditional "density" and most of the most important services are accessible by walking, or at least decent cycling, or by public transporation, and you have the infrastructure for pedestrian almost everywhere (though development of the infrastructure for city biking is a struggle here in Prague indeed; it is not that much necessary in smaller towns and people use bikes there naturally and traditionally).<br><br>Also, I have never understood the status of the car in the American culture, though similar tendencies and manifestations of the automobilist mentality can be seen here as well, especially in the last fifteen years. There are actually many sociological studies which analyze and show the patology hidden behind automobilism and the "car culture", and the externalities are so striking that you can hardly stay blind to them, it would seem (from the impacts on the air to destruction of country or fragmentation of cities, etc. etc.). Unfortunately, many of it has been already grasped in Western Europe, but is difficult to explain to the east from there, where many indeed admire the American way of life. A post-communist trauma, one would say.<br><br>As far as Marx is concerned - I too think marxism is a bit misplaced here. It has much to do with Christianity indeed, but not in this way. Moreover, it is not marxism that is described here but rather only its deplorable role in the ideological framework of the ruling class in the communist coutries. Marx himself would surely not recognize marxism in the political practice of the Soviet Union or the Soviet bloc, and as a leading intellectual and philospher of his time, he would find the inferior fairytales elaborated by these regimes, in which he played one of the main roles, silly...<br><br><a href=#c3214235077500239515 title="comment permalink">1/27/12, 1:28 AM</a><br><br>

I imagine that if hosting costs increased tracking increasing energy costs, Facebook might get increasingly desperate in marketing user's information.....knowing that direct user charging would likely drive users away, and the 'network effect' it relies on would unravel if a very significant portion of people stopped using it. <br><br>Also I think Facebook, being fairly prescriptive in some ways of the way in which it expects its users to interact, has a negative effect there too. <br><br>However there are a couple of groups of friends, notably my Cornish language group that rely on it to arrange meetings and discussions, so I feel it would be difficult to disengage. <br><br>I actually deleted my Facebook profile last summer completely, I however rejoined about a month or two later starting again. <br><br>I think I will suspend my account again for the time being.<br><br><a href=#c552629118605003989 title="comment permalink">1/27/12, 9:26 AM</a><br><br>

It is set in the mid 1800's with Imperial Britain and all of the horrors brought to a culture that already had its own set of castes, slavery, indentured servitude and acceptance of their Indian ways of life. It seems to have been written for an East Indian audience as much of the language used is pidgeon and terms that only those versed in Indian culture might know. Its portrayal of the beliefs and psychology of the people is fascinating and shows how humans can be led into bondage of various kinds. In the reading thereof it is a simple step to compare our culture and the way beliefs here and now are utilized to sway opinion and desires. The TV ( dancing girls and men, sumptuous banquets, harems) and the auto ( oxen, horses, carts, wagons) are only the latest forms of desire to show power and status ( caste, position).

Get a bike or some other form of transportation and figure out how to get everywhere and carry the things you need with it. It will take some time to think of everything, which is why you keep the car handy until you figure it all out. You can just start with basic transportation and work all the way to actually giving up the car completely for all but long distance travel that you are not conditioned or have the time for. Refuse to use convienance as a credible reason for using the car vs. the bike to get every day transportation tasks done. This requires a somewhat strong imagination, as you have to legitimately believe in your own pretense that you don't have a car when its raining or shining, or whether the grocery store is 5 miles or 5 minutes away.<br><br>It took me about three years to overcome my inner objections fully. As you show how various tasks such as getting groceries home with panniers and going to work everyday by pedal are feasible, your husband will have less excuses about what you two can't afford to do without using a car for as you demonstrate it can be done, even if some things require a little more preparation than a joy ride.<br><br><a href=#c527676448750296865 title="comment permalink">1/27/12, 12:53 PM</a><br><br>

It's often pictured as a kind of counterfoil to the industrialised British state. Not entirely true since a fair amount of industrialisation happened there with metal (mostly tin and copper) mining. It was however one of the first places to experience de-industrialisation after the Industrial Revolution, beginning in 1860s when copper prices fell due to overseas competition. Emigration resulted, and from 1861 to 1961 Cornwall's population tended to decline.<br><br>On the one hand, the costs of periperality to the 'core' of the UK (i.e an axis running from London to the Midlands - which is targeted for the High Speed 2 line - extending the commuter belt to Birmingham...) are liable to increase with energy costs. <br><br>On the other there's a decent renewable energy potential with wind and probably even bigger, wave energy which is in process of being developed. <br><br>The overall picture depends on whether the emphasis economically will be on keeping a corporatist, centralised economy going at any cost, which is likely to result in preservation of the core at expense of peripheral areas, or a refocusing to human scale economic activity. <br><br>Trouble is there are so many vested interests in the former.<br><br><a href=#c5280010192854470768 title="comment permalink">1/27/12, 3:55 PM</a><br><br>

My most interesting thought about machines is that they have significantly altered how we think about things. Having machines around and using them as analogies for lots of aspects of life we begin to think that how we build, repair and modify machines applies to life. In doing so we grossly underestimate the complexity of life and how it works. With machines you can shut them off, remove a major part, replace or significantly modify it, put it back and tinker until you get the whole thing to work again. That is not the process that evolution has been able to use in designing life or evolving ecosystems. The interconnectedness of life makes our machine view of life seem like a joke. An example for fun is to imagine changing a tire on your car while driving. <br><br>Thanks for all the thought provoking JMG.<br><br><a href=#c6940135222662483273 title="comment permalink">1/27/12, 7:48 PM</a><br><br>

Lots of food for thought. I’d read about Buber and the I/Thou relationship, and it makes sense to apply it to Americans’ obsession with things (in fact, I often wonder if hoarding is due to being trapped in inappropriate I/Thou relationships with things). I love the point about the car being faux freedom and the tv faux community! When I see friends get slack-jawed in front of a tv, I’m appalled – very zombie-like. I don’t have a tv, and don’t miss one. My truck, OTOH, compensates for a bad back and hip that needs (and won’t get) replacement. I consider it a prosthetic. &lt;:-}<br><br>Good point about the difference in perception of long journeys! Never thought of that, but again, that makes sense.<br><br>In general, our culture has really fallen for the myth of independence, rather than seeing our interdependence. Ran Prieur commented on this post on his blog: “I've written before that America is a nation of mad kings. Machines make this possible by giving us something to rule without ruling each other.” Most of us have shifted to power relationships, preferring things that can “submit” to relating with other people, who have to be asked.<br><br>But the other part of the defensiveness about cars is the fact that most people could not live the life they now lead without one, and they know it, and they can’t even imagine the disruption they would have to endure to switch away from it. That’s a huge aspect of modern life: we expect to be “efficient” and “effective” and speed and large transport ability is part of that. I spent years in various cities where I could take bus or walk, and still it was impossible to carry home what was needed except in small batches and multiple trips (true, once I carried an entire encyclopedia home from Barnes &amp; Noble on 25th to my East Village apt on 6th, but that was a NYC exception). There were definitely times that I had to choose to drop several activities in a day because I couldn’t do them all by bus. Most people won’t choose that, unless they have to. I am appalled at the number of friends and family who have commented to me that they don’t even <b>look</b> at the gas price – they just fill up “because they have to”. So money, even, isn’t the controlling issue – it’s speed, efficiency, and the ability to do what they feel they need to do in a day. Until we drop our expectations, I doubt this will change. And part of the trap is that this “efficiency” and speed keep people from having the time for introspection that would help them see the insanity of it all.<br><br><a href=#c7957572597824872443 title="comment permalink">1/28/12, 7:19 AM</a><br><br>

This could explain why so many people assume that giving someone power automatically means that person is going to (or should) wield that power like a jerk. Power corrupts, but power over machines corrupts one's human relationships. And this confusion is exacerbated by people's tendency to anthropomorphize complex machines. <br><br>What other things do we assign Deep Meaning to? Hmm... apart from the computer, which so many people have mentioned, someone mentioned central heat... I can also see central air as something people cling to; perhaps a symbol of being "civilized" or not slowed down by nature? Heck, the single-family house is a symbol. Look at the reactions people get if they claim to prefer renting an apartment (no maintenance costs! no yard to maintain! no debt!). It's even more severe than when I tell people I don't have a TV.<br><br>I guess this is the answer to my question a few weeks ago, on the narrative that steampunk embodies. In steampunk stories, the heroes are mostly people who make machines. Some of them make machines that have inner lives of their own, yet are bound to their creators as if they didn't. Some, like Dr. Frankenstein, use machines to make people and then are surprised when those people have inner lives. And these machines are what give the steampunk societies their shape. Does this scan? Can anyone add to my analysis?<br><br>Hmph, for narratives, maybe we're better off with Little House on the Prairie.<br><br><a href=#c7824529761304427109 title="comment permalink">1/28/12, 3:04 PM</a><br><br>

(PA and OH come to mind)I had the rare opportunity to attend an Amish horse auction in central pa - ( not far from where i grew up) it was a "working" horse auction of at least 400 horses. Road, buggy and plow horses,mules and donkeys. It was primarily managed by and supported by Amish and/or old order Mennonites. There were a few "english" (non deutch americans with English as first language) types with trailers to move horses to modern farms , a few more owned or leased by more modern deutch orders to get the horses home, but otherwise, life goes on without supplemental trucks or trailers. The rural roads there often have buggy lanes, the shopping centers have horse hitches, etc. It is a fairly bustling, though local and small scale economy .. at least in the central PA rural land that I grew up in. I think a fairly interesting model for a post industrial future. I spent a while at a local mennonite supermarket examining how far the food was transported.. I think it was safe to estimate that more than 50% of all the food- was produced withing 100 miles..fresh eggs,produce, meat ( that is common in farmer markets across the us) but ALSO- preserved, frozen and canned products - everyday essentials like flour, cornmeal, canned veggetables, sauces, soups, broth, milk, a great variety of delicatesent cheeses and cold cuts, dried noodles, pickled goods, dried fruits, nuts, home made pies,,, "processed" Delights like ice cream, candy, bread, corn chips, pretzels, pototoe chips. Frozen convenience foods like piroges, french fries, chicken, beef, pork,sausage ( even farm raised buffalo and elk). ALL of these items made with in PA..Other items....Though not sold in PA Deutch stores one can easily find breweries and wineries and tobbaco producing products locally. I think we can learn from all kinds of places but what a delight to know places or systems that have thrived for a few centuries in a low industrial economy still exist.<br><br><a href=#c8514584555835254751 title="comment permalink">1/28/12, 7:51 PM</a><br><br>

The real poor are people on foot. We evolved as bipeds, to walk.<br><br>I was an okay walker in my 20s, and could make around 25 miles in a day on a mountain trail without too much problem. I did not own a car until I was 25, and though I had a bicycle, I enjoyed walking more in most cases. I was never much of a runner, but I could walk, and my little brother was way better than me. No way can I do that now, in my 50s, and with 15 years of desk cubicle life, etc. But I am trying to work back into it.<br><br>Humanity spread over the globe on two feet. The San people of Africa, the Hopi here in the U.S., and the Tarahumara of Mexico are all examples of how well a trained human being can make a hundred miles in a day, and even wear down game animals like deer in a patient, relentless human pace. My own tribe the Ioway are recorded by the French in 1680, before we got the horse, as having run alongside buffalo to shoot them with arrows.<br><br>I have a bike, and it is the easiest and most fun way for modern people to cover long distances in a fairly short time with little effort. Yes, in some ways it is much more efficient than an auto or even walking for many people. And bikes can be transformed into light cargo transport of people of goods. I see them pulling trailers here in town with recycle bins. <br><br>Using one's reason to choose transport, while we still have it is the key. In some instances, across town or commuting, bikes are probably best. When transporting a sick person, a number of small children, or going to a remote ranch in reasonable amount of time, nothing can beat an auto (people who turn up their noses at cars and swell up in pride, while mooching rides with others who have cars, make me laugh). Yes, autos will go away some day, but they have their place now, if one uses reason and thought.<br><br>But bikes, their manufacture, parts, tires, and lubricants are all dependent on oil. People steal bikes. You have to park them and they depend on decent roads and trails. Cars try to run you over. Ice and snow are issues as are steep grades and wind. You do have to spend money on them too.<br><br>Our two feet are our ancient mode. And if you become your own cobbler, learning how to make mukluks and moccasins and repair them as you go (scavenged materials from upholstery, old auto tires, or tanning/curing hides), or you live in warmer climes and toughen your feet or learn to make sandals from the same kinds of materials, you are set to go.<br><br>I am learning to make my own footwear from available materials as my own legacy to pass down to the next generation, should a person not be able to afford shoes.

One thought that occurred to me is that some people seem to resist an I/it relationship with their machines. It is not uncommon to give names to automobiles or even computers, and talking to the things is just a given, sometimes coaxing, sometimes cursing, sometimes praising. On the other hand, we have the tendency to treat other people as objects. I wonder how frequently these tendencies are seen in the same person. We certainly have historic precedent—heroes who use their named sword to hack down enemies who are seen as interchangeable units of evil. Goodness we are a muddled up species. <br>I have increasingly noticed that, even for those who drive, the areas fitted up for cars are hostile territory once you leave the car. Drive to the mall and once you exit your car you are on your own to dodge vehicles that are seeking a parking space, entering or exiting a space, or entering or leaving the parking lot. Only handicapped spaces are given marked pathways to the buildings. The situation is particularly hazardous for people with small children in tow. I don’t know how many times I have repeated the phrase, “This is a parking lot, you have to hold my hand.” You would think that shop owners would want customers to reach their premises intact and in a good mood, but apparently the idea of surrendering a few feet of potential parking space in favor of walkways is unsupportable. <br>There have been two recent articles about mass transit in Slate online magazine. The first “What’s the Best Way to Get Users to Embrace Mass-Transit” by Tom Vanderbilt, posted 1/19/12, discusses planning transit systems to attract passengers. Interesting ideas and commentary. But I believe I have a simple three part answer. Mass transit has to go WHERE people need to go, WHEN they need to go there, RELIABLY. We don’t need cute names like Oahu’s “TheRIde”, or cute vehicles like trolley cars, or high concept vehicles like monorails. We just need to be sure when we set out that a bus or train will go get us to our destination and home again in a reasonable time and with reasonable reliability. Years ago I read an interview with the director of Bay Area Rapid Transit in which he excused his failure to use public transit on the grounds that he had important meetings to attend. I wish the reporter had followed up with some comment like “So what you are saying is that mass transit is for the masses, not for important people like yourself?” <br>The second Slate article, “Train in Vain” by Matthew Yglesias, posted 1/27/12, tells of an expected change in the federal regulations controlling the type of transit projects that are approved. Currently the rules require that a project show promise of reducing commute time. Since trains making frequent stops cannot compete with autos the type of projects approved usually parallel a heavily traveled route that cannot be expanded and features stations relatively far apart with large parking lots. Bay Area Rapid Transit is an example: neither the tunnel between the eastern suburbs and the Bay, nor the Bay Bridge could be widened, so the BART trains could realistically be expected to speed commuters on their way. The new rules will allow the number of riders who will be served to be considered as part of the cost/benefit analysis. I was not surprised that most of the comments on these two articles lambasted the authors for the very idea that mass transit should be considered an important part of America’s transportation plans. Obviously the American public has internalized the BART manager’s attitude that trains and buses are not convenient or reliable enough for important people to use.<br><br><a href=#c4188138848383315215 title="comment permalink">1/29/12, 8:53 PM</a><br><br>

Later, grass and clover swards in temperate agriculture provided a sustainable basis for more intensive farming. Even if you do not graze animals on your lawn it is possible to transfer sustainably some of the fertility (grass clippings by hand-mowing?) to your compost heap. Meanwhile your sward is building some useful nitrogen and carbon, and if you need to suddenly extend your cultivation for vegetables there is a fertile soil waiting. Also in the meanwhile, many birds can feed off your lawn.

As I mentioned around this time last week, I've been on the road -- had a three day workshop in Minneapolis to teach, and that and the train trip there and back ate most of a week. I'm sorry to say that I won't be responding individually to 140 comments!<br><br>One comment, though. I found it interesting, and wryly amusing, that several people here and others elsewhere on the net got very hot under the collar about my comments on Marxism. Yes, I have read Marx's <i>Das Kapital</i>, including the two later volumes edited by Engels -- it was to the latter that I was referring, of course, when I mentioned the shining promises that have been such a central part of Marxist apocalyptic rhetoric. (I hadn't heard about the handwriting analysis, as mentioned by Ash -- that does cast an intriguing light on the genesis of the Marxist theory of history.) <br><br>Those who feel that I've treated Marx roughly, though, should take heart. I'm convinced that the next few years will see a serious attempt to revive Marxism as a major political movement here in the United States, and for the thirty years or so that'll follow -- that's about how long a popular cultural movement in the US generally lasts -- they will have plenty of people agreeing with them. I really doubt they'll get any further than the last big Marxist movement in the US did, but in the interval, it should be a very exciting time to be a Marxist.<br><br><a href=#c7318247498660698021 title="comment permalink">1/31/12, 2:32 PM</a><br><br>

Following Richard Heinberg in 'The Party's Over', we can distinguish four categories of tools, roughly corresponding to four major watersheds of social evolution:<br><br>1. Tools that require only human energy for their manufacture and use.<br>2. Tools that require an external power source for their manufacture, but human power for their use.<br>3. Tools that require only human energy for their manufacture, but harness an external energy source.<br>4. Tools that require an external energy source for their manufacture and use.<br><br>The boundary between machine and non-machine is unclear, but one can state that category one and two tools are not 'machines', while category four tools certainly are. Category three tools are harder to classify. I would argue that a wooden plough and a sailboat (both category three tools) are not machines, while a windmill (also a category three tool) probably is. It depends, it seems to me, on the level of mechanical complexity of the category three tool in question. There may also be some time dependence here: in the medieval period, a windmill would certainly have been considered 'a machine' - in the 21st century, not so much, because the mechanical complexity is much more widely understood.<br><br>Anyway, in the case of the bicycle, category 3 classifications are academic, because a bicycle is clearly a category 2 tool. Ergo, a bicycle is not a 'machine'.<br><br>Another useful way of thinking about this is that 'machines' were unknown before the holocene era, and will doubtless be in short supply again when the fossil fuel era has ended.<br><br><a href=#c7170586690039252800 title="comment permalink">2/1/12, 7:11 AM</a><br><br>

Tool because use depends on hands that have opposable thumbs, at least to start. I'm certain some lucky people can balance their entire lives and never need a handlebar, but most need the handlebar. You have to be able to grip the handlebar to balance and to turn, to point the front wheel or to back up. To park and lock the chain. To hold the handlebar while you put the kickstand down. If your bike has gear shifts and handlebar brakes, voila, another demand you have opposable thumbs.<br><br>The machine parts are pedal, the gear(s) and the sprocket chain that meshes. You could sit on a bicycle and push yourself along with both feet. But the pedal, single gear and sprocket chain allows your feet to pedal and then transfers your downward circular motion into a conversion factor that allows you to go forward. <br><br>You can tie baskets or build a come-along cart or a rickshaw.

These are: Lever, Inclined Plane, Wheel and Axle, Screw, Wedge, Pulley. I might contend that the screw and wedge are forms of an inclined plane, and that the wheel and axle is a form of lever.<br><br>The dictionary claims a tool is <em> <br>A device or implement, esp. one held in the hand, used to carry out a particular function.</em> and a machine is <em> <br>An apparatus using or applying mechanical power to perform a particular task.</em><br><br>From this, my take is that a machine transforms energy from one form to another, to perform a task.<br><br>Thus the bicycle transform leg muscle changes into forward motion, the windmill applies wind energy to various processes from pumping water to grinding grain and sawing wood.<br><br>Most tools will be a machine of some kind. <br><br>As for the Heinberg class of "tools", this appears to be contrived to identify risks that particular tools and processes might not be available in the future. In that light, I would restate the "external energy" as "industrial era energy source".<br><br>Many common hand tools, from woodworking chisels and planes to hammers, saws, garden hand tools, cooking utensils, and more, have been and can be made using scrap iron or steel or iron ore, and charcoal, coal, or industrial gases. (I am not sure methane will reach the heat density needed to work steel; there is still brass and bronze, though, at wood fire temperatures.) <br><br>When looking at the list, though, keep in mind the premise -- that the retreat from the industrial era is likely already underway. And that the pace of decline may or may not increase noticeably in any particular decade. That is, adapting early avoids the last minute rush, when the realization that the last truck into town has already arrived and departed. Or that with *this* particular power outage, we can no longer depend on electricity being available for any particular use or event.
