Last week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> post, despite its wry comparison of industrial civilization’s current predicament with the plots and settings of pulp fantasy fiction, had a serious point. Say what you will about the failings of cheap fantasy novels—and there’s plenty to be said on that subject, no question—they consistently have something that most of the allegedly more serious attempts to make sense of our world usually lack: the capacity to envision truly profound change.<br><br>That may seem like an odd claim, given the extent to which contemporary industrial society preens itself on its openness to change and novelty. Still, it’s one of the most curious and least discussed features of that very openness that the only kinds of change and novelty to which it applies amount to, basically, more of the same thing we’ve already got. A consumer in a modern industrial society is free to choose any of a dizzying range of variations on a suffocatingly narrow range of basic options—and that’s equally true whether we are talking about products, politics, or lifestyles.<br><br>I suppose the automobile is the most obvious example, but it has dimensions not always recognized and these bear a closer look. To begin with, the vast majority of cars for sale these days are simply ringing changes on a suite of technologies that was introduced in the late 19th century and hit maturity close to fifty years ago. That’s as true of electric and hybrid cars, by the way, as it is of the usual kind—the hype surrounding the so-called “hybrid revolution” conveniently fails to mention that the same system has been used for more than sixty years in diesel-electric locomotives, and cars powered by electricity were common on American roads before the Big Three auto firms succeeded in getting a stranglehold on the industry during the last Great Depression. Steam-powered cars were also to be had back then—the Stanley Steamer was a famous brand; try finding one now. <br><br>What variations can be found nowadays are almost entirely a matter of style rather than substance, and this becomes even more evident when it’s recognized that the auto is simply one way to get people and light cargoes from one place to another. Are there other ways to do this? You bet, but none of them get the saturation advertising, the huge capital investments in manufacturing and distribution, or the vast government subsidies on local, state, and federal levels that cars receive on an ongoing basis. It’s a continuing source of amusement to listen to the pseudoconservatives who dominate the Republican Party these days denounce the very modest government funding that goes to passenger rail service and public transit. Ask them if they’re willing to give up Federal highway dollars, to name only one of the huge subsidies that autos receive, and you’ll very quickly hear a different tune.<br><br>It so happens that I don’t own or drive a car, and indeed I never have. Among its other benefits, that’s a good way to see the limits on the alleged freedom of choice that the consumer economy provides its inmates. In today’s America, you can live without a car, but most other choices you make are going to be sharply curtailed by that decision. When my wife and I decided a few years back to leave the west coast and settle in the Rust Belt, scores of pleasant towns we might otherwise have chosen were ruled out in advance because the only way to go from there to anywhere else was to drive a car, and our options for buying a house were just as tightly constrained by the need to be within walking distance of groceries and other necessary services. All those choices the propagandists of the consumer economy prattle about? They exist, but only if you give up your right to make any of the decisions that matter.<br><br>That same logic applies across the board in today’s industrial societies. What products would you like to buy? If it’s not something that a handful of gargantuan corporations want to make and market for you, good luck. Would you like a voice in the political process? Sure, but only if you agree with one of two or three major parties whose positions differ so little you’ll need a micrometer to tell them apart. How about a different lifestyle? Here’s the list of available options, every one of them a slight variation on the common theme of shopping for products and running up debt; if that’s not what you have in mind, sorry, we don’t have anything else in stock.<br><br>All this can be seen as simply one material expression of the thaumaturgy we discussed a while back in these posts, the manipulation of basic drives through the endless repetition of emotionally charged symbols that serves to swamp the thinking mind and keep the individual penned in a narrow circle of self-defeating behaviors. From another perspective, though, the torrent of material goodies that comes surging through the channels of the consumer economy is the payoff for cooperating with the existing order of things; so long as you want the things you’re supposed to want, you can have them in fantastic abundance. It’s no exaggeration to point out that average middle class people in the industrial world just now have access to material benefits that emperors couldn’t expect to get five hundred years ago. That’s their share of the payoff for acquiescing in the status quo.<br><br>That’s the great strength of the "magician states" Ioan Culianu talked about in <i>Eros and Magic in the Renaissance</i>, those nations—and if you’re reading this, you’re almost certainly living in one—that maintain control over populations by thaumaturgy rather than by brute force. The thaumaturgy is backed up by very real material benefits for those who cooperate. Those who don’t—well, my own experience is a case in point; by the standards of most of humanity, I lead an extremely comfortable life, but most of the people I know are horrified by the thought that if it’s raining and I have errands to run, I put on a coat and open up an umbrella and go for a walk in the rain. They’d be more horrified still to learn that I deal with summer’s heat and humidity without an air conditioner, and respond to cold nights in winter by putting on a sweater rather than turning up the heat, but I don’t go out of my way to bring those details to their attention; my car-free life is enough of a shock for most of them.<br><br>Of course there’s more to it than that. The more of the payoff you refuse, the sharper the restrictions you have to live with. Now of course the less privileged classes in the industrial world, and the vast majority of people elsewhere, live with those restrictions every day of their lives, but suggest to those who don’t that they might find it useful to accept those restrictions, and I’m sure you can imagine the response you’re likely to get. Still, this is exactly what I intend to suggest, because there’s another factor in the situation, and it’s the one this blog has been discussing for more than five years now.<br><br>The entire operation of the modern magician state, after all, depends utterly on uninterrupted access to gargantuan supplies of cheap, highly concentrated energy. The considerable amount of energy that goes to power the communication technologies that get thaumaturgy to its target audiences is only a drop in the oil barrel of the whole energy cost of the system. A much larger amount goes to supply and maintaining the infrastructure of thaumaturgy, and of course the largest fraction of all goes into produce that torrent of goods and services mentioned above, the collective payoff that keeps those target audiences docile. Now factor in the depletion of concentrated energy sources—above all petroleum, which provides 40% of the world energy supply and close to 100% of energy used in transportation—and the proud towers of the magician state abruptly turn out to rest on foundations of sand.<br><br>To understand the consequences of that awkward fact, it’s important to get past the rhetoric of victimization that fills so much space in discussions of social hierarchy these days. Of course the people at or near the upper end of the pyramid get a much larger share of the proceeds of the system than anybody else, and those at or near the bottom get crumbs; that’s not in question. The point that needs making is that a great many people in between those two extremes also benefit handsomely from the system. When those people criticize the system, their criticisms by and large focus on the barriers that keep them from having as large a share as the rich—not the ones that keep them from having as small a share as the poor, or to phrase things a little differently, that keep their privileged share from being distributed more fairly across the population as a whole.<br><br>Map the factor of middle class privilege onto the history of protest over the last half century or so and some otherwise puzzling trends are easy to understand. The collapse of the 1960s protest movement here in America, for example, followed prompty on the abolition of the military draft in 1972. The real force behind that movement was the simple fact that the American middle classes were no longer willing to send their sons off to Vietnam, and were willing to use their not inconsiderable political clout to make that change of heart heard. It was indeed heard; the draft ended, the US extricated itself awkwardly from the Vietnam war, and the protest movement popped like a punctured balloon, leaving a minority of radicals who believed they were leading a revolution sitting among the shreds and wondering what happened. Attempts to launch American antiwar movements since that time have foundered on the unmentionable but real fact that middle class Americans by and large have no trouble at all reconciling themselves to war, as long as someone else’s kids are doing the fighting.<br><br>It’s in this light that last year’s spasmodic outbursts of protest from within the middle classes need to be understood. Since the peak of conventional petroleum production in 2005, economies around the world—above all the economies of the US and its inner circle of allies, which use more petroleum per capita than anybody else—have been stuck in a worsening spiral of dysfunction, and the middle classes have abruptly found themselves struggling to maintain their lifestyles. Their annoyance at that fact is easy to understand. From their point of view, after all, they’ve kept up their side of the bargain; they’ve bought what they were supposed to buy, borrowed when they were supposed to borrow, lined up obediently behind one or another of the approved political parties, and steered clear of all the hard questions. Now the payoff that was supposed to be their reward for all this, the payoff their parents and grandparents always got on time and that they themselves could rely on until now, is nowhere to be seen.<br><br>The payoff is nowhere to be seen, in turn, as a result of processes sketched out more than thirty years ago in a forgotten classic of political economy, Paul Blumberg’s 1980 study <i>Inequality in an Age of Decline</i>. Analyzing the downward spiral of the American economy in the 1970s—the last time, please note, that soaring energy prices clamped down on an industrial society—Blumberg showed that while a rising tide lifts all boats, a falling tide behaves in a much more selective fashion, as those groups with more political influence and economic clout are able to hang onto a disproportionate share of a shrinking pie at the expense of those with less.<br><br>The decades since Blumberg’s book appeared have only sharpened his argument. One after another, nearly every economic sector has undergone drastic reorganizations that slashed jobs, pay, and benefits for everyone below the middle class, and a growing number of people in the lower end of the middle class itself. Now that everyone below them has been thrown under the bus, the middle classes are discovering that it’s their turn next, as the classes above them scramble to maintain their own access to the payoffs of privilege. Having nodded and smiled while those further down the pyramid got shafted, the middle classes are in no position to mount an effective resistance now that they’re the ones being made redundant. I can almost hear a former midlevel manager in an unemployment line saying: "First they laid off the factory workers, but I said nothing, because I wasn’t a factory worker..."<br><br>Of course that’s not the way most people in today’s middle class like to think of things, and the gap between the reality of middle class privilege and the sort of rhetoric the Occupy movement spread last year—the claim that privilege applies only to the 1% of the population who are much richer than the middle class—opens an immense field of action for zealots and demagogues. Make the claim that you can keep the middle class supplied with its familiar comforts and status symbols and you’ll be able to count on a following in the years to come. The demand for that particular form of comforting nonsense is already booming, and an increase in the supply is already forthcoming; human nature being what it is, it’s probably not safe to assume that all those who provide the supply will be harmless nitwits.<br><br>This is where the capacity to envision profound change mentioned at the beginning of this essay becomes essential. In order to make sense of the future bearing down on us, it’s necessary to recognize that the privileged lifestyles of the recent past were the product of the chain of historical accidents that handed over half a billion years of stored sunlight to be burnt at extravagant rates by a handful of the world’s nations. Now that the supply is running short, those lifestyles are going away, and since the decline in petroleum production is gradual rather than sudden, the way it works out is that some people are losing access to them sooner than others. The automatic reaction on the part of most people facing this challenge is to cling to their familiar perks and privileges like grim death; the problem with that reaction, of course, is that the deathgrip in question very quickly becomes mutual.<br><br>The alternative is to let go of the perks and privileges before they drag you down. That may be the least popular advice I could offer, but it’s also among the most necessary. Over the years to come, as the real economy of goods and services contracts in lockstep with the depletion of fossil fuels, the fight over what’s left of the benefits of a failing industrial system is likely to become far more brutal than it is today. In the long run, that’s a fight with no winners. The alternative is to walk away, now, while you still have the time and resources to do it at your own pace.<br><br>This doesn’t mean, it probably needs to be said, pursuing the sort of green tokenism that’s become the latest form of conspicuous consumption in some circles on the leftward side of American life: the overpriced hybrid car parked ostentatiously in front of the suburban house with a few grid-tied solar panels on the roof, and the rest of it. It means giving things up: for example, doing without a car, getting rid of the suburban house and moving to a smaller, older, more efficient home two blocks from the bus route that will take you to work every day. It means accepting limits, not in some vague and abstract sense (which generally means accepting them for other people), but in the painfully specific sense that applies to your own choices. It means doing without things you want, during the difficult process of unlearning the mental automatisms that make you want them in the first place.<br><br>Unpleasant as it seems, this strategy has two massive advantages. The first is that you’ll quickly find yourself saving a great deal of money. Sell your car, and what you now spend on car payments, fuel, maintenance, insurance, and the rest of it, can go to something with a future. Apply the same logic to the other money-wasting habits of the middle class, and the money adds up fast. Since getting or staying out of debt, and providing yourself with the tools and skills you’ll need to get by in an age of decline, ought to be among your core priorities just now, that extra money is a valuable tool. So is the spare time you’ll have—most of those money-wasting habits are also time-wasting habits, remember.<br><br>The second advantage is one I’ve mentioned here before. If you’re going to be poor in the future, and you are, you might as well learn how to do it competently. It’s entirely possible to lead a life that’s poor in terms of money, material goods, and energy consumption, and profoundly rich—far richer than most contemporary lifestyles—in human values. If you’re going to do that, though, you’re going to have to learn how it’s done, and the only school where you can study that is that ancient institution, the school of hard knocks. If you start cutting your energy use and your material wants now, before you’re forced to do so, you can get past the hard part of the learning curve while you still have other options.<br><br>Thus it’s time, and maybe even past time, to wake up and walk away. Doing that, though, is going to require confronting one of the core superstitions of the modern world; we’ll discuss that next week.<br><br>**************<br><span style=font-size:130%>End of the World of the Week #5</span><br><br>You might think that the habit of predicting the apocalypse would yield a bumper crop of self-fulfilling prophecies. Convince enough people that the end is nigh, and you might just get enough of them to do something crazy enough to make some approximation to the end of the world happen, right? Over the three thousand years or so since the apocalypse meme started on its long and merry way through human history, there have been some examples of that phenomenon—but even then, things generally haven’t turned out the way the prophets thought it would.<br><br>One instance worth remembering can be found in the War Scroll, one of the famous Dead Sea Scrolls, which were written right around the beginning of the Common Era in what is now part of Jordan, and was then a bleak corner of the Roman province of Judea. The War Scroll deserves its name; it’s a lurid advance account of the final conflict between the forces of light and the powers of darkness, and if you know your way around the Jewish apocalyptic literature of that period you know that by definition the powers of darkness spoke Latin and took their marching orders from the big cheese in Rome.<br><br>As apocalyptic literature goes, the War Scroll ranks well up there for sheer verbal color. "On the day that the Romans fall there shall be a battle and horrible carnage before the God of Israel, for it is a day appointed by him since ancient times as a battle of annihilation for the sons of darkness," it bellows. "The sons of light and the forces of darkness shall fight together to show the strength of God with the roar of a great multitude and the shouts of gods and men: a day of disaster."<br><br>It was prophetic harangues like this one, historians agree, that set the stage for the three Jewish revolts against Rome in 66, 115, and 132 CE. A great many Jewish people by that time convinced themselves that their Messiah would show up to lead them to triumph against Rome. That’s not how things worked out, though; the Romans won every round, and those on the other side who survived were either sold into slavery or driven into exile. The result was indeed "a day of disaster," but the disaster fell almost entirely on the heads of the Jewish people.<br><br>—story from <a href="http://www.vivaeditions.com/book_page.php?book_id=25">Apocalypse Not</a>

I own a car but I walk to work everyday. It's about 1.5 miles each way. It is always funny to see peoples reactions to the fact I walk when I own a perfectly good car and can afford the gas. The reactions range from bewilderment to subtle hostility. Every now and then I'll get a "That's cool, I should walk to but it just seems like to much trouble. That's good YOU do it though." I am at the current advantage that I live and work close by. I'm in the Army and thus have little say in where I live and work so in the future I might not be so fortunate. I would love to walk away from my car completely though. So for now I walk when I can.<br>I find your analysis of the peace movement especially timely since I was discussing the same thing with my sister a few days ago. I stated that I didn't feel the peace movement of that era was completely sincere since it ended about the same time as the draft and our (US) involvement in Vietnam. It wasn't like wars ended. It seems anybody who held onto the ideals of the era was later ridiculed as being "stuck in the 60's". It seems it was less about peace and more about a strong desire not to get shot by some Vietnamese kid in some far off jungle. <br>I apologize because this might not be the right place to ask this but I wanted to make a donation and when I click the button it sends me to paypal. Can I pay this way, and if so what do I use as the recipient address? Thanks.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c4753228469957742843 title="comment permalink">1/18/12, 6:22 PM</a><br><br>

I do not deny that we are all on a sinking ship, but do not agree with the notion that as a result the middle class should just accept increasing inequality. Since you observe that wealth during decline is disproportionately distributed to the top, does it not follow that the decline experienced by the middle class would be less severe if inequality were reduced to the levels seen in the past via policy changes?<br><br>In other words I think there is a third path, one other than accepting comforting nonsense as you rightly put it or alternatively accepting growing inequality and embracing voluntary poverty. The third path is to fight to restore economic equality while simultaneously embracing voluntary poverty and sustainability.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c2775081758925244236 title="comment permalink">1/18/12, 7:09 PM</a><br><br>

And elites would have us believe that it is our own discretion, or lack thereof, which makes us self-defeating-thus alluding to the fact that subjugation to "emotionally charged symbols" could likely be a form of victimization when the elusiveness of thaumaturgy is not yet realized by the victim. We, of course, do not have to take the bait, but it is a form of victimization nonetheless for children whom do not yet possess the aptitude or discernment to reject thaumaturgy at its source before they are penned to the rabbit hole of industrial society that could take them a lifetime to free themselves from. I fight corporate America day-in and day-out for my children's future (that is a future they decide) and I must say it is the most difficult challenge I have faced yet. Far greater than my own individual challenges to live a more simple and more self-reliant life.<br><br>Class war is evident and it doesn't take awareness of thaumaturgy to witness this process within the policymaking halls of elite society. Symbols and emotive behavior have their place in this process and set the tone and pitch, but are pale in comparison to the blatant attacks that well financed interests levy on the general population through so-called government reforms. Take the anti-piracy legislation(s), privatization of public amenities, the permanent war economy, destruction of the commons, denial of ecological limits, and on and on and you have a recipe for feelings and cycles of victimization.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c8625613971359972527 title="comment permalink">1/18/12, 7:14 PM</a><br><br>

I just put in my two week notice to the corporate sponsored American hologram on Monday. My wife and I were prepared to walk away from our house to leave the insanity behind and move in with a relative (we had decided that staying here would essentially make us debt servants on parole for the banks since the mortgage was the only thing keeping us). The next day, due to a facebook post on my wife's part, we found a young couple who wants to buy our house. Then 14 acres of pasture land makes itself available directly behind the house we will be moving into. The owner is in his 70's and just needs somebody to tend the land to keep it in the farm program so as not to pay all of the back taxes. He doesn't care what I do with the land so long as it's agriculture.<br><br>Then today, I meet a local farmer who is switching over to organic methods and possible going to practice some cutting edge acquaponics. He's willing to take me on as an intern. <br><br>Even after all of that I still had a kernel of doubt because we have a toddler and we have to give up the medical insurance. My dilemma was that I didn't want to be selfish because my son comes first, and his needs are more important than mine. This is where most of my doubt came from. <br><br>This is just too much synchronicity for me to ignore. It's almost like you wrote this blog to ease my mind (although I realize this is not the case, it has that effect). I recently blogged about the myth of progress and in the comments of that blog I had a discussion with another of your followers about this very thing. That being how you seem to blog about things we are doing just after we do them? <br><br>It's as if just being aware of the synchronicity causes more of it to happen. Or is it the other way around? Coincidentally (or not if the synchronicity bit holds) enough I have just recently committed myself to the study of Druidry.

I hope your housemates have figured out some of the advantages by this time. <br><br>Draft, take the numbers for income inequality in the US, and then subtract from the share of the upper class the total value of US-owned derivatives and other hallucinatory wealth. It's a remarkable experience. There will indeed be less inequality, but not the way you're suggesting -- rather, all classes are leveling down toward poverty. <br><br>DC, er, did you read my comment about the rhetoric of victimization?

If there's really no way you can decrease your dependency on the system below what it is now, in order to free up money and time, then it's possible that yes, you're screwed.

The message isn't new, but some of your phrasing and contextual arrangement was and I found it very helpful. Loved your use of "inmates."<br><br>I think there are many people who understand the idea that certain oil-producing countries use a good chunk of the cash and energy from that commodity to keep their population acquiescent. It's written about in mainstream news articles. Turn that around and note that the United States does the exact same thing, though, and I imagine most people would scoff at the very notion. But it's very much true.<br><br>Thanks to your writings, I've made it a specific goal this year to further my life of poverty. I suppose I'm already there in comparison with the majority of the population, but I also have a ways to go. So this will be a year of intense gardening, paid farm work, studying, learning to do and create useful things with salvaged material and blogging about all of it.<br><br>I have an example that I think fits into what you're arguing for. I am soon going to have to move from the small farm/off-grid homestead that I've been living on for nearly a year. I have two jobs with local farms, though, and so am staying in the area. Having to decide where to live next, I considered one of the farms that I have a job with, which just happens to be a short walk down the road from my current residence. Yet, I wasn't thrilled with the idea of living there, due to a couple small inconveniences and the condition of the place I would be living. In other words, it wasn't ideal. I would likely be dealing with a few annoyances I prefer not to deal with.<br><br>But the more I thought about it, the more I couldn't say no. By moving there, I see multiple benefits. I will have pretty much as much room as I want to garden; I'll have access to plenty of manure for use in that garden; I'll already be on site for one of my jobs, eliminating a commute; I'll be able to pay my rent via work-trade rather than cash; and I'll be near the farm I'm on now, which will likely prove to be one of my main social outlets.<br><br>On the other hand, I could have looked for a "better" place to live (read: easier in the sense of eliminating some of the inconveniences I see on the farm down the road) and probably ended up in town. This would lead to a commute to <em>both</em> my jobs <em>and</em> my main social outlet. It would almost certainly cost more, and I would have to pay cash for it. I don't know if I would have gardening space and, if I did, I would have to find and bring in more fertilizer for it. All in all, it would be far more expensive, even if it provided me with an ideal space that I could control completely.<br><br>Coming to my sense, I chose the farm down the road. To not do that would be to engage in the sort of luxury that I can hardly afford and would be antithetical to my stated year's goals. By choosing the farm down the road, I'll have much more spare money, more spare time, and likely will grow more of my own food. I'll be able to pay off my credit card debt quicker. I'll be able to function more outside of the standard economy. I'm pretty sure I'll in all ways be better off. All it took was accepting that I may have to deal with a few more annoyances with where I live, but that seems a small price to pay for the enrichment I'll otherwise gain.<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c772659522153472721 title="comment permalink">1/18/12, 8:41 PM</a><br><br>

I'm 26 and living in a Buddhist monastery in Taiwan. I decided in my teenage years I would live a stoic lifestyle while cultivating myself in religious practice and scholarship. Despite being poor, I've actually been able to get by quite well (at least by my own standards). I studied languages, history and linguistics instead of commercially valuable fields like engineering or business, much to the mockery of some of my peers who would ask, "Well, what is that gonna get you?"<br><br>Contrary to expectations, my skills are actually valued by certain organizations who are happy to provide me with free food and accommodation (both here in Taiwan as well as in India and Japan) while I work for them. I basically get paid to translate Chinese and Japanese texts into English, which requires a very special skill set, but few people on the planet are qualified. I'm still poor by western standards, but I get by and wander the world as a pilgrim, scholar and translator. All my stuff fits into two backpacks which easily fit under a bunk on a train.<br><br>If I bought into the typical consumer lifestyle back home, I'd have a mortgage and car, and would have to work endless hours at a job where being laid off is always possible.<br><br>I'm actually contemplating taking vows and becoming a monk, which would mean an end to wandering, but such a monastic and stoic lifestyle would be incredibly rewarding while also being perhaps best given what the coming decades hold. Being happily destitute is actually a virtue in Buddhism. Monasteries are also resilient and in Taiwan their ability to salvage so much of what goes into the trash is amazing. We just spent hours cleaning up old plastic jars for reuse.<br><br>Believe it or not, your blog has actually fostered such inclinations in me since I started reading last year. Given that a career in mainstream academia is becoming impossible, perhaps being a Chan scholar-monk, adept at salvage and wet rice agriculture and teaching it to others, would be the best route to take. I gotta thank you for all your insightful posts.

And my problems have everything to do with the theme of your column. I just spent a week trying to help my mom and my family deal with splitting up and selling my late grandmother's estate.<br>We all know this is the type of event that often rends families asunder, and just for one reason: material avarice. The symbols of somebody else's past affluence somehow retain a mental hold on many people long after the actual items themselves have decayed and broken-down and the real wealth and happiness have fled.<br>Pardon the comment hijack, but... I would really like to hear your views, JMG, and any ideas from you and your readers, about what elder care is going to be like in the post-peak world... how it might be a sustainable part of public life, and what we relatively young spring chickens can do to prepare for it. Considering that survival itself will involve a lot more physical labor in the future than it does now, and everyone's capacity for labor diminishes quickly with old age. Because of course I see myself getting older, and I hope to face my own dotage with a bit more dignity and grace than my mom seems to be doing. <br>Obviously I'm not writing from an unbiased viewpoint, but it seems clear to me that everyone involved values my grandma's possessions far more than they value maintaining good relations with their own relatives -- betrayals and recriminations are flying around right and left. And my grandma was by no means rich in the monetary sense. Most of her estate is neither expensive nor practical nor useful; most of this stuff is just clearly junk, old or new.<br>Worst of all is my mom, who has absolutely declared that she wants to squirrel away every single cheap plastic necklace grandma collected over 99 years, every broken doll head and every cheap tin pot that nobody else even wants. (Of course, Mom has a bad back and bad joints, so she demands that her family do ALL the actual hard labor of moving, packing and storing this junk.) She tells me I can have grandma's generic white plastic patio chairs for myself, ($10 at any of a million Wal-Marts across the country), and then when I decide they're not worth the space and effort of packing and storing them, Mom goes running to the Salvation Army giveaway pile and claims them back. The house buyer is showing up to close escrow in three hours, the house is a total disaster in no condition to turn over to the buyer, and my mom is still picking through my grandma's costume plastic jewelry pile one item at a time, asking me "Tom do you remember what this little plastic lid is for? I think it's important." When you say that people have a death grip on their middle-class lifestyle, you are <b><i>NOT</i></b> exaggerating in the slightest. It is totally a form of hypnosis!<br>I am absolutely certain I'm not the only one with a story like this. It strikes me that there's a certain segment of the American elder population -- maybe not a majority, but a large plurality nonetheless -- who are besotted with a huge sense of entitlement to crappy plastic consumer goods, and who expect their descendants to work like dogs to keep their ersatz affluent lifestyle viable in a crumbling and overcomplex world. <br>I would love to hear JMG, and all the regular commenters, discuss how we can care for our own relatives like that, without (a) coming to despise them, (b) falling into their own trap of materialism ourselves, and/or (c) mortgaging our own long-term survival in order to prop up theirs... short of disowning them completely. What can we do to get back to the days when our elders offered us wise advice from their own deep life experiences, rather than just demanding to have material and consumer goods? And how can we avoid becoming like them ourselves when we get older? Obviously not all our elders are like this, but I hear the same story from other people over and over again.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c2100845602543443035 title="comment permalink">1/18/12, 11:42 PM</a><br><br>

When I was recently down in Spain I got to see the effects first hand of the falling tide. <br><br>Most of my friends there, it is probably fair to say, are formerly middle class. Over the last four years or so they have gone from having plenty to having very little and now cannot even be described as working class as none of them have jobs.<br><br>First the cars went. Not all at once but by a gradual process of, as one person put it ‘descending into illegality’. When people could no longer afford the spiralling costs of tax, insurance and the yearly maintenance check, at first they took risks. The local police, always keen to raise money, handed out fines by the bucket load until people were brow beaten into giving up their perfectly functional vehicles – most of which now sit unused and dusty on drives – or are shared between groups who all chip in to keep one of them on the road.<br><br>With the cars went long distance trips to supermarkets. One woman has a weekly food budget of 20 euros which she takes to the weekly market and is able to come away with more vegetables, eggs and bread than she can carry. Supermarkets, all of a sudden, seem very expensive by comparison. <br><br>Next went the mobile phones. First the fixed contracts went and everyone went ‘pay as you go’. In short order people inevitably ended up with no credit and would never call you back when you left a message. Gradually people seem not to be bothering with them. For the price of sending a few texts you could alternatively buy a stick of fresh bread.<br><br>Plenty of other luxuries have gone down the tubes as well, of course. Foreign holidays are out, and so is talk about buying houses. Instead people are talking about banding together to buy some land and pitch yurts on it. “At least it’ll be a home,” one of them said. <br><br>My friends, generally speaking, are a rag tag bunch who to some extent chose to drop out anyway, so they are meeting the deprivations in good spirits (well, most of them) and are starting up various non-cash alternatives. Nevertheless, I think it has come as a shock to most of them the revelation of the extent to which they relied on the housing bubble (many of them are foreign builders, but even the alternative healers suddenly have no clients). <br><br>It was a useful glimpse of how things will be for many more of us in the not-too-distant future. I'm planning to write a more in depth blog post on this shortly.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c8322841871852151279 title="comment permalink">1/19/12, 12:22 AM</a><br><br>

I'm in my mid twenties and am working on entrenching myself in the permaculture community in Colorado and elsewhere after returning from a couple years in Japan. With some of your recommendations ringing in my ears, I recently moved into a shared house in Denver with the intention of cutting my overhead via bikes/public transit, gardening, and dumpster diving (this last one is no small mental hurdle for a child of the upper middle class).<br><br>However, my recently much more wealthy grandmother decided that I should have a car, and sent me a check to buy one. As I have several times in the last year, I felt torn between personal plans and ideals and a desire not to distance or unnecessarily offend those closest to me. Perhaps it was weak of me, but I did accept the money and bought a little used diesel car that I plan to convert to run on waste vegetable oil. This is absolutely a compromise, though, and I can feel the immediate loss of a certain kind of freedom. I'm not sure yet if it was worth it to make my grandmother happy, but I'd also rather not be an alienating, increasingly unapproachable grandson/son/friend/etc. I hope that's a worthwhile tack to take in the longer term, middling as it feels.<br><br>All that said, I've experienced synchronicity or grace or support from the universe or perhaps self-fulfilling perceptions of luck quite a bit recently, and it gives me confidence that my overall direction is truer than it has been in the past. Your essays regularly help keep me on track and inspired (and laughing).<br><br>Several months ago I wrote a poem called "Less" to reference your imperative of L.E.S.S. It's no great work, but if you're interested in reading it please email me at creighton (dot) s (dot) hofeditz (at) gmail. The layout and spacing is important so I can't really reproduce it here.

I am not repeating back what your words to be snotty though, its a moment of recognition and respect about what's going on here with the care that you are taking to introduce ideas that may seem like they are from Mars to an audience likely to be reading a blog. <br><br>In that light, I don't know anything about magic except what you have written, but whatever dispelling you are trying to do is working. I started walking away last spring, quit my corporate job in SF, returned to my family's homestead in NY and have am using my savings to set myself up for a life of voluntary poverty. Fortunately, I have been an extreme minimalist and had no debt to begin with, nor a car or mortgage. I know several people here who are doing, have done and are trying to do the same in whatever circumstances they are in. <br><br>I am not saying its all thanks to you, but you are definitely helping people like me return to their senses. It wasn't that long ago I felt trapped by the system, seeing only the binary alternative of homelessness and misery to careerism. <br><br>I have several ways to go forward right now and its hard to choose which one to follow. One you may find interesting to hear about, in so far that I likely owe a good deal of thanks to you for conceiving and is what I imagine in line with your hope for the ADR, is the following.<br><br>My brother has been a working blacksmith for almost two decades. He lives in a tiny town in upstate NY with a small population. He has two houses (which almost makes him a majority owner of the town’s real estate) and wants to turn one into a dorm to take on 2 or 3 apprentices for 2 or 3 years at a shot. He also has a business associate who cuts lumber and is doing the same thing. They both have living accommodations and their way of doing things. I am set to study under my brother as a beginning apprentice would for 6 months, and then shoot a 5-10 Youtube minute video explaining the setup, what he is looking for in understudies, what he can accommodate in his spare house for apprentices/family, what he has to offer, and I could explain the conditions and what its like to work with him through the program. <br><br>If I happen to know 2 craftsmen who have this need, then there must be hundreds of them all over the country, each with all manner of personal and local conditions. They are having a hard time finding people because they are working tradesmen, they don't have a lot of money and the unemployed coming to them want salary and benefits even though they don't really know how to do anything and will jump ship at the first 'real' job that becomes available. The working tradesmen are not generally savvy with the internet, and very unlikely to understand how to optimize search engine hits. The idea I have is to go try out their programs, work and study under them as a beginning apprentice would for a period of 6-12 months - long enough to get some of the basics down, and stay in whatever accommodations they have to offer, whether its a spare room, spare house, log cabin, tent or whatever (as long as I can bring the wife), and at the end help create an informed video of the setup that is one part their explanation and one part my review. My hope is that I can do more than the first one, what a great way to learn a bunch of stuff and see a bunch of places. <br><br>P.S.I won't be offended if you keep this off list since its not really on topic.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c3601736746573598314 title="comment permalink">1/19/12, 4:57 AM</a><br><br>

I suppose we started walking into poverty a couple of years ago, but we walked slowly at first and didn't raise a lot of dust. We're walking faster now, and its more noticeable. Somehow it seems recently like we're passing a point of no return. I still have a foot in my old life, and do various consulting projects to bring in income. But that's fading - after a time it gets very hard to have your head in both places (in my case building new IT stuff that I'm pretty sure won't be worthwhile or maintainable). I'd rather work part-time in the local book store at this point.<br><br>We know where we're going, and many synchronicities are occurring as we go. We don't have doubts. But it is a lonely path at first, at least in our town. I'm hopeful of seeing more people along the way.

Our now-infamous plutocratic governor in Wisconsin Scott Walker decided to massively cut funding to Milwaukee County's ailing public-transit system. (In fairness, part of the blame for this problem falls squarely on the county for mismanaging the system for many years now.) Had the county not been able to secure some available funds from the Federal government at the last minute, the transit system would have been gutted. The Scott Walker supporters here in Milwaukee who need right-wing talk-radio to tell them what to think no doubt would have cheered wildly. But an awful lot of people (myself included, though I would have had options in the form of help from friends had the worst happened) in the county rely on the bus to get around the area. I am nearly certain that these ill-informed pseudoconservatives have no idea what an economic catastrophe this would have proved for Milwaukee County as people lost jobs to which they wouldn't be able to show up anymore and would likely have been forced to flee the area permanently. I suspect that in their minds, the only people who take the bus are dark-skinned individuals who to their reactionary way of thinking deserve every bad break they get.

The first thing that came to mind while reading your comment was that it sounds like your mother (and probably your grandmother) is a hoarder. This has actually become a legitimate psychological disorder. I find it a very interesting one at that. It appears to be very much an American disease and a very fitting one at that. My wife has these tendencies from her mother who got it from her mother. It seems to have an origin starting around the great depression. The need to keep anything and everything because you may need it latter to fill a need that you won't have the money for. The main idea is an intelligent one of thrift and I get that. Why waste things that don't need to be wasted? However there is a fine line between keeping things that you may find a use for later and hoarding.<br><br>Hoarding, as a psychological disease, is more concerned with keeping things because of there sentimental value. They remind the hoarder of a specific memory, and they fear that losing the object will strip that memory from them. I think the important thing to glean from this is that it is a psychological disorder. I think it's the obvious end result from years of being considered consumers and all that that entails. This is simply a pathology that the insane and sick American way of life has created. <br><br>As far as taking care of elders, and their function as a wellspring of wisdom. It seems to me that as things contract and people start moving back in with family, the taking care of elders part will just sort of happen. After all, before the geezer freezers that are called "nursing homes" came into existence it was family that took care of family. This is what my wife and I are doing, moving in with an elder aunt of hers who has nobody to care for her and no company since her husband recently died. Her home is paid for and we don't want a mortgage. It's a win win symbiotic relationship. It's not without psychological damage to the aunt created by the American way. She is heavily medicated on prescription franken chemicals to deal with her crappy and lonely life. It seems this is part of the work we will be dealing with.<br><br>As far as getting that wisdom from the elderly. It seems that we have simply lost much of this due to the perverted American life style. It has left much of our elderly devoid of wisdom in many respects. How much wisdom can you glean from a life filled with meaningless consumerism? Not that they don't have wisdom to provide, but simply being elderly does not equate to having wisdom.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c8322640310557914275 title="comment permalink">1/19/12, 7:41 AM</a><br><br>

Diesel electric drive for trains is a relatively simple system of a diesel engine running a generator which powers an electric motor which drives the wheels. It offers certain advantages in simplifying the drive mechanism and allowing multiple engines to coordinate, but probably gives no fuel savings.<br> The new Hybrid cars (Prius) on the other hand are complex systems in which the electric motor (generator) and the gas motor work symbiotically to drive the wheels. During coasting and braking, the gas motor shuts off completely and the wheels drive the electric motor, now working as a generator, to charge the battery. When high torque is demanded, the electric motor kicks in and boosts the output of the relatively small gas motor. While they can be faulted for their extreme complexity, some of the hybrid cars (Prius) do work well and do save gas. The large hybrids are a bit of a travesty.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c6801111374993304835 title="comment permalink">1/19/12, 7:44 AM</a><br><br>

You're bound to get some outrage from the 99% who just happen to live lives of greater luxury than kings of old. <br><br>We didn't always have a middle class in the US, and Zinn's work points that out well. Up until the oil age got kicking really well and the US established a global empire after WW2, we were more of a two class society with constant conflict between the classes. But having a large percentage of the society heavily invested in it's preservation and serving as a bulwark between the very rich and the have-nots was a far more stable and cost effective way of maintaining order. The middle class will fight tooth and nail to preserve what they have, against the poor in their own societies and against the outsiders with patriotic fervor. <br><br>Of course you have to have the goods to keep them paid off, to maintain their investment in the system, and the net return of our empire is no longer sufficient to do that – and not just from an energy perspective, but also from the normal cycles of such things. So while an invested middle class may be the preferred method maintaining control, there are others. When you cannot bribe or fool people into behaving and supporting the state, and the accumulation of wealth by those at the top, then force and fear are the natural tools. <br><br>The accumulation of people in prisons, likely to soon include debtor's prisons, is one example of that. What people perceive as random violations of their “rights” is another. This is merely the existing system asserting it's power, while it still can, and the effects move through the society in many ways. It is likely what RianbowShadow is seeing pieces of.<br><br>There simply aren't enough spoils returning from our empire to maintain that middle class buffer anymore. Born in 1963, I'm very fortunate to have lived my life thus far in a time when there were, and before the costs of it all became so apparent. But there cannot be any doubt that it will change, and those who still believe they have power by virtue of their “rights” and that they produce something of value through their jobs commensurate to what they've been provided are in for a very rude awakening into a world where nothing is recognizable.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c4706821826239520251 title="comment permalink">1/19/12, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

We know that it's not something to be depended on, but I don't know how he'd work in the meanwhile without something to cart all his tools around in.

We're still imagining careers that "make a difference" from a greener-liberal standpoint and considering what graduate degrees might get us there. We still dream of buying a house and having a nice little urban-homestead, despite knowing that there's no way we can afford that unless I keep my job and she gets a degree and somehow earns enough for us to be able to afford it together...<br><br>We're both stuck in this odd middle-ground where we know in our hearts that all of this consumer-culture/mainstream-ness is an illusion, but can't figure out how/when/where to create a different story for ourselves...beyond the small changes we've already done: trimming the budget, cooking from scratch, staying healthy, less car-dependent, saving instead of spending, etc.<br><br>Voluntary Poverty.

The settlers warmed their home with a small fire place, over which the women would cook all of the food and do the washing . The roofs, assembled so shoddily (partly because I think settlers assumed life would get better in the future, allowing a better living arrangement) that they would wake up in the mornings after winter snow storms with two inches of snow on their beds and floor. Talk about poverty! <br><br>Amidst all that hardship, there were stories of culture, parties, and camaraderie. They lived quite literally by the vagaries of nature, crop yields, and amongst an uncharted wilderness. But they didn't let that damper their spirits. Of course, that was just life, not a fear ridden fantasy in their heads. And all of that is to mention nothing of the prior achievements of the Indian population.<br><br>From my experience, the largest obstacles are mental obstacles. I think Orlov's observation of American culture being substantially less adaptable to the future than Soviet Russia's ala late 1980's is spot on. From what I observe, the American Dream will not go out without a fruitless, in not dangerous, fight.

Before the bubble collapsed, Japanese companies offered jobs for life. Salarymen who knew exactly where their next paycheck was coming from were more confident buying a Tiffany necklace or an expensive French dinner for their girlfriend. Now, nearly 40 percent of Japanese work in nonstaff positions with much less job security.<br><br>"When the economy was good, Japanese men had only one lifestyle choice: They joined a company after they graduated from college, got married, bought a car, and regularly replaced it with a new one," says Fukasawa. "Men today simply can't live that stereotypical 'happy' life."<br><br>Yoto Hosho, a 22-year-old college dropout who considers himself and most of his friends herbivores, believes the term describes a diverse group of men who have no desire to live up to traditional social expectations in their relationships with women, their jobs, or anything else.

He said he moved from Athens to Chios in 2010 as an act of defiance against a global financial system he found unsustainable. He bought property with a well and grows his own vegetables. <br><br>“I came to the conclusion that I want to live this insignificant life of mine as one human being among others,” Mr. Makridakis said on a sunny afternoon, looking down from his balcony on the rooftops of his village, Volissos, and the blue sea below. “According to the old ways, where people work to secure their basic needs.” <br><br>Others find the trend discouraging. In the walled medieval village of Mesta, Georgia Poumpoura, 73, stood under a grape arbor outside her small stone house and chatted with friends. She said she divides her time between Athens, where she raised her family, and Mesta, where she grew up in poverty and where her monthly pension, which has been cut by the government’s austerity plan, stretches further. <br><br>“I have three sons,” she said. “One is a civil engineer, one an electrical engineer, another a mechanical engineer. All three are unemployed. They’re having a hard time in Athens. Here we manage to make ends meet, but we spend less,” she said of herself and her husband, who is also retired. <br><br>But she said she would be disappointed if her sons returned to Chios. “I worked so hard to make my children and grandchildren go to college,” she said. “I don’t want them to come back.

I particularly liked <i>A consumer in a modern industrial society is free to choose any of a dizzying range of variations on a suffocatingly narrow range of basic options—and that’s equally true whether we are talking about products, politics, or lifestyles.</i><br>That’s so true that I’m constantly amazed that people don’t see it! When you point out 22 brands of cereal that is basically wheat, corn, oats, rice and much sugar, they grudgingly admit it, but don’t want their favorite brand removed. <br><br><br><i>The alternative is to let go of the perks and privileges before they drag you down. That may be the least popular advice I could offer, but it’s also among the most necessary. Over the years to come, as the real economy of goods and services contracts in lockstep with the depletion of fossil fuels, the fight over what’s left of the benefits of a failing industrial system is likely to become far more brutal than it is today. In the long run, that’s a fight with no winners. The alternative is to walk away, now, while you still have the time and resources to do it at your own pace.</i><br>And the other good reason to let go/walk away is that control over the circumstances of your life get more and more clear and simple when you detach from the wild complexities of our consumer society. One of these days, I’m gonna list all the dang accessories and updates needed to run some of our basic “tools”, especially the ones that have manual alternatives!<br><br><i>It means doing without things you want, during the difficult process of unlearning the mental automatisms that make you want them in the first place.</i><br>Excellent point! Once you learn not to want them, the “pain” goes away. But it is a learning curve and it does take time – or so I’ve found it.<br><br><br>And I wanted to share this – the ruinmen have arrived:<br><a rel=nofollow>http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/opinion/dismantling-detroit.html?_r=1&amp;hp</a><br>“One freezing evening we happened upon the young men in this film, who were illegally dismantling a former Cadillac repair shop. They worked recklessly to tear down the steel beams and copper fasteners. They were in a hurry to make it to the scrap yard before it closed at 10 p.m., sell their spoils and head to the bar. <br>Surprisingly, these guys, who all lacked high school diplomas, seemed to have a better understanding of their place in the global food chain than many educated American 20-somethings. The young men regularly checked the fluctuating price of metals before they determined their next scrap hunt, and they had a clear view of where these resources were going and why. They were the cleanup crew in a shaky empire. Somebody’s got to do it. <br>One of the men, who had come up from Kentucky to scrap after losing a job in a coal mine, stands out in our minds. Taking a short break from the action, he looked up and said with disgust, “All that’s left here are the remnants of what was.” <br>The next day we went back to check on the progress of their project. The entire building was gone.”<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c7314718608509560296 title="comment permalink">1/19/12, 11:31 AM</a><br><br>

I empathize with your difficulty; family’s one of the hardest groups to deal with, because you don’t want to disown them, as you say. I wonder if your Mom’s behavior is part of her denial of/ fear of death – it’s scary to become the elder generation (I’m on the edge of that; I’m it once my Mom, 81, dies). I confess that I moved far away from my family (who sounds similar in this area to yours) because I couldn’t find any other sane way of living near them. I have already decided that I will put no claim on anything my siblings want, and won’t fight if there are any inequalities in the will. Basically, I detached from the whole thing, while I’m still trying to be supportive and grateful to my sibs who live closer to Mom. We can’t tell anyone else how to live their lives; it’s possible our examples can be useful to them, though. That said, it will still be painful if at the end of Mom’s life, she puts demands on me that I need to resist. And how do we not get like them? Start now! I’m already working hard to be aware of death and aging, and be conscious in my acceptance of declining skills and declining “relevance” in the world. Not that I don’t do good things – I’m just stepping far away from the culture’s pretence of “never aging”, which puts people in terrible traps.<br><br><br>@Creighton: <i>As I have several times in the last year, I felt torn between personal plans and ideals and a desire not to distance or unnecessarily offend those closest to me.</i> <br>I also struggle with that, and like everything else in this adjustment, there are no hard and fast rules. Since I don’t live near family, and they seem not to “get” the simple, rural life I’m living, I cheerfully thank them for their gifts and give more than half of them to a thrift store where I get great used clothes and items that fit my lifestyle. I try to appreciate their loving attempts to “help” me without feeling the need to pretzel my life to fit them.<br><br>BTW- the word verification thingie is really glitchy today!<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c6517774692117038890 title="comment permalink">1/19/12, 12:13 PM</a><br><br>

Likewise, the peak event in a vacation is what is remembered. So 110 minutes of a boring movie followed by a fantastic 10 minute ending gets an A Plus rating.<br><br>Most people discount the daily pleasures of things like a walk in the rain or the crisp feel of Autumn on the cheek. What Hollywood and Pepsico and Kentucky Fried Chicken all know is how to give expensive, mundane experiences some sense of 'Peak-End' effect which causes us to remember them and keep coming back for more.<br><br>It is also true that a 60 second peak moment can outweigh an hour of pleasant experiences. For example, we may choose to drive an hour each way on crowded highways to the big waterfall, while we could walk down to the neighborhood creek and spend two pleasant, timeless hours listening to the birds and the water and perhaps napping in the sun.<br><br>Which leads me to the speculation that those who have learned to value the present moment, as is taught in Mindfulness, can be quite happy and content with very little, while those who are trapped by their 'Peak-End' proclivities are forever going to need more resources of all kinds chasing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.<br><br>And which leads me to think that the discussion about whether the Middle Class is screwing the Lower Class or, alternatively, both are getting screwed by the One Percent is only accurate in the context of 'Peak-End'. If one expands the context to include the voluntary poverty of those in monasteries or Thoreau at Walden, then the class warfare fades as a valid explanation.<br><br>Perhaps more people should walk their dogs--who seem to me to be totally in the moment.<br><br>Don Stewart<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c4327703095435830948 title="comment permalink">1/19/12, 12:13 PM</a><br><br>

The subject of voluntary simplicity – which, for me, means mental/philosophical simplicity as much as material simplicity – has always fascinated me. Then again, I'm not American, so I cannot really relate to the consumerism and addiction to superficial comfort that has been so rampant in the USA during the last few decades. I grew up in central Europe and still live there, and even though many people here have cars and iPhones and whatnot, the general attitude seems more down-to-earth. Hardship and famine are still present in our collective memory (think post-war years), even though most people living today have not experienced them first-hand.<br><br>Personally, my wife and I are trying to pursue a kind of "middle path" between excess consumerism and voluntary poverty (like moving to a farm without electricity, as an acquaintance of my wife has done). For us, this means owning no car (which is not uncommon however – four out of ten households in our city do not have one, even though probably three out of these four could easily afford one). It also means no TV, living in an apartment instead of a family home (shorter distances, better walkability), spending our yearly vacation somewhere we can get to by train etc. This has worked very well for us; it allows us to both work part-time, thus having more spare time to spend doing useful things, like cooking or playing with our one-year-old son.<br><br>I suspect, however, that living this way much easier in some parts of Europe than in the USA (we live in Vienna).<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c6429378310018157847 title="comment permalink">1/19/12, 12:45 PM</a><br><br>

At the same time, there will be a shrinking workforce of younger people producing anything to support the elderly, and with little prospects of ever having the kind of wealth they see in those well-off pensioners. We are at the beginning of this age now, as the baby boomers retire.<br><br>Eventually, two things are likely to happen, though I'm not sure which will come first.<br><br>Firstly, young people with no prospects will become increasingly angry at the older people with all the money, perceiving this as a gerontocracy (the money will also buy political power). This may manifest itself in the form of violence, abuse, voting patterns, etc.<br><br>Secondly, the pension funds that people entering their 60s depend on to make them comfortable and a little wealthy will start vanishing, in various economic crashes, either to hyperinflation or to toxic investment. <br><br>Together, this makes growing old a fairly scary prospect. <br><br>But here we can bring the discussion back to the theme of today's post. If you are young now, consider walking away from the idea of a pension fund, and think about how you might instead incorporate yourself into the household economy of some younger people as you grow old. <br><br>If you really want to put money away, it's better to invest in physical goods with value in your daily life. One idea might be to buy a house (assuming you can maintain a means to pay it off). Later in life, you can get some younger people to live with you in exchange for taking care of you.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c6870148597834428044 title="comment permalink">1/19/12, 12:48 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, I did. You stated that with the following:<br><br>"The point that needs making is that a great many people in between those two extremes also benefit handsomely from the system. When those people criticize the system, their criticisms by and large focus on the barriers that keep them from having as large a share as the rich—not the ones that keep them from having as small a share as the poor, or to phrase things a little differently, that keep their privileged share from being distributed more fairly across the population as a whole."<br><br>I agree there is victimization rhetoric out there and some folks in the middle class are clueless about a number of things--including their own privilege, but I don't agree that we can blanket all those who feel victimized by our current mode of production as one trying to achieve the same riches as the top 1% or any other percent positioned above working class America. This seems a bit reductionist to me as I am aware there are many ways with which a learned helplessness of victimization may be interpreted. There is the internal and external meaning making at play here and it is quite diverse depending on a number of factors. I think most are tired of being ostracized, alienated and disenfranchised, to say the least, from the political process and feel the majority of Americans when acting in solidarity may achieve economic justice in the end.<br><br>I also disagree that the Occupy movement can be lumped into a single protest message such as upward social and/or economic mobility. Many people in the Occupy movement are using the latest scams and boondoggles by Wall Street and our corporate-dominated political system as a means to catalyze (maybe foolishly, but nonetheless) the creation of a new world in the shell of the old. Or, as the Zapatistas have famously quoted as their intent to "create a world in which all worlds may exist." I think for the most part the Occupy movement is a springboard for creating open and free spaces to counteract laissez faire, crony capitalism. <br><br>I agree with the class struggle analysis and abandoning wage slavery, but I do not agree that a socialist or capitalist mode of production--both being wholly dependent on infinite economic growth and the fantasy of progress-relying entirely on wishy washy technological advances to thwart or manipulate the circumstances that surround our current and future biophysical realities.<br><br>If there are any self-identified groups in America that are willing to give you and I a podium for speaking our views on peak oil, limits to growth, etc., it is the Occupy movement. We just need to reach out to them as we provide constructive criticism of their tactics or demands.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c3998901841907800809 title="comment permalink">1/19/12, 4:52 PM</a><br><br>

I planted a full garden last year and got only weeds; which is odd because I didn't plant any weeds? I have never been a farmer, my parents weren't farmers, my grandparents moved off the farms for the 'good' city jobs and never looked back. I've looked at the cost of buying farm land, the cheapest farm land is far from services and is still in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars of initial cost up front- way beyond my meager means for any foreseeable time in the future.

No, it's not an easy number to find; you basically have to take the C&amp;C number, check the specific definition being used, and then start subtracting based on reports of the amount of other things being counted in. The result is a very rough figure -- but it's clear that the unconventional fuels are making up a growing share while total production is nearly flat. <br><br>Meg, I think it's definitely different data.

The main reason for the setup is that it is the best way (mechanically least complicated) to transmit the power from the diesel engine to the driving wheels. Other setups have been tried (Southern Pacific bought some German made hydraulically coupled engines) but nothing works as well as diesel electric. The move from steam engines to diesel electric in the late 40s early 50s was driven primarily by the huge labor cost savings in all facets of operations, from providing fuel to maintenance, of the diesels over steam engines.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c3935942534046646358 title="comment permalink">1/19/12, 10:08 PM</a><br><br>

There will be a lot of rude awakenings in the years to come. <br><br>Sunbeam, excellent! Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. The mass production of imaginary wealth to prop up the otherwise collapsing financial support for the upper classes is the nonreported story of the last thirty years. They're basically padding their balance sheets with funny money to keep from facing the reality that the economic system that used to support them is bankrupt. <br><br>Ric, I make a point of walking mostly in the poor part of town -- that's where I live, anyway. A lot of people there walk, and drivers are relatively polite. It's in the relatively affluent parts of town that drivers become belligerent at the sight of a pedestrian. <br><br>Glenn, I criticize PV when it's presented, as it so often is, as a way to keep the age of abundance going -- because it can't. PV, as I've said repeatedly here, is a valuable transitional tool; when we get far enough down the curve of decline, they won't be manufactured any more, but in the meantime -- to produce small amounts of electricity for practical purposes -- they're great.<br><br>Richard, definitely think about it, mull it over, take some baby steps, go through the changes. In the Druid order I head, we advise new members to try making three changes in their lifestyle to cut down on the burden they place on the biosphere -- they get to pick the three changes, and stick with them for a year. After that, it's easier to see where to proceed. <br><br>Brad, in some posts I stress turning toward, in others I stress turning away. Both halves have to be grasped, grappled with, and then integrated; today's cult of self-indulgence is well enough ingrained in most Americans that renunciation has to be presented repeatedly to them before they get it. <br><br>Jess, if Matt needs a truck to do his work for the time being, he needs a truck. You make your choices depending on where you are and what you want to do. <br><br>Gruff, you're still falling into the dualist trap of believing that it's only the 1% that believe in the power of money. Most of the American middle class believes it, too, and will furiously reject any attempt you make to disabuse them, because they realize that their privileges depend on the money delusion just as much as Romney's do. <br><br>Margfh, that's becoming a reality for a lot of people. Do you have any younger relatives in good health who need a place to live? Bringing some of them into the household might help. <br><br>Lewis, nicely handled, and those goats ought to do a fine job on the blackberries. The only thing I've never seen them touch is nettle. <br><br>Ando, I'm actually certified to teach, though I don't; I practice by myself at the moment. There's a kung fu school in town that has t'ai chi clases, but those conflict with my Masonic meetings so I haven't checked them out. <br><br>DW, I think a lot of people are going through what you and your wife are going through right now. One bit of advice -- stay out of college! There's a huge bubble in student loans that's being inflated right now to give the banks a bunch of allegedly safe loan-backed securities, and college tuitions have been inflated to an appalling degree because of that. If you let yourself get sucked into that you will probably never get out of debt.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c3739073060043401388 title="comment permalink">1/19/12, 10:12 PM</a><br><br>

When I think back to some of the disasters I have had with chooks, vegies and fruit it makes me shudder. If I was relying solely on those systems for food then I'd probably be dead. Thankfully, for me at least there are other options whilst I learn and practice.<br><br>Alternative energy is identical too to the food problem. It's great as long as you don't expect your current lifestyle. Winter is a real drama for solar and I'm working towards 100% solar this winter (9 months of the year, I'm 100% self-sufficient on energy).<br><br>I'm not sure anyone has mentioned a benefit with poverty since I haven't read all of the comments yet, but poverty also provides a measure of independence.<br><br>PS: I'm so glad you mentioned vehicles as I've been watching the development of these for some time now. Australia has 60 brands on the market (the US has only 30 brands) and we still manufacture them here too. Vehicles are very indicative of our culture. I use them as a litmus test.<br><br>Electric vehicles are a great idea, but they make me laugh. A battery pack for an electric vehicle has a capacity of about 24kWh and costs about $1,000 per kWh. The reason I laugh is because I read an article recently which quoted economists (!) as claiming that the cost per kWh will come down to $200 within the decade. Wishing does not make something happen!<br><br>By the way, that 24kWh will probably only take you 160km (100m) at best case scenario - and remember not to use the heater and/or air conditioner too!<br><br>Also, I'm pretty certain that our electricity grid here could not produce that extra output 365 days per year. It would fail.<br><br>Oh yeah, it will probably take somewhere between 3 and 8 hours to recharge that battery too. Most people are incapable of planning, I will say no more...<br><br>An excellent electric vehicle is a push bike with the assistance of an electric motor. It doesn't get more efficient than that type of vehicle.<br><br>What people want and what they'll get in the future are two very different things.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c4839140781593072059 title="comment permalink">1/20/12, 3:01 AM</a><br><br>

It led me to look for data on the conventional oil peak. I found a couple of possible references. One is <a href=http://www.trendlines.ca/free/peakoil/Scenarios/scenarios.htm#rco rel=nofollow>at Freddy Hutter's site,</a>, which shows Regular Conventional Oil peaked in 2005 at 68 mbpd, with current production around 63 mbpd. <a href=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2010/11/101109-peak-oil-iea-world-energy-outlook/ rel=nofollow>A 2011 National Geographic article</a> mentions the IEA statement of peak in 2006, with a plateau of between 68 mbpd and 69 mbpd. The latter reference is not clear as to what is included but does talk about "conventional oil". However, this is quite a bit more than estimated at Freddy Hutter's site, so it's still a bit confusing though it does seem reasonably clear that there has been a kind of plateau of the high EROEI stuff for 6-7 years. This should be hot news but I've never seen it mention in the main stream media.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c7905183071194838726 title="comment permalink">1/20/12, 3:15 AM</a><br><br>

There are interesting tie-ins to the subject under discussion. Kahneman demonstrates that we think with two different systems: System 1 is our intutitive system which operates virtually instantaneously and without effort and is mostly what we rely on; System 2 is reserved for hard problems and requires effort. Humans don't like to exert effort, so the work of System 2 is frequently sub-optimal.<br><br>After previously demonstrating that practice makes System 2 tasks much easier (such as a Chess grandmaster analyzing the board vs. someone who has just been handed a rule book), on Page 42 he talks about the depletion of our capacity by hard tasks such as thinking in unusual ways or reconciling conflicting objectives. He states that doing something hard such as making choices which involve conflict or trying to impress someone depletes our store of energy and thus makes us more likely to do things which are not in our best interests such as eat a bad diet or splurge in our spending.<br><br>The lesson that I would draw is that, if the future holds less material wealth than we are accustomed to in the present, then it makes sense to become a Grand Master of Voluntary Poverty. Then, as we survey the chess board of possible moves in life, we will deplete far less energy than the novice, newly arrived in the state of material want, and will be far better equipped to choose wisely.<br><br>Don Stewart<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c892503429900438656 title="comment permalink">1/20/12, 8:13 AM</a><br><br>

I don’t disagree with your assessment regarding PV and the ultimate long-term viability and its inability replace fossils while maintaining current usage levels. Clearly that won’t happen, so the imperative has to be use less energy overall, as you rightly say. I think it’s inevitable that people will be confronted by that fact, like it or not, so cutting consumption and conserving what remaining sources we have ought to be the first consideration. After that, whatever can be generated on site in as clean a manner as possible strikes me as useful. In my case, half of my need is produced on my roof. The remaining half is drawn from the grid. My grid mix supply is one third renewable (30% hydro, 2% wind and 2% bio-mass) and two thirds fossil or fossil dependent (23% nuke, 30% nat gas, 6% oil and 7 % coal). So theoretically, if the nuke/fossil component of the grid disappeared tomorrow, I’d need to reduce my usage by a third to have 100% non-polluting/sustainable electricity supply. Given a 25 year lifespan for the PV system, it seems an appropriate approach to easing the transition.<br><br>I could cut that one third use tomorrow if I eliminate the freezers/refrigeration aspect of our food preservation strategy and went 100% root cellar/smoked/canned, but at present the system works well (about 50/50), the alternatives are functioning in place and could be expanded. I’m content to follow a stair-step process to whatever equilibrium state we’re approaching, rather than jump straight down all at once.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c5027214330605203628 title="comment permalink">1/20/12, 9:17 AM</a><br><br>

Thanks very much, Kieran, the Archdruid’s article from 2009 is actually very helpful in terms of organizing the problem into Plan A and Plan B.<br><br>For brevity's sake (4096 characters per comment) I omitted a lot of information that would have helped you all understand my family (Gawd forbid you'd want to). Far as I know, Thijs and Deborah, my mom did not have that type of affectionate relationship with her mother (my grandma). These trinkets, I conjecture, don't really represent fond memories, but rather jealousy. "I've wanted that tacky china set for 40 years and Grandma wouldn't give it to me. Now that she's dead, I'm taking it!!" Maybe her sub-conscious mind is still striving to prove her love to her mother, Thijs, but that’s roughly the opposite of what her conscious mind is doing.<br><br>Grandma’s death was certainly not sudden or unexpected, though. She was 99 and had two different types of cancer. (Amazingly enough, she was more or less kinda taking care of herself up until a few weeks before the end -- she was so cantankerous that she’d never stand for anything else -- but we all knew for years that her time was fast approaching.) Part of my rage at my family is that we could have done this in a leisurely, organized manner if only we’d faced up to this years ago. <b><i>Plus</i></b> we’ve had almost two years <b><i>after</i></b> grandma’s death, we could at least have started throwing out / donating to charity the least valuable stuff. Instead, because nobody could agree on the disposition of anything, we put it all off until the last minute and we’re still sorting plastic Mardi Gras beads while the house buyer is standing there tapping his foot.<br><br>Absolutely no need to apologize, Luciddreams -- I seriously believe that you are actually closest to the truth. I don't think my mom is as bad as those people on the "Hoarding" reality shows, but there are definitely goat trails in her house. And you're so right about the fine line between thrift and hoarding. What caused the blow-up last week was because my mom was so obsessed with hoarding that she just literally couldn't understand we had a legal/contractual obligation to be out of the house -- by a deadline. Some of the stuff we had to throw away (/donate to the poor) might not have been utterly useless. But the Hoarding urge in my mom seems to have completely obliterated any concept of "triage". Plus of course it's <b><i>VERY DAMN EASY</i></b> to say "I want to save every single Tupperware lid" when <b><i>SHE ISN'T THE ONE</i></b> boxing up this stuff and lugging it around on her <b><i>OWN</i></b> back. <br><br>I really think there's something to Luciddreams' theory that many or most Americans have a low-level version of this psychiatric disorder, Hoarding, due to being raised in conditions of abundance (while hearing tales from their elders about the Depression). I'd love to hear JMG mention Hoarding in a column.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c509961043529882105 title="comment permalink">1/20/12, 10:49 AM</a><br><br>

Part of the concept of a "wise elder" is that he or she is offering advice to a younger, more capable person <b><i>who is currently providing leadership and taking action</i></b>. To be a wise elder, you have to give up the command authority <b><i>first</i></b>. By contrast, in my family -- I’m 45 and it’s time for me to be making some of these family decisions -- when I make a decision that has anything to do with one of my elder relatives or their property... they will fight me to the point where I'd have to physically assault them to prevent them from running and un-doing my decision (as was my mom with the white plastic chairs).<br><br>To put it in national terms for Americans, Donald Rumsfeld was running our American wars, arguably the single most powerful man in the world in terms of destructive force and weapons at his fingertips, right up until a handful of years ago. Now, I’m 45, I’m no longer young, and Donald Rumsfeld had already <i>been a Senator for 2 years <b>before</b></i> I was even born. He probably has fond memories of the War of 1812! He fought the Iraq war with strategies that would have <b><i>TOTALLY</i></b> routed the Nazis, sixty years ago. But that was the wrong war. <b><i>There</i></b> is an elder who should have stepped down earlier than he did.<br><br>Part of the reason I wrote what I did in this thread was because, just a couple of weeks ago, I listened to some podcast or other (was it Kunstler?) who prognosticated that the enlightened elderly several decades from now might band together into "green" retirement homes, using renewable energy and growing some of their own food, hiring medical and personal care, and marketing what home goods they could produce, (such as lace or preserves or vegetables??) Man, that sounded like a crock to me. The idea that any of the elders I know would band together and make unified decisions was laughable on its face; and the idea that they would be interested in helping, marketing or contributing to their community was twice as ridiculous. <br><br>(Once again, this is the batch of elders that I know personally -- I'm sure there are plenty of elders out there who would be overjoyed to do something along those lines.)<br><br>Was it also Kunstler who once used the metaphor that petroleum energy does the work of hundreds of slaves for each of us -- so even though the South lost the Civil War, Americans still have a kind-of a slaveholder mentality? That's part of what I'm saying about how today's elders won't give up the reins of authority. These people grew up in the heyday of Petroleum, when Oil and Science made it seem like anything you imagined was possible -- without much sweat on your own brow. So they are very accustomed to giving orders and disassociating those orders with the sweat and labor it takes to carry them out. (Again, this is my own elders, not a general rule.)<br><br>When I wonder how we can avoid becoming like our elders, that's the sort of thing I worry about in myself. How much has that culture of easy energy really tainted my thought-processes, my expectations, my weighing of values and the worth of things?<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c3878539733546918806 title="comment permalink">1/20/12, 10:57 AM</a><br><br>

I moved to a particular town, in New Zealand, for various reasons, none had to do with public transport, which is almost non-existent outside of the main cities and their suburbs. This town has a single bus, at 6.25 am to the nearest big city suburb, with a return time of 5.50 pm. With a bus change, it takes two hours to get to the city, 45 minutes by car. There is no rail service and to get to the nearest rail station requires a 20 minute car journey. Few small towns are any better unless they are on a reasonably main route. <br><br>So, the choice is really to live in the suburbs or to really start living locally. I've chosen the latter (as much as I can) but, of course, our town isn't really set up for local living. People just assume you can get into a car, which is something I try to avoid, walking or cycling to the few places I need to go, unless I need to pick up something bulky. When friends and family also assume that the car is the transport option of choice (which it mostly is), it makes it particularly difficult to live locally.<br><br>Most people assume that society, and its attendant economy, will eventually return to "normal". I get so frustrated with news stories (the ones that aren't about celebrities, great and small) which have this implicit assumption in them. Let's plan for a different future, I keep saying to myself. Unfortunately, most of the time it is just myself I'm talking to. We still have road building plans and even city rebuilding plans. The city council has 5, 10 and longer period development plans. It's as though the environmental limits and problems are not there, or are someone else's problems. This led me to thinking about how any action we take that requires some use of unsustainable resources or some use of environmentally destructive methods, somewhere along the chain, is an implicit approval of everything that goes on in the chain and its impact. In effect, our lifestyles are an approval of all the abuse and exploitation of people and the environment. This is kind of depressing because I'd like to avoid environmentally destructive or morally suspect practices but that's a hard thing to do, even when trying to live lightly. Mind you, living lightly is difficult when friends and family aren't on board.<br><br>Sorry, starting to rant a bit here, so I'll leave it for now. Good post, though, I hope I can get my family to read it.<br><br>Tony<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c2968893916849565302 title="comment permalink">1/20/12, 3:08 PM</a><br><br>

Obviously the policies of the Grand Old Party has been just as damaging to most people not in the top twenty to thirty percent as any the Democrats have had (although, as have been pointed out they usually the same). As Thomas Franks expressed it in “What’s the Matter with Kansas”, the Democratic Party perceives itself as slightly nicer than the other guys, so aren’t the working stiffs voting for them? Franks is to his credit noting the hypocrisy in that statement. And perhaps that is the answer. While the Republican certainly engages in enough cant and hypocrisy – the only administration in my adult life that actually appeared to shrink the size of government even slightly was lead by a Democratic President, they don’t generally present themselves as a group that wants to “help” the working class directly.

It reminds me of a blindness in the peak oil world that has frustrated me for years: it is blind to minorities. They do not exist. Take the contention that the working class votes Republican. That is true only if you look at white voters. I'd wager that racial and ethnic minorities comprise roughly half of the working class in America today. And very few of them vote Republican. I could care less what party they vote for, but the broader point is that there is a blindness to a whole swath of the nation.<br><br>I was happy to see at least JMG, Orlov, and others participate in a forum last year on peak oil and minority communities (was it in Georgia?). I hope something was learned and that peak oil writers will stop pretending that the nearly half the nation that is non-Hispanic white doesn't exist. This is especially relevant in discussions as to where to move. A minority person is unlikely to be welcomed with open arms in the sort of run-down small town or city it is often recommended one move to.

I modeled the ruinmen in <a href=http://starsreach.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>Star's Reach</a> on what I'd read already of people who make their living off salvage, so it's a matter of life imitating art imitating life. <br><br>Don, that's interesting. Certainly the thaumaturgists of corporate marketing and advertising are good at playing off the mental habits of the unreflective. <br><br>Shark, I don't talk much about religious organizations here because it's one of those hot button issues that make most Americans' brains turn off, and since I have a vested interest in the subject, as a religious leader in a small minority faith, it's seemed helpful to avoid the subject where possible. <br><br>Someone, a lot easier. It's got to be an advantage to have had radical political, economic, and social change, not to mention a great deal of extreme poverty, within living memory. <br><br>Kieran, the thing with the South is that most of the cities were extensively rebuilt right after the Second World War, when prosperity bloomed south of the Mason-Dixon line for the first time since the Civil War. Most other American cities did a lot of their building out earlier, before the auto became quite so much of a fixture.<br><br>Tom, your Rabbi Yeshua also seems to have done quite a respectable job of predicting the mess that hit Judea thirty-odd years after his death; I've long thought that Matthew 24 and its equivalents was best interpreted in that sense. <br><br>DC, the experience of other peak oil people with the Occupy movements last fall was not promising. Nobody wanted to hear that the age of abundance is over; the free-energy folks got a much better hearing. Thus I don't think you're right to say that Occupy is likely to give what I'm saying any kind of podium at all. <br><br>Sophie, of course protests continue on a small scale; they continued through the 1950s, too.

In a well-off suburb, you're basically asking to be pulled over by the police. In the poor part of town, nobody cares. <br><br>Cherokee, there's a huge amount of focus and fixation on vehicles just now. I prefer to rely on the mobility system that evolution gave me. I know that won't work for everyone, but I've found that a fairly large fraction of the people who insist they can't possibly walk could do it if they simply made a few changes. <br><br>Sofistek, yes, it should be front page news, but nobody wants to rock the boat. <br><br>EVdriver, that kind of information will vary from place to place and person to person. There's no way I can offer detailed advice for every case, not least because all I have to go on is my own experience and the reference sources I have to hand. Learning the things you need to know is part of being a green wizard -- and Henley's is one place to look. <br><br>Maria, exactly! It's precisely the small changes that matter -- that, and incorporating what you know into every decision you make, so that each shift takes you closer to where you want to be. <br><br>Zach, the best answer I know to Brand's profoundly arrogant slogan is "We are as human beings and might as well get modest at it." <br><br>Don, thanks for the reference! This is exactly what I was talking about in the posts on magic, when addressing the difference between the primate nervous system and the rickety structure of human consciousness built over the top of it. I'll check out Kahneman's book when I have the time. <br><br>Margfh, you might point out to your relatives that those who don't have any other skills will be the ones who are shoveling manure to fertilize those 40 acres, when it comes to that. <br><br>Glenn, that's certainly a valid option; as long as you recognize that PV won't maintain a middle class lifestyle, you're ahead of the game.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c2467508062310172769 title="comment permalink">1/20/12, 9:16 PM</a><br><br>

The more people who walk away now, and in the near future, the better -- as Cherokee pointed out earlier in the comment thread, there's a lot of learning to be done. <br><br>Thomas, I worked in the nursing home industry years ago, and the <br>"green retirement home" business made me choke. Retirement homes require exactly the sort of huge subsidies for doing nothing that our society won't be able to afford much longer. As I see it, those elderly people who have practical skills and can get along with younger people will get by -- when daycare stops being an option and the school system begins to grind to a halt, having Nana at home to take care of the grandkids and do some cooking and cleaning is going to be a major economic asset to mom and dad. That depends, though, on Nana's willingness to get along and to accept the implications of living under someone else's roof, and by their rules -- and a lot of today's and tomorrow's elderly have far too much of a sense of entitlement to do that. <br><br>Edde, as a transitional technology, good. Do you have plans to pass on the knowledge of how to build them from scrap metal for the days when there will be no more factories to make them? What of tires, lubricants, etc.? Time to get working on that...<br><br>DW, good. I'll add Watts to the list of oldies but goodies I need to reread. <br><br>Sofistek, it's a justifiable rant. Things are going to get back to normal, mind you -- it's just that "normal" doesn't mean what most people today think it does. Normal is when 80 to 90% of people make their living growing crops using their own muscles and maybe those of an animal or two, and being well off means that you've got ample food in the cellar and maybe even an extra pair of boots. The last three centuries have been utterly abnormal. <br><br>Echo, fascinating. The goats I tended in my hippie farm days wouldn't touch nettles. They'd devastate blackberries, including the big coarse Himalayan ones -- they didn't eat the canes, but they expertly stripped off every leaf and bud until the canes died.

That's exactly the way I expect things to skid downhill -- no maintenance, spare parts running out, stuff being stripped for metal and other valuables, poor neighborhoods being blacked out so that rich neighborhoods can keep power for a while longer, and it just keeps on rolling. As for ham radio, you're preaching to the choir, as I'm sure you know -- if we're going to have a viable communications net at the end of the 21st century, it's going to be created by hams and their descendants, using homebrewed rigs with QRP wattages, and a lot of operator skill and cooperation in place of fancy technology and legal-limit power. <br><br>Barath, my take is that his estimates for the amount of nonconventional fuels are way up there on the high side; he also ignores net energy and energy subsidies -- for example, you'll notice that he includes biofuels in the mix without including a correction factor to represent the amount of fuel needed to raise the crops, etc. <br><br>Glenn, it was apparently eaten -- I don't recall having to delete anything by you in quite a while. ;-)<br><br>Doctor W., the thing I'd point out is that what the Dems perceive about themselves is not necessarily the way they look to anybody else.

It soon appeared that light sweet crude had peaked in November 2005. <br><br>In the years since a number of studies have been done and the year 2005 still stands as--though the peak is as likely to have been in May as November. But the exact date matters little. <br><br>However, by 2006 it was obvious to all oil industry insiders that light sweet crude had already peaked, or was about to, and this represented a problem. The solution, as in so much of American life where statistics are involved, was to fudge the base-line. So numbers started to be published as "all petroleum liquids" rather than light sweet crude, so that the "peak" could be postponed. By 2008 this number, representing crude production of all types, was also peaking so the number was changed again to "all liquids"--which included production from tarsands, natural gas condensates, biofuels, and so on and so on. By changing the baseline again, peak was again postponed, and "production" has remained on a bumpy, but basically flat plateau since. <br><br>The current debate, which seems to be wrapping up, is whether "all liquids" has also peaked. It seems that it has, and likely a gentle decline has begun. <br><br>Cornucopians generally avoid talking about production rates, which are too knowable and too telling, in preference for recoverable reserves, which are intrinsically guesswork and allow for rosier pictures, but are also less relevant economically. <br><br>You should not be surprised that you do not find good or clear information about peak oil in the media, as that would cut at the heart of continued belief in our industrial economy. Once you understand peak oil you understand that the game really is over--and very few people want that. <br><br>My own belief is that the media will never, ever, deal with peak oil but will attribute our decline to absolutely anything--gay marriage, hippies, lazy workers, or even deadbeat homeowners--else. <br><br>--Gaianne<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c3937515817367568815 title="comment permalink">1/20/12, 11:47 PM</a><br><br>

It can travel up to 2km on electric power, whilst retaining a 1.5L petrol engine for recharging the batteries (we don't have the fully battery powered Prius here), powering the wheels (for most of it's life) and it can also recover energy into the batteries whilst coasting and braking.<br><br>Yet, my own vehicle which is a Suzuki Swift 1.5L has the same capacity engine has less complexity and far less weight and costs well under half the price of the Prius.<br><br>Given that fuel consumption is largely a factor of weight and engine capacity these days, then surely you can't keep a straight face and tell me that a Prius is an appropriate response.<br><br>I'm not knocking the Prius which is an amazing bit of kit, but you can't meet a simple problem (resource depletion) with a complex solution. Too often this is a path that we as a society follow and it is the wrong one among many.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c450013339124211057 title="comment permalink">1/21/12, 1:56 AM</a><br><br>

My reflection on the matter is there is no one size fits all approach to dealing with the economic decline. As my Buddhist teacher says we all have to work with our own condition, which includes everything such as age, health, knowledge etc and with our circumstances, such as housing, employment, family situation etc. There is no point wasting energy on wishing these are otherwise but it is useful to think through the choices you have available given the possibilities and limitations of your condition and circumstances.<br><br>We live in a mid-terraced house in a mid-sized city in the UK, we live within 10 minutes walk of a good local shopping street and within 30 minutes walk of the city centre. We don't have a garden, just a small patio, but we do rent a half acre plot in allotments down the end of our street. We discussed a few years ago whether we should consider moving to living in a community in a rural location but decided to stay put and work towards reducing our dependence on the economy and becoming more sustainable over time. I work in the National Health Service, although cuts are now having to be made so I have to be prepared that I may not have a job in the future. My husband is a freelance performer who does stuff on environmental and heritage themes - he used to get a lot of work from schools but this has virtually dried up, so he has had to become what he refers to as an urban peasant - growing food and chopping wood for our living room woodburner, cooking and preserving etc, while I go out to work and pay the bills. <br><br>I have recently had a legacy and we have chosen to use the money to do stuff to the house we couldn't otherwise afford to do, including installation of solar PV to reduce our use of grid electricity. We still have some of the legacy left so we are on the look-out for a small piece of woodland within a maximum of 20 miles from here so we could still get to it by bike when private road transport becomes unaffordable or unavailable. <br><br>We have been taking a gradual approach to reducing our dependence on the financial economy including fossil fuels, which I feel is the best approach both practically and psychologically. One thing I am very aware of is the need to be able to look after our own health as the health service is going to become increasing unsustainable (my husband is in his early 50's, I am in my mid 40's), so I am thinking about doing a diploma on herbal and natural medicine so I am equipped to look after my own health and possibly have a marketable skill for a possible jobless future.<br><br>Keep up the good work - you are an inspiration to all of us who realise the need to adjust to the challenges presented by economic decline &amp; peak oil. A book I would recommend is 'Do Good Lives have to cost the Earth?' by the New Economics Foundation, which is a collection of essays on how living more simply can be seen in a positive light. http://neweconomics.org/publications/do-good-lives-have-to-cost-the-earth<br><br>Cheers, Anne<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c8339393199711436128 title="comment permalink">1/21/12, 5:51 AM</a><br><br>

Credit score (at least here in the US) has become the single number of merit by which all are judged. Landlords won't rent to those with low credit scores, employers won't hire those with low credit scores. There are also tax consequences. The IRS considers any forgiven debt to be income. Currently there is an exception for debt forgiveness up to a certain dollar limit on your primary residence if you meet certain conditions. But any other forgiven debt is treated as ordinary income. I've seen dozens of people trade being crushed by consumer debt for being crushed by IRS debt. Trust me; you would much rather owe money to the bank.<br><br>latheChuck: "When you need to choose between Food, Energy, Water, Shelter, and 4G streaming of your favorite celebrity videos to your mobile device, which bill doesn't get paid?"<br><br>Based on my experience here in central Florida, the important bills are the last priority. 4G and alcohol are tied for first with the car payment in a close second. I am constantly amazed when I hear a neighbor on their iPhone screaming at the power company for turning off the juice when they were "only" three months behind.

About a year ago when the massive demonstrations against his anti-union policies were occuring in Madison, it was really good to see so many people caring about those issues, but I couldn't help but wonder why they were caring now and not thirty, twenty, or even ten years ago. And the answer is that Walker's moves against public employees are an assault on the middle class, whereas in the past, the policy-assaults were mostly on the laboring class. And this probably explains the puzzling number of white working-class people who support Scott Walker. On a level these people likely don't even entirely recognize, they are probably thinking, "You middle-class liberals didn't care when people like <b>me</b> were having our lives ground into sausage by those rich people!" I like to think that I cared at least at little, but I have pretty much been a rather marginalized and isolated person ever since being forced to realize that the denizens of the college "PC" scene weren't really my friends.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c200925573230916510 title="comment permalink">1/21/12, 7:06 AM</a><br><br>

Still, your broader point is valid. I don't discuss the interface between peak oil and America's ethnic minorities very much, simply because -- to put things as bluntly as they deserve -- advice from clueless white folks is rarely of any use to anybody else. It would be good to see more people of color discuss their own perspectives on peak oil. <br><br>Cherokee, I think I need an Australian-American dictionary.

Two months ago me and my sister put our father in a nursing home in England as he could no longer cope on his own (our mother died some time ago) given that he has advanced dementia.<br><br>We had five days to clear out his house of all he had accumulated over a lifetime. As you can imagine it was no easy task, logistically or emotionally, and I tried to salvage anything of material or sentimental value, with the rest going to charity and the stuff even they didn't want going to the 'recycling' centre (to either be thrown into a China bound container or sent to landfill). It was here that I watched a man take a lump hammer to the family stereo system that my parents had bought with such pride in the early 1980s.<br><br>The whole operation was a meditation on the transience of wealth and status.

It can only be paid for by his generous pension scheme.<br><br>Unfortunately, for reasons I'd rather not go into here, neither myself nor my sister is willing to take him in and look after him ourselves.

You are absolutely right about the naked aggression of drivers. There is nothing subtle about it.

I had the luxury of a good superannuation scheme, with a lump sum payout,which allowed me to retire at 55 and buy a small mountain cottage outright. a few years later my daughter had twins who are autists, and I have for the last 12 years been the main provider of childcare and support. My daughter moved to a different state and I now travel 4 times a year 14 hours by train to help out in the school holidays. I was fortunate. My friends younger that me, are mostly educated working class and work in white collar jobs, problem is Super funds like the one I was in have all been abandoned. Many of my friends have lost a lot of super in the 2008 fiasco, as well the australian goverment has been increasing the retirement age, so that many of my friends will not be of pension age until 67. There goes the idea of nanna being able to take on the childcare, unless the kids want to wait until 35 - 40 to start a family. This trend was well explored by the marxist/feminist movement in the 1970's, just google women and housework. I agree that most women adopted so called labour saving devices with great glee, but there was a hidden cost, and we are just now beginning to see the consequences. It may be an easy thing to let go of things like dishwashers and clothes dryers not so easy a thing, to be able to return to the role of homemaker, with no viable income. In my view, the ruling class, knows exactly what it is doing, has always done so, and it is going to take a great deal of skill and cunning to fly under the radar<br>diane<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c5496988198839327259 title="comment permalink">1/21/12, 4:11 PM</a><br><br>

By placing a large wheel in the middle of the vehicle instead of a smaller wheel in front, one could easily carry three to six times as much weight than if using a European wheelbarrow. <br><br>"The one-wheeled vehicle appeared around the time the extensive Ancient Chinese road infrastructure began to disintegrate.

We store a seasons worth of local meat &amp; processed produce on a rolling basis at any one time, eating it down throughout the rest of the year and replenishing it when back in season. Works just fine in conjunction with the root cellar and canning operation. Hence my commitment to producing whatever amount of power I can. Fits in overall with the theme of self-reliance.

Look on page 41 for the paragraph beginning The Busy and Depleted System 2. In brief, our brain uses a lot of energy in the form of glucose. When we are trying to solve a mentally taxing problem or trying to control ourselves or trying to impress others, we are putting a load on System 2 and depleting its stores of glucose. <br><br>Subjects are given a difficult mental task, and then given some lemonade, and then another difficult mental task. Half the lemonade is sweetened with an artificial sweetener and the other half is sweetened with glucose (sold as dextrose by Amazon). The people who get the glucose sweetened lemonade perform much better than the artificial sweetener group.<br><br>Studies of parole board actions reveal that they are much more likely to approve parole requests when they have just finished lunch and their brain glucose stores have been replenished. If you think about it, a parole board is considering the possibility that a criminal has changed their stripes. Evaluating a possible change is hard mental work, and our brain rebels if it is depleted of glucose. The brain reverts to System 1 thinking which reacts quickly and easily, but superficially. The superficial answer to a parole board is 'No'.<br><br>Why do I think this might be important to think about? All of us who read this blog are anticipating some major changes in our worlds. We think that some hard physical and mental work is going to be required for successful adaptation. The evidence is that the mental work requires that the brain be replenished with glucose pretty frequently--otherwise the brain defaults to superficial answers.<br><br>I will note that glucose is not metabolically the same as sucrose (table sugar) or fructose (the sugar in fruit). For an explanation of the metabolic fates of sucrose and fructose and high fructose corn syrup, see <br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM<br>where Dr. David Lustig talks for over an hour on the subject.<br><br>Also please note during his talk that glucose DOES NOT result in de novo lipogenesis. There is no storage of the glucose in fat. It is immediately sent to the needy organ--the brain if you have been thinking hard.<br><br>So my (non medical) conclusion would be that glucose is going to be more effective, with fewer side effects, than sucrose or fructose.<br><br>I will also note that caffeine gives me the ILLUSION of renewed brain performance. I think it just makes me jumpy. In other words, I have done nothing to replenish the brains depleted glucose, but I have made System 1 jump around a lot. Which probably just makes it harder for me to do anything coherent.<br><br>In short, if you are trying to do hard mental work (such as problem solving), then you want to pay attention to glucose depletion and keep some glucose (dextrose) around and have some quick and easy way to ingest it.<br><br>But please don't take my word for it. Check with Kahneman and Lustig and try it yourself.<br><br>Don Stewart<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c5220653753725480136 title="comment permalink">1/22/12, 9:39 AM</a><br><br>

I have often thought that had he and John met, some valuable ideas would come out of it.<br><br>I have also read Jim Goal’s work. Far more unpleasant and over the top – at least for people who consider themselves the dainty middle class and (until now) satisfied with the order of things.<br><br>John – your point on the support of poor over the working class is one I totally agree with, but didn’t mention in my earlier comment. Of course, no one thinks to ask who the black urban poor really are and where they came from anymore. Most of them appear to (to use a term that is accurate and very uncomfortable to think about) peasants who were thrown off their land, whether they own it or not. The fact that they did important work and had critical agricultural skills which has now been lost to their current generation is something that occurs to almost no one. That we will shortly very much regret that lost of knowledge is an ugly irony. For the early death that this loss of knowledge will at some point cause will not only strike at the urban black poor themselves (who are already very familiar with early death) but as John repeatedly tries to point out at many (likely most) in what are now the more privileged classes.<br><br>One critical point that Joe B. pointed out is that there is a (growing) white underclass that is in a similar boat as their black counterparts, except that this underclass tended to be more rural and suburban. Many of them, especially in the south, have also been pushed of their land and have lost their agricultural skills.<br><br>@Rita: Your point about the middle class prospering as power transferred from landowners to the factory owners and merchants is correct. What we are going to see is that process going in reverse with landowners regaining their previous power. One very limited way of looking at land is as an energy collection device. And when oil fields and coal mines no longer provide…<br><br> Finally, regarding the Occupy movement - my Transition group, being the closest one to Wall Street, has some members that are in contact with the people there. I’d never had the opportunity to do so, so my knowledge is second-hand. The good news is that Richard Heinberg’s “The End of Growth” is considered one of the five most important books to read in the movement. There are clearly many people in the Movement that do understand much of what is facing us. However, and this comes from someone in my group that does have a very clear understanding of our situation, in general the people with the best understanding don’t seems to be in the most influential workgroups, but in ones dealing with sustainability and the environment.<br>It is notable to me that so far the Occupy Movement talks about income inequality in general between the “1%” and the rest of us, but the things that would actually remedy this, like honest accounting and reimposing the rule of law (financial fraud is a crime after all), don’t appear to make up much of what seems to be talked about with the movement. Since Bill Black, of the S&amp;L prosecutions, has been in communication with the Occupy Movement, they can’t say these ideas have not been presented them. Unfortunately, while doing these simple things would greatly reduce income inequality, as John points out, it would not be reduced in the way that the middle class, and the aspiring to be middle class, would want. Alas, the Republicans were half right again. Trickle down economics did work for the middle class, even if what was trickling down was mostly imaginary wealth.<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c4291627337811848850 title="comment permalink">1/22/12, 10:47 AM</a><br><br>

I don't own a car either, which certainly raises eyebrows here in So Cal. Laguna Beach is a walking town so I can meet all my needs in walking distance. I ride a bicycle, and I take the excellent bus system to travel further afield (most people around here don't even know there is a bus system, and nobody I know has ever ridden a bus), and the train to go to LA or San Diego. I live comfortably on my SS of $750 a month, and I am able to save most of it, since I live rent free and I get most of my food from the food bank and the local Hare Krishna temple. I maintain excellent health through walking at least ten miles a day, the temple lacto-vegetarian diet, and frequent fasting of up to ten or more days, which I highly recommend. I thus have no health or medication expenses at age 62, and I'm certainly not interested in any kind of mandatory health insurance premiums to be paid to private insurers.<br><br>I've learned that my happiness is completely unaffected by how much money I have so long as my basic needs of food, clothing and housing are met. This is not hard to do so long as you contribute your time instead of money by showing up and getting involved. The temple feeds me because I show up for all their activities and participate, starting at 5 am everyday. The food bank collects date-expired food that would otherwise be thrown away. Clothes can be easily obtained from local thrift shops for trivial sums. I can live rent-free for just the modest cost of utilities since I have a relative with a rental property for which I act as caretaker. <br><br>I have no assets, and more importantly, no debt. I live in 200 sq ft, and that's more than enough. Of course I live alone, but I have also learned that attachment to other people is definitely not a source of happiness, and more likely a source of misery. I get plenty of association at the temple, at local coffeeshops and at our frequent Transition meetings. I'm in better shape physically and mentally than I have ever been in my life. I went through some serious misery some years ago before I learned these things. <br><br>A well-regulated life of serving others is the key to happiness.

That's an amazingly useful introduction for me just now - and I suspect for many others wrestling with the choices they must make for their future. It really does tie in with much that JMG has been saying this last year - and will be a real help to us - thankyou!<br><br>I don't have much time to comment on here, but I always read up, and as ever I'm indebted to JMG and everyone else for taking the time to make this weekly dialogue so inherently useful. In the words of the David Rock video (and bearing in mind how isolated we can be with our world view), it increases our 'relatedness' massively - amongst other things of course.<br><br>I've been fairly paralysed recently in trying to navigate the changes needed in my life - and this is mirrored in many comments on here. Watching that video really struck home just how much <b>energy</b> we are using up thinking logically through our problems. In a very real sense, the thinking about it is actually stopping us dealing with our problems. Part of that is because they are really predicaments (and thus are unsolvable) and we are treating them as problems (as discussed by JMG previously), but nevertheless, it's very handy information to have in realising some alternate ways of looking at those problems/predicaments and simply letting our wider mind get on with dealing with them.<br><br>With regard to making the 'right' choices - and as a veteran cogitator on such matters (I'm sure I'm not alone on here), it seems clear that we waste a lot of time trying to come up with 'perfect' solutions. We need to think (some, but don't overdo it!), decide, and <i>get on with it!</i>, even though some of our choices will be 'wrong'. Otherwise by the time we fully have "woken up", we won't have the time to "walk away".<br><br>As an English person, I was frankly horrified to learn on here how people who choose to walk/cycle about in the US are viewed by car drivers. Oh my does that show some cultural differences! Over here if I see someone walking, it simply doesn't register. It kind of does explain my American friend's reaction when I visited her in SF some years ago when I told her that I would walk into town (2-3 miles at most) - she just couldn't believe it.

In the transportation discussion, it's always horses that come up. There are a lot more options for animal traction for heavy work, some of which are more affordable or versatile.<br><br>Horses are best for plowing and harrowing light soil quickly, and for riding or driving fast. You can cover a lot of ground. But they are expensive to feed.<br><br>Other options include donkeys (most economic feeder per amount of work produced), mules (usually more economical and smarter than horses) and oxen, or cattle. Some breeds of milk cow can work up to 4 hours a day and still give milk, if sufficiently fed.<br><br>And historically, horses were not kept and used the way modern Americans do with cars. Quite frequently they were rented or borrowed when needed. Quite simply, they weren't affordable for everyone.

Granted, this glaring problem is ignored by even the doomers as is the population issue, but still, it needs exposure: living within walking distance of stores, shops, etc., entails living within walking distance of the soon-to-be dispossessed abandoned by the comforting and infantilizing myth of modernity. True, many will simply die with a whimper, but plenty will be irrational and violent (okay, MORE irrational and violent), and you either join in their reindeer games or you're next in the noose.

My take on the whole peak oil issue is that the average ethnic minority in this country most likely sees the peak oil issue as less of a threat to their way of life. IMO, for whites, the peak oil issue and overarching sustainability movement is about trying to adjust to life in a way that allows them to minimize the impact to their standard of living as much as possible and there will be MUCH resistance. <br><br>On the other hand, for many ethnic minorities, their struggle has always been about survival on the most basic level. They are not bogged down on whether or not they can live with downsizing to a smaller hour or going from two cars to one, as many do not and/or never have owned a vehicle or needed one for that matter, to get back and forth from their jobs to their suburban homes. Likewise, riding a bike or taking a bus wouldn't necessarily be a major transition for inner/urban city ethnic minorities, IMO. <br><br>In the end, I think that it is going to be hard for ethnic minorities to go off to some rural area or small town and feel accepted, especially during a crisis, because, from experience, I tried rural living in South Carolina,for a few years and I by no means felt "welcomed" at any point or time.<br><br>I think that the peak oil issue and any breakdown or collapse in a city, region or nation will break along the lines of class, before anything. So, middle class ethnic minorities - or those who were middle class prior to the start of the collapse, are aware of the issues that the U.S. faces. On the political front, there are even some Blacks that are now looking at Ron Paul as the candidate of choice for president.<br><br>On the other hand, IMO, the majority of poor/inner city ethnic minorities are in the dark about the entire threat to global civilization/end of empire/peak oil issue and will continue to live out their lives looking for the government to rescue them.The issue of self reliance, etc. is going to be the difference between survial or NOT, so sad to say, there will be TWO categories of people who may not make it in the long run: the poor, regardless of race and the masses of the unawakened Whites in suburbia.<br><br>On a final note, there are the religious sector of Whites, like the Mormons, in particular who see the issue and are going to be very prepared. I downloaded their "preparedness" manual put out by someone affiliate with their group. It is good, information wise, but I couldn't help to notice how many times they kept raising the issue of racial tensions that will be a threat to life, during a SHTF scenario. IMO, this is the driving force behind the incentive to prepare for "Bugging Out"...... which primarily would apply to Whites- to avoid being a target by some poorer ethnic minorities who might riot, etc when they realize that the U.S. Govt. won't save them (like Katrina).<br><br><a href=waking-up-walking-away.html#c7140608883682429743 title="comment permalink">3/26/12, 8:08 PM</a><br><br>

That is what makes an outsider, clinging to an outside culture rather that living within the dominant community culture.<br><br>I accept that minorities have different problems, or we wouldn't define a group as being a minor part of a larger community. But I think race is the least important aspect of the differing cultural choices that set one apart from their community.<br><br>Actions and words that are respected vary from community to community -- from culture to culture. The way we dress, the way we talk, who we work for, how well our family background is known at the local coffee shop -- these can each set us apart from a community we wish to join. <br><br>It seems harsh, to have to give up our identity, to redefine who we know ourselves to be, to accept a job or to move to a new community. We know that such a move or change always involves a period of depression, somewhat related to "buyer's remorse" that comes after a major purchase.<br><br>As the Tarot "death" card explains change, we have to let the old life die, to make room for the new life.
