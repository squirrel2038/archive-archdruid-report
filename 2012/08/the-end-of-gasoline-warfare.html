<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week’s discussion of American military vulnerabilities touched on one of the major issues that ought to be giving Pentagon officials sleepless nights—but only one of them The military downsides of America’s obsession with high-tech gizmos, in a world where complexity just gives the other guy more opportunities to mess with you, are no small matter, to be sure, but those downsides are taking shape in a wider context that has its own bad news to deliver to fans of US global dominance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To make sense of that context, though, it’s going to be necessary to return briefly to a point I’ve made here more than once before, which is the pervasive misunderstanding of evolution you’ll find straight across the cultural landscape of today’s America. Since Darwin first proposed his eminently simple theory more than a century and a half ago—“How stupid not to have thought of it before,” Thomas Henry Huxley is reported to have said—the great majority of Americans, believers and critics alike, have insisted on redefining evolution as progress: what is “more evolved” is better, more advanced, more progressive than the competition. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Not so. Evolution is adaptation to changing circumstances, and that’s all it is. In some cases, evolution moves organisms in the direction of greater complexity, but in plenty of other cases it’s gone the other direction. Over the two billion years or so since the first self-replicating organisms first appeared on this planet, the no-holds-barred wrestling match between genetic variation and a frighteningly unstable environment has turned out some remarkably weird adaptations—pterodactyls, uintatheria, Khloe Kardashian—but they aren’t the organisms that endure over the long term.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The dragonflies who visit my backyard regularly haven’t changed much since the Devonian, the box turtle we see at intervals out front had relatives munching slugs in the Cretaceous, while the adolescent bat who got lost and ended up in our bedroom one morning a few weeks back would not have been out of place in the forests of the Eocene.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They and organisms like them are survivors because they found a good stable adaptation and stuck with it; while other organisms adapted in ways that turned out to be dead ends. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s precisely because evolution is adaptation to circumstances, no more and no less, that it’s possible—and indeed easy—to find precise analogues to Darwinian evolution in fields far removed from biology. War is one of these. Seen from a systems perspective, nations competing for survival, prosperity, and power show plenty of equivalencies to species doing the same thing for the same reasons, and war—now as always, the final arbiter of national survival—follows patterns of adaptation that a Darwinian analysis explains well.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The collapse of Bronze Age chariot warfare discussed a few posts back offers a useful example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The chariot armies of the late Bronze Age were superbly adapted for their military environment, but like so many highly specialized life forms in evolutionary history, their adaptations limited their ability to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That limit proved to be fatal to many societies along the eastern Mediterranean littoral, and might well have done so even for Egypt if that ancient society had not been willing and able to return to an older and more resilient set of military adaptations.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Our chances are fairly high of witnessing an even more striking example of the same process in the not too distant future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As discussed a while back in this series of posts, the current American way of war was originally pioneered by the German and Japanese militaries in the years before the Second World War, as both nations explored the extraordinary new possibilities that petroleum had opened up in war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The destruction of the French army in the spring of 1940 by a German invasion force that had fewer men, cannons, and tanks than its Allied opponents put the world on notice that the old ways of war no longer mattered; the Japanese conquest of the entire western Pacific in a few weeks at the end of 1941 made that memo impossible to ignore, and the United States—to the lasting regret of Germany and Japan—proved to be a quick learner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The new warfare depended on the mobility that planes, tanks, and trucks made possible, but it had another dimension that is not always recognized.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The German conquest of France in 1940, for example, did not succeed because the Germans met and crushed the Allied armies in a head-on battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Rather, the panzer divisions of the Wehrmacht dodged the big battle the Allies wanted to fight on the plains of Belgium, and cut across France south of the Allied forces, breaking their communication and supply lines, while the Luftwaffe carried out air strikes to disorganize Allied units and crippled their ability to respond to a rapidly changing situation. Compare it to the US invasions of Iraq in 1990 and 2003 and it’s hard to miss the precise parallels; in both these cases, as in 1940 France, what handed a quick victory to the invaders was a strategy that focused on shredding the enemy government’s and military commanders’ ability to respond to the invasion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The aftermath, though, is telling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1940 as in 2003, the invader’s victory was followed promptly by a sustained insurgency against the occupying forces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(The only reason that didn’t happen in 1990 was that the elder Bush and his generals had the great common sense to declare victory and get out.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The same thing has happened far more often than not whenever gasoline warfare on the blitzkrieg model has taken place in the real world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are good reasons for that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Military theorists have postulated any number of conditions that define victory in war, but in practice these all come down to one requirement, which is that the losing side has to be convinced that giving up the fight is the best option it has left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That was the point of the old-fashioned pitched battle, in which one army offered battle at a chosen location, the other army accepted the invitation, both sides got into position, and then they hammered away at each other for a day or two until one side or the other had the stuffing pounded out of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After a few battles of that kind, everyone from the king to the lowliest foot soldier knew exactly which side was going to keep on beating the other if the war went on, and so a peace treaty was normally negotiated in short order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Gasoline warfare rarely has the same result.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For those on the losing side—I’m relying here especially on accounts by French and British officers who were in the Battle of France in 1940—the war is a roller-coaster ride through chaos; many, sometimes most, ground units never have the chance to measure their strength against the enemy in combat, because the other side has gone right past them and is deep behind their lines; orders from their own commanders are confused, contradictory, or never arrive at all; and then suddenly the war is over, the government has surrendered, and the other side is parading through Paris or Baghdad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So there you are; your government’s will to resist may be broken, but yours isn’t, and pretty soon you’re looking around for ways to carry on the fight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That way lies the French Resistance—or, for that matter, the Iraqi one. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is why resistance movements sprang up so promptly in every nation conquered by Nazi Germany, and why insurgencies have done the same so often in nations conquered by the United States. It’s the natural result of a way of war that’s very good at bullying governments into fast collapse but very poor at convincing the ordinary grunt in uniform, or for that matter the ordinary person on the street, that the other side’s triumph ought to be accepted without further fuss. (Attentive readers will note here that the logic of the blitzkrieg is weirdly similar to that embraced more recently by believers in the sudden collapse of industrial society; in both cases, the words “what happens next” play an insufficiently large role in planning, and the possibility that people affected by a sudden collapse might do something to respond to it rarely seems to get a look in.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s here that the Darwinian analysis of war mentioned earlier is most relevant, because insurgency is not a fixed thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It evolves over time, as different insurgent groups try new tactics, strategies and weapons, and draw on the experience of past insurgencies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The evolution of insurgency, as it happens, dates from before the birth of gasoline warfare; it emerged as opponents of European colonial regimes in the Third World began to adapt the methods of European revolutionary warfare to the distinctive conditions of their time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The new model of insurgency saw its first trial runs in South Africa and the Philippines right around 1900; both insurgencies were eventually defeated, but not without serious cost to the two imperial powers in question, and the lessons learned in those wars spread widely—it’s not accidental, for example, that the word “commando” entered military parlance in the very early 20th century from Afrikaans, where it was used for Boer insurgent groups fighting the British. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The evolutionary struggle between gasoline warfare and insurgency has been much discussed in recent years in military journals, although the label that’s been given to state of the art insurgency—“Fourth Generation warfare,” or 4GW for short—confuses far more than it reveals. The notion that military history can be divided into a set of neatly defined generations, each one of which supersedes the one before it, simply restates the contemporary myth of progress in another guise, and is just as arbitrary as narratives of progress normally are; though the technologies differ, 4GW was practiced by Elamite hill tribes against Babylonian armies more than three thousand years ago, and will doubtless still be being practiced by peoples on the periphery of empires as long as human societies are complex enough to support urban imperial centers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Despite the problems with the term, and with a good deal of the thinking that’s gathered around it, the debates aroud 4GW have brought up a crucial issue, which is that today’s insurgent groups have been at least as quick to innovate and to adopt the latest technology as their well-funded opponents in the Pentagon and its equivalents elsewhere. Darwinian selection works just as effectively on insurgencies as on species, and the mechanism is much the same—a constant pressure on ecological boundaries, which sooner or later stumbles across every available option for greater success at the hard work of survival.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So far, the military bureaucracies in the world’s great powers have been able to stay more or less abreast of the resulting transformations, but their situation has a lot in common with that of physicians today faced with antibiotic-resistant bacteria:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>you can keep on inventing new antibiotics for a while, but the law of diminishing returns is always working against you, the germs are gaining ground, and you know that sooner or later something lethal, communicable, and resistant to all known antibiotics is pretty much certain to make an appearance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Exactly what form the next military revolution will take is an interesting question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some days I suspect that a first draft of it was field-tested by the Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon in 2006. To deal with an invasion by an Israeli Army as thoroughly committed to gasoline warfare as any army on earth, Hezbollah adopted a strategy that could probably be called preventive insurgency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Soldiers, weapons, ammunition and supplies were carefully stashed in underground hideouts all over southern Lebanon in advance of the Israeli invasion, where they could wait out the aerial bombardment and the initial assault, and then popped up unexpectedly behind Israeli lines with guns and antitank rocket launchers blazing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While both sides claimed victory in the resulting struggle, the fight was nothing like as one-sided as Israel’s two earlier invasions of Lebanon had been Could the same strategy be taken further, and turned into a wickedly effective defense in depth against a conventional invasion?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I suspect so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On other days, I remember the war between Libya and Chad in 1987, when Libya was a client state of the Soviet Union and had an extensive army and air force equipped with secondhand Russian tanks and planes, and Chad had an army equipped mostly with Toyota pickups packing 50-caliber machine guns, rocket launchers, and half a dozen infantrymen in back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Chadian forces won an overwhelming victory, whipping around the Libyan forces via goat trails in the mountains and leaving the plains of northern Chad littered with burning Libyan tanks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those armed pickups are called “technicals” in African jargon, and it’s a term you may want to remember; for decades now, they’ve been standard military vehicles all over the continent, and my guess is that it’s only a matter of time before they start being used elsewhere in the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Could an army equipped with technicals, and with antiaircraft and antitank rocket launchers a little more sophisticated than the ones in common use just now, copy the Chadian victory against a major power?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Again, I suspect so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Whether or not these speculations have any bearing on the way things work out, though, the age of gasoline warfare that began with Stukas screaming out of the sky in the spring of 1940 is guaranteed to come to an end sooner or later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are two reasons that can be said with a fair degree of assurance. First, of course, is the simple fact that every way of making war eventually runs into something it can’t handle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If military history shows anything, it’s that the invincible army of one era is the crow food of the next, and far more likely than not the switchover has nothing to do with technological progress; it simply takes a certain amount of time for potential enemies to stumble on whatever trick or tactic will do the job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, even this factor is less certain than the other, which is that gasoline warfare is only possible in the presence of ample supplies of gasoline. More generally, the contemporary American way of war can only continue if huge amounts of relatively cheap energy can be provided, not only to fuel planes and tanks and ships, but to support the immense infrastructure that makes modern war possible. As that surplus of energy wanes, so will gasoline warfare, and the successful military powers of the future will be those that can figure out ways to project power and win battles with less of an outlay of energy and raw materials than their rivals. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To be sure, some amount of gasoline or the equivalent will be going into war for a very long time to come—the advantages provided by the internal combustion engine are real enough that gasoline will probably still be being used for military purposes long after the private automobile has retreated into legend. My guess, though, is that the last gallons of gasoline to used in warfare will be fueling technicals, not tanks—and long before that happens, a way of war dependent on the extravagant consumption of energy and raw materials will have gone whistling down the wind alongside a civilization that tried to support itself on the same unsustainable basis. </div>

It has been three years now since I took a break from these weekly essays, and for a number of reasons, now’s a good time not to take that any further. The fictional scenario that was going to be the last post in this series of three has unexpectedly grown into an extended narrative five posts long, one that needs to be filled out by a good deal of further research; I also have a contract, finally, for the Green Wizardry book project, and a major writing project on the other side of my career, both of which could use some concentrated attention just now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This will therefore be the last <i>Archdruid Report</i> post until the beginning of October. I’ll be responding to comments on this post for the next week or so, but after that, you’re on your own for the month of September. Put the time you’d spend reading these essays into digging in your gardens, building solar ovens, learning to brew beer, or in some other way developing skills that will help you weather the opening years of the deindustrial age, and you’ll be ahead of the game. See you again on October 3!</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

<div class=MsoNormal>
And for those who are worried about missing their weekly dose of apocalyptic fantasy...</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: large">End of the World of the Week #37, #38, #39, #40, and #41</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Until recently, at least, the usual way to come up with an apocalyptic prediction was to figure out first how the world was going to end, and then try to figure out the date when that would happen. The current 2012 hysteria has taken the opposite approach, first choosing a date and then trying to find some cataclysm or other to justify it—but it’s not quite the first time this latter method saw use. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No, that honor belongs to the redoubtable Charles Berlitz, one of the leading authors in the rejected-knowledge field in the late 20th century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Berlitz was the man who invented the Bermuda Triangle and rescued the supposed Roswell flying saucer crash from oblivion, so he unquestionably had the skills needed for his apocalyptic magnum opus, <i>Doomsday: 1999 A.D.</i>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
How would the world end that year?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Berlitz was nothing if not open-minded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A convulsion at the earth’s core might cause cataclysmic earthquakes, or an overload of ice at the South Pole might destabilize the crust and send it skidding over the mantle, moving all the continents into new positions and causing earthquakes and floods; a sudden ice age might sweep the globe, plunging much of the northern hemisphere into a deep freeze; there might be a nuclear war, or the earth might get swatted by an asteroid or a really big comet. Hey, it could even be more than one!</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course there was no reason to think that any of these things were more likely to arrive in 1999 than in any other year, and with three of the five, there are very good reasons to think that they can’t happen at all. Still, it made for a very successful book—until 1999 came and went uneventfully, that is—and the same logic Berlitz offered is being used today to argue that one or more of an even more diverse flurry of world-ending events will infallibly arrive on December 21 of this year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>

Running out of a finite resource is a very common way for civilizations to die, but it's not the only option, so western civilization would have a finite lifespan with or without oil, and with or without your imaginary limitless supply of it. As for when things became unsustainable, yes, I'm familiar with that theory -- you do know, don't you, that most other species also kill competing species, and will squeeze them right out of existence given half a chance?

So far, except for one that came down in Iran under controversial circumstances, there's been little visible response on the part of those targeted by these flying surveillance and weapons platforms.<br><br>They're stealthy but slow, probably have vulnerabilities but may also have evasive defensive capabilities. So far the Afghans in the crosshairs don't seem to have figured it out. It may be just a matter of time; meanwhile, the U.S. military, buoyed by early success, is betting big-time on expanding use of this technology across all services, as well as into domestic enforcement roles. (Remember when every big-city police force had to have its special SWAT team, with big black SUVs and black ballistic-nylon gear bags loaded with black semi-military weapons? watch for the same equipment-lust when it comes to unmanned surveillance platforms).<br><br>There's another aspect to the Drone Wars that I never see mentioned, and it's this: in the Old Days, the alpha male at the top of the pecking order (usually "Emperor" or "King" titled) was actually conversant and capable in the wielding of whatever weapons were in use at the time; when he provoked or was provoked into going to war, he was generally in the thick of it himself, likely with some shielding by a phalanx of the best soldiers his side could muster at the time; the point was, the guy on top put his life and limbs on the line in pursuit of whatever military victory or conquest he sought.<br><br>Now, with the evolution of unmanned aerial surveillance / weapons systems, even the grunts behind the controls are shielded from any possible harm, in their air-conditioned office cubicle, where controlling a lethal weapon bears more than a passing similarity to the video games they've played since they were 6 years old (and physically, with identical risk - you "die", you re-start the game).<br><br>Now how do you think this goes over with the tribesmen and Taliban targets of these weapons systems? They may fear, but they will not respect. They feel humiliated, and that feeling goes far in stoking resentment and rage. Basically, they will feel that their opponents, shielded by the ultimate protection - half a world of distance away - fight in a <i>cowardly way</i>. No life or limb is personally at stake. <br><br>It's very unlikely that any exercise in diplomacy will win any "hearts and minds" in Afghanistan as long as their skies are patrolled by lethal weapons (which, by the way, periodically blow up the unlucky wedding party or gathering of tribal elders). More insurgents are enraged, enlisting to fight the faceless invaders.<br><br>It will be interesting to see how it plays out.<br><br> Dick Lawrence<br><br><a href=#c8995334417547113588 title="comment permalink">8/30/12, 5:56 AM</a><br><br>

The two destroyers sent to reinforce the city had no air cover and were easily sunk by Japanese bombers. Attempts to blow the road bridge to Malaysia failed. Lew Kuan Yew (18 at the time, later Primeminister for life of an independant Singapore) later said that when his headmaster asked what the bang (from the attempts to mine the bridge) was, said "the sound of the end of the British Empire".<br><br>Following the fall of Singapore and the use of the British Army in Asia as slave labour, how could this tiny island ever convince the world that they were "destined to rule". Their white subjects in Australia and New Zealand felt they could probably do rather better on their own and their Asian and African subjects now knew that the great British Empire could be defeated. The rest, as they say, is history.<br><br><a href=#c3942625521749828054 title="comment permalink">8/30/12, 8:38 AM</a><br><br>

Just ask the Romans agains Hannibal ( BTW both Gulf wars and the Blitzkrieg were explicitely based on the thought framework behind Hannibal actions, especially the battle of Cannae ... aparently neither the Germans in 1940 or the Americans in 2003 got to the post-Zama part of their History book :D ). And obviously, the fossil fuel manifestations of that unwillingness to surrender started pretty much with the era, with the <i>guerilla</i> movements against Napoleonic armies in the Iberian penisula ( BTW "commando" got to the afrikander from a portuguese borrow and originally meant a guy that got a mission ( a "comando" ) to go to African hinterland alone or with little company to submit a certain tribe. Hence the origin of the term for the notion of a lone fighter somewhere in the wild ). That alone would be a good topic ;)<br><br>And on the technicals ( that are pretty much flying batteries on diesel ), well they are a ode to a century and half of diesel veicules left in a darwinian enviroment : the auto "market" favours far more sturdy and reliable machines than most of the current military ( for all that is worth, a car is expected to last a decade or two with daily usage and with atleast 1000 km per year of use, while a military veicule has most likely less expectations of usage and duration ... tanks for example are expected to do 1000 km <i>in their total usage life</i> ). So, it is not exactly surprising to see cars outwitting mechanical porcelain ballerinas on armour ( I do remember that the <i>whole</i> British armour was rended innoperational in Gulf War I due to ... sand clogging down the air filters of the tanks engines so hard that they broke and let sand into the cilinders. My trusty 1988 VW Golf ( so, basically the same time of build ) is still going strong, just for a comparison ), unless you expect that more hi-tech ( whatever that term really means ) equals better ...<br><br>To, end, good "vacations" .I hope things go right with the contract and that your five+ posts scenario will also ends well done ( I'm eagerly waiting for it ). Until October, then :D<br><br><a href=#c3224255209059360974 title="comment permalink">8/30/12, 8:39 AM</a><br><br>

I submit insurgency is a typical response to conquest by a foreign power, rather than utterly ruthless and crushing slaughter like Tamerlaine or Ghengis Khan or the Red Army. The difference is the former leaves much of the inhabitants alive and disgruntled, whereas the latter leaves fewer shell-shocked survivors.<br>The Prussian invasion of France in1871 crushed the French armies, then starved Paris into submission, proclaimed their new Empire at Versailles, and promptly went back over the new border, which was sufficiently little territory that they could easily subdue if needed, just as more insurgencies were cropping up all over the rest of France. Bismark knew that it would be far too costly to subdue the whole country, so he contented himself with Alsace and $10b. He assumed that the next war would go the same way, and they would eventually conquer France piecemeal over a couple of generations.<br>Even the invasion of France after Dunkirk was a classical campaign by soldiers on foot against towns and infantry, exactly as in 1870, with the exception of air power and better logistics. Their mistake was to stay on as rulers, rather than set up a client state under Petain with the illusion of independence.<br>Insurgencies are relatively simple to crush.<br>In Military College they taught that requires a ratio of 1:20 troops to civilians (and a willingness to commit what we today refer to as 'war crimes' or 'crimes against humanity'). That requires an apriori assumption that power is the only possible response, along with supreme confidence in the rightness of a 'cause'. War becomes an acronym: "We Are Right."<br>Simple, but awfully expensive, both in money and public relations. The British never recovered from the Boer war in public opinion, until someone worse came along to distract and help people forget.<br>However, another way -- albeit a long-term project -- to defeat an insurgency is to remove the cause for it. That option never occurs to power-drunk megalomaniacs, but it is effective.<br>As for insurgencies thenselves, they do not last very long without outside help.<br>If the Confederacy wasn't able to import weapons and materiel from Europe, they wouldn't have lasted as long as they did. If the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan weren't given billions of dollars in aid, the fighting would have died out after two years. Hezbollah, FARC, Shining Path or any of a dozen insurgencies could never have continued without access to or support from outside sources.<br>You enjoy a well-deserved break.

I'm not sure where to begin with this shaggy-dog of an analysis. It is ironic that an arch-druid would be so concerned about warfare and military matters, maybe it's a secondary specialty of druidry that few are aware of. <br><br>The basic premise seems to be that conventional mechanized militaries have short-term successes but the success itself leads to insurgent push-back and longer term failure. Presumably, the push-back takes place on the same battlefields or at least the same theaters of operations as the mechanized successes. <br><br>Reviewing actual events from industrial revolution to the present does not support this premise. <br><br>The first mechanized 'modern' war was arguably the Spanish conquest of the New World. For the Europeans, it was a resounding success. Peruvian gold financed the industrial revolution, the 'enlightenment', 200 years of religious wars that resulted in a Europe free of Muslims for the first time in centuries. The mechanical aids were the musket and the 3-masted sailing ship, things the natives did not possess. There was never a native insurgency, only religious scruples ended their enslavement.<br><br>Napoleon did indeed have a tech advantage but was undone on battlefield as well as by his own political ineptitude. 'Honest Abe' Lincoln won his machine war and there was no insurgency, there was nothing left of the confederacy to support one (just nostalgia). <br><br>Europeans won mechanized colonial wars very cheaply and exhibited staying power: colonies failed when the powers struggled within Europe.<br><br>The USSR's nuclear/military establishment bankrupted the USSR along with inept agriculture and Moscow's inability to source external capital. Insurgencies defying Soviet rule were ruthlessly crushed and survivors shot or exiled to concentration camps.<br><br>The Soviets lost the proxy war vs. the US in Afghanistan The Soviets were jettisoned by US Stinger missiles and their effect on Soviet attack helicopters. <br><br>More mechanization has proven to be far better than not enough, the alternative to mechanization is the military equivalent to human power: old-school infantry assaults. As Moctezuma, Napoleon and Robert E. Lee discovered, good infantry becomes harder to come by over time. It is too vulnerable: here is the logic behind robotic warfare, robots are expendable in ways that real soldiers are not. <br><br>Germany in 1945 had almost 11 million men in uniform but only a small fraction -- less than a million -- were willing to battle the Soviets and Americans. None of these Germans were part of an insurgency. The Germans planned one (Operation Werwolf) but it was less than useless: there was no public support for a war that had failed.<br><br>Had Hitler managed to hold out until August instead of May, the first atomic bomb would have fallen on Munich or Berlin instead of Hiroshima. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c8354365296144982466 title="comment permalink">8/30/12, 1:17 PM</a><br><br>

Insurgent combatants were engaged more against other insurgents or avoided combat altogether. During the first world war were mutinies within standing armies: in the Ottoman Empire (which became Turkey), in Russia (which became the USSR), Austro-Hungarian Empire (which fell apart), within France (the mutiny which almost destroyed French army), ultimately the German Empire which ended ended with the abdication of the Kaiser and the end of the war.<br><br>The German soldiers on the Western front were crushed on the battlefield not by insurgency. 40 of Germany's best divisions were wiped out and a hole blown in the German lines @ Sedan by a gigantic American army, the largest the US has ever put onto a battlefield. It was successful because the Americans had an excellent logistic system that relied on motor trucks instead of porters or horse-drawn wagons to move supplies. The big problem for the Americans was not the German army but traffic jams. The British were exhausted, they were desperate to sign the Armistice before the German political enterprise was totally crushed (as Gen Pershing demanded). British political blunder led to the German 'stabbed in the back' conspiracy theory that led thence to the Freikorps and Stahlhelm groups then NSDAP. <br><br>Victory in world War II was consequence of mechanized, hierarchic, centralized forms (including massive naval invasions forces and atomic bombs dropped from high-tech bombers). Insurgencies were irrelevant to outcome<br><br>Our current, literally casualty-free (our side) wars are far superior to the alternatives. It is the low cost that makes them so easy to engage in. There is a pittance in casualties, some credit costs which are paper debts that will never be repaid. What terminates these wars is changes in domestic US politics rather than defeat at the hands of an insurgency. <br><br>Automobiles in the US have killed more Americans than all US wars put together. Simply outrageous!<br><br>The failures of US and others since WWII haven't been on the battlefield instead have been political self-immolation. US war in Vietnam ended when Congress pulled the funding plug due to political demands from constituents upset over increased consumer prices. The war itself ended on battlefield as PAVN tanks and artillery overcame ARVN tanks and artillery -- and aircraft -- in pitched battles on conventional battlefields.<br><br>Afterward, the old Viet Cong complained that they were left out of the political process. Some of them became boat people. <br><br>In Vietnam and elsewhere, the 'man on the street corner' was ahead of the government decision makers as to whether to continue to prosecute pointless and expensive wars. Political pressure -- or its absence -- is what determines force status in these theaters, not the (in)effectiveness of various insurgencies. BTW: insurgencies in these areas have been short-circuited repeatedly by bales of US$100 bills. <br><br>Not to say the US 'style' of energy gobbling warfare-for-fun has a future, it doesn't ... the problem is war waged for the benefits of big business and establishment without a strategic gain. Anyone waiting for a US military defeat due to inappropriate doctrine you will have a long wait: the world will end first.<br><br>:) <br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c7829998856250189020 title="comment permalink">8/30/12, 1:19 PM</a><br><br>

How many other nations have considered the Swiss strategy, not as a permanent state of affairs, but as something that can be put into place in a matter of six months or a year prior to hostilities? <br><br>Renaissance, of course there are other things that can generate insurgencies -- my point is that blitzkrieg tends to produce them much more reliably. You cited Napoleon in Spain -- how many other countries that he conquered (and he conquered quite a few) did the same thing?

The Army still has AAA/ADA (anti aircraft artillery / air defense artillery) units, but they're something of a joke within the Army because we've been able to assume American air superiority for decades. When the skies are no longer American-controlled, our ground forces will find they have a much harder time of it. Libyan air defenses clearly posed no threat, but one wonders whether Bashar Assad has avoided the fate of Gaddafi by prudently investing in more serious air defense systems. If there really are a lot of Libyan MANPADS (man-portable air defense systems) around, the cost of war - and its difficulty - may go up for America; if someone finds a way of cheaply downing high-altitude drones, bombers, and cruise missiles, it will go up still more.<br><br><a href=#c5551578207398575056 title="comment permalink">8/30/12, 4:50 PM</a><br><br>

But I would definitely say that the entities that focus in fast and efficient warfare are more prone to forget about how to deal with a ocupation aftermath, simply because in their view that is not part of the war, unlike it happens with the "slow" war where you need to ocupy vast swats of the enemy territory <i>during</i> the war and will obviously be very tempted to extract as much of resources out of it as the local population allows without the oportunity cost going skyhigh.<br><br>Besides ,you must add that, unlike a fast warfare ( with all the quirks that Mr Greer described ), in a slow war you will see the enemy often and they will stay a lot of time in the same place ( it is a slow war, after all :D ). And like humans can get accostumed with almost everything if the transition is gradual enough, that will allow the enemy troops to get social connections with the inhabitants of the occupied land in a far more solid way than after a fast war when they appeard suddently and sat on the mayor's chair ... <br><br>To end ,and as a post script, on the horse warfare ( vs bike ): people in that kind of discussions tend to forget that horses need to eat, and more, that they eat a very low energy density food that only grows in satisfactory ammounts in 2 discountinuous belts around the globe and only during a certain time of the year. This means that even a XVIII century tytpical cav division would need a serious ammount of infrastructure behind and that you would need fossil fuels to get anything bigger than that in a permanent basis ( just for reference, the biggest ammount of cavalry divisions in a army belongs to pre-WW I Russia, 25 div to be exact ... and they could not be fully deployed because simply moving them and the food for the horses to the front lines would make the Russian transport network ( that included coal powered trains, remember ) to collapse ). OFC you can have big cav armies if you disperse during most of the time and only gather for the war ( like in medieval ages ) and/or if you go nomad ( the mongols ), but even then there is a huge effort required to maintaining a battle horse and you pretty much have to reroute all the society to work fulltime to keep a cav army...<br><br>In other words, I think that besides some exceptions, cavs will be kept as a special weapon but that the bulk of the the work will be done by humans ( they have to go to the battlefield after all, because no one surrenders to planes or horses ;) ), wiht or without bikes or any other kind of mechanical help.

We are the only surviving hominid, but there were many branches. When species become too specialized in a changing environment, they become susceptible to extinction. Better to be a generalist.

But clearly tyres and tubes will require some level of industry and trade to produce. The major problem I can see with building bikes in a totally deindustrialised society will be ball bearings which I doubt can be made by hand in a workshop.<br><br>However it takes a relatively low level of industrial technology to build bikes, it takes a relatively small amount of resources to build and maintain them, the kind of bikes the Dutch build last for 100 years and they are the ultimate force multipler of human power. Broken bikes can also be stripped for spare parts. If all goes totally pear shaped and we end up back in the dark ages there will be no bikes, we will be back on foot. It might happen, who knows, but that is a real worst case scenario.<br><br>One of the few thing we have going for us right now is that we have vast amounts of human power.

If we take that line as the boundary, or even a line 500 miles west of the Urals, then at no time since the 13th century has Europe ever been "free of Muslims." There has been (and still is) a Tatar Muslim presence in Belorus and Poland. <br><br>The Balkans, too, belong to Europe. There Bosnia, sitting as it does athwart the boundary between the Catholic and the Orthodox halves of Europe, but not a natural part of either, used to adhere to a heretical, dualist form of Christianity. This had made them very much a target for conversion at the point of a sword by all their Catholic and Orthodox neighbors. When the Ottoman Turks (who, of course, were Muslim) conquered the Balkans in the 14th century, most Bosnians -- in sharp contrast to all the other Balkan Slavic peoples -- eagerly became Muslim. This gave them a huge political and military advantage over their Catholic and Orthodox neighbors. So there have been very many Muslim Slavs in the Balkans for some 600 years now. <br><br>Also, the Albanians (who are not Slavs) became largely Muslim about the same time.<br><br>Here in the United States, there is a strong tendency to think that everything east of Germany and Italy is not Europe at all.

The nitric coumpounds are the tricky part, since you need sulfuric acid to make nitric acid out of nitrates ( being nitric acid a very strong acid, you need a even stronger one to make it ) and, irony of the ironies, <i>you need sulfuric acid to make sulfuric acid out of sulfur</i>, atleast in a usable form ( that is relatively well kept secret ... even the typical high school chemistry books lie blantantly on this part, when they say you only need to mix sulfur trioxide with water to make sulfuric acid. If you try to do that you will get a Venus-like sulfuric acid mist that take ages to settle down, a very nasty situation if you have not made the reaction in a closed vat and pretty annoying if you had the sense of doing it ( since you will need days ( or even weeks ) to let it settle ... I don't want to say much, but the real route to get sulfuric acid out of sulfur trioxide needs sulfuric acid as a catalist :D ). More, you need to mix sulfuric acid with the nitric acid to nitrate stuff ( makes the reaction far faster and more complete ). And all of what I did was made with acess to relatively pure nitrates and sulfur ( I can easily do nitrates out of ashes ... it is not the hardest thing of the world to do a couple of recristalization cycles. Making sulfur is another game, though ), but the energy requirements are not that high as that if you do don't go to the tons area ( in fact a lot of the reactions in the cycle are exotermic making that you will need to cool stuff down instead of getting it hot ) <br><br>On the conservation issues, well, nitroglycerin is highly unstable and does not age well. Nitrocellulose OTOH can actually be kept in somewhat good conditions for quite a time if you know some tricks to avoid it getting "wet" ( basically the same you need for gunpowder ... my favourite is to put some uncooked rice near it. Rice is highly hygroscopic ( especially if in powder ) as well and will compete for moisture with the nitrocellulose ) .<br><br>Well, in resume, in spite of being extremely possible that some people "in the know" being able to do the necessary stuff ( the fulminates, the primers and the smokeless powder ), the relative difficulty of getting sulfur ( and mercury ) added to the sheer ammount of "tricks" you need to know for the whole process ( I am pretty sure that even 95% of the people with a Chemistry degree nowadays would not be able to do nitrocellulose if you gave them sulfur, a generic nitrate ( or even air, since you can make nitrates out of thin air ... if you know even more tricks, have a heating source and pure copper in hand. But you need sulfur for that as well :D ) and cotton, due ot the sheer ammount of little quirks the reaction path has ) would make the explosive and munition business something that only very wealthy people or states could finance ( and would probably force out a new "alchemist" age ) ... as it actually was the case before the XVIII century. And to be honest, I'm seeing this going back to good ol'gunpowder, that is relatively easy to do from really raws materials ( not the todays highly refined "start" reagents ) compared with the nitro and fulminate stuff ...<br><br><a href=#c1337832403468380260 title="comment permalink">9/1/12, 5:29 AM</a><br><br>

People tend to forget that in our timeline the gunpowder weapons only gone handheld in the XVI century, exactly at the time when new knowledge on hard metal leagues was being acheived in Central Europe ( another son of that development is the printing press ;) ) and to get automatic weapons you need even more refined smelting knowledge and more exotic adds to you steel ( because automatic weapons can't be fed by the mouth you need extra strong metal in the back ... ). And, as as anyone that knows about Mao's great leaps to somewhere not the front, household metal furnaces are simply inneficent and gigantism is highly rewarded. This would probably mean that below a certain level of society complexeness and of fuel avaliability ( furnaces really need big ammounts of fuel, no matter what fuel you use ), it would be more economical to "degrade" to non auto weapons, then non striated weapons ( those also need strong metal leagues ), then front charging muskets, then handheld small cannons, then bombards, then ( if the thing goes back as much as that ) fuse grenades. I can't give you numbers since metalworking is far from speciality, but I think the basic scheme of things is this one leading that if you're ( as a private citizen ) relying in automatic weapons to stop cavs, you will be in the short side of the stick as soon as the private great ovens bankrupt due to fuel costs ( and we already passed that point a decade or two ago :p )<br><br>Anyway on cav warfare, to stop them you only need one of the below: a wall of sharp things ( or a actual wall, like the sandbag walls WW I style or the medieval <i>abbatis</i> ) or enough projectiles per second to make sure they die before they reach you. Both of them can be arranged ( and were historically arranged ) without gunpowder as soon as you can do enough pikes and bows ( or beasts ). In fact, historically gunpowder even gave new life to non-archer cav warfare, because it forced the early musket armies to from static lines ( that could easily be flanked ) or <i>tercios</i> ( that , due to their compactness , were ripe targets for a well aimed frag or limestone cannon shot ), because charging cav warfare was pretty much dead after the string of defeats that charging knights had across Europe from Portugal to Scotland and Russia in the XIV century by varying combinations of pike and shooting troops....<br><br><a href=#c6303488209974926275 title="comment permalink">9/1/12, 6:14 AM</a><br><br>

Yeah, there were some deficiencies in generation capacity over winter there for sure.<br><br>Anyway, I set the challenge to power this place purely on solar PV alone for a full year. There's been a lot of tweaking to the system to max out the PV solar generation potential since then.<br><br>Well, just to keep you and the readers here updated, the results are now in and I failed, but only just! I've had to resort to using a generator to get some charge into the batteries on 25 occasions for the full calendar year. Each occasion uses about 2 litres of petrol which in total is about 50 litres (13.15 US gallons). Not bad and it is a significant improvement on the prior year.<br><br>The problem is really that the sun is low in the sky for 3 weeks either side of the winter solstice (21st June) and if it is rainy and/or misty during this period then the system doesn't cut the mustard at all. There were also a couple of 5 day stretches of rainy/misty weather during this period. It can be very humid here over winter (usually &gt;90% relative humidity). High humidity reduces the available sunlight, but also keeps the temperatures fairly mild.<br><br>So, another source of renewable energy is required and next season I'll add a wind turbine or two which might just make the final difference.<br><br>You said long ago that it takes a long while and a lot of experience to be able to establish and survive on "alternative systems" and I can only concur with this view. It has been hard all the way and the system itself only has a lifespan of between 20 and 50 years.<br><br>Still, if it was to all pack it in tomorrow, I'd get up with the sun and go to bed with the dusk. The house would still be the same. It all seems to me like a good excuse to get some extra sleep over winter.<br><br>PS: I'm going to try and sell some of my surplus produce at the local farmers market over the next month or so. Should be fun and interesting! If anyone is in the area, I'll drop a comment here with the time, location and date and we can say hello. A discount may apply for ADR readers too!<br><br>PPS: I hope that your Autumn is gentler than your summer has been and that your produce is bountiful during this time. Autumn has a growth spurt here just like Spring, so I assume that it is the same thing over your way?<br><br>PPPS: Enjoy your well deserved break!<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c4181855717765999856 title="comment permalink">9/2/12, 2:36 AM</a><br><br>

There is no need to think about Mad Max fantasy, just look at the Japanese in the Second World War. Or look up bicycle infantry in Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_infantry. This is not Hollywood fantasy, it’s history.<br><br>Odin's Raven is right the big advantage of horses is that they can provide food (blood and meat) for an army. Their big disadvantages is that they are incredibly expensive in time and resources and much slower than bicycles. No doubt the horse will have a role in future war, but if humans can still make bicycles, the cheapness and speed of the bicycle will trump the horse in many roles.<br><br>In some future world horse armies may again dominate the Eurasian Steppes, as Odin's Raven points out a horse army could feed itself on the steppes. But if a future world still has bicycles, a horse army that moved off the steppes would loose the traditional advantage of a nomadic horse army, a bicycle mounted army could easily catch up with a horse army and bring it to battle.<br><br>The single greatest advantage of bicycles in such a scenario, is that between wars they could be stores in sheds at zero cost. The horse and the bicycle have the same advantage they give people much greater mobility than they would have on foot. But the bicycle gives much greater mobility than the horse and does so at a fraction of the cost.<br><br><a href=#c2430285088594142923 title="comment permalink">9/3/12, 3:11 AM</a><br><br>

You put into words things I have thought about for a long time, after reading books like In The Absence of the Sacred, Where the Wasteland Ends, Starhawk's The Fifth Sacred Thing and the Ecotopia books. Your approach is so level headed it's scary. And I think the scenario you lay out for the future of Industrial Civilization is spot on. What you talk about is scary, but you know the old saying about life, sometimes it can be a bitch. The only thing we can do is try our best to do the right thing, and provide for our family and try to ensure those future generations get their proper due.<br>There is a brighter side to all of this. I have always felt that Industrial Civilization has an air of unreality to those of us who's sympathies lie with living a more balanced and spiritual and honest life and taking future generations and the other inhabitants we share this planet with into our consideration. It will be a good thing for humanity to return to balance with nature.<br>I got into an argument with someone who denies Peak Oil is a problem, he claimed that there is more than enough oil to last for centuries, and I said to him "Gods I hope you are wrong.

My guess is that black powder will become the fallback technology, the thing that any future society can manage, and societies that cycle upwards into greater complexity will do more complex things. <br><br>Sooper, granted, but industrialism is not just another word for relatively complex manufacture -- it's a specific way of managing the production of goods, relying on economies of scale and nonhuman energy sources. Still, I avoid "post-industrial" because of its previous uses; the term you'll mostly find here is "deindustrial." <br><br>Raven, the fact that archery takes years of practice, and musketry can be learned in a few months, is one of the two main reasons why muskets replaced bows; it's just that much easier to replace troop losses and expand an army in a hurry. The other? The fact that once you have guns, armor is a waste of time. Both those will remain true, so I wouldn't get too excited about a neofeudal future. <br><br>Kieran, thanks for the links!

The Great Plains here in the US are at least as well suited to horse nomads as the Eurasian steppes, so you have the nomadic raiders of D'kotah up against a kingdom centered in the Ohio valley, let's say, with bicycle dragoons pedaling hard to get to the outpost-city of Meeyaplis...<br><br>Jason, if other readers want to post links to their blog here, to provide reading for September, I won't object. <br><br>Rob, I've been intrigued by that.

On the other hand, a horse may be of more assistance in crossing a deep or flooded river. It's been known for cavalry to line a river to make it easier for infantry to cross in their lee, but I can't imagine bicycles doing that.<br><br>Apart from the nomads, cavalry was usually only a small part of most armies, albeit often the decisive part. Horses also had other important functions such as transport and pulling guns. I don't think bicycles could replace them in hauling heavy weights.<br><br>There's also the moral effect. It took well trained steady infantry to withstand a cavalry charge, and once the infantry was seem to be wavering the horsemen could probably sweep them away and perhaps start a panic in adjacent units. Bicycles could hardly emulate the terrifying and literally earthshaking effect of a cavalry charge.<br><br>The Man on Horseback has long been an emblem of power and authority, capable of inspiring awe and fear. If horses are available, generals and rulers will prefer to ride them rather than bicycles when horseless carriages are no longer available. Even nowadays rulers are only seen on bicycles when they want to give an impression of affable informality, of being one of the common people. Bicycles just don't add dignity to a public image.<br><br>Of course if bicycles come to more prominence in warfare we may speculate on further possibilities. Mayhap there could be bicycle chariots, pedaled furiously by charioteers who might feel the lack of the performance enhancing drugs consumed by modern cycling champions.

Which one is used depends entirely on the relative ability of various techs (gunsmithing, bunpowder chemistry, metallurgy etc).

Hot humid weather is particularly uncomfortable. I'm surprised that this is the case for you that far North in the US. I assume that you have a mountain range to the west of you that traps in the humidity from the eastern ocean and deprives the central plains of rain?<br><br>I have Scottish ancestors on both sides (one highland and the other lowland) and always prefer the cooler mountain climate that is prevalent here.

No question, nonviolence is pretty hopeless when it's someone like Stalin holding the cards, but in most cases nonviolence's success relied on people in power resorting to violence rather than avoiding it. <br><br>In both India and the U.S., violent assault on nonviolent protesters is what gave the movement teeth, because it effectively shamed the violent in front of people who were horrified with the violence and could exert political pressure on the violent.<br><br>That triangular dynamic is important and, in places like Stalin's Russia, entirely absent. If the people taking a beating have no political allies, well, it's just suicide. Contrariwise, if the people in power just don't beat people in public, it's also politically weak.<br><br>It surely helped that in both India and the U.S., violence was looming if compromises couldn't be made. That was sort of the hammer to the nonviolent anvil.<br><br>So many of those first wave nonviolent protesters aspired to something like military discipline--they trained to take a beating. That kind of stoicism makes a serious impression. <br><br>(This sort of thing makes a nice sort of checklist why contemporary 'nonviolent' protest has had so little impact, too. Almost none of the conditions for its success are in place. Nonviolence, though has almost become a cargo cult for some--perform the actions, you'll get the result, right?

The fact that guns will likely be the basic weapon of choice from here on simply settles one variable; the others are still wide open. <br><br>Cherokee, warm and humid is standard summer weather from the Great Plains straight across to the Atlantic. You get warm steamy air coming up from the Gulf of Mexico, which is basically one big sauna, and it gets caught by the prevailing westerlies and pushed across the rest of the continent. Up here in the mountains, things are much less brutal than lower down (or further south), but 90 degrees F. and 90% humidity is pretty common in July. <br><br>Johan, thank you! Firepower, protection and mobility make a nice set of basic principles; the one thing I'd add to the mix is complexity -- Tainter's analysis of the risks of too much complexity has a great deal of relevance in a military setting. <br><br>Quos Ego, I'd love to read that thesis! Wouldn't be too hard to ground it theoretically, either, since there's been a lot of work done on the sociology of deviance and the internal politics of groups that have been labeled deviant by the wider society. I drew extensively on that work for my forthcoming book on the psychology of peak oil. (Have I mentioned that project here? I don't happen to remember.) <br><br>Irish, that's interesting, but you're getting perilously close at this point to -- I trust you'll pardon the pun -- beating a dead horse.

Still, I suspect those who have reason to hate the United States will take a more active role in its downfall. <br><br>Ian, granted. You have to have someone in power who will be seriously embarrassed by violence against a nonviolent minority. That's the reason the Civil Rights movement succeeded -- every time Southern whites beat the crap out of black protesters who were sitting there and singing hymns, the Soviet Union got handed a massive propaganda advantage in the Third World; that's what drove a series of Cold War presidents to send in the troops. Lacking that, the movement would have been targeted for mass lynchings and annihilated. <br><br>Fabrice, thanks for the link!<br><br>Glenn, I'd point out that it takes a much more advanced technological infrastructure to produce body armor that will stop bullets than it takes to produce bullets. Helmets came back in to protect against shrapnel from heavy artillery fire, not against rifles -- that's why it became universal in the First World War. I'll talk more about the implications of a future without body armor in an upcoming post -- it's a hugely important issue, much more so than most people realize.<br><br><a href=#c2504055169496996503 title="comment permalink">9/4/12, 10:09 AM</a><br><br>

I’m glad you are taking a needed break! <br><br>I have found it ironic that sometimes people who are vehemently critical of the US war machine (or for that matter, corporate power and empire in general) simultaneously assert the myth of its omnipotence and invincibility. Sometimes I find that the rhetoric goes something like this: “The corporate-controlled US empire’s capacity for destruction will go on forever and destroy everything it can unless it is stopped NOW by us.” (As if both non-human and other human forces aren’t also major factors with the potential to limit its power, at least when looking through a longer-term frame of time).<br><br>Similarly, I sometimes find that the rhetoric of those who oppose unsustainable aspects of society actually reinforce a belief in its permanence, by essentially warning, “If “we” don’t stop this unsustainable societal path, it will continue and continue.”<br><br>I sometimes joke that if you don’t like an unsustainable culture, there is at least one wonderful thing about an unsustainable culture, and it’s precisely that: its unsustainability. At least you can count on that what you are critical of won’t continue indefinitely. Though perhaps only a small solace, because a lot of damage can certainly be done in the short-term, and even most of us here on this blog can admit to enjoying certain unsustainable aspects of society. <br><br><br><a href=#c6797719018402027756 title="comment permalink">9/4/12, 4:58 PM</a><br><br>

A mixture of trucks and bicycles were employed by the Germans and the Japanese in the opening phases of WWII in light of this observation, and future armies basing their mobility on the technical will do likewise.<br><br>Technicals have the limitation of requiring a relatively hard surface in order to function. The desert plains of Northern Chad were suitable for this kind of effort. The technical would be useful on similar open terrain, or on semi-decent dirt roads where the open terrain is unsuitable. Denial of this operating requirement is key to a defense against technicals by robbing them of their speed and manuverability.<br><br>The enemy of the technical on roads is either the IED or another technical. <br><br>A region seeking to make itself unattractive to neighbors fielding technicals would behoove itself to be well learned in the art of IED manufacture and placement, as well as making access to suitable offroading terrain as difficult as possible, as well as denying supplies of fuel. <br><br>Mountainous regions are particularly well suited for this kind of defense. <br><br>Given some forewarning, locals inhabiting the region can do their bit by simply neglecting the maintenence of their local dirt roads (which deteriorate at an alarming pace, especially after a season or two of rain), and forcing anyone passing through to drive with great and slow care through stretches of potholes and narrows, facilitating ambushes and other attacks.<br><br>Powerplants of technicals depend on what is available, but ideally, I think a diesel-electric powerplant would provide a balance between mobile and static needs, as well as a 'retirement plan' for technicals too worn out to be used as battle wagons, yet are capable of being used as a semi-mobile source of electricity and perhaps mechanical power.<br><br>The need for communications gear will probably eat up the last semi-conductor production. I expect to see a dwindling number of lightweight yet "black box" radios, coupled with a small and slowly growing number of more servicible vacuum tube radios, their deployment limited by their power supply needs, a dedicated cranked dynamo or a supply train of heavy batteries that are somewhat recharged from a technical's alternator.<br><br><a href=#c6259583644473953169 title="comment permalink">9/5/12, 8:45 AM</a><br><br>

Ya never really know until you try!<br><br>I had a brief comment about the nonviolence thread... during the first Gulf War, Sojourner magazine published a well-written <a href=http://sojo.net/magazine/2002/09/weapons-will rel=nofollow>piece about how the then-'threat' of Iraq could be solved with committed nonviolence</a> on the part of the Iraqi people. They made what I thought was an excellent point that even the most bloodthirsty dictator <b><i>wants</i></b> certain things from his population, including economic productivity and obedience. If larger and larger numbers of citizens resist nonviolently, you get into a situation where more and more soldiers, police and government bureaucrats find themselves on the verge of punishing their own brothers, sisters and mothers, and more and more of those enforcers are eventually going to balk. When the average people (who go along with the dictator's will because it's easier), finally decide to deny him their co-operation, the dictator and his regime lose their power. This is basically what happened in East Germany, from what I heard when I was living in Europe. <br><br>The East German socialist party leaders were on the verge of ordering a Tiennanmen-square-style massacre of students protesting for freedom in East Berlin universities. But the soldiers who were going to be ordered to carry it out, as well as some of the Party officials, got wind of the decision in the offing and simply said "we're not going to do this, those are our brothers and sons and daughters." And then the Berlin Wall fell, and then the Soviet Union fell.<br><br>So this falls into the category, as JMG says, that nonviolence only works when there are political allies who can be appealed to. But I thought it was worth clarifying that the political allies can be the average citizens spread throughout the entire population -- not <b><i>only</i></b> some other leader or political party or sector of the country. If a nonviolent protest causes, for example, average soldiers to ignore orders, or average citizens to become tax resisters perhaps, then it may become effective even without a distinct "ally" to point to. Just the average citizens spread throughout the country; even the small cogs in the great wheel can gum up the works if enough of them decide to.<br><br><a href=#c3118124020289269152 title="comment permalink">9/5/12, 9:57 AM</a><br><br>

They can be made of a very large number of materials. Wikipedia has an entry: 'Ball_bearing'. Manufacture of a ball bearing is also found under the name: 'Ball_(bearing)'.<br><br>But bearing science isn't limited to balls alone. In a strictly literal sense bearing technology is as old as the pyramids. Bearings don't have to be ball shaped as seen in another wiki entry: 'Rolling-element bearing'. They don't even have to involve more than two(rolling) elements, as in plain(or plane) bearings, wiki: 'Plain bearing'. The German engine manufacturer Daimler-Benz used plain bearings in their V-12's during WWII, though there is some criticism that this was an open admission of the inability of German industry to make good ball or roller bearings, the lack didn't stop DB from making good engines that did the job expected of them.<br><br>De-industrialization will certainly crimp, at a minimum, ball bearing manufacture, but it won't much impact the use of bearing technology in most applications that need it.

The major issue as I see it is you all are discussing this topic without expanding the framework of warfare.<br> Warfare is separated into 3 distinct levels each with its own relevance and level of responsibility and national buy in.<br>Strategic warfare: National Political and Military objectives where the decisions on resources allocation and funding are decided. How much time, money, people and effort are we putting into this war and is it worthwhile for the nation. What weapons do we make and in what quantity. That’s the decisions what we pay our politicians, Very Senior Military and Public Service leaders to make. History decides if they make the right decision or not.<br>Operational Art: How the Military uses the resources allocated to the theatre of operations to achieve the strategic objectives by planning and co-ordinating multiple and sequential tactical battles.<br>Tactics: Force through the use of weapons to impose your will on the enemy by killing or incapacitating them.<br>In Tactics the use of force comes down to combined-arms where each weapons system has its own advantages and disadvantages. I my opinion it is like the game rocks, paper, scissors. This is where a military corp such as infantry, armour (cavalry) and artillery have advantages and disadvantages depending on the terrain and weather.<br>Manoeuvre warfare is the art of getting your weapons system into a position where it can do the most damage to the enemy with the least cost to you. Your scissor against the enemies’ paper.<br>The fundamental questions in tactical warfare are:<br> What do you know what your enemy is up to and where are they?<br>How do you get into the enemy commanders decision making cycle so he responds to your moves.<br>The talk about destroying an aircraft carrier by an ICBM is all well and good. Carriers have always been vulnerable to dive-bombing attack. See Midway. The trick is to find the target and there is a lot of space in an Ocean to be searched. If you can see it, you can hit it, you can kill it. The trick is not to be seen in the first place. In a carrier battle group the weapon is not the aircraft carrier it is the aircraft and the missiles on the escort ships. Taking out the Chinese Reconnaissance Satellites is Priority number 1 on Day 1 Minute 1 of any war.<br>The F-35 aircraft is a design by committee to be too many things for too many people on the one airframe so instead of a pure breed Arabian Stallion you are ending up with a camel. It is also being designed as a peace time weapon which will have a service life of up to 30-40-50 years and see generations of aircrew fly and support it. A war time weapon is designed to be cheap, effective where is absolutely has to be and easy to use by many people with limited training and time. <br>Another Military Saying is “Quantity has a quality of its own” and I would like to expand it with “It is the sum of quantity and quality that makes the difference”.<br>From my research I agree with you that the downward spiral after peak oil will be long and bumpy. MHO as human kind we will not completely de-industrialise, at least not for a few thousand years anyway.<br>Thanks for all your articles and thoughts.<br><br><br><a href=#c7258008221583317182 title="comment permalink">9/7/12, 6:56 PM</a><br><br>
