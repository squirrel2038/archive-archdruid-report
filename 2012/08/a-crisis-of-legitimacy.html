<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Over the last week or two, the peak oil scene has been going through another round of its ongoing flirtation with fantasies of overnight collapse. This time the trigger was a recent paper by David Korowicz of Feasta, which I discussed <a href=../../2012/07/on-far-side-of-denial.html>a few weeks back</a> and which you can download in PDF format <a href=http://www.feasta.org/wp-contenrt/uploads/2012/06/Trade-Off1.pdf>here</a>.
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">As I mentioned in that earlier post, it’s a well-written study, limited only by a few frankly unrealistic assumptions about how governments tend to react when faced with an immediate threat to national survival, and Korowicz detailed his presuppositions clearly enough that a thoughtful reader can easily bracket the improbable parts of the study and extract the very real value to be found elsewhere in it. Korowicz is quite correct in suggesting that the current global financial system is a house of cards that could easily come crashing to the ground, taking a quadrillion dollars or so of imaginary wealth with it and dealing the world’s industrial societies a staggering blow. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">It’s purely his suggestion that this could cause the global economy to freeze up, not for weeks, but for years or even longer, that strays out of the realm of realism into territory mapped out well in advance by Western civilization’s penchant for apocalyptic fantasies.  In the real world, of course, governments facing sudden financial collapse don’t just sit on their hands and make plaintive sounds; they take action, and there are plenty of actions they can take, since a financial collapse doesn’t actually make anything of value go away. Money, let us please remember, is not wealth; it’s a set of arbitrary tokens people in complex human societies use to manage the distribution of real wealth; if a monetary system breaks down, other ways can readily be jerry-rigged to keep real wealth moving. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Glance through the last century of economic history and you’ll find plenty of examples of governments responding to sudden financial crises with equally sudden, drastic measures that worked, at least in the short term—and while it’s always popular to say "It’s different this time," I hope my readers recall how often, and inaccurately, these same words get used in the not unrelated field of speculative bubbles.  The parallel’s not inappropriate, since the believer in the latest speculative delusion uses those words to convince himself that he doesn’t have to put up with the common but unwelcome experience of having to work hard to become wealthy. In the same way, I suspect, much of the popularity of fast-collapse scenarios come from the fact that many people want to convince themselves that they don’t have to put up with the common but unwelcome experience of the decline and fall of a civilization.  The temptation to get it over with, or at least to daydream about getting it over with, is a strong one. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">I mention all this again because the theme of this week’s post centers on another kind of sudden disruption that occurs tolerably often in history, one that we’re probably going to see repeated in the not too distant future here in the US and elsewhere. Just as financial systems routinely come unglued, so do political systems; in both cases, though it takes years of mismanagement to build to the point of crisis, the crisis itself can hit suddenly and bring shattering change in a very short time; in both cases, in turn, the aftermath involves substantial losses, a great deal of frantic jerry-rigging and damage control, and then a return to a new normal that often has little in common with what the old normal used to be. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Political power’s a remarkable thing. Though Mao Zedong was quite correct to point out that it grows out of the barrel of a gun, it has to be transplanted into more fertile soil in short order or it will soon wither and die. A successful political system of any kind quickly establishes, in the minds of the people it rules, a set of beliefs and attitudes that define the political system as the normal, appropriate, and acceptable form of government for that people.  That sense of legitimacy is the foundation on which any enduring government must build, for when people see their government as legitimate, no matter how appalling it appears to outsiders, they will far more often than not put up with its excesses and follow its orders. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">It probably needs to be said here that legitimacy is not a rational matter and has nothing to do with morality or competence; great nations all through history have calmly accepted the legitimacy of governments run by thieves, tyrants, madmen and fools. Still, a government that has long held popular legitimacy can still lose it, and can do so in a remarkably short time.  Those of my readers who are old enough to have watched the collapse of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact satellites will recall the speed with which the rulers of several Communist nations saw the entire apparatus of their government dissolve around them as the people they claimed the right to rule stopped cooperating. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Now of course that sudden collapse of legitimacy was long in preparing. Just as a singer or writer who becomes an overnight success normally gets there after many years of hard work, the implosion of a system of government normally follows many years of bad decisions and unheard warnings, and it’s not too hard in retrospect to trace how simmering unrest eventually rose to a full boil; still, the benefits of hindsight can be misleading, because it’s actually quite rare for anyone to catch on to what’s building in advance.  As the famous Affair of the Diamond Necklace dragged the prestige of the French monarchy in the mud, Talleyrand commented to a friend, "Pay attention to this wretched necklace-affair; I should not be in the least surprised if it overturns the throne"—but then Talleyrand was one of the supreme political observers of the age; to most others in France in 1784, it was just one more tawdry royal scandal in a country that had seen plenty of them already. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">We have seen plenty of equally tawdry scandals in the United States of late, and it’s easy to ignore the impact of, let’s say, the Obama administration’s systematic refusal to bring charges against any of the financiers whose spectacularly blatant acts of fraud helped fuel, and then pop, the recent housing bubble. Still, I’ve come to think that a modern Talleyrand might see things differently. Had Obama acted otherwise, the Democratic party would likely have come to dominate the American political scene for the next forty years as thoroughly as it did for the four decades or so after 1932; instead, by giving the country a remarkably good imitation of the third term of George W. Bush, the Obama administration has convinced a sizable fraction of Americans that they have nothing to hope for from either party.  It’s symptomatic that a recent Rasmussen poll found that only 17% of respondents thought that a choice between Obama and Romney for president represented the best that America could do. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">It’s all too common for the political class of a troubled nation to lose track of the fact that, after all, its power depends on the willingness of a great many people outside the political class to do what they’re told. In Paris in 1789, in St. Petersburg in 1917, and in a great many other places and times, the people who thought that they held the levers of power and repression discovered to their shock that the only power they actually had was the power to issue orders, and those who were supposed to carry those orders out could, when matters came to a head, decide that their own interests lay elsewhere.  In today’s America, equally, it’s not the crisply dressed executives, politicians, and bureaucrats who currently hold power who would be in a position to enforce that power in a crisis; it’s the hundreds of thousands of soldiers, police officers and Homeland Security personnel, who are by and large poorly paid, poorly treated, and poorly equipped, and who have not necessarily been given convincing reasons to support the interests of a political class that most of them privately despise, against the interests of the classes to which they themselves belong. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Such doubts and dissatisfactions can build for a long time before the crisis hits. If history shows anything, it’s that trying to time that crisis is very nearly a guarantee of failure.  Sooner or later, once the system’s legitimacy becomes sufficiently doubtful, some event dramatic enough to seize the collective imagination will trigger the final collapse of legitimacy and the implosion of the system, but what that event will be and when it will come is impossible to know in advance.  Not even Talleyrand seems to have guessed in advance that the calling of the Estates-General in 1789 would set off the final crisis of the monarchy whose collapse he accurately anticipated—but then who could have predicted the spur-of-the-moment improvisation that led representatives of the Third Estate to proclaim themselves a National Assembly, or the circumstances that sent a Paris mob running through the streets to storm the Bastille? </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">What follows the moment of crisis is a little less opaque to anticipation.  France in 1789 and Russia in 1917 were both politically centralized nations in which power was primarily exercised from the capital city, and revolutionary politicians and urban mobs in Paris and St. Petersburg respectively thus had an overwhelming impact on the course of events, and radical change there spread rapidly throughout the country, since there were no effective centers of power outside the core. In less centralized countries, control of the capital is less decisive; the seizure of power by Parliament and the London mob in 1641 in England bears close comparison with events in the two later revolutions, but when the rubble of the English Civil War finally stopped bouncing, the system that resulted was much closer to the one that had been in place before 1641 than, say, France after the revolution resembled the Ancien Régime; the survival of familiar modes of government in peripheral centers made it easier for those same modes to be restored once the revolutionary era was over. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">That degree of regional independence did not survive in England, but the European pattern of political geography, whereby the capital city of each nation-state normally becomes its political and cultural hub and its largest population center, did not catch on anything like so well in North America.  In the United States and Canada alike, the national capital and the largest population center are two different cities; in both nations, as well as Mexico, large regional divisions—states or provinces—maintain a prickly independence from the central government, and regional cultures remain a potent political force.  The United States is the most extreme example of the lot; Washington DC is for all practical purposes a modest regional center that just happens to share space with a national government meeting, and there is no place in the country where even the largest urban mob could have a decisive impact on the survival of the federal government. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">The complex historical processes that brought thirteen diverse colonies under a single federal system, furtthermore, left a great deal of power in the hands of the states. Very little of that power is used these days; repeated expansions of the originally very limited powers given to the national government have left most substantive issues in the hands of federal bureaucrats, and left the states little more to do than carrying out costly federal mandates at their own expense.  Still, the full framework of independent government—executive, legislative, and judicial—remains in place in each state; state governors retain the power to call up every adult citizen to serve in the state militia; and, finally and critically, the states have kept the constitutional power to bring the whole system to a screeching halt. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">You’ll find that power spelled out in Article V of the US Constitution. If two thirds of state legislatures call for a constitutional convention to amend the Constitution, the convention will happen; if three quarters of state legislatures vote to ratify any amendment to the Constitution passed by the convention, that amendment goes into effect. It’s that simple.  Congress has nothing to say about it; the President has nothing to say about it; the Supreme Court has nothing to say about it; the federal government is, at least in theory, stuck on the sidelines.  That power has never been used; the one time it was seriously attempted, in 1913, Congress forestalled the state legislatures by passing a constitutional amendment identical to the one for which the states were agitating, and submitting it to the state legislatures for ratification.  The power nonetheless remains in place, a bomb hardwired into the Constitution. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">What makes that bomb so explosive is that there are very nearly no limits to what a constitutional convention can do. The only thing the Constitution specifies is that no amendment can take away a state’s equal representation in the Senate.  Other than that, as long as two thirds of the states call for the convention and three quarters of the states ratify its actions, whatever comes out of it is the supreme law of the land. Everything is up for grabs; it would not be beyond the power of a constitutional convention, for example, to provide a legal means for states to withdraw peacefully from the Union, or even to repeal the Constitution and dissolve the Union altogether. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Had the leaders of the southern states in 1860 been less proud and more pragmatic, it’s entirely possible that they could have won their independence and spared themselves the catastrophe of the Civil War by some such measure as this. It’s eerily plausible to imagine Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi rising in the Senate that year to propose an amendment to provide for the peaceful dissolution of the Union, denouncing the radicals on both sides of the slavery issue who were pushing the nation toward civil war, and offering a peaceful separation of the states as the only workable solution to the problem that had dogged the nation for so long—and it’s by no means hard, at a time when most Americans still wanted to avoid war, to imagine such a proposal getting the votes it would need from Congress and the states to take effect. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Any further development of that speculation can be left to fans of alternate history.  Under most conditions, of course, no such proposal would ever be seriously made, much less accepted, but 1860 offers a trenchant reminder that under the pressure of irreconcilable conflict, the system of government we have in the United States can freeze up completely and make desperate measures the order of the day.  In 1860, the US government lost its legitimacy in a third of the country, and it took the 19th century’s bloodiest conflict to bring back the southern states to a grudging and incomplete obedience.  In the crisis of legitimacy that’s building in today’s America, a rising spiral of conflicts between regions also plays an important role, but this time the federal government can hardly count on the passionate loyalty it got a century and a half ago from the Northeast and the Midwest; in fact, it’s hard to think of any corner of the country where distrust and disaffection for the current government haven’t put down deep roots already. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">If and when the crisis comes, it’s anyone’s guess what exactly will happen, but the possibility that the states will call on their power to redefine the Constitution—whether they use it to reshape the national government, or to let the country split apart into smaller nations along regional lines—belongs somewhere on the list of potential outcomes.  For that matter, it’s anyone’s guess what will spark such a crisis, if in fact one does come.  The triggering event might well be political, or economic, or even environmental.  Still, if I had to make a guess, it would be that the most likely triggering event will be military. We’ll open that immense can of worms next week. </span></div>

<span style="font-size: large">End of the World of the Week #34</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">What could be more convincing, at least for believers in an imminent apocalypse, than eyewitness accounts of one of the most important details in the apocalyptic prophecy happening <i>right now</i>?  That’s the question devout Christians had to answer for themselves in the year 171 CE, when a priest named Montanus announced that the events prophesied in the Book of Revelation were taking place then and there.  "There," specifically, was Phrygia, in what is now part of Turkey; that’s where Montanus lived, and that’s where his followers repeatedly spotted nothing less than the New Jerusalem, hovering in the air above the modest Phrygian market town of Pepuza. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">The New Prophecy, as Montanus’ belief system was called at the time, became a nine days’ wonder in the early Christian church, and attracted a great many followers—notably women, who were being forced out of the positions of prominence they had held earlier on. Two women, Priscilla and Maximilla, who left their husbands to follow Montanus became prophets in their own right, and they and Montanus became known as "the Three"—a term with certain resonances in more recent apocalyptic movements.  Despite excommunication by the main body of the church, the Montanist movement remained active for at least four centuries, waiting for the New Jerusalem to finish its descent onto Pepuza—and if there are any Montanists left, of course, they’re still waiting. </span></div>

In looking at maps of the drought devastating such a large portion of the US, it’s not hard to imagine regional lines being redrawn according to climate change-induced disaster, with the as yet functioning portions of the country being forced to receive large numbers of the “internally displaced”. So while I am glad that states retain the right to go their own way should the occasion warrant it, I am not convinced that the very crisis which might inspire them to do so wouldn’t just bring the state apparatus crashing down anyway, just as it was finally poised to do something useful. <br><br>But then again, I don’t need convincing. I don’t share the common penchant for apocalyptic fantasy, and I love to consider various possible long descent scenarios. While I am doing that, I am quietly taking my admittedly meager tokens of real wealth out of the system and investing them in my neighbors, educating my kids without the assistance or input of the state, and trying to figure out a way to feed my livestock without Midwestern grain. A foot on the path towards not doing what I am told, perhaps? <br><br>I am always hopeful though (er, most of the time), and I appreciate the reminder about our constitutionally-guaranteed “out”. It will be fun to think about how such a scenario might play out. Perhaps mine own New York State, with its fair share of thieves, tyrants, madmen and fools—past and present-- would rise to the occasion. Stranger things have happened, right?!<br>Cheers,<br>Kathleen<br><br><a href=#c3148127003968583841 title="comment permalink">8/9/12, 7:15 PM</a><br><br>

See this article:<a href=http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/08/if-a-government-cant-tax-is-it-really-a-government/260811/ rel=nofollow> If a Government Can't Tax, Is It Really a Government?</a><br><br><i>Could Congress invalidate your state's constitution and demand it be rewritten?<br><br>The answer -- disconcertingly enough for those who regard the states as "sovereign," as against the federal government -- is almost certainly yes. It won't happen, of course. But last month, a related question emerged that may have more practical importance: Could a federal court do the same thing?<br><br>The clause that raises this question is called the Guaranty, or "Republican Form of Government," Clause of Article IV, § 4. It provides that "[t]he United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government . . . ." The clause, usually obscure, is relevant now because of a preliminary district court decision on July 30 in Kerr v. Hickenlooper, a case in which members of Colorado's legislature have gone to court to argue that the state's own constitution is unconstitutional.<br><br>The target is Colorado's so-called "Taxpayer's Bill of Rights," enacted by initiative in 1992, which essentially bars both the state and local governments from raising any tax without a prior approval by popular vote. The plaintiffs' complaint in Kerr contends that "[a]n effective legislative branch must have the power to raise and appropriate funds." Removing this power entirely, the argument goes, in essence leaves the state without a functioning legislature. In turn, a state without a legislature cannot have a "republican form of government."</i><br><br>This leads to the following scenario of slow collapse, which we're already seeing play out:<br><br>1.) The investor class, who are collecting ever more of the nation's wealth, buy their way out of paying taxes through campaign contributions and posing as "job creators"<br><br>2.) Taxes are shifted onto the back of the working classes who are becoming ever poorer (leading to less overall income). Unable to control their salaries, they try and gain back lost income through the only thing they can control - taxes.<br><br>3.) The middle class backs tax revolts sponsored by the investor class essentially stripping the government of the right to tax its citizens (in reality no one will vote for higher taxes).<br><br>4.) The middle class and the wealthy still expect and demand first-world government services, but there is no money to pay for it. Government issues debt to pay what it can't pay with taxes, however there is no way to pay back the debt plus interest.<br><br>5.) Government contracts. Job losses in the public sector counter gains in the private sector; poorly paid officials become corrupt. Infrastructure degrades and the corporate welfare the private sector depends on dries up, leading to economic depression, especially with rising energy prices.<br><br>6.) wash, rinse, repeat until utlimate bankruptcy and deligitimization of government.<br><br><a href=#c7886203722165627036 title="comment permalink">8/9/12, 7:45 PM</a><br><br>

The first commercial oilwells were drilled with steam power. Nations might look to their military for outward expressions of power, but armies can only fight with the energy sources available. Before the steam engine, gun barrels were hand made, with steam power came mass production. In the civil war the northern states had most of the industry and steam powered factories, and simply outproduced the southern states in weaponry. The nation was held together by force of arms, but that was backed up by superior factory output.<br>After the civil war, the power released from coal and oil drove the expansion of the nation and America became a web of highways, cities and transport systems built for a common prosperity of commerce and trade. But its critical factor was and still is the constant availability of endless supplies of cheap energy. More and more fuel must be burned to remain viable, the national crisis will come when energy flow stops, or becomes too expensive to use. At that point the government will lose control, America will cease to be and the nation will fall apart and collapse into autonomous regions, and subsequently into separate nations. Ethnic, theocratic and geographic borders are already in place, and the people are fully armed. As JMG points out, people will only follow government orders if they perceive them to be in their best interests, if not, they will become the instruments of separation.

At a point of the interview, the reporter does the praxis question of how Gorbatchev explained the demise of the USSR , most likely expecting a tried and tested canned response ( lack of liberty, economical mishaps, Afghanistan, Reagan Star wars ... just pick one )... infact I was also expecting it. But then he surprised me when he starts talking about the USSR 1924 constitution ...<br><br>Aparently Gorbatchev considered that, what really had made the USSR fall ( most likely he meant the proverbial last drop that makes the bucket spill out ) was the fact that all the USSR constitutions since the first had in clear and unambiguous text that ( quoting the last one ) "Each Union Republic shall retain the right to freely secede from the USSR. " ... and then in 1990 one of the Soviet republics ( Lithuania ) pressured for a legal framework for that article ( because there wasn't any ). The Supreme Soviet weaves out one ( Gorbatchev wasn't too specific at this point of the interview, but it was heavily hinted that the designed mechanism was made to put the smaller and more problematic republics ( especially the baltic ones ) still in the USSR orbit economically even if they politically seceded ... you might call it a Soviet EEC/EU ), and then it happens the unthinkable for the Gorbatchev administration and RUSSIA of all people decides to abandon the USSR. As the secession law was made under the unspoken assumption that Russia would be the one that would never leave ( and thus the economical and demographic weight of Russia would be used to keep the would-be seceders in USSR orbit even if they got out politically of the Union ), there was simply no way to avoid that the most powerful Soviet republic to leave without the USSR becoming a hollowed husk. Gorbatchev ended hinting that this was not, in his opinion, anyway inevitable and that was more the result of a series of acidental political manouvers that putted him and a young and ambitious Ieltsin in colision course ( not that I agree much with his opinion, but he has the distinct advantage of having been in the eye of that particular hurricane ).<br><br>Well, due to the fact that there isn't any US state that has the weight that Russia had inside the USSR, this is not directly appliable to the USA. But I've had been hearing a very persistant rumour for a year or two that Germany has a backup plan for the the Euro crisis, that is ... well, you guessed, leave the Euro alltogether and emit some kind of new marks, leaving the rest of the Eurozone to their own means ( and you would be probably forced to measure in femtoseconds the time the Eurozone would hold in one piece without Germany ) ...<br><br><a href=#c1623868882015064441 title="comment permalink">8/10/12, 7:55 AM</a><br><br>

Our ability to remove money from the system, whether voluntarily or through necessity, gives us quite a bit of power over a system that needs that money to keep growing, or to at least pretend that its growing. Tax revenue is part of it, but money to buy goods and services is a much bigger part. Perhaps this provides even more leverage than demonstrating loudly in a state capitol? <br><br>My own experience is that as you start to take care of your own needs more directly (food, energy, medicine, entertainment, etc) you step back and start to question the systems that were providing those things for you, and from the questioning you see how rotten they are. And so you withdraw your consent in quite a tangible way. More and more people seem to be going through this process now. I don’t think this is anything like a majority, of course, but something is starting to happen.<br><br><a href=#c1253923642957137177 title="comment permalink">8/10/12, 8:19 AM</a><br><br>

You attribute this to the desire for it all to get over with at once instead of enduring the long and boring reality of decline. I'd argue, however, that the real reasons to desire an apocalypse to come are purely personal. <br><br>I recall a time in my life when I was desperately hoping for the aocalypse to arrive just to excuse myself from any responsibility in the real world. I lost a job over it and nearly failed out of college over it, telling myself and others, "Well what's the point of working a job anyway if in a few years the entire world is going to collapse and within ten years the earth will go back to a medieval feudal system." Of course, I didn't have any real factual reason to believe any of this. It was purely psychological; it was purely a distorted resurfacing of a deeper unconscious desire to run away from my unglamorous responsibilities at my job. <br><br>In the end, I gained absolutely nothing from that year awaiting the apocalypse, just a small garden plot of dead plants and lots of wasted money on survival supplies. In fact, my commitment to the apocalypse only sabotaged the real opportunities I had to live life that year, taking away my motivation to give any effort to my real world responsibilities. It was really funny, though, how as soon as I started to take pride in my job again and value my relationship with the world that the apocalyptic fantasies vanished or turned into images of pure shame and ridicule.<br><br><a href=#c2626692958130136852 title="comment permalink">8/10/12, 8:29 AM</a><br><br>

Thanks, John, for reminding us. I wonder if another of the reasons a state-sponsored constitutional convention has never been called is that the prospect of another convention that could do just about anything including scrap the current Constitution, is simply downright scary.<br><br>Nevertheless, despite the fact that the states have these powers, and despite the fact that we cannot really know what is going to happen once the crisis trigger is pulled, the fact remains that currently many state officeholders are in the same big corporate pockets as the federal officeholders. (Just note how successful ALEC has become getting their "model legislation" passed in many states.) Therefore, it's hard not to speculate that when the crisis comes, the whole shebang, federal and state governments alike, is likely go up in flames simultaneously. Some of the more independent-minded states (e.g., Vermont) might weather that storm with their governments more or less intact, but I really wonder if the government of my own state--Ohio--will fare very well.<br><br>(ALEC, for the sake of John's overseas readers, stands for American Legislative Exchange Council and is an organization funded by large corporations.

Today we live in an era with an unprecedented amount globalisation. This globalisation means national countries and by extension governments are much less self-sufficient than in the past. I will give you the UK as an example. About 50% of the food consumed must be imported and not only that but much of our manufacturing base has been outsourced to places like China. The UK can only keep up this dynamic by honouring its financial obligations and credit lines. Suppose the financial system collapses which it will considering the whole financial system is a giant Ponzi scheme how can the British government enact policies that ensure people have adequate access to food, goods, medical supplies and energy? <br><br>The government could mitigate these problems but all the required policies would require years to implement as not only do significant capital investments need to be made (which will be severely limited if there is a financial crash) but a large degree of retraining and thinking will need to take place. All of these things take time, time we will not have.<br><br>It is likely that if the financial system does crash people will not only lose their jobs but their pensions and even access to critical items like food, medical supplies, clothes and energy. If people do not have access to such things then it is likely to lead to political failure or social upheaval. Yes I am sure the governments will do everything they can to prevent such a thing from happening but without long-term measures then I think they would be largely impotent as most nations are dependent on the globalised trade to meet its basic needs. <br><br>Yes some nations may salvage something if they can agree to bilateral deals like the middle-east can get food in exchange for its oil etc. but still, they would face a collapse in my eyes because their society would have to undergo a process of forced simplification as these trades would be more limited and will not provide them with the amenities such as big cars, air conditioning that they enjoy or expect to have in the future.<br><br>I would be more inclined to believe a quick collapse is entirely avoidable if I could figure some policies a government could implement if there was a sudden failure in the financial system and a sudden drastic fall in world trade. I do think the probability of this occurring is rather high and if the financial system goes into meltdown global trade will collapse quite suddenly. The ability of the individual governments to handle this scenario would determine their survival. <br><br>Now just because I cannot devise a strategy on how the governments can save itself that does not mean they will not find a way. Please note when thinking of strategies I am considering non-democratic processes also. I do think the take home point is anything is possible and there is a significant chance of a fast collapse, I am not saying it is an inevitable scenario simply it is a possible scenario with a reasonable chance of occurring. I think it is prudent to watch the canaries of the world and at the moment it is Greece the other PIG nations and the poorer Arab/African nations that form the marginal parts of the globalised system. <br><br>How they fall (or survive) will offer a blueprint on how the core countries or core elements of the globalised system will respond. Then again there will be notable differences when the core nations do come under severe stress as the force of contagion and other systemic failures will be much stronger. As result it is possible the bigger nations will fail due to larger cascading failures falling around them in much the same manner in how a human body fail and suffer multiple organ failure soon after its kidneys cease functioning. The body, like the politician, will fight tooth and nail for survival but it can reach a tipping point where it becomes helpless to its environment and undergoes a process of rapid decline even collapse.<br><br>END OF COMMMENTS<br><br><a href=#c4110970396241457331 title="comment permalink">8/10/12, 8:38 AM</a><br><br>

Governments will do whatever they can to maintain the status quo. This is why the financiers were bailed out in 2008 and were not hauled before a kangaroo court for a, "please explain your previous actions session and atone for your sins". Given the same circumstances today, they'd probably get a further bailout? I don't seem to recall people protesting in the streets about it either (with any sense of passion).<br><br>When governments fail the ordinary citizen though, other more shady groups step in to take their place. Has anyone not taken note that extreme right parties such as Golden Dawn in Greece are handing out food parcels to selected people that conform with their ideals. Interestingly too, like the IRA, they have split the extremists and the political wings so that each can deny the other and yet at the same time, strangely benefit from the others presence. Very hard to explain for them, yet they do.<br><br>Hard times provide fertile soil to these types and it is in the interests of the powers that be to not ignore this lesson (although chasing self-interest to the bitter end, they probably will).<br><br>PS: I'm enjoying the Earth path, but feel a bit of discomfort.

I feel the people who do wish for a fast collapse have not considered all the consequences that a fast collapse would entail.<br><br><br>The reason a slow decline must be preferred is because it allows more time for people and society to adjust to the new reality. This is not just in a practical sense by implementing some actual reforms/measures on how to live life but also mentally as well which is also an important aspect to consider. Currently society wastes a lot of energy/resources on activities that do little to enhance happiness so in theory we could reduce our foot print quite significantly without any significant impact on the quality of life however as the general narrative is of a bigger and "better" future then anything that does not advocate rampant consumption or at least the promise of rampant consumption in the future will be seen as loss. In short what I am saying is an important element in all this is a transformation of people's mind-sets and expectations of life. Currently society expects way too much and it needs to change however if this change were to come through sudden drastic changes in the environment then the reactions, and subsequent manipulation by unscrupulous individuals or governmental powers can result in much more negative outcomes.<br><br>Changing the subject however and focussing a bit more on collapse. I feel we can agree we live in a complex world which is governed by complex systems. In fact the degree of complexity in today's world is unprecedented. One thing that we do know about all complex systems is they are inherently unpredictable so making precise predictions on how, when and to what pace things will develop is largely a fool’s game. Only the general trajectory of the system can be determined with any real confidence. So I think it is best to at least consider that a fast collapse is one of the possible scenarios that can occur. Also when discussing the issue of collapse it is important to know how this term is defined. For many people, collapse would be something reminiscent of a mad Max movie but to me I would define a collapse of society in a similar fashion to Joseph Tainter; a forced simplification of the way society operates. <br><br>I strongly believe there is great merit in following history and as an former economics student can really understand the folly of not following/appreciating history but at the same time whilst it is very important to note the similarities of what happened before it also just as important to note the differences between the now and then. As Mark Twain would have said: <br>“History does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme”. <br>I can definitely subscribe to this notion. I also believe that the behaviour of the politicians will be the same of times gone by and the reaction by society is equally likely to be similar also. The other variable that must be considered is the environment we do live in. Is it really so exactly the same as times gone by? I have my doubts over this and please note I do not just mean the environment in the literal sense (although that will form an important element in the overall story). When I use this term I also encompass the political/economic environment. Whilst today’s society does indeed share many sharing some similarities to the past, there are some clear differences so the final outcome could be different.<br><br>SEE PART 2 WHICH IS SEVERAL POSTS ABOVE THIS POST<br><br><a href=#c1774224437498591751 title="comment permalink">8/11/12, 6:01 AM</a><br><br>

Our current constitution came into being because that earlier arrangement didn't work. It remains to be seen whether the EU is going to establish a European government that matters -- that is, one with an elected executive and some degree of voter control over the EU's bureaucrats -- or whether it's going to fall apart, as the US very nearly did before our constitution was ratified. <br><br>Lewis, I sometimes wonder if putting the state capitol in a small city was a deliberate act to keep the European model from repeating here. <br><br>Joy, benefit checks? Not so fast. Since we're talking about national bankruptcy, what gives you the idea that the benefit checks will keep coming? <br><br>Sunset, bingo. <br><br>Bhavana, the US population is already moving toward contraction as the birth rate drops and immigration becomes a lot less popular. The global population will be headed the same way as global grain production heads south. I see population as an effect, rather than an independent cause; as we lose the abundance that made breeding like rabbits look like a good idea, my guess is you'll see population move into contraction pretty quickly. <br><br>Ivan, the fixation on the absurdities of the rich is a common American pastime during times of relative prosperity, because people can fantasize about having that much money themselves. In times of contraction, that sort of conspicuous consumption gets bombs thrown through car windows. If I were Brad or Angelina, whoever they are, I'd be a little more careful. <br><br>Mr. M., the power of money is a very brittle thing. As long as things remain stable, the masters of money can buy a great deal of power; once the stability shatters, they're more likely to be robbed at gunpoint by governments that no longer have to care about the rule of law. That's why the culture of executive kleptocracy we've got these days is so self-defeating; the corporate kleptocrats are destroying the basis for their own influence by wrecking the economic machinery that alone gives them their power.<br><br><a href=#c8264258741134033665 title="comment permalink">8/12/12, 2:21 PM</a><br><br>

In the long run, you're quite correct. My working guess, though, is that the collapse of US empire may trigger a crisis large enough to bring about that result even in the much shorter run. <br><br>Russell, also good. One of the likely results of any attempt to impose centralized authority on the US would be a long and bitter insurgency that would trash the US economy and shatter any hope of holding onto our global empire. Mind you, we may well get the insurgency anyway, in which case a lot of bets are off. <br><br>Larry, look up the economic history of France during the Revolution sometime. It was a remarkable mess. <br><br>Robert, as long as Canada has money flowing in from tar sands, my guess is that your government will be able to buy its way to stability.

The point I'd make, again, is that political influence that's bought by money is a very brittle thing, and once governments abandon the rule of law -- as they generally do during extreme crisis -- it's much easier simply to seize private wealth, directly via confiscation or indirectly via confiscatory taxes, than to whore yourself for it. <br><br>Monsta, yes, I've heard that reasoning before, and I've explained at some length why I find it implausible. <br><br>Kieran, again, the Napoleonic wars were quite a bit more than one war. The Taiping rebellion? Heck of a good question; I've read that it and the US Civil War were something close to neck and neck, though more recent research may have tipped the balance. <br><br>Justin, thanks for the link! As for Haley Barbour et al., exactly -- my suggestion is that under extreme stress, the fracture lines that divide the regions would give way, and politicians would stumble into a situation from which the dissolution of the Union might be the only viable way out. <br><br>Ron, I've discussed at great length in many blog posts why I find Korowicz' theory implausible, based on his own admission that he assumes governments will take the minimal possible steps to deal with a collapse -- an assumption that can't be justified on any basis but sheer faith. If you find that disappointing, so be it. <br><br>Art, even so odd a duck as Aleister Crowley wrote that he couldn't see the west coast remaining in the US indefinitely. I disagree with Crowley on almost any issue you care to name, but there I suspect he was right. <br><br>Mustard, fascinating -- I'll have to compare the total death toll, though. As for raising the stakes, do we have evidence that this is in fact the case, in this specific case? Otherwise it's argument by metaphor, which is always interesting but hardly conclusive. <br><br>Larry, not at all. The question is simply where the potential fracture lines are if the federal government blunders into severe crisis. <br><br>Jennifer, there were plenty of corporate lobbyists in DC from the 1870s on. How come monopolies got banned and the New Deal enacted into law? Again, influence isn't power, and the influence gained from money is brittle. <br><br>Cherokee, all I can say is that the Earth Path material in <i>The Druidry Handbook</i> has inspired a fair number of people to try to lessen their impact on the biosphere.

You get today's gold star for saying the crucial words: <i>it's not the end of the world</i>. It's history as usual: an empire comes apart, political discords spin out of control, there's a war or two, and then things settle down at a new level. That's the shape of the US imperial twilight, too. <br><br>Monsta, you left out the main reason why people prefer to talk about fast collapse: they don't have to do anything. If it's all about to come crashing down, why bother to change your life now? Thus it's one more lullaby, or to use a metaphor from an earlier post, one more excuse to keep on living in Hagsgate. <br><br>Mister R., it's not just the South. California is a different country. New England is a different country. Texas -- well, it's basically a different planet. That's one of the reasons why disunion seems like a likely outcome to me. <br><br>Robert, I'm aware of it. If that's accepted, we no longer have a republic here in the US. <br><br>Justin, hmm. As I see it, the binary is still the widely held popular notion that the only options are business as usual or sudden collapse, and the third factor belongs somewhere in a range of options including gradual decline, stairstep decline, and massive but not fatal crisis. <br><br>Hapibeli, the number of media stories like that is, I think, solid evidence of just how desperate things have gotten. <br><br>John, I'd encourage you to go look it up. <br><br>Chris, unless something provides a political focus for the rural population, it will remain as diffuse and powerless as it generally is. Many rural areas in the South were opposed to secession in 1860 and 1861; the power was concentrated where the population was, and so secession happened.

What we can describe is what is happening. Whether we qualify that reality as a fast or slow process is one of those entirely subjective value judgments that are largely irrelevant. In my view, we are already collapsed in the United States and its getting worse. You go to small town America, and what you generally find is a hollowed out social structure, and impoverished economy based on gas stations, chain restaurants and superstores. Meanwhile, major manufacturers have left. Minor manufacturers are playing a game with local tax bases, playing one county off another to keep seeking regulatory arbitrage.<br><br>I am spending part of my time in a rural community, and the isolation and lack of coordination of economic activities is paralyzing. Everyone is doing their own thing, no one wants to even think about forming something as simple as a farmer's market. Part of my income stream is from art, and although there is a half-assed gallery in every town up here, not a single person wants to think about pooling resources. I've been told in response to inquisitions as to why there are no economies of scale that, "around here, we like to keep to ourselves." <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohawk_Valley_formula rel=nofollow>The Mohawk Valley Formula has a legacy, for sure.</a><br><br>Anyway, even within the terms of debate about slow and fast collapse that excludes the rapid environmental collapse from discussion, its bad.

Then whenever money runs short, the President can just detain various conveniently selected super-rich people indefinitely and add all their wealth into the treasury.<br><br>All this reminds me very strongly of Caesar Augustus' strategy to transform the old Republic into an Empire by taking all the power into his hands while carefully not calling himself an emperor and preserving most of the outward customs and offices of the Roman Republic. <br><br>One of Augustus' chief tools, as he did this, was the legal power he had been granted to proscribe people, that is, to execute, banish or simply "disappear" them at his pleasure. Since the property of a proscribed person went to the state treasury, he also used proscription of selected very wealthy men whenever he needed to replenish the treasury or clear some of the State's debts. This generally enhanced his popularity with the masses and strengthened his political power.<br><br>You surely know all this Roman history, JMG, but it may be news to some of your readers. <br><br>I daresay we will all know for sure by 2024, or maybe sooner, whether something like this has been in the works for a while.<br><br><a href=#c6108430859174875698 title="comment permalink">8/12/12, 9:18 PM</a><br><br>

He is now 90, a Brit, and lived through the period in which the British Empire collapsed. A few highlights: 1929 crash, his father lost his business and home, and moved his family to China to seek something new; 1936 Japanese invasion of China (he was living in Shanghai); 1940-45 in the British air force in the far east, in the early years seeing various British defeats (Rangoon, Singapore, etc); 1947 he was with the British forces leaving India; Late 40s and 50s living in bombed-out London, with rationing and economic challenges; 1957 Suez crisis; 1960s various remaining colonies gained independence (Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Rhodesia, Malaysia) as cost of retaining Empire couldn’t be justified; 1967 devaluation of the pound; 1970s economic turmoil, rolling black-outs, industrial strife, three-day weeks, Irish bombings; 1980s more recession and industrial strife, Falklands war, end of the cold war. <br><br>So that’s what one collapse looked like, in the course of a long life: lots of crises, some catastrophes, plenty of slow grind, some periods of recovery. And of course the process isn’t done yet. The 1990s and early 2000s were relatively quiet, but the economy is now faltering again, and North Sea Oil is running low. But the sun always came up tomorrow, even if what it highlighted wasn’t always very pleasant. Throughout all this my Father did the British thing – kept calm and carried on – and did a lot of gardening. <br><br><br><a href=#c8126274473951036488 title="comment permalink">8/13/12, 10:21 AM</a><br><br>

I don't think anyone has accurately estimated civilian casualties, but for the sake of argument let's estimate up to a million (with Sherman's scorched earth and broken supply lines all over the South, I think that's fair). Anyway, your point in the post stands.<br><br>But in terms of the bloodiest war in the 19th century, the 1-2 million Americans killed in the Civil War doesn't seem to measure up to other wars. The Taiping Rebellion is believed to have caused the deaths of 10-40 million, while both the White Lotus Rebellion and Dungan Revolt, also in China, caused the deaths of something in the region of 10 million each. As for the Napoleonic Wars, I think they are mostly considered to be a single, continuous conflict for the purposes of casualties (with deaths in the 3 to 6 million range), even just the War of the Sixth Coalition, counting the Russian Invasion, had an estimated death toll in the 1 to 2 million range, comparable to that of the American Civil War. <br><br>From what I can see so far, the American Civil War, while very bloody, wasn't even in the same order of magnitude in terms of casualties as the happenings in China in the 19th Century, and is probably more neck and neck with the sub-wars of Napoleon. Of course, historiography is a tricky thing, and I would be very open to seeing the sources you've read which say otherwise.<br><br><a href=#c1485343462864373384 title="comment permalink">8/13/12, 2:31 PM</a><br><br>

Federal Election Commission</i>, 558 U.S. 50 (2010). In <i>Citizens United</i>, the Supreme Court ruled, essentially, that no limits could be imposed on campaign contributions because that would be a form of infringing free speech of corporations. As we can all see, that decision enabled the creation of Super Pacs and has driven up the cost of campaigns substantially. It is this extra cost that helps the monied interest, and thus the status-quo. It also lends itself to that “diffusion” of decision-making that Mr. Greer alluded to in “The Descent into Stasis.”<br><br>This is as much a historical accident as anything else. When the Constitution was written, corporations were strictly state animals. Corporations were still under the Roman strictures that limited their scope and duration so as not to compete with the State. The British, incidentally, had flirted with removing regulations on corporations so that they could “innovate” (sound familiar), which resulted in a financial calamity and the passage of the “Bubble Act” in 1720, which reimposed the old Roman strictures. By the time we won independence, there were only about 250 small corporations in the thirteen states. With no central government, the states where the companies were located inherited their articles of incorporation. When the Constitution was enacted, it gave “full faith and credit” to the laws of the other states, as well as all “privileges and immunities” to the citizens of other states. Corporations were not mentioned in the Constitution – only government and the public. Most importantly, citizenship was not defined in the original Constitution or the Bill of Rights. It as only a matter of time until the Supreme Court had to decide which side corporations fell: citizens, or government. That question was settled in a tax case in 1886. <i>Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company</i>, 118 U.S. 394 (1886). That's when corporations officially became people, my friend. <br><br>Once they were people, they were given all the privileges and immunities of other citizens. Moreover, under the Full Faith and Credit clause, the lax laws of states like Delaware were effectively imposed on the other states through corporations that could not be excluded by the state government because of the Supreme Court decisions. Once corporations were people for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment (which for the first time attempts to define citizenship in a Constitutional context), the protections for corporations were eventually extended to other provisions in the Bill of Rights, including the First Amendment. <i>First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti</i>, 435 U.S. 765 (1978); <i>Buckley v. Valeo</i>, 424 U.S. 1 (1976); <i>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</i>, 558 U.S. 50 (2010). <br><br>This historical accident means that corporations have become institutions in our society that rival, in many ways, the authority of the state and federal governments. Even though they are unelected, the unrivaled ability to aggregate capital and employ that capital to affect appointments of individuals, as well as direct to whom elected officials find themselves accountable, has done as much to nullify our democracy as any overt act. Yes, we have the ability to take the government back – in writing. I cannot, however, imagine that the powers that direct all that capital would allow anything like meaningful reforms from happening.<br><br><a href=#c232379874921373654 title="comment permalink">8/14/12, 12:08 PM</a><br><br>

(The tax issue having never been in my history book) <br>I did read in Rex Weylers history of the red man wriiten by a white man (blood of the land) about the story of the monks arrival to the Americas. I guess as the Saxons started to spread, the monks or holy people were forced further and further onto the periphery of Europe. Rex Weyler tells the story of how some sailed to America in leather coracles across the Northern route to establish the great councils of peace. The largest of which was with the Irquois and Seneca and another tribe if I am correct.

What we are missing, though, is a decent comparison between real wealth and perceived monetary wealth. Not easily done, but I suggest we compare the amount of money a farmer receives to the supermarket prices, and we'll get an idea of how far the economy is from real wealth and usefulness. Something like 50:1 ratio for things like corn flakes or beans.
