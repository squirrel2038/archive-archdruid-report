<div class=MsoNormal>
Among science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke’s many gifts was a mordant sense of humor, and a prime example of that gift in action was his 1951 short story <a href=http://www.mayofamily.com/RLM/txt_Clarke_Superiority.html>Superiority</a>. It’s the story of a space war told by the commanding general of the losing side; he is explaining to some interstellar equivalent of the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal how his forces managed to lose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The question is of some interest, as the space fleets and resources of the losing side were far superior to those of the victors. So, however, was their technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>"However" is the operative word, for each brilliantly innovative wonder weapon fielded by their scientists turned out to have disastrous downsides when put into service, while the winning side simply kept on churning out unimaginative space battleships using old but proven technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the time the losing side realized that it should have done the same thing, it was so far behind that only a new round of wonder weapons seemed to offer any hope of victory—and a little more of that same logic finished them off. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s been suggested by more than one wit that life imitates art far more often than art imitates life. The United States military these days seems intent on becoming a poster child for that proposal. Industrial design classes at MIT used to hand out copies of "Superiority" as required reading; unfortunately that useful habit has not been copied by the Pentagon, and as a result, the US armed forces are bristling with brilliantly innovative wonder weapons that don’t do what they’re supposed to do. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The much-ballyhooed Predator drone is one good example among many.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For those who don’t follow military technology, it’s a remote-controlled plane designed to fly at rooftop level, equipped with a TV camera and missiles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The operator, sitting in an air-conditioned office building in Nevada, can control it anywhere on Earth via satellite uplink, seek out suspected terrorists, and vaporize them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Does it work?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well, it’s vaporized quite a few people; the Obama administration is even more drone-happy than its feckless predecessor, and has been sending swarms of drones around various corners of the Middle East to fire missiles at a great many suspected terrorists. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You’ll notice that this has done little to stabilize the puppet governments we’ve got in the Middle East these days, and even less to decrease the rate at which American soldiers are getting shot and blown up in Afghanistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There’s a reason for that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The targets for drone attacks have to be selected by ordinary intelligence methods—terrorists don’t go around with little homing beacons on them, you know—and ordinary intelligence methods have a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a result, a lot of wedding parties and ordinary households get vaporized on the suspicion that there might be a terrorist hiding in there somewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since tribal custom in large parts of the Middle East makes blood vengeance on the murderers of one’s family members an imperative duty, and there are all these American soldiers conveniently stationed in Afghanistan—well, you can do the math for yourself. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus the Predator drone isn’t a war-fighting technology, it’s a war-losing technology, pursued with ever-increasing desperation by a military and political establishment that has no idea what to do but can’t bear the thought of doing nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The same logic drove the policy of torture so disingenuously defended by the Bush administration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(Yes, waterboarding is torture. Anyone who wishes to disagree is welcome to undergo the procedure themselves and then offer an informed opinion.) Beyond the moral issues, there’s a practical point that’s far from minor:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>torture doesn’t work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s not an effective way of extracting accurate information from prisoners; it’s an effective way of making prisoners say what the torturer wants to hear—I recall the comment of the elderly Knight Templar, after his session on the rack, that in order to get his torturers to stop he would readily have confessed to murdering God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus torture is another war-losing technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Technically speaking, it’s a good way to maximize confirmation bias, which is what cognitive psychologists call the habit of looking for evidence that supports your presuppositions rather than testing those presuppositions against the real world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It appeals powerfully to the sort of squeaky-voiced machismo that played so large a role in the Bush administration’s foreign policy, but wars are not won by imposing one’s own delusions on a global battlefield; they’re won by figuring out what’s out there in the world, and responding to it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They’re also won by remembering that what’s out there in the world is also responding to you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To grasp how this works, it’s going to be necessary to talk about systems again—specifically, about the three ways a system can mess you over. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There may be official names for these somewhere, but I’ve taken the liberty of borrowing terminology from Discordianism, and calling them chaos, discord, and confusion. For a timely example of chaos, it’s hard to do better than Tropical Storm Isaac, which is churning its way into the eastern Caribbean as I write this. As systems go, a tropical storm is a fairly simple one—basically, a heat engine in which all the moving parts are made of air and water, with a few feedback loops linking it to its environment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those loops are what make it chaotic; a tropical storm’s behavior is determined by its environment, but its environment is constantly being reshaped by the tropical storm, so that perturbations too small to track or anticipate can spin out of control and drive major shifts in size, speed and direction. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus you can never know exactly where a tropical storm is going to go, or how hard it’s going to hit. The most you can know is where, on average, storms like the one you’re watching have tended to go, and what they’ve done when they got there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s chaos:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>unpredictability because the other system’s interactions with its environment are too complex to be accurately anticipated. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If we shift attention from Tropical Storm Isaac to the latest recall of bacteria-tainted produce, we move from chaos to discord.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Individually, bacteria are nearly as dumb as storms, but a species of bacteria taken as a whole has a curious analogue to intelligence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All living systems are value-oriented—that is, they value some states (such as staying alive) more than other states (such as becoming dead) and take actions to bring about the states they value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That makes them considerably more challenging to deal with than storms, because they take active steps to counter any change that threatens their survival. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the factor that drives the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, for example. Successful microbe species maintain a constant pressure on their ecological boundaries via genetic variation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The DNA dice are constantly rolling, and it doesn’t matter if the odds against the combination of genes they need to survive in an antibiotic-rich environment<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>are in the millions-to-one range; as long as they aren’t driven to extinction, they’ll roll boxcars sooner or later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s discord:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>unpredictability because the other system is constantly modifying its own behavior to pursue values that conflict with yours. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Compare bacterial evolution to the behavior of a tropical storm and the difference between chaos and discord is easy to grasp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Tropical storms aren’t value-oriented; they simply respond in complicated ways to subtle changes in environmental conditions they themselves play a part in causing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Imagine, though, a tropical storm that started seeking out patches of warm water and moving away from wind shear, so it could prolong its own existence and increase in strength.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s what all living things do, from bacteria to readers of <i>The Archdruid Report</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Tropical storms don’t, which is a good thing; there would be a lot more cataclysmic hurricanes if they did. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To go to the next level, let’s imagine an ecosystem of living tropical storms: seeking out the warm water that feeds them, dodging the wind shear that can kill them, and competing against other storms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s all in the realm of discord.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Imagine, though, that a storm that achieves hurricane status becomes conscious and capable of abstract thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It can think about the future and make plans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It becomes aware of other hurricanes, and realizes that those other hurricanes can frustrate its plans if they can figure out the plans in time to do something about them. The result is confusion:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>uncertainty because the other system is deliberately trying to fool you. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s crucial to grasp that what I’ve called chaos, discord, and confusion are fundamentally different kinds of uncertainty, and the tricks that will help you deal with one will blow up in your face if you apply them to the others. Statistical analysis, for instance, can give you a handle on a chaotic system:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>meteorologists trying to predict the movements of a storm can study the trajectories of past storms and get a good idea of where the storm is most likely to go. Apply that to bacteria, and you’ll be blindsided sooner or later, because the bacteria are constantly generating genetic novelty and thus shifting the baseline on which the statistics rely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Apply it to an enemy in war, and you’ve made a lethal mistake; once your enemy figures out what you’re expecting, they’ll play along to lull you into a sense of false security, and then come out of the blue and stomp you. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This bit of systems theory is relevant here because American culture has a very hard time dealing with any kind of uncertainty at all. That’s partly the legacy of Newtonian science, which saw itself—or at least liked to portray itself in public—as the quest for absolutely invariant laws of nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If X occurs, then Y must occur:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>that sort of statement is the paradigmatic form of knowledge in industrial societies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of the great scientific achievements of the 20th century was the expansion of science into fields that can only be known statistically—quantum mechanics, meteorology, ecology, and more. Even there, though, the lure of the supposedly invariant has been a constant source of trouble, while those fields that routinely throw discord and confusion at the researcher are by and large the fields that have remained stubbornly resistant to scientific inquiry and technological control. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It also explains a good bit of why the United States has stumbled from one failed counterinsurgency after another since the Second World War.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There’s more to it than that—I’ll explain next week why the American way of war guarantees that any country invaded and occupied by the United States is sure to pup an insurgency in short order—but the American military fixation on certainty and control, part and parcel of the broader American obsession with these notions, has gone a long way to guarantee the litany of failures. You can’t treat a hostile country like a passive object that will respond predictably to your actions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You can’t even treat it as a chaotic system that can more or less be known statistically. At the very least, you have to recognize that it will behave as a discordant system, and react to your actions in ways that support its values, not yours: for example, by shooting or blowing up randomly chosen American soldiers to avenge family members killed by a Predator drone. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, it’s crucial to be aware of the possibility of the third level of uncertainty, the one that I’ve called confusion. Any hypothesis you come up with, if it becomes known or even suspected by the enemy, becomes a tool he can use to clobber you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The highly political and thus embarrassingly public nature of American military doctrine and strategy pretty much guarantees that this will happen—does anyone really believe, for example, that the Taliban weren’t reading online news stories about the upcoming American "surge" for months before it happened, and combining that with information from a global network of intelligence sources to get a very clear picture of what was coming and how to deal with it? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So far, the consequences of confusion have been limited, because the United States has been careful to pick on nations that couldn’t fight back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We could pound the rubble in Vietnam and Iraq, invade Panama and Grenada, and stage revolutions in Libya and a bunch of post-Communist nations, because we knew perfectly well that the worst they could do in response was kill a bunch of American soldiers. Several trends, though, suggest that this period of relative safety may be coming to an end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The spread of digital technology is part of it—the ease with which Iraqi insurgents figured out how to use cell phones to trigger roadside bombs is only the first foreshock of a likely tectonic shift in warfare, as DIY electronics meets DIY weapons engineering to produce cheap, homemade equivalents of smart bombs and Predator drones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The United States’ increasing dependence on the rest of the world is another part—the number of soft targets that, if destroyed, would deal a punishing blow to America’s economy has soared in recent years, and a great many of those targets are scattered around the world, readily accessible to those with a grudge and a van full of fertilizer. Still, there’s a third factor, and it’s a function of the increasingly integrated and highly technological American military machine. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As the most gizmocentric culture in recorded history, America was probably destined from the start to end up with a military system in which most uniformed personnel operate machinery, and every detail of making war involves a galaxy of high-tech devices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The machines and devices have been so completely integrated into military operations that they are necessities, not conveniences; I’ve been quietly informed by several people in the militaries of the US and its allies that a failure of the GPS satellite system, for example, would cripple the ability of a US military force to do much of anything. It’s far from the only such vulnerability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Today’s US military is tightly integrated with a global technological infrastructure of fantastic complexity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That structure is immensely powerful and efficient...but longtime readers of this blog will recall that efficiency is the opposite of resilience. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s why I discussed the abrupt termination of Bronze Age chariot warfare by javelin-throwing raiders in last week’s post.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you have to fight an enemy armed with an extremely efficient military technology, one of the most likely ways to win is to find and target some previously unexploited weakness in the technology itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Complex as they were by the standards of the time, chariots had a very modest number of vulnerabilities, one of which the Sea Peoples attacked and exploited. By contrast, the hypercomplex American military machine is riddled with potential vulnerabilities—weak points that a hostile force might be able to monkeywrench in some unexpected way.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Surely, you may be thinking by this point, the Pentagon is thinking about this as well. No doubt they are, but the famous military penchant for endlessly refighting the last really successful war and the tendency for weapons systems to develop political constituencies that keep them in service long after they’re obsolete militate against a meaningful response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>US military planners in recent decades have followed the lead of the sciences to embrace the form of uncertainty I’ve called chaos, and so you get plenty of scenarios of future war that extrapolate current trends out fifteen or fifty years, with a few new bits of gosh-wow technology and a large role reserved for weapons systems such as carriers with constituencies that have enough clout.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The thought that hostile forces may be evolving resistance to our military equivalent of antibiotics rarely gets a look in, and the thought that at least some of those hostile forces may be reading those same scenarios and brainstorming ways to toss a monkeywrench into the machinery—well, let’s just say that making such suggestions will be about as helpful for the career of a military officer today as the same habit was for Col. Billy Mitchell back in the day. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is one reason why I have come to believe that of the shocks that could cause the US empire to collapse, one of the most likely is a disastrous and unexpected military defeat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At this point, very nearly the only thing that maintains US power, and the disproportionate share of the world’s wealth that is the payoff of that power, is our eagerness to pound the bejesus out of Third World nations at the drop of a hat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If we lose that capacity, we could end up neck deep in kim chee very quickly indeed. </div>

<h4>
End of the World of the Week #36</h4>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a tendency to assume that people who buy into end-of-the-world prophecies are, shall we say, a couple of horsemen short of an apocalypse. History, though, shows that it’s entirely possible to be very bright and still buy into the apocalypse meme. Among the leading examples is the redoubtable John Napier (1550-1617), who combined a fascination with apocalyptic prophecy with a well-earned reputation as one of the great mathematicians of all time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Does that latter description sound exaggerated?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It isn’t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is the man who invented the decimal point. Oh, and logarithms. Not to mention one of the first practical mechanical calculating devices, the once-famous Napier’s Bones. We won’t even get into his remarkable innovations in spherical trigonometry. The point that matters for this discussion is his very careful, elegant, mathematically exact calculations of the end of the world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Like nearly everyone in 16th-century Scotland, he took the Book of Revelations seriously, and turned the same penetrating intellect on its mysteries that he used with better results on the properties of numbers. After years of careful calculation, he determined that the Second Coming of Christ would occur either in 1688 or in 1700.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Fortunately, Napier’s reputation rests on more durable grounds, for both years passed without the faintest sound of Gabriel’s trumpet. </div>

It was essentially a small jamming device that would overload the bombs GPS receiver, thus causing it to become a "dumb" bomb. If I remember, it cost about $50 dollars and could easily fit into a soldiers backpack. From what I heard, the Pentagon was in an absolute panic over it. In addition, Russian contractors were laying fiber optic cables to network all of Iraq's radar facilities with their SAM sites.

U-boats - which nearly starved the UK. Tank designs which remained superior throughout the war – but severe weather and fuel shortages did it for them. They flew a small jet aircraft just before the outbreak of war and the technology was sufficiently developed to produce the impressive Me 262 fighter, but the performance margin it enjoyed was overwhelmed by delays in entering service, such that the sheer numbers of Allied fighter pilots ranging over German skies quickly found its weak spot – picking them off as they landed. Incidentally, the 262’s engine life was only 24 hours, but that was academic as the pilot’s life expectancy was considerably less than that. <br><br>Other impressive technology such as the V1 ‘doodlebug’ drone and especially the V2 ballistic missile represented massive leaps of capability, but had no strategic impact to show for all the effort invested. <br><br>As the war became more desperate for Hitler, the appliance of technology to produce wonder weapons verged on the ridiculous. Examples being the highly dangerous rocket powered Me 163 Komet glider, the vertically launched Baachem Natter, designed to break in two once the pilot had launched his salvo of rockets against the B-17 formation, and the Heinkel Salamander, a wooden-winged jet interceptor intended for eager Hitler Youth pilots after a few hours qualifying on gliders. <br><br>What actually prevailed were tons of USAAF and RAF bombs falling on their cities and installations, and a vast, expendable peasant army equipped with crude but effective machinery such as the T-34 tank, Katyusha ‘Stalin’s Organ’ truck-mounted rocket launchers and primitive Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmovik close-support attack aircraft, the most produced aircraft of all time (42330 were built).<br> <br>Another sometimes overlooked but decisive factor in the defeat of Germany were the ‘Ultra’ intercepts of the Enigma coding machines. Technology so advanced that the Germans remained supremely confident that their codes could never be cracked.<br> <br>And then, the victors decisively ended the war in the Pacific with an astonishing technological breakthrough – unaware that the flashes of their Atomic Bombs had also blinded them with science. <br><br>Mustard<br><br><a href=the-monkeywrench-wars.html#c3939063425566248071 title="comment permalink">8/23/12, 3:12 AM</a><br><br>

As you know I think a lot about this stuff and the processes you describe in this essay have got me thinking about Buzz Hollings panarchy theory and how as a system reaches its climax phase it has become so optimised with so many connections and so little resilience that it becomes brittle and hence collapses when the environment changes. I can't help but think that technologically advanced militaries are in the same position. They are so optimised for a certain environment (funding, stable supply chains etc) not to mention a certain type of threat environment that as that environment changes (as it is now), there is the very real chance that some sort of capability collapse will be triggered.<br><br><a href=the-monkeywrench-wars.html#c7069797665192556945 title="comment permalink">8/23/12, 3:41 AM</a><br><br>

Most human factors experts agree that this device is not properly usable by anyone unless in a calm lab environment. Certainly most consumer-grade GPS devices have far superior user interfaces. Pity the poor soldier trying to use it effectively in battle conditions. Quite a lot of their high-tech gear is similar, from the choking F-22 to the piece-o-crap Bowman.<br><br>More interestingly is how the military, for all the bleeding-edge technology, is now lagging in so many areas. There was a great talk by a Google guy discussing some of this problem http://www.informationdissemination.net/2012/05/keyhole.html<br><br>ID has another interesting article regarding cyberwarfare (attacks on Google) and its role in future conflicts (http://www.informationdissemination.net/2010/01/china-vs-google-espionage-or-cyber.html). The Israeli hack of Syrian air defence systems is another example where military technology is being leap-frogged. Same for Stuxnet and Flame attacks on Iran.<br><br>The point being that military effectiveness comes back to personnel effectiveness and the problems for the USA are only just starting to become evident. Even the most basic aspects, such as the toll of the extreme missions (the navy rotations are a good example) is going to one of the main root causes for lost battles.<br><br>It is not an issue of "if" but "when". If a soldier is spending time playing around or even just trying to operate gear then he/she is not focused on real time. Not a good situation.<br><br><a href=the-monkeywrench-wars.html#c3206667728452089728 title="comment permalink">8/23/12, 6:23 AM</a><br><br>

This certainly creates vulnerability as pointed out here but paradoxically it does also promote a resilience similar to the ways slime molds go from individualism to collectivism depending on the environmental conditions. <br><br>Digital technology has created both realities; one of incredible vulnerability but as a counter argument also an increase in resilience to disruption in the sense that mutual dependency makes it increasingly clear that military adventures and even economic warfare (think China) have to be tempered with keeping the host you attempt to parasitize healthy enough to continue to buy your junk. <br><br><br><br><a href=the-monkeywrench-wars.html#c9204396054729151883 title="comment permalink">8/23/12, 6:35 AM</a><br><br>

And like the airplane, they are good for some things and terrible at others. <br><br>In WWII, air power was everything. The Japanese Navy was broken from the air. An entire SS panzer division was annihilated by P-47's. Air power negates an enemy's ability to project power. <br><br>Then again, WWII was about pushing invaders out of territory they'd invaded. We, the enemy of the local's enemy, were friends. <br><br>What air power couldn't do was finish the war. Airplanes don't occupy ground, men with guns do. German production was greater at the end of the war than the beginning but they weren't at full war production then. Albert Speer said that attacks on petroleum production were effective. Breaking morale from the air did not work, typically just making the bombed out citizens more angry and determined to fight back. <br><br>If we look at both Gulf wars, air power and modern, mechanized warfare is highly effective at fighting a high-tech opponent. The Iraqis were swept from the desert much as the Japanese were from the seas. Of course, the desert and ocean are both similar in that there's little cover. Once on islands or in cities, air power is neutralized and you're stuck clearing things out with close-in fighting. <br><br>The other thing air power can't do is win people over to your side, especially when you're in the wrong. No amount of bombing could convince the Vietnamese we were the good guys and their fellow countrymen from the north were the bad guys. <br><br>We couldn't win over the Iraqis because we had trouble convincing them that we weren't taking over their country and stealing their oil because we are greedy, not nice people; this was probably because we did invade their country to steal their oil and killed quite a lot of them in the process. <br><br>If our goal was to commit wholesale genocide, i.e. How the West Was Won, then high-tech military force could probably work. Dalek Doctrine, EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE! Barring that, we'll just waste tons of money occupying a country whose people don't want us to be there, sending bodies home by fives and tens, and running up an unimaginable debt.

The taxi driver was an Iraqi man with his own business, hard working, reasonably ambitious, a Londoner. He'd been back in Baghdad seeing his old mother, and was driving home along a dual carriageway, when someone threw a grenade into the sophisticated American armoured truck going in the opposite direction.<br><br>The truck screeched to a halt and all the soldiers jumped out, before it blew up. He stopped, and shouted across to them to get in his car, and with no other viable options, they did. He asked them where they wanted to go, they replied the American base, but they didn't have a clue how to get there, as they didn't have access to their vehicle's GPS! Needless to say Baghdad had changed a lot(!) since my friend had lived there, so he phoned his mother on his mobile, and she directed them to the American base!<br><br>His reward for saving the lives of helpless and vulnerable US servicemen, and returning them to the safety of their base (in what was, at the time, still effectively a war zone)? To be hauled out of his car at gunpoint, roughly handled, and aggressively questioned! Still, it's nice to see a granny and her taxi-driver son keeping the streets safe in Baghdad. <br><br>Apparently, British servicemen are much better thought of than American servicemen in Iraq, the thought being that Brits actually know “foreigners”, probably live next door to them, whereas Americans just don't know people from other countries and cultures (I'd guess rank and file soldiers know precious few people from outside their own state?), and therefore have no skills or knowledge about how to deal with them. Even the US ruling elite who travel, don't really know “foreigners”, they just know other rich people, with slightly different accents, who went to Oxford, Cambridge or the Sorbonne, instead of MIT or Brown. A huge disadvantage to understanding the world, and how to respond to it. <br><br><br><a href=the-monkeywrench-wars.html#c3417071680981475003 title="comment permalink">8/23/12, 9:54 AM</a><br><br>

I was recently talking with an economics student who studies the ways countries manage their exchange rates, and he was fully aware of the kind of uncertainty you call 'confusion.' In that case, publishing his statistical analysis of the de facto exchange rate targets could lead to changes in the behavior of the central banks to avoid being too predictable to speculators. What you are calling 'confusion' seems to be a fundamental reason why economics will always be a set of rules of thumb that describe past economic arrangements rather than a predictive science.<br><br><a href=the-monkeywrench-wars.html#c3992455878479579878 title="comment permalink">8/23/12, 9:55 AM</a><br><br>

It now has planes that can fly from Diego Garcia and rain debt from above with old school bombs and return home unharmed. The only thing that can touch them is the surface to air missiles and as was seen during the Iraq war there are ways to knock them out.<br>I can’t help but think that if you want to fight the US you’re best off not doing it in on the battlefield in your own Country, I reckon even if you knock out the Carrier fleet and the Drone fleet you will still lose.<br>Any US enemy will need to do to the US what the US does to it. It will need to bomb its vital infrastructure, and kill it’s important people. It’s useless killing Soldiers. Armies, Politicians and to a lesser degree Civilians are inured to them. A US enemy in a fight to the death with it will have to fight a terrorist campaign on the US homeland.<br>It’s a lot less technically difficult to set up a number of terrorist cells in US cities have them gather intelligence on important infrastructure and people and leave them there lying in wait until the time comes.<br>If they can avoid large Civilian casualties but still hit US infrastructure and Establishment then it may be able to convince the same Establishment that this war may not be for it.

I will remain skeptical. <br><br>Much the same for conventional technology. Is it possible to jam GPS signals? Sure, the receiver isn't anything special and if you flood that frequency it will not function. Can you do that without a large transmitter and power source? Not really. Far better to send up sandcasters and try to destroy the satellites. Of course, you've just declared war on the rest of the world, but that's a minor issue.<br><br>There is a strange resilience of most imperial states. The empire already lost in Vietnam, and is well on the way to losing in Afghanistan. The first really didn't do much to break things and the second isn't heading in that direction either. Not really a surprise. Look at the loses suffered by any empire in history. England lost most of North America. Rome sent legions into the mists of the German forests, then lost the entire west of the empire. Until the structure becomes brittle enough to collapse on itself or, more likely, a stronger state emerges to take control the imperial state persists.<br><br>If you want to consider the next likely ground for asymmetric warfare, look at the computer in front of you.

Yes, long supply lines are a huge issue. As for causes -- er, we've been talking about the other reasons why the US empire will collapse for months now. A military defeat is just a likely trigger; there are plenty of other causes in place, as previously discussed. <br><br>Phil, the collapse of the US would bring major benefits to most of the other nations in the world -- just to start with, the 25% of world energy supply we currently use would be up for grabs. I'm sure there are plenty of people in capitals around the world who are aware of that math. <br><br>Mustard, good. I'm pretty sure Clarke had Germany in mind when he wrote his story. <br><br>Cam, that's a useful way of conceptualizing it -- too much specialization on a specific environment and a specific set of functions is pretty much a guarantee of failure in a changing world. <br><br>Siani, no argument there. <br><br>Evan, I'll check it out.

Check out the brouhaha about the Joint Strike Fighter aka F-35 Lightning II sometime -- brilliantly suited to its tactical mission of extracting the largest possible amount of money from defense budgets all over NATO; too bad it doesn't cope well with any other tactical mission. <br><br>Nano, good, but I have a slightly different scenario in mind. <br><br>Yuri, thanks for the links! One of the many problems is precisely that the really lavish big-ticket items are being paid for by cuts in other, less glamorous things that actually matter, like having enough soldiers, equipping them adequately, and rotating them out of combat zones for reasonable periods. Not to mention the dozens of relatively cheap, unglamorous bits of current tech that could be brought in to make the military more effective and even more resilient. <br><br>Jeffrey, don't push the argument from mutual dependence too far. Exactly the same argument was used before 1914 to insist that the nations of Europe couldn't possibly go to war with one another, since they were so economically dependent on each other.<br><br><a href=the-monkeywrench-wars.html#c1340258853179616031 title="comment permalink">8/23/12, 2:02 PM</a><br><br>

I suspect that the economic sphere is full of chaos, discord and confusion -- in the mock-technical senses I've given the words as well as their ordinary senses!<br><br>Dylan, I've already worked that into my scenario. I'll explain in the upcoming post on nuclear deterrence in an age of decline why, even in such a situation, lots of mushroom clouds are an unlikely outcome. <br><br>Sometulip, I'm far from sure that a US invasion force elsewhere couldn't be beaten -- and losing control of the air is one way that could happen. Nothing guarantees the US a perpetual monopoly on air power, especially when other nations are already fielding fighters better than ours. As for an assault on the US by terrorist means, that's a dubiously effective warfighting method -- it might just as easily harden the resolve of millions of Americans to make the other side pay in blood. As I'll discuss next week, the ultimate target in any war is the enemy's willingness to keep fighting, and terrorism has a poor record in that regard. <br><br>Raven, the major catastrophe is already happening. It's just happening slowly enough that people who are entranced by the thought of sudden collapse can't see it. I'm not counseling patience; I'm counseling people to get off their butts and take action, now, because this is what collapse looks like and we are already collapsing. <br><br>Tracy, excellent! There's a fascinating theory, btw, that the old British long barrows were artificial horizons, set high enough that observers could avoid the distorting effects of low atmospheric angles. <br><br>Modler, it's a very typical story. I wonder how many of the naval brass who ruled Van Riper's tactics unfair realize that at least a dozen hostile nations will have been taking copious notes. <br><br>Umber, actually, that's been considered at length. As I mentioned in last week's post, I'll be discussing the calculus of deterrence in an age of decline in a future post. There are very good reasons why politicians and military leaders in the real world -- as opposed to those in fiction -- are vanishingly unlikely to launch bombs at random. As for jamming GPS, who said it's going to be done the simple and stupid way? The more complex the technology, the more weaknesses it has that can be exploited. <br><br>Ando, thank you, but there are historians and ecologists who are quite a bit better at their trades than I am.

While there were some very impressive shots of test missiles firing and the like, one of the most intriguing things he had to say was about the adoption of technology in submarines.<br><br>It goes very slowly. Their computer systems were built custom using five to seven year old chips that had proved their reliability, and the software was also something that was heavily tested for years before being used. The reason for this was simple - if you are two miles down, a computer malfunction could turn your ship into a radioactive coffin. As such, they tended not to be anywhere near as attractive to the beltway bandits as the surface navy purchasing new jets, carriers and the like.<br><br>My suspicion is that a hot war naval scenario would burn off the surface craft within the first week, but after that, it would become a submarine war of attrition. However, what taking out the surface ships does, even more than eliminating the supporting jets, is that it destroys the ability to build supply lines for transporting troops, equipment and supplies. This to me would imply that any naval war would very quickly degenerate into a stalemate - the subs can threaten any advances, but cannot be used to deploy troops in numbers.<br><br>Keep the series up - it's very thought provoking.<br><br><a href=the-monkeywrench-wars.html#c5564009037556302616 title="comment permalink">8/23/12, 6:15 PM</a><br><br>

I have an active dislike for GPS. You know, I think it has changed the way people view spatial contexts. I've never conducted a survey, but when I speak with people about locations, they tell me how to get to a place and not where that place is located. I'm like, "just tell me the address".<br><br>On the other hand, I have to then tell people how to get to a location, rather than just give them an address and leave it up to them. Then, they ring me up half way going, "I'm at an intersection, there's this large tree". Grrrrr.... hehe! Oh well.<br><br>A funny story too. A mate of mine despite having a PhD in science thought I was playing jokes on him because his GPS was telling him that he could get to my address without using unmade roads. What, how’s that possible?<br><br>On a road trip a while back, with another mate, who despite having never travelled through the Central Highlands here, was insisting that I should take this dodgy back road because the GPS was advising him that it was a short cut, when I knew full well how bad that road was. The other strange thing about that trip was that he was obsessed with the GPS on the smart phone rather than appreciating the spectacular scenery. I've often wondered whether people are a bit frightened or detached from nature and that holding onto such devices gives them a connection back to the world they know?<br><br>I may be repeating myself, but the limitations of the military with fighting the last battle doesn't gel with observing and learning from an ecological system which is constantly changing and challenging. On the farm, I am in a constant state of the unknown about what the weather will bring. One year is radically different from the next and I suspect that this may be an Australian environment thing. As such, you have to learn to adapt your infrastructure to become resilient to extremes and this is by no means an efficient way to go.<br><br>I worry about your drought, because over here a drought can go on for years and given the US status as an agricultural export country, well... There is no quicker way to make enemies than to remove the feed trough.<br><br>PS: Don’t blame me, someone else brought up movies! I had a couple of hours to burn the other day so off I went to see the new Batman film. Man, that film is dark and full of cultural symbolism. It doesn’t say nice things about US culture or the perceived ability of the authorities to respond to crisis.<br><br>PPS: I thought that the Empire Strikes Back was the pinnacle of the Star Wars story.

Any increases in computing speed will quickly lead to more accurate forecasts.

General Paul K. Van Riper, used old methods to evade Blue's sophisticated electronic surveillance network.

Thus warned of Blue's approach, Red used a fleet of small boats to determine the position of Blue's fleet by the second day of the exercise. In a preemptive strike, Red launched a massive salvo of cruise missiles that overwhelmed the Blue forces' electronic sensors and destroyed sixteen warships. This included one aircraft carrier, ten cruisers and five of six amphibious ships. An equivalent success in a real conflict would have resulted in the deaths of over 20,000 service personnel. Soon after the cruise missile offensive, another significant portion of Blue's navy was "sunk" by an armada of small Red boats, which carried out both conventional and suicide attacks that capitalized on Blue's inability to detect them as well as expected.<br>*************<br><br>I don't think one could ask for a clearer demonstration of the kinds of issues JMG has been discussing in the last couple of blogs.<br><br><a href=the-monkeywrench-wars.html#c6268168295327540692 title="comment permalink">8/24/12, 8:57 AM</a><br><br>

I think you are correct in distinguishing between chaos, discord, and confusion and the predictable result of the diminishing return on US imperialism. However what I found even more interesting was applying your same three point analysis to your "End of the World this Week/Apocalypse Not" line of reasoning. Clearly you are assuming that the end of the world is a mythic thing that historically has been proven wrong time and time again with the implicit assumption that it isn't a “living thing” that can adapt to circumstance (like the metaphor of the hurricane and what if it could adapt). However what if the Apocalypse isn’t just myth, and there is a real Evil One, as in the devil, then the third option of confusion would be his greatest asset and his logical course of action. For the record I should disclose that I do believe that the Judeo-Christian scriptures are true and that there is an Evil One (and I know that a lot of people will ignore everything from this point on which is fine) but I also reject the analysis that modern western Christianity tries to use in these things and agree that it can often be over-simplified and plain wrong. The ancient Christians never dwelt on the end times per se, nor did the church fathers write very much about it. In fact it is virtually irrelevant to how you should live other than you should always be prepared to meet God. Anyway my main point is that you simply can’t use an a posteriori statistical analysis where all past behaviour of end-times predictions proved false and then leap to a cause and effect statement that since it never happened before it will never happen. I don’t think you have to even believe in a God or Devil to understand that climate change, the economic collapse of one global system, peak oil or any combination thereof is quantitatively and qualitatively different than any past experience in human history. In fact I can offer two clear examples that the apocalypse can be very real without any help from God or the Devil. Example one – if we have a global nuclear war the science clearly shows the survivors, if any, will be living in an apocalypse. Example two – the collapse of the closed Easter Island economy lead to the complete ending of all human life there and we now have an almost closed global economy/system. Your trivialization of the apocalypse meme seems to me to be pretty close to the cornucopian meme of faith that human resources are infinite so economic growth can be infinite. Anyway great post as always and I really enjoy reading your thoughts on things.<br><br>Chris Nicholas<br><br><a href=the-monkeywrench-wars.html#c8984397109719934290 title="comment permalink">8/24/12, 10:28 AM</a><br><br>

I'm assuming it was done as an elaborate pencil and paper sort of affair. Whoever was the game master would have to interpret the rules on the fly. How do they account for the unconventional? Motorcycle messengers, ok. How was that simulated? Did they just put a delay timer on the enacting of orders? "It takes x minutes per mile to relay this order, that site is 20 miles away, thus 20x delay in the order." I'm guessing that both sides were able to look at the specs for everything in the order of battle and agree on figures. How granular did they go with the simulation? Did they just say any suicide boat that gets within range of a ship has a 20% chance of making a hit? Did they simulate it down to .50 cal fire from sailors on deck? <br><br>You can lie to yourself so bad in these games depending on the assumptions you run with.

I wish I could say the same thing about ours. Glad to see that the hugelkultur project is progressing!<br><br>Diane, that's an interesting speculation. It's probably not an accident that this happened just as sadomasochism was beginning to creep out of the whip closet to become one of America's hot new fashion trends -- the runaway success of <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>, which is for sale at grocery stores here in Cumberland, is an interesting sign of the times. <br><br>Dan, oh, granted, but you can't argue morality with most people -- there's such a kneejerk reaction against it. That's why I stress the practical reality that it doesn't work. <br><br>Cherokee, current diesel-electric submarines are remarkably silent and difficult to track. Another example of older technology that's just as effective as the hot (in the radioactive sense) new stuff. <br><br>Goedeck, the T-34 was in its own way an awesome piece of machinery: take a rugged vehicle with a good sturdy engine, armor it to a fare-thee-well, arm it with the biggest and nastiest cannon you've got, and then turn it out by the thousands. As the Wehrmacht found out even before Kursk, the result was hard to beat. <br><br>Ivan, war profiteers go back a long way, though it's embarrassing to see the US contributing so many to the list these days. <br><br>Modler, true enough. I expect that steel-hulled ships will be the first new wave of sailing craft, though -- the windjammers of the late 19th century were in their own way a triumph of maritime technology. Wooden ships will have to wait until salvaged steel becomes scarce enough, and trees common enough, that the economics work. <br><br>Karim, it doesn't necessarily take a catastrophic defeat to bring down a modern empire -- neither the British nor the Spanish empires, for example, collapsed that way. What it takes is a shock at the right time, when the empire is already crumbling from within -- as ours is -- to set off a sequence of internal breakdowns that the empire doesn't survive. I'll be sketching out an example in the fictional scenario I've got in the works. <br><br>Unknown and Paul, er, you're respectively the fourth and fifth people (unless I lost count) to bring up that same story. It sometimes helps to glance down through the comments...<br><br>Nathan, I'd say rather that the fossilization of our major systems is the necessary condition for the major catastrophe.

It's crucial to realize that people who are wrong can believe, honestly and passionately, that they are right, and dismiss evidence that they're wrong in the same spirit with which you would dismiss the latest Pentagon press release. Access to accurate information means very little in the face of strong convictions; that's one of the massive challenges we face in trying to warn the world that the future of endless technological progress they think they've been promised isn't going to happen: no matter how strong the evidence may be, belief in what amounts to a secular religion of progress trumps it. <br><br>Steve, significantly more than half -- most of the Iranian missiles that crashed did so because they were poorly built, not because any of our missiles hit them. <br><br>Chris, if you want to be one of the people standing up there on the hilltops on December 21, 2012, waiting for the end of the world, don't let me stop you. For that matter, if you believe in the imminent arrival of the Great Pumpkin predicted by the prophet Linus, that's also your right.

You can put an industry on hyperdrive and churn out one plane a minute but it's impossible to prepare good pilots in seconds. Drones are an answer to that, it makes sure that you never lose pilots and to add to that drones are actually far less complex than conventional jet fighters and they beat pilot driven aircraft on every count be it the ability to withstand G forces or flying round the clock. Their application may be wrong but this is the future, currently Air Forces around the world are resisting the temptation to replace their fighter crafts with fighter drones for obvious reasons(the pilots will be out of job) but sooner or later it's bound to happen.

Pakistan is a good example. In its existential history of 65 years, it has been ruled for half the time by generals, who gutted every other sector of economy to feed the military machine.

I see it a lot in code systems: most complex systems start out with fairly simplistic requirements that establish structure but also create constraints. <br><br>Over time, as the system faces external impulses that were not accounted for in previous designs, features are added on, typically in an ad hoc fashion, dealing less with the initial problem and more with the constraints. <br><br>Eventually, the constraints become so limited that the ability of the system to facilitate the original requirements gets lost.<br><br>Put another way, a great deal of software (and no small amount of hardware) is written by people writing patches. Indeed, the Apache Web Server, one of the most widely used web servers in use today, received its name after one of the originally developers noted that the software was a patchy affair.<br><br>If you're a student of fractal curves, one curve set I've always found fascinating are <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve rel=nofollow>Peano Curves</a>. These are space filling curves that partition a space into ever finer divisions. I believe that constraints can be modeled via such curves, with the interesting consequence of this being that the stability of a system can be determined by the degree of space filling. <br><br>A good example of this came for me several years ago when I had just left a coffeeshop and looked at the asphalt parking lot outside of it. The lot was weathered, and there were a number of major cracks that had in turn spawned minor cracks. In certain portions of the lot, the cracks had become so space filling that these areas were little more than loose gravel and were dangerous to park on. Inflexibility in the system was bringing about collapse. I see this happening at the macro-level now.<br><br><a href=the-monkeywrench-wars.html#c5092962994442485425 title="comment permalink">8/25/12, 8:32 AM</a><br><br>

A professor at the University of Connecticut, he is a respected mathematical ecologist with a lengthy list of influential papers on animal movements and populations behind him. "It was a midlife crisis," he recalls. "I turned 40, and I had achieved tenure and some notoriety in population dynamics. At some point I thought, 'Where is the challenge?'" So he started looking for a new field where he could put his formidable mathematical chops to work. "It turns out that the only science that didn't have that already was history. The field was wide open." So Turchin rolled up his sleeves and began the familiar process of forming hypotheses and testing them."<br><br>"Reasoning that the fate of an empire rests ultimately on social cohesion, he has used historical records to track the prevalence of what he calls collective violence - deaths due to political assassinations, riots and civil wars, but not international wars or ordinary crimes - in three major civilisations, the Roman Republic, medieval Europe and Tsarist Russia. Applying mathematical tools borrowed from population biology, he has found that in each case deaths from collective violence follow two superimposed cycles, one spanning two to three centuries and the other about 50 years (Secular Cycles, Princeton University Press, 2009). What's more, he thinks his data provide enough leverage to understand what drives the longer cycle."<br><br>I thought this might be of interest to Arcdruid and readership (to read the whole article registration at NewScientist is neccessary, but that's free).

That won't be the theme of my next post, but yes, it's precisely relevant to the upcoming post on nuclear deterrence in an age of decline. <br><br>Allison, nicely phrased. The thing is, we will leave, whether we "can" or not.<br><br>Mark, a lot of that is what Jung called projection of the shadow -- a lot of people in the US these days are using the government as an inkblot on which to load their own unacknowledged craving for power. <br><br>Jennifer, I have no idea why anyone would buy a house in a neighborhood with restrictive covenants. When my wife and I went house shopping here in Cumberland three years ago, one of the first things we said to the realtor was that we didn't want anything of the kind, and he had no trouble finding us a place without nonsense of that kind. <br><br>Diane, no, it's new. I've been bombarded of late by spammers who want me to let them put up guest posts whoring various products and services to this blog's audience. <br><br>Sooper, I don't expect that ever to happen, for reasons I'll be discussing at length in an upcoming post.<br><br><a href=the-monkeywrench-wars.html#c6384521119500757796 title="comment permalink">8/28/12, 4:45 AM</a><br><br>

Bush, the country music fans screamed that the Dixie Chicks were un-American and needed to "shut up" and be silent.<br><br>But now Hank Williams Jr. and Ted Nugent have publicly denounced Obama as a Muslim, a Communist, and an America-hater (which are all charges that are simply not accurate), and they're paying no political price among country music lovers like the Dixie Chicks did.<br><br>So, I must admit I do have a somewhat low opinion of people in flyover country, because if this is typical behavior (and I don't know if it is or not, I don't live where you do), then I can only conclude that people in flyover country stand for "personal responsibility", unless you're ONE OF THEIR OWN, in which case you are above all criticism.<br><br>I could be wrong, though.

The idea of inevitable progress is so much ingrained in the western Europen philo from a couple of centuries up to now that the mere concept that a unsophisticated and weaker enemy can win a war is a hard pill to swallow .<br><br>Anyway, as i got late to the party ( you most likely are writing the next instalement at this point ), but just let me say the scenery that me and some of my friends ended getting for the crisis that will mark the decline of the United states ( our group is a bunch of guys that know since high school and that specialized in various parts of knowledge, from biology to history and we ended on this topic in one of those Sunday afternoons ... ).<br><br>Basically, at this point the only thing that is still keeping the US empire running is fear and a perception ( misguided or not ) that the US military has no real match since 1990. Any sense of affinity with the US based on values was pretty much eroded to dust in the last two decades except in countries that are suffering a similar evolution to autoritarism, so even the symphatetic feelings generated due to the 9/11 are long lost.<br><br>The issue is that both fear and the sense of impotence against the US can be lost by a simple thing: a lost war where the token Pride weapons ( the ones that the Empire in question uses to scare the "natives" ) are beaten. ANd to be honest, we could definitely see a war in the Persian gulf and with the US putting a task force or two inside it as it did in both Iraquian conflicts ending it with those task forces sunk, the 5th command abandoned or destroyed and with the US licking wounds.<br><br>OFC this is not enough to put the US Empire out ( note, we were talking of the US Empire, not the USA or the Americans ). But a cabal and solid defeat will only serve to show the negative side of a Empire of basis: the fact that, unlike what Sun Tzu preconized, someone that goes that path is outnumbered and weak <i>everywhere</i> ... and if someone beat the pride weapons, why can't "we" beat that ragtag bunch in that bunker up there ?...<br><br>Besides that the fact that the US would not be in control of the Hormuz strait would force inevitably a shift of alliances, especially in a context of scarcity of cheap oil ( that war would even exarcebate things ). We might not even think much of that, but the unspoken assumption that someone is keeping the Hormuz strait open to international navigation ( the strait after all is all national waters of Iran and Oman and only their bayonet forced "goodwill" allows the oil to get out without problems or uber taxing ) is a powerful tool in the hands of whoever has the navy to control it. And if the US Navy , doesn't, someone will ... and after that the main wealth pump of the Empire dries out.<br><br>Not saying that the US Empire will crumble to nothingness rapidly even if that happens: History is filled of cases of Empires that dwindled slowly for centuries after their heyday or even flourished after a serious and aparently unrecoverable defeat ( Rome, for example ). But, to be honest, i don't see internal conditions inside the USA to power up another global empire initiative for quite a while ...<br><br><a href=the-monkeywrench-wars.html#c2949524997672748346 title="comment permalink">8/28/12, 3:42 PM</a><br><br>

Countries that have nuclear weapons on their soil and don't want them anymore turn the bombs over to the U.S., which extracts the fissionable material, blends it with less enriched uranium until it isn't weapons grade any more, and then returns the uranium to the source country for free or a cut rate, to use in their reactors. <br><br>Some of the countries that have participated in this swords-to-ploughshares arrangement are former Soviet satellites. Others are developing nations that briefly got into the nukes game for status reasons, and were offered economic and political incentives to get out again. As a result, despite India and Pakistan getting the bomb, the number of countries known or suspected of having nuclear weapons is lower than it was fifteen or so years ago.<br><br>I remember seeing a segment on the Rachael Maddow show (she's a liberal cable news host) within the past year about a country that agreed to have all its nuclear weapons rounded up and shipped away on the Q. T. Unfortunately, I don't remember which country it was.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-monkeywrench-wars.html#c1718308454031732820 title="comment permalink">8/28/12, 5:39 PM</a><br><br>

Weed seeing his nation breaking up around him, there really isn't a 'United' States to defend any longer, so using missiles in defence of a nation that no longer exists would be pointless, even to the most megalomaniacal fanatic. If the troops at the keyboards even took orders any longer.<br>The break-up scenario is pretty much that described 30+ years ago by the soviet analyst (whose name I can neither remember nor find) whose conclusions were greeted by the rentier class with the same sort of derision as the Club of Rome report "Limits to Growth". Except Limits to Growth is coming true and I found the breakup hypothesis plausible back then and I believe it remains plausible, given the geographic size of the United States (and Canada).<br>Just my own observation (I haven`t studied this or anything) but it seems to me that whenever people inhabit an area, they tend to create their own local cultures, even within the context of a wider source-culture. In my own experience, I can see the differences between people in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, people in BC, people in Northern Ontario, people in Southern Ontario, all of whom come from the same root stock, at about the same time, and from the same culture, under the same government under Queen Victoria. The differences are shaped by the land: in BC it`s primarily extractive primary economy of mining and logging and maritime trade, across the prairies the prime economy is agricultural and energy supply, in northern Ontario, it`s extractive again, and in Southern Ontario it`s manufacturing and industry and finance. Each area seems to create a different mindset, the way different trades do: a plumber does not look at a building quite the same way a stonemason does. <br>Now I have not enough first-hand experience of the U.S. to say confidently, but from what I have heard, read, and the little I do know, I see the same regional tendencies existing there, so, given enough motivation, and increasing loss of faith in central authority, I`d say another break-up is more likely than not, but this time without a rising central power to counter the devolution.<br>It`s a natural course across history: nations come together, then break up into smaller nations, then reunite. History shows us this happened in Germany, France, Central Europe, Russia/USSR, China, and India over the course of millennia. I see no reason why not continental North America, too.<br><br><a href=the-monkeywrench-wars.html#c6424046263769350194 title="comment permalink">10/18/12, 7:04 AM</a><br><br>
