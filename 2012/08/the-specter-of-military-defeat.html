I’ve come to think that the single greatest obstacle that stands in the way of a clear understanding of the predicament of our age is the insistence that the past has nothing to teach the present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You might think that after the recent crescendo of speculative bubbles, the phrase "it’s different this time" would have gotten a well-earned rest, having been worked nearly to death by the promoters of the dot-com and real estate bubbles. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No such luck; those of my readers who follow the comments on these essays will have noted how often that same claim gets used by those who insist the future must obey the fantasies that modern industrial culture demands of it. Progress and apocalypse, business as usual forever or overnight collapse, are the Tweedledee and Tweedledoom of the modern imagination, and the mere fact that history doesn’t work that way is easy enough to brush aside by claiming that modern industrial society is so much more—fill in your preferred adjective here—than any past society, and therefore it’s perfectly justifiable to dismiss history and insert the warmed-over religious myth of your choice in its place. The fact that the identical argument gets used to bolster arguments for both alternatives simply adds to the irony. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I mention this here because the topic we’ll be exploring over the next few weeks tends to draw the insistence that "it’s different this time" the way a dead rat draws flies. I intend to talk about the role of the US military in the downfall of American empire, and the suggestion I propose to offer is that one of the most likely triggers for an American imperial collapse is the experience of dramatic military defeat. I’m not suggesting, furthermore, that such an experience will happen in spite of the immense power of today’s US military machine; I’m suggesting that it will almost certainly happen <i>because</i> of that vast preponderance of force. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve commented before that nothing seems so permanent as an empire on the verge of its final collapse, or as invulnerable as an army on the eve of total defeat. That’s a good general rule, but it’s even more crucial to keep in mind in thinking about military affairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The history of war is full of cases in which the stronger side—the side with the largest forces, the strongest alliances, the most advanced military technology—was crushed by a technically weaker rival.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That unexpected outcome can take place in many different ways, but all of them are a function of one simple and rarely remembered fact: military power is never a single uncomplicated variable. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Any number of examples could be cited, but the one I’d like to bring up here was usefully anatomized in Robert Drews’ 1993 book
<i>the End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe of c. 1200 B.C</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I trust my readers will forgive a somewhat lengthy excursus into what, for most people these days, is an unfamiliar corner of the past. Those who know little and care less about the late Bronze Age should follow along anyway; once we get past the exotic details, the story may begin to seem oddly familiar. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The eastern Mediterranean in the 13th century BCE was at or near the cutting edge of technological complexity at that time, and that inevitably expressed itself on the field of war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Earlier, battles used to be fought by lines of massed infantry using spears, but the rise of a new suite of technologies—the horse-drawn chariot, and new and powerful composite bows—revolutionized warfare, allowing relatively small armies of highly mobile and mechanized troops to run rings around old-fashioned infantry armies and cut them down from a distance with lethal firepower. If you want to call the resulting mode of warfare "blitzkrieg," you won’t be too far off. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Chariots, by the standards of the time, were a complex and expensive technology, and they required the highly trained personnel on the front lines and the large and expensive organizational systems behind the lines that complex and expensive military technologies always do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The superpowers of the day, Egypt, Assyria, and the Hittite Empire, put quite a bit of their annual budgets into chariot procurement and related costs, fielding anything up to several thousand chariots for major battles; smaller nations, most of them client states of one of the big three, had their own more modest chariot armies. Since a relatively small chariot army could defeat a much bigger force of spearmen, most kingdoms didn’t<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>bother to have any more infantry than they needed to man the walls of fortresses and add a few extra pompous circumstances to the royal court. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was a stable, rich, technologically advanced society—and then, over a few decades to either side of 1200 BCE, it crashed into ruin. The Hittite capital was sacked, its empire collapsed, and the Hittites as an independent people vanished from history forever. City-states from Mycenean Greece straight down the eastern Mediterranean littoral to the borders of Egypt were sacked, burned, and abandoned. Surviving documents refer to unknown ships appearing suddenly off the coast, and record frantic pleas to allies for military aid. Finally, in 1179 BCE, the raiders come into the full light of history as the Sea Peoples—that’s the name the Egyptians used for them—launched an all-out assault on Egypt itself. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What made the raiders all but unstoppable, Drews showed, was that they had come up with a suite of military technologies and tactics that efficiently crippled chariot armies. Their key weapon was the javelin. Chariot armies depended on mobility and the ability to maneuver in close formation; swarming attacks by light infantry, who could get in among the chariots and use javelins to injure, kill, and panic the chariot horses, shattered the maneuverability that made chariot armies otherwise invincible. Combine that with fast ships that allowed the raiders to come out of nowhere, annihilate armies sent to stop them, pillage and burn every town within sight, and vanish again, and you have the recipe for a shattering military revolution. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And Egypt?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Egypt survived and triumphed, in a thoroughly Egyptian way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was the oldest of the superpowers of its era, and the most conservative; it had a modern chariot army, but it also still had the knowledge base and infrastructure necessary to organize and use an old-fashioned army of massed infantry armed with spears and shields. That’s what Ramses III and his generals did, scrapping their chariots and returning to an older and more resilient way of warfare, and so the Sea Peoples crashed headlong into an enemy that had none of the weaknesses on which their tactics depended. The resulting battles were the kind of straightforward slugging match where sheer numbers count most, and Egypt had them; the Sea Peoples got the stuffing pounded out of them, and the survivors scattered to the far corners of the Mediterranean world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There were many other factors that fed into the long and bitter dark age that followed the invasions of the Sea Peoples, but let’s concentrate on the military dimension for the time being. Egypt and the Hittite Empire were pretty much equal in military terms; the great battle between them at Kadesh in 1275 BCE ended in an Egyptian retreat, but the forces pitted against one another were of equivalent size and effectiveness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The loose coalition of barbarian chiefdoms that the Egyptians called the Sea Peoples was immeasurably inferior to either one in conventional military terms—that is to say, they had no chariots, no chariot horses, no composite bows, and military budgets that were a tiny fraction of those of the superpowers of the day. Furthermore, the weapons systems used by the Sea Peoples were radically simpler than those of the superpowers, almost embarrassingly primitive compared to the complex technology of chariot warfare. That didn’t keep them from bringing the Hittite Empire down in flames and posing a threat to Egypt that only a stroke of military genius nullified in time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The central lesson to be learned from this bit of ancient history is that <i>military power is always contextual</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What counts as overwhelming power in one context can be lethal weakness in another, and the shift from one context to another can take place without warning. Thus it’s never safe to say that because one nation has a bigger military budget, or more of whatever the currently fashionable military technology happens to be, than another, the first nation has more military power than the other. In fact, if the first nation has enough of an advantage, and the second nation has the brains the gods gave geese, the first nation is very possibly cruising for a bruising. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s look at another example, one that I’ve cited here more than once already: the British Empire on the eve of its dismemberment. In 1900, it was official policy that the British military was to be able to take on the next two largest powers in the world at any moment, and beat them both. That commitment drove a hugely expensive naval building program, backed by research and development so rapid that the world’s most powerful battleship in 1906, the then-newly commissioned HMS Dreadnought, was hopelessly obsolete by the time war broke out in 1914.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That and millions of pounds spent elsewhere made Britain, by every conventional measure, the strongest military power in the world at that time.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The problem, as mentioned earlier, was that most of that gargantuan expenditure went into projects that didn’t amount to a hill of beans when war finally came. Britain’s vast naval fleet spent most of the war tied up to the quays, waiting for the inferior German fleet to come out and fight; when the latter finally did so, the result was the inconclusive Battle of Jutland, after which both fleets sat out the rest of the war in port.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A fraction of that money put into developing antisubmarine warfare, say, or jolting the British Army out of its 19th century notions of strategy and tactics, might have had a significant impact on the war, but battleships were central to the British notion of how wars were supposed to be fought, and so battleships were where the money went. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s more, after the First World War ended and the Second loomed, the British military remained fixated on the same kind of thinking. While rising powers such as Japan and the United States flung their resources into aircraft carriers and laid the foundations for the future of naval warfare, Britain dabbled in naval aviation and entrusted its defense to battleships. Only a near-total failure of strategic imagination in the Kriegsmarine, Germany’s naval arm, kept that from being fatal; if Nazi Germany had paid attention to its Japanese ally, built half a dozen aircraft carriers before the war, and used those to carry out a Pearl Harbor-style strike on the British Navy in the spring of 1940, Britain would have been left wide open to an invasion across the Channel once France fell. As it was, most British naval forces in the Pacific were efficiently targeted and destroyed by Japanese planes early in the war. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Chariots and battleships are simply two examples of a common theme in military history:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>any military technology that becomes central to a nation’s way of war attracts a constituency—a group that includes officers who have made their careers commanding that technology, commercial interests who have made their money building and servicing that technology, and anyone else who has an economic or personal stake in the technology—and that constituency will defend their preferred technology against the competition until and unless repeated military defeat makes its abandonment inescapable. One weapon such constituencies routinely wield is the military scenario that assumes that the enemy must always make war in whatever way will bring out their preferred technology’s strengths, and never exploit its weaknesses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As far as I know, whatever literature ancient Egyptian chariot officers, horse breeders, and bow manufacturers may have churned out to glorify chariot warfare to the Egyptian reading public has not survived, but there’s an ample supply of books and articles from British presses between 1875 or so and the Second World War, praising the Royal Navy’s invincible battleships as the inevitable linchpin of British victory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All this literature was produced to bolster the case for building and maintaining plenty of battleships, which was to the great advantage of naval officers, marine architects, and everyone else whose careers depended on plenty of battleships.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The fact that all this investment in battleships was a spectacular waste of money that might actually have done some good elsewhere did not register until it was too late to save the British Empire. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If my readers have any doubt that the same sort of literature is currently being churned out by the constituencies of today’s popular Pentagon weapons systems, I encourage them to visit the nearest public library and check out a copy of Tom Clancy’s 1999 puff piece <i>Carrier: A Guided Tour of an Aircraft Carrier</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It’s a 348-page sales brochure for the most elaborate piece of military technology ever built, a modern nuclear aircraft carrier, which currently fills the same role in the US military that the battleship filled in that of imperial Britain. You needn’t expect to find substantive analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of this hugely expensive technology, or of the global military strategy or the suite of tactics that give it its context; again, this is a sales brochure, and it’s meant to sell carriers—or, more precisely, continued funding for carriers—to that fraction of the American people that concerns itself sufficiently with military affairs to write the occasional letter to its congresscritters. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The inevitable military scenario comes in the last chapter, where Clancy demonstrates conclusively that if a hopelessly outgunned and outclassed Third World nation were ever to launch a conventional naval attack against a US carrier group, the carrier group will probably be able to figure out some way to win. It would be a masterpiece of unintended comedy, if it weren’t for the looming shadow of all those other books before it, singing the praises of past military technologies whose many advantages didn’t turn out to include any part in winning or even surviving the next war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nor are carriers the only currently popular weapons system that benefits from this sort of uncritical praise; the US military is riddled with them, and thus with a series of potentially fatal vulnerabilities that rest partly on the unmentioned weaknesses of those technologies, and partly on a series of impending changes to the context of military action that follow from points we’ve discussed here many times already. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To sum up in advance the points I hope to make in the next few weeks, the US military faces at least three existential threats in the decades immediately ahead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first is that rising powers will devise ways to monkeywrench the baroque complexity of the US military machine, leaving that machine as crippled and vulnerable as Hittite chariots were before the javelins of the Sea Peoples. The second is that an ongoing revolution in military affairs will leave the entire massive arsenal of the US military as beside the point as all those British battleships were once the Second World War rolled around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The third is that the decline in fossil fuel supplies will make it impossible for the United States to maintain a way of war that, reduced to its simplest terms, consists of burning more petroleum than the other guy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We’ll talk about the first of these possibilities next week. </div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: large">End of the World of the Week #35</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the more overhyped bestsellers of 1997, Michael Drosnin’s <i>The Bible Code</i> got its fifteen minutes of fame by claiming that the Hebrew text of the Old Testament contains concealed letter sequences that predicted such then-recent events in Jewish history as the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin. What was more, these same codes predicted that the end of the world would occur via a nuclear holocaust in 2006. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The sequences are there, too. The way the Bible Code works is simple: you take the entire Hebrew text of the Old Testament and program a computer to skip through it, taking every second letter, every third letter, every fourth letter, and so on, until you find the sequence you’re looking for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If this suggests to you, dear reader, that you can find anything you’re looking for, you’re quite correct; according to an online Bible Code calculator I consulted, the phrase "Elvis shot JFK" can be found no less than three times in the Bible using Drosnin’s method. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A believer might take that as proof that Elvis, hidden in a sniper’s perch on the grassy knoll, fired three shots at JFK’s limousine. Those of us less convinced in the accuracy of such prophetic methods are welcome to find other interpretations—and, of course, the hard fact remains that the nuclear holocaust in 2006 didn’t happen. </div>

In the early stages of the conflict, the ARA Veinticinco de Mayo was at sea and close to attacking the RN Task Force, only to be thwarted by bad weather. Then the cruiser ARA General Belgrano was sunk by the submarine HMS Conqueror, so Veinticinco de Mayo was withdrawn to port and played no further part - her aircraft deployed to operate from shore bases during the remainder of the conflict. Indeed, HMS Spartan, another submarine, was looking to find and sink that carrier. ARA Veinticinco de Mayo remained in service until 1997, and was not replaced. <br><br>Although the British military prevailed in 1982, it was described by a senior officer as a ‘close run thing’. Many surprising lessons had to be relearned, such as firefighting and damage control aboard ships. Had the Argentines fielded more than just five air-launched Exocet anti-ship missiles in their inventory, the fate of HMS Hermes and HMS Invincible may well have been sealed. <br><br>As things stand thirty years on, the UK has decided it can’t afford either Harriers, or carriers for now. HMS Ark Royal – sister ship to HMS Invincible, since scrapped - has been decommissioned. Nor do we have any Nimrods to patrol above our seas. But while these ‘capability gaps’ are upon us, we fear not, for we have two huge carriers being built. Hurrah! Though the second one is apparently some kind of contractual obligation signed in error, as we actually now only want the one in occasional service, in between refits. Perhaps the other could be converted to a prison hulk. Regarding the carrier procurement, all sorts of other mistaken planning assumptions appear to have been made. For example, that there will be affordable bunker fuel for the next thirty years, paid for with the economic growth that hasn’t appeared like it used to. It’ll have a handful of some sort of F-35 for the air complement – hovering or arrestor hook variety, well, we vacillated on that too. And we can be assured that all this vast expense won’t hollow out the rest of the RN fleet even more. <br><br>Of course, their Lordships at the Admiralty will be the next generation on from those that understood that both the hunter-killer submarine and sea-skimming anti- ship missile render carriers particularly vulnerable. Instead, it’s grandstanding, splendid isolation, and gunboat diplomacy - operating independent of ‘host nation support’ in an uncertain world, against tin-pot Third World entities. For their Lordships, I daresay there are lucrative second careers and consultancies to be had in the shipbuilding industry, too. <br><br>Admiral of the Fleet John Arbuthnot "Jacky" Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher of Kilverstone, would be spinning in his grave. <br><br><br>Mustard <br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c6607383494221524997 title="comment permalink">8/16/12, 3:16 AM</a><br><br>

This why armies always bankrupt their homelands, because eventually they run out of resources in conquered territories, and look to the ‘home’ nation for support. We Brits were convinced we could afford a European army in 1914, and bankrupted ourselves , then compounded it in 1939. America in the modern context is a little different, in that initially they bought their loot (oil) until the arabs wised up to the fact they were being robbed anyway and quadrupled the price. Now the US military is committed to protecting that oilflow or face certain total societal and economic collapse. So now political/industrial/military systems have become intermingled, and politicians try to have their particular defence factory supported by the taxpayer ad infinitum. Once established, they must justify their existence, demanding bigger and better wartoys, and more tiers of rank and hierarchy against outside threats, whether real or imagined. Communities never accept that their particular factory is unaffordable, they want to keep their jobs.<br>To add to the insanity, Governments insist that military production is part of GDP, even though it’s paid for out of taxation, money extracted from taxpayers from previous GDP output.<br>It is all ultimately futile of course, but nobody is allowed to point out that taxpayers are paying for their gas at the pumps, then paying three times that much to pay the army that protects it, and that the entire edifice is a Ponzi scheme anyway.<br>The community is no longer prosperous, but it struggles to pay to secure oil supplies to keep the world economy ticking over for a few more years.<br>Since WW2, America has poured out treasure to this end, to maintain the illusion of a world superpower, and as a result is also bankrupt. The military complex must collapse, and as it does so we are facing a very different future. http://www.yourmedievalfuture.com/<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c1563510174222908541 title="comment permalink">8/16/12, 4:16 AM</a><br><br>

In the 1990’s, American troops were withdrawn from Somalia, their mission abandoned, after photos of a dead soldier’s body being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu swayed American resolve. Osama Bin Laden made note of the incident saying, “one American was dragged in the streets of Mogadishu -- you left; the extent of your impotence and weaknesses became very clear.” http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/u-s-marine-dragged-through-mogadishu/ <br><br>But he was not the only one to take notes. There were other hot spots on the globe. An international effort was underway to depose usurper and tyrant, Duvalier, and to restore democratically elected Aristide to power in Haiti. Supporters of dictator Duvalier were watching: “Haitian leaders watched in fascination as U.S. Congressmen debated the deployment of American soldiers on Sunday news programs. They could not fail to notice that many representatives opposed sending any troops at all. The message was unmistakable, and so were its implications: The United States was weak and irresolute. If the Americans could be persuaded that Haiti was "another Somalia," the Clinton administration would be forced to back down. . . . The climax of the drama came on October 11, when the U.S.S. Harlan County was prevented from docking by an angry mob. The subsequent decision to withdraw the ship from Haitian waters was taken without consultation with or even notification of the United Nations, President Aristide or Prime Minister Maval. It left the impression that the United States had cut and run; worse, that it had been frightened away by a few hundred unruly thugs.” http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub47.pdf<br><br>I remember the incident, which has now become so buried that it took some time to unearth any reference. The Somalis dragged one dead soldier through the streets and it was enough to defeat 'the world’s greatest military.’ All the Haitians had to do was throw rocks and smash car windows and America backed down. The troops finally did land and Aristide was restored to power, but the lesson lingers.<br><br>I am not weighing in on the ‘rightness’ or ‘wrongness’ of any of the above. I am only making an observation on what appears to be at least one Achilles’ heel of the American military machine, all classical references fully intended.<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c860248103188674702 title="comment permalink">8/16/12, 8:09 AM</a><br><br>

The idea of "the more things change, the more they stay the same" is equally frustrating. <br><br>In an era which holds the possibility of push-button extermination of entire nations, and much of planetary life as it is, is undeniably different, militarily, than any previous reality. The power of the Ark Of The Covenant no longer exists only in the minds of those who carry it.

How would the conflicts of the past which you cite have been different had such options been available, on such a scale?<br><br>A growing awareness that our species is backing itself into a corner, leaving itself few options, may not be so different from the awareness societies of the past have had when faced with a dramatically superior force and elimination from the scheme of things, but the options for acting upon this ultimate desperation have advanced immensely. At what point does deterrence morph into determination? Sociopaths have convenient ways of giving themselves permission without seeking permission, elaborate justifications for the horror they impose. The past also tells us this.<br><br>I don't waste much energy contemplating any "Final Solution" that may occur, nor do I think it's particularly useful to dwell upon how "this time is different", and I expect that's your point in all of this. As I've said, my response, my path, will be the same. I believe that there's a 'groove' that each one of us must find, and devote most our energy to; one that involves resilience, respect for one's environment and fellow creatures, and especially the future, seems like a win/win, and requires a bit of faith.

It's not just chaotic; it's computationally irreducible. Meaning, among other things, that any omitted or mis-estimated variable can change the entire outcome, in the same way that one wrong digit in a long multiplication problem can quickly change every digit of the result. The law of computational irreducibility (which would definitely be one of the Seven Laws of Computational Hermetics, if any such list existed) states that for any system surpassing a certain minimum level of complexity, the only way to learn the outcome is to run the system.<br><br>Of course the U.S. military has weaknesses. One likely one, typical of small expensive highly capable forces, is being overwhelmed by a much larger lower-tech force. (Every war gamer trying out a new game will at least consider the strategy of fielding the maximum number of the cheapest available unit, because it so often works.) However, that didn't prove a problem in Desert Storm when many people predicted it would be. (The "peace" that followed has been a different story, of course.) <br><br>What spins the system into unpredictability is, in essence, that counter-forces designed to exploit a weakness have weaknesses of their own. <br><br>I don't know yet whether JMG's range of predictions encompass invasions of the U.S. mainland. It's likely that whatever exploit succeeds in defeating the U.S. abroad would not serve very well on the continent. Under the conditions where such an invasion might occur, the country could become WWII Russia or a giant Somalia, with no possibility of pacifying the population. To have any change of breaking even resource-wise, an invader might be forced to attempt all-out extermination, which would motivate all-out resistance. Outcome: computationally unpredictable, and a nightmare scenario for any military planner.<br><br>(An invasion occurring once collapse is well along might be a different matter, for instance if the land is depopulated or the populace already starving.

But when larger heterogeneous groups try to make decisions by consensus, serious problems often arise. By prioritising the will of the individual, the process allows small minorities, even a minority of one to thwart decisions that the majority of the community supports. And individuals will dissent, for not every community member will agree with every given decision; nor should they do so. Conflict is endemic to politics, a sine qua non, indeed a circumstance of its existence, and dissenters are (fortunately) ever-present. Some individuals will always feel that a particular decision is not beneficial, either to their own interests or to the public good.<br><br>But communities that govern themselves by a consensus process often reach consensus by manipulating dissidents into going along with the majority position, or even coercing them sub rosa, using psychological pressure or making discreet threats. This type of coercion may not happen in public view – it could, and often does, happen outside the scrutiny of assembly. But it would be no less coercive for that, and it would be more pernicious.<br><br>When the issue in question comes up for a vote, the coerced or manipulated dissenters tend to let themselves go on public record in favour of the measure, perhaps to avoid offending the majority – despite their strong opposition to it. |n that case their very real dissent is no longer a matter of public record, a respected if failed effort. Indeed their dissent would be erased as if it had never existed, much to the detriment of the group's political development.<br><br>Alternatively, if dissenters cannot be pressured to change their vote, they may be successfully pressured into declining to vote at all. That is, they may “choose” to withdraw from the decision-making process on that issue – to “stand aside,” in the jargon of the consensus procedure. But this choice, in effect, nullifies the dissenter as a political being. It resolves the problem of dissent essentially by removing the dissenter from the political sphere and eliminating the dissenting view from the forum of ideas. <br><br>By insisting on unanimous agreement, consensus either intensifies conflict to the point of fracturing the community, or else it silences dissent altogether. Rather than respect minorities it mutes them. A far more honourable and morally healthy way of handling dissent is to allow dissidents to vote openly, with high visibility, in accordance with their beliefs, with the prospect of altering the decision in the future and potentially fostering the political development of the community...”<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c2556794180077449793 title="comment permalink">8/16/12, 1:45 PM</a><br><br>

Cherokee is right that the infrastructure needed to maintain them is dependent on fossil fuels, so they will eventually become unusable. However, the time when we have declined that far is still a ways off, which leaves time when there's still a possibility of nuclear war. I doubt there will be a full-scale nuclear war, but the threat of one certainly changes things, as it has since 1945. I suspect much of the "this time is different" meme when speaking of millitary and politics comes from the nuclear threat. I don't hear anyone claiming that it's different now because of aircraft carriers or because of the newest fighter planes, it's always the nukes. I don't think the US or any nuclear power would use them on an overseas war, as the consequences would be too severe, but if there was a direct invasion of their homeland, they could take drastic measures.<br><br>I guess it's possible that there could be developments that counter the nuclear missiles so well as to make them beside the point, I just have trouble seeing that happening in a world of declining energy considering that nothing has been developed that would do that in the over sixty years of cheap energy that have passed since nuclear weapons arrived on the scene. So, I expect the threat will be there until all the nuclear powers collapse far enough that the infrastructure maintaining them falls apart.<br><br>I don't see the "this time is different" idea as totally unsupported by history. To name one example, consider the European conquest of the Americas. The native peoples had their share of conflict and hard times before 1491, but the scale of destruction and upheaval that occurred from the Europeans and the diseases they brought was unprecedented in their history. If a native had said when the first white men landed, "This time is different, this is way more than just another war with the Iroquois" they would have been right. I look at nuclear weapons and see the potential to bring to us a scenario as dramatic as what the Europeans brought to the Americas. <br><br>I very much hope there is no major nuclear war in our future, and I don't base my life around such scenarios. I agree with you that many people use fast crash scenarios as an excuse for inaction, and that's a major problem in our culture. I just don't see that as the whole picture. There are many out there such as myself who don' desire such a scenario and don't even think it's all that likely, but just think it's one of the many possibilities that has a potential for happening.<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c7698385725203511375 title="comment permalink">8/16/12, 1:57 PM</a><br><br>

The story of warfare is pretty much made of "invicible" weapons that end being defeated by brains and not necessarily hi-tech counters ( my favourite is a Spanish tercio in the time of Philip II being beaten by some proposedely enraged bulls pitted against them ). And I guess that with so many people resurfacing the USN resurfacing of their carriers ( ;) ) only shows that a lot of people recognize that the carrier nowadays is pretty much a status weapon ( I'm from the opinion that both the tank and and the carrier as fighting weapons are obsolete since 1944 ... and the shiny painting of the jet fighter/ attack helicopter pilot in knightly colors by the official bards also does not pass the sniff test ). I can recall that when I seen last time a USN carrier entering Lisbon harbour ( for you americans, the Lisbon harbour is so much alike San Francisco in geographical and climateric terms that we actually hired the guys that made the Golden gate brigde to make a equal for Lisbon ) a year or so ago and I simply thinked that even a XVIII century howlitzer could sink it easily with them exposing themselves like that...<br><br>Anyway, I just wanted to point 2 things ...<br><br> The first is that IMHO the biggest weakness of the American strategy is what is normally refered to as empire of bases. It is not the first time that a country tries to do that ( I live in one that tried, so I recognize it quite well ) and it always ended the same way so far: the system as a whole becomes a bunch of highly immobile fortress garrisons spread around whose only propose is to show face to the "natives" and a highly mobile elite group that ends going around putting fires out. Then the growing ressentement of the "natives" added to the ever decreasing utility of that extra fortress that is always needed to protect that extra area ends making sure that there will be a time when there will be simply too much fires to take down for the elite team ... and then either the system collapses fast or it limps out losing base after base , depending of the average resilience of the garrisons and the fight that the ruling elite still has in it regarding keeping the empire, no matter what. I do not see the Americans breaking that streak, especially given the heavy logisitcs the average American soldier has behind, that puts a level of stress in top of the whole system completely unheard off in the previous interactions.<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c2601074009959407854 title="comment permalink">8/16/12, 4:52 PM</a><br><br>

First , on the Egyptian war chariots ... it is extremely hard to breed horses below the 33º N paralell in real life ( not the Dubai current version ) , especially the agile and strong horses needed for war chariots. So the Egyptian army had to pretty much import the bulk of their war chariot horses from greener pastures ... that probably explains why they were able to forget about trying to use them : most likely they didn't even had enough horses to push more than the bigwigs chariots by the time the Sea peoples got in top of them, due to the disruption of the trade networks north of them. Second is about the Kriegsmarine remark ... like someone already posted, it takes a while to make and man up a carrier ( another vulnerability ) and in fact the Germans were planning to do so ( their first carrier , the Graf Zeppelin, was planned to get out of the forge in 1940 ). The big issue was that Hitler had prommised to the KM planners that Gemany would avoid a world class conflict up to 1946, and thus they planned the builds with that date in mind, starting by the cheap raiders ( the U-boats ) and the dedicated anti RN-battleship battleships ( the Bismarck class ... you can see easily what a pack of Bismarck could had done to the RN by the fact that Bismarck alone forced the RN to use basically all the avaliable ships between London and Iceland to catch it and even then the Germans won handily in terms of metric damage to the enemy ) ... but, as we know, the war came a litle earlier than that and the KM was pretty much caught red handed.<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c7341432594752378532 title="comment permalink">8/16/12, 4:57 PM</a><br><br>

When Israel tangled with Hezbollah several years ago, Hezbollah "manpads" wiped out a LOT of IDF armor, and slowed down the advance to a crawl. Israel responded by bombing the s--- out of Lebanon, to force the rest of the country to rein in Hezbollah. <br><br>There were some excellent analyses of the reality of the battle, which I've since lost; but it appeared to me to be a harbinger of future warfare. <br><br>It must have been closely noted by the US (along with the effectiveness of IED's against armor) because my understanding is that the US Army will soon discontinue purchasing of tanks. <br><br>Oh, and close relatives of the manpad can be very effective against attack helicopters. Soon the modern mechanized army will be reduced to not much more than heavy infantry (with body armor), especially in urban areas, even if oil was to remain cheap. All armored vehicles, ground or air, are becoming extremely vulnerable to VERY cheap and increasingly sophisticated missiles. <br><br>Javelins are cheap, chariots are expensive. Once a javelin can take out a chariot, the chariot is dead except as a showy vehicle for heros. Works with longbow vs horse mounted armor, and manpads vs modern armor. <br><br>As always, looking forward to next week's essay!<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c7840642506705378434 title="comment permalink">8/16/12, 4:58 PM</a><br><br>

Here is what they discovered ( and I was graced to observe personally) what goes on when a single fly approaches a hive:<br>The single little female fly scouts over the hives mound methodically, searching for just the right little foraging ant to “zombify”. What the astute observer realizes is that the above ground ant members somehow sense the winged attacker, they go into a panic mode.. running “ Helter-skelter back to the hive- ( in a most un antlike, uncoordinated manner). This brief intrusion by a single little fly , trying to lay her couple of hundred eggs, sets the ant empire into – essentially- a siege situation.. Foraging ants will not scout and retrieve food effectively, panic sets in, supply lines are distrupted… and this is enough… under a regular simple attack by a few flies… to affect reproduction.. enough to keep the empire from not only expanding, but creating a kind of ant “Catabolic collapse” of the colonly.. No, the empire is not exterminated, but lack of resources leads to reduced growth. …. Hmmm…. Sounds familiar?

It is true that there's a general tendency in warfare for sucessful warring states to keep stuck "figthing the last war", both WWI and WWII being very good examples of that.<br><br>WWI was fought based on the napoleonic experience, when decisive action and bold attacks broke the stalemate, siege-prone XVII mode of warfare, and it promptly failed in the face of the machine gun, barbed wire and the railroad. The french, having won WWI, tried to fight it again on WWII, with predictable disastrous results. <br><br>Having said that, most empires don't get military defeated by innovative low-tech upstarts. They usually over-extend themselves and an up and coming power (usually as advanced as the superpower, if on a smaller scale) then tips the point.<br><br>That's what happened to the Spanish Empire which is, incidentally, in my own opnion, the best "historical match" for the USA. They got over-extended, specially in the Low-contries, and the second-best power of the time (France) encouraged the various groups opposing Spain all the time, until such a time as a new form of warfare (equally high-tech) began to emerge in Flandres and the german battlefields, culminating in the defeat of the spanish tercios at Rocroi by the french.<br><br>Incidentally, while the way the US maintain it's empire, with the Carrier Groups, foreign air bases, GPS, surveilance sattelites, etc, etc, is eminently prone to be "jammed" and otherwise interfered with by means that other people already wrote about (notably, the carrier groups are very vulnerable), the US itself is more like Egypt in your tale. It is far too big, far too geographically isolated, far too populous and far too well-armed (with the old-fashioned kind of weaponry that would do very well, i.e, the massive ammount of private firearms) to be seriously threatened. It's a bit kind of like Russia. Sure, from time to time they lose their ability to project power (the latest being the fall of the USSR, which they are still recovering from), but it is damn near imposible for anyone else to actually "conquer" russia. You can harass the Bear into retreating into it's cave, but you can't poke it too closely.

That's old school. We have seen that smaller organizations (Al-Qaida for instance) can wage a war without being encumbered by belonging to a country. The response of blaming a country for hosting them and taking military action against that country might slow the activity down, won't necessarily stop it, but also underscores our lack of readiness to get beyond the old-school response so we pick a country and beat it up. Invading and occupying all the countries in the world won't stop it. I picture countryless little mice slashing at the Achilles' heels of empire elephants.

Since our access to them ultimately runs against the self-interest of most of the countries in which they are found, our only recourse, alas, is to rely on force and corruption.

I think you'll find you're quite wrong -- but we'll get to that. <br><br>Jason, that's one of the hypotheses. It's a lively field of ancient history, well worth following. <br><br>John, the effective defense against drones is computer hacking. That's how the Iranians got one of our surveillance drones to land on one of their airstrips a little while back. You can spoof their GPS readings, too. Faced with a technologically astute opponent, drones are overrated. <br><br>DaShui, what I'm discussing has been talked about elsewhere for some years; it's not much discussed in the peak oil scene, though. As for the article, it's making some huge assumptions; more on this later. <br><br>Mallow, the best measure is whether or not you've got US military bases on your territory. Britain certainly does; I don't happen to know about Ireland -- though Ireland these days is basically a client state of Germany via the EU, so it may be a client of a client. <br><br>Lauren, I'm not an expert, but my reading suggests that EMP is a lot harder to use effectively than the media makes it look. There are many other vulnerabilities that would be a lot easier to target. <br><br>MawKernewek, yes, that's among the many vulnerabilities. <br><br>Russell, the US has won most of its wars, too, or wiggled out of them before suffering a clear defeat. I suspect that very few people have adequately gauged the depth to which the fantasy of invincibility pervades the American imagination, and thus the impact on the country's collective psychology of a really solid and unanswerable military defeat. <br><br>Carp, always a possibility. I tend to assume -- and, again, I've read Sun Tsu -- that the Chinese have quite a few different angles in mind for monkeywrenching, and will not show all of them at once even if it comes to a shooting war. <br><br>Myriad, good. No, I don't envisage an invasion of the American continent -- that would be a ghastly challenge to any prospective invader. The US, like any other country, can lose a war without being conquered; it simply has to be forced into a position where settling for a peace treaty is preferable to continuing to fight at a disadvantage.<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c8721598373373606284 title="comment permalink">8/16/12, 11:08 PM</a><br><br>

I'd be more interested in figuring out how a country could make itself look so unappetizing to potential invaders that nobody would bother -- Switzerland is a good model here. <br><br>Joel, I read about that. I hope the Pentagon is taking detailed notes. <br><br>Frank, thank you! I'll have to find Biehl's book. <br><br>Ozark, nukes are America's phallic talisman of omnipotence -- that's why so many people were babbling idiotically about using a nuke on the Deepwater Horizon when it was fountaining oil into the Gulf of Mexico. I'll be addressing them, as previously mentioned, in a later post. <br><br>Raven, that's only one model. History has others. <br><br>Dealer, I figure we're about 50 years from horse cavalry -- less than that if we get a domestic insurgency in the West, and fuel supplies start running short. <br><br>Bruce, exactly. Current talk involves using a high altitude drone positioned over the target to guide the missile in. Current Chinese antiship ballistic missiles are estimated to be able to hit their targets from straight above at Mach 10; given decent targeting, that wouldn't even need an explosive charge. <br><br>Raven, funny! Reminds me of the comment of a heathen friend of mine about why he worships the gods he does: "Jesus promised to get rid of sin and death. Thor promised to get rid of frost giants. Seen any frost giants lately?"<br><br>Matrix, 200 might well be enough to swamp the fleet's antimissile defenses and get through. 200 missiles and, say, twice as many decoys -- at that point we're into assured-kill territory, and the chance that the Iranians haven't thought of that is so close to zero I'm not worried about it. <br><br>Jim, I've discussed the meaning of apocalypse many times here. It doesn't just mean "something bad happens." (That happens all the time.) It means that history ends -- that what happens afterward has no relation to what happened beforehand. Those Canaanites got stomped by history, but their more fortunate compatriots picked up the pieces and went on with their lives.<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c4226154762595066105 title="comment permalink">8/16/12, 11:23 PM</a><br><br>

Mind you, the T-34 was by no means an inferior tank -- it wasn't an elegant piece of machinery, but it was hard to kill and very effective in battle, and of course it didn't hurt that the Russians turned them out by the thousands. <br><br>Guilherme, nah, I don't expect an invasion of the continental US any time in this century. Major defeat in an overseas war, followed by political collapse along the lines of what happened to the USSR? Much more likely. <br><br>Unknown Barb, while there's much of value in the whole 4th Gen warfare hype, it's based on the unstated assumption that states can't or won't use military force against each other any more.

More on this down the road a bit. <br><br>Robert, that makes complete sense. <br><br>Justin, oh, we're in a world-class mess, no question; the resource base that allowed the industrial bubble to happen was bigger than any past equivalent, and so the consequences of the fall will be worldwide and very harsh.

True, in regular situations, the Egyptians would not have any dificulty in finding horses for their war chariots via commerce/tribute. But when the trade/tribute could not follow ( and notice that the sea people invasions coincide with the colapse of the Hittite empire and the arrival of the Philistines to Palestine, so , not much of oportunities for any of those options ), the Egyptians could not simply replenish their horse stock as easily as that. And note that between Kadesh and the events despicted in Medinet Habu it passed as much time as between Queen Victoria Jubilee and the Cod Wars ( really, losing naval confrontations against a country without a war navy ... ) ... Anyway, my point was that the war chariot was always a foreign weapon for the Egyptians due to the fact that horses were not native there, a weapon that was used because the others used it and only kept in suficient numbers. So it would had been "easier" for them to ditch it than in other places ( Romans faced war chariots when of the invasion of Britain ... ).<br><br>On other note , it is funny that the US Army bigwigs aparently do not notice that their enemies are basically reverse engineering what they did in WW II and preparing to use it against them. The Chinese balistic missile is a complete copy cat of how the USN dive bombers trounced the core of the japanese carrier fleet on Midway ( ok, that was largely by acident, but why not copy the core idea ? ;) ) and the drone "takedown" is the reverse of the American and English decription feats vs the Axis military ciphers ( according to what I read , the iranians said off the record that the drone was not taken down, but that, due to the work of them and a unnamed third country, they were able to decript the military grade GPS signal and they simply overrode locally the american sign and convinced the drone that it was getting back home when it going to land in a iranian strip. Not sure if that is true, but it is definitely plausible ... and the only way of countering that would changing completely the GPS cipher system, that would probably cost the americans more than any war at this point ... ).

I speak BTW as a former military officer. When I was a plebe at West Point in 1964, I recall heated discussions in our military tactics classes arguing the pros and cons of that new conflict in SE Asia. Some of my classmates argued that guerrilla tactics then being employed could in time defeat the US Military. "No Way!" shouted the other cadets. I recall a certain instructor named Major Kristoferson allowing the discussion to proceed. In the end we lost the war as the then cadet minority feared. It should also be noted that we have either had stale mate or have lost and are losing every"war" we have started since WW2. Your comment about carriers is especially poignant because of the sheer cost of the new carriers(on the order of $10 billion not including the squadrons of expensive aircraft housed within their shells. The latest Russian developed and Chinese built successors to the Exocet anti ship missiles(the supersonic Sunburn, the Sizzler etc) almost certainly could severely damage or destroy our carriers and the other thin skinned vessels in the Persian Gulf especially in the choke point of Hormuz and most especially if deployed in swarms and launched from multiple platforms. Military people fear these weapons but you see little to no coverage in the popular media. I would contend that our carriers are modern day chariot equivalents. One other point is that our modern standing armies are primarily mercenary(aka "volunteer") forces who are well equipped and technologically superior to most other insurgent armies but no insurgent commander would throw his forces against ours in an open field. Hence the use of non conventional tactics like IED's detonated by cell phones and other guerrilla and quasi- guerrilla tactics. Also never underestimate the courage and ruthlessness of a soldier defending his homeland against foreign invaders. In the end I think the sheer unaffordable cost of the military budget is what will defeat us first. That is unless the Israeli military launches a preemptive strike against Iran in which case all bets are off. We live in dangerous times.<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c8509491354635895940 title="comment permalink">8/17/12, 6:39 AM</a><br><br>

My thought, though, was that cavalry will likely fill the same roles it did in the Civil War and other 19th century conflicts -- scouting, irregular warfare, and the like -- rather than being a battlefield arm. <br><br>Ruben, it's been an ongoing theme in many past posts, which is why I put it through. You're right that certain agreements, if they can be enforced, can keep consensus more or less on track; the problem is that enforcing those agreements against a minority with an agenda, and a willingness to manipulate the process for its own ends, is effectively impossible in a consensus system. Thus you're left with a system that only works when everyone involved is honest -- and in such a situation, you usually don't need a formal system at all. <br><br>Sometulip, that's Matt Ridley, author of <i>The Rational Optimist</i> (sic). He's one of Bjorn Lomborg's epigones, into the same trick of cherrypicking data to make a nice warm fuzzy portrait of a happy world we don't happen to inhabit. It's a lucrative gig -- much more so than pointing out the trouble we're in -- and deeply committed to the Tweedledee and Tweedledoom dichotomy: if sudden apocalyptic collapse hasn't happened yet, why, that proves that everything's going to be wonderful for the imaginable future. <br><br>Kurt, I don't accept that assumption, for the simple reason that wars happened at least as often before the rise of the modern corporation.

When I talk with others about resource depletion and the possible decline of the US empire an argument that often crops up is that the US hegemony can be maintained through military force. I have always had trouble with this sort of argument because for a start since WW II the record of the US army has been far from invincible despite claims to the contrary. It would seem however that people have short memories.<br><br>Once the decline really begins in earnest then I do think the rules of engagement will change and the weaknesses of the US military will be exposed even more. History proves time and time again for this to be true, I do not see how the US is any different to previous empires in this regard. <br><br>I also tend to side with your argument that nuclear warfare is unlikely to feature a significant role as we begin the decline phase of industrial civilation in earnest. The main reason I would say this is because the losses of such actions are too great relative to the gains. It is like you said, to avoid being conquered one need not be stronger than the invading army, they simply need to be strong enough that a victory would be too heavy for the victorious army to bear. It is primarily this reason why I cannot see how nuclear warfare would be used.<br><br>Saying just because the US won't use its nuclear arsenal that does not mean other nations will not use it. For example if Israel faced an existential threat by its surrounding Arab neighbours it might use its nuclear weapons as a final desperate act. Improbable granted, but more feasible than a US strike on the Middle-East/China etc.<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c7803915101012096651 title="comment permalink">8/17/12, 10:44 AM</a><br><br>

For those who haven't read it--the author takes issue with the current consensus belief among historians that Rome collapsed slowly; Ward-Perkins makes a pretty decent case for its fast collapse. Your description of the Hittite empire's demise sounded like a fast collapse, as well. Not that our empire will necessarily follow the Roman or Hittite empires' trajectories, but if you accept the premise that some empires collapse rather quickly and some take centuries to do so, I'm curious about what you feel are the criteria, in general, for a fast collapse versus a slow one.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c7905412659464496246 title="comment permalink">8/17/12, 2:40 PM</a><br><br>

From conventional explosives to nuclear, they all are, in a sense, EMP bombs. What an EMP bomb is, essentially, is a conventional bomb whose formula has been tweaked to produce the strongest EM pulse. To deploy such a bomb you would have your usual choice of plane dropped or missile delivery, the criteria being it had to be detonated over your target area at altitude.<br><br>From what I remember, there was suspicion such a bomb was deployed in Belgrade during the Serbian-Kosovo war. The target, not military hardware, but the hardware controlling the cities water and sanitation systems. No flowing water, no sewage treatment, no flushing toilets equals diseases such as cholera and TB. <br><br>So essentially, when an EMP bomb goes off, it will seem to be like any other ordinary bomb, except it will be at some altitude, and it will fry your electronic hardware. Vacuum tubes, on the other hand, are supposed to be immune (unless the blast itself shatters the glass!).<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c969875535864530008 title="comment permalink">8/17/12, 3:16 PM</a><br><br>

What happens when a sufficiently large defeat, or chain of them in a short enough time, breaks that spell completely, shattering the myth of invincibility? Couple that with the shattering of the myth of economic progress, already ongoing but not yet big enough on its own to break down a large collective entity, and I can see where this could lead to unendurable stress both on individuals and on larger collective entities such as the US.

There is a nice Wikipedia page, but you need a little background in the sciences to understand it: <br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse rel=nofollow>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse</a><br><br>And thanks for the survivalblog summary, Yuri, it was excellent. <br><br>An EMP attack would be done with a nuclear bomb, but to get the effect it is detonated in space. There is no be a blast or radiation. You would never hear it. If it happens at night or if you are looking up at the sky, it would be like a flashbulb going off. There isn't even any appreciable fallout. <br><br>Microelectronics, like the chips that go into computers or cellphones, are designed to survive small static discharges and would typically be undamaged. But metal objects will pick up electrical energy proportional to their length. Electrical grids would be knocked out as every transformer in every substation gets hit with an enormous surge. Most of our phone system and internet is now based on optical fiber -- such fibers do not conduct electricity and are immune to nearby lightning strikes. The fibers themselves would not be damaged by an EMP. Of course the equipment in the little buildings at the fiber's ends would be vulnerable, more or less, as it can only run for a short while without grid power. Cellphone towers would likely be knocked offline. <br><br>Whether your solar array survives or not depends on how close you are to the epicenter of the pulse, I expect. Its wires are much shorter than those of the grid, but the electronics cannot take as much of a surge. Lots of variables in that calculation. <br><br>And it was interesting to read that only 10% of cars would be knocked out -- the car's body acts as a Faraday cage which protects its electronics. If 85% of our cars were killed off, the EMP would be doing us a favor. Oh, well. <br><br>On nuclear pollution: <br>One interesting factoid that has emerged in the wake of last year's Japanese nuclear accident is this: by the end of this century, 99+% of the radioactive pollution on the planet will have come from events like TMI, Chernobyl, Fukushima, and a number of less-publicized releases, and releases yet-to-come. This is "peaceful" nuclear material. Even a dirty bomb is no match for a fire in a spent fuel pool, one that has been accumulating nuke waste from the slow burn of a generating plant over a period of three or four or five decades. <br><br>And it is becoming increasingly clear that, in the hollowed-out economy of the far side of Hubbert's Peak, it will be extremely difficult to marshall the resources necessary for proper decomissioning of these monuments to the profligacy of scale. <br><br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c5034219331181641200 title="comment permalink">8/18/12, 12:33 PM</a><br><br>

I've seen it for sale in our local markets, but it doesn't get any special "health food" mention. It looks like it has been cultivated south of you for a long time. You never know... I’d try it, although space is not at a premium here.<br><br>As to coffee substitutes, which okra also falls into, I've taken up the tea camellia (camellia sinensis) and chicory challenge. As a bit of feedback, the chicory seems to be far more frost hardy than the camellia. Other camellia's here soldier on and flower well over winter, but not this one. As bad luck would have it, I've had two frosts now this year (-0.4 degrees Celsius) and the tea camellia was frost burnt. It is obviously at the extreme end of its range, however the chicory did not skip a beat and looks set to become a major weed here. I love edible weeds. They should be celebrated!<br><br>I may be wrong, but I reckon the root stock for fruit trees is the key to them surviving extremes of weather. I experiment with all sorts of rootstock here, although trying to track down non dwarfing rootstock is a real pain and growers aren’t setup for this. Always the key is diversity.<br><br>Mind you, it takes about four years for a citrus tree to harden to outdoor living even here. Before that over winter they look a bit wan, but they do get through. The benefit too is that once they do get established, they aren’t subject to all of the pests that they suffer from in warmer climates. In Melbourne, every citrus tree that I’ve seen is infested with citrus gall wasp, no matter how well they are growing.<br><br>Interestingly too, I’ve learnt that with the herbs, both culinary and medicinal about 80% have lost their potency over winter, which I didn’t expect. They obviously must use the energy from the sun to produce their sugars, alkaloids etc. I always used to enjoy a cup of lemon (or lime) balm tea in the evening, but it is pretty weak stuff over the depths of winter. I’m still learning though.<br><br>Back on topic though. Isn't the military a reflection of the society that funds it? If you live in a risk averse, hands off society dependent on excessive energy use and technology, well, you get drones.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c2091904057612330035 title="comment permalink">8/19/12, 3:25 AM</a><br><br>

It popped up in a few doomer blogs in 2009, including The Breaking Time and The Doomer Report. Some facts and speculations that might be food for thought today:<br><br>The entire Bronze Age technology was, of course, dependent on a steady supply of copper and tin. Tin is a scarce metal, and there's evidence it was being mined and shipped to the Near East from as far away as Britain. Only with a far-flung and *stable* international trade network could armies keep supplied with it. This was a massive Achilles' heel of Bronze-Age civilization, as much as the exotic components needed for making chariots and compound bows.<br><br>Trevor Bryce points out in <b>The Kingdom of the Hittites</b> that the Hittite empire became very dependent on grain shipped in from abroad -- and in the later years of the thirteenth century, it had more and more trouble with rebellious tributaries, which could have made it harder to import that food. Combine that with a megadrought, which the whole Near East and Anatolia are prone to, and you have an empire falling apart even before the barbarians arrived. Interestingly, he suggests the capital, Hattusas, was actually abandoned by the elites at least six months before the end -- in fact, most Hittite cities were just abandoned, not razed and burned. Bryce states:<br><br>"The overall, though still far from complete, picture we have of the centuries immediately following the collapse of the Hittite kingdom is not one of widespread destruction and massacre, but of large-scale movements of peoples -- abandoning their homelands, grouping and regrouping with other peoples on the move, then finally dispersing, sometimes to lands far from their places of origin."<br><br>For the Mycenaeans: Oliver Brown suggests in <b>The Aegean from Bronze Age to Iron Age</b> suggests that many Mycenaean cities destroyed each other in internecine warfare for what water and food supplies remained -- or in some cases even fell to civil war from within, as the elites fell apart into warring factions.<br><br>At one point during the collapse, according to Bryce, some of Ugarit's own ships changed sides to join the raiders. The chief administrator of Alasiya wrote him to inform him: "It was the people from your own country and your own ships who did this! And it was the people from your country who committed these transgressions."<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c8330197149365079978 title="comment permalink">8/20/12, 11:50 PM</a><br><br>

We know we can smear the tar out of any enemy opposed to us on the conventional battlefield, so that's how we percieve how legitimate warfare to be like. Yet 10 years in Afghanistan and we are no closer to achieving any vague, undefined victory or even pacification. Iraq is still in turmoil. The insurgents are still killing U.S. and NATO troops. They cannot afford tanks and guns, so they use cell phones and<br>Now, I find it highly ironic that in popular American culture, in movies (e.g. Star Wars), in TV shows, and in popular images of historical heros such as Francis Marion, and Samuel Adams, and Paul Revere, the 'good guys' are the insurgents, the rebels, the minutemen: civilians who surreptitiously struggle against the oppressive military machine, who fight using exactly the same Asymetric Warfare principles that we officially despise as cowardly and despicable ‘terrorism’ when used against us.<br>Oh, and just to pick at a nit: 'ballistic' missiles act like a bullet, so once aimed and fired, they stay on that trajectory. If the path can change in flight, it's a 'guided' missile.<br><br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c7656722736047162237 title="comment permalink">8/21/12, 2:01 AM</a><br><br>

I generally agree with the idea that human nature is a result of our brains and therefore will not change until the brains do. Evolution has changed it in the past, genetic engineering could tamper with it in the future. Barring direct tinkering, evolution moves on a time scale too large for us to experience. <br><br>2. Culture and civilization can change. Culture can mediate human nature. This is why we no longer see human heads spiked on London Bridge. The NFL, while violent, is far less bloody than gladiatorial combat. Of course, simulated violence is quite common and available in media. <br><br>3. We do have a cognitive bias of thinking we live in unprecedented times, just like every teenager discovering sex for the first time is sure the adults don't know a thing about it and have never truly experienced life. <br><br>4. All that being said, we do live in an exceptional time. Our politics is as dismal as ever, our public institutions as corrupt as ever, but the consequences are so much greater. Climate change is real. Energy depletion is real. We are overbuilt, overextended, and overpopulated in a dramatic fashion. <br><br>The ultimate source of these problems is not new, is not any different from the problems of the past. (Greed, pride, vanity, an inability to appreciate one's own limits, etc.) But when gangs used to settling fights with fists and boots are given guns, the next fight will start for the same old reasons but the consequences will be unlike anything they've experienced.<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c4873019794593160538 title="comment permalink">8/21/12, 12:39 PM</a><br><br>

INS uses accelerometers to track motion and predict position. GPS/INS systems are in use in many places, using GPS to calibrate the INS broadly and INS for up to the microsecond measurements. <br><br>I have a feeling that GPS hacking is an obvious security hole left by engineers who didn't have the budget or time to do everything the right way. Consider the Taliban viewing unscrambled video from the drones. That's right, drone video is sent in the clear! The control systems telemetry was encrypted. <br><br>In general, the less autonomous the drone, the more vulnerable they will be to jamming of the control signals. However, active jamming also points out where the jammer is. Cold War smart weapons could home on an enemy's radar emitter or home on the jamming signal. When surface-to-air missiles threatened to make the manned combat aircraft too vulnerable to fly, specialized Wild Weasel teams took the fight right back to the SAM's. <br><br>Also, the smarter our AI gets, the more we'll be willing to trust drones to operate autonomously. <br><br>In Frank Herbert's Dune all interstellar transport was monopolized by a Spacing Guild and thus shipping costs were enormous. Given a proscription against the use of atomic weapons and artificial minds being held in anathema, the fighting man became the dominant weapon of the day. Control of a planet could turn on the outcome of a fight between the retinues of warring nobles. Wars of Assassins. <br><br>When we can't afford carriers and armored divisions, we might still see the aims of wars carried out with robotic assassins. I've seen some estimates that the 9-11 attack had an operational budget of under a half-million dollars.<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c6203395821267604874 title="comment permalink">8/21/12, 12:56 PM</a><br><br>

There are always similarities and differences. You are pointing on the weakness of 'this time growth will continue forever' or 'this time the world will really end' extremes. But that can easily hide the ways that our situation is indeed different than anything recorded in history. We are a global society that has filled up its planet. We have nuclear weapons capable of destroying much of the biosphere. We understand the basic laws that govern how the universe works to a pretty good approximation. None of these have happened before this century. On the other hand, human nature hasn't changed much over recorded history. So we can expect to repeat many of the blindnesses and blunders of the past. We also have many more options for responses. This makes the future even more unpredictable, but it seems clear that whatever happens it will occur on a scale that is quantitatively unprecedented and hence qualitatively different.<br><br><a href=the-specter-of-military-defeat.html#c1428357775958087362 title="comment permalink">8/21/12, 12:56 PM</a><br><br>

It was said that it represented some kind of money, and that there was some kind of financial bubble in bronze that burst around 800BC. It was never really explained why.

Perhaps none more so than those of us who grew up reading SF, with all sorts of exotic battles... Here's my take:<br><br>I see there's a lot of focus on specific technologies here - super/hypersonic missiles, drones, MANPADS etc. <br><br>To me, the lesson of the Hittites and the Sea Peoples isn't that the javelin was such a great piece of technology. Instead, the javelin allowed the Sea Peoples to negate the central assumption behind chariot warfare - that you could stay away and on the move and never engage the enemy on its own terms. Since everything - from tactics to strategy - was based on this, everything fell apart when the Hittites couldn't adapt. The Egyptians, on the other hand, could adapt and so threw the Sea Peoples into the sea. <br><br>Is there any similar assumption behind US tactics and strategy? You may claim that the carriers are such an assumption, but carriers aren't fighting ships - the aircraft do the fighting. The carriers are floating bases, and as JMG has noted, the US has plenty of bases around the world, including air fields. With inflight refueling, US air forces can reach far even without carriers.<br><br>This, in my view, points to the central assumption. Drones, as well as refueling aircraft, rely on air superiority to be useful. The US has relied on total air superiority for the last few decades, which means tactical behavior will have adapted, even if manuals and training theoretically still takes air attack into account.<br><br>Negate this advantage - force the US military to operate without assured air superiority - and I suspect you'll see a military setback that rocks the world and triggers political chaos in the US. It could well be an old-fashioned bloodbath.<br><br>It would require a "suite of technology and tactics", and I don't think shoulder-launched missiles alone would cut it. A mix of distributed sensors (with some innovative radioing to negate the stealth advantage) fusing their view together with a mix of shoulder-launched and high-altitude anti-aircraft-missiles, perhaps.<br><br>Not easy to do, but a hypersonic half guided, half ballistic missile doesn't sound "easy" either, with the targeting, tracking &amp; guidance and launcher infrastructure it would need. Plenty of vulnerabilities there.<br><br>Of course, the loss of a few carriers wouldn't exactly improve the situation, but I'd spare a thought for old-fashioned submarines (such as the Swedish diesel-electric HMS Gotland) - ASW is tricky, and for a carrier group with its attention aimed upwards doubly so.<br><br>Fittingly, air power is rather like chariot power - stand off, move fast, never meet the enemy face to face.
