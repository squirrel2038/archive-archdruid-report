The struggle between Northern and Southern models of human ecology in nineteenth-century America, the theme of last week’s post, determined more than the shape of American continental expansion. The South followed what was becoming the standard pattern in the non-European world during that century, focusing on the production of commodities that were traded on global markets to pay for manufactured goods from European factories. That’s what the South did with cotton, tobacco, and a variety of lesser cash crops, and it’s also what British North America (that’s Canada nowadays) was doing at that same time with grain, lumber, fish, and the like.<br><br>Had the South kept the dominant position it originally held in American national politics, and arranged the nation’s trade policy to its own satisfaction, that’s what would have happened between the Mason-Dixon line and the Canadian border, too. Without the protection of tariffs and trade barriers, the North’s newborn industrial system would have been flattened by competition from Britain’s far more lavishly capitalized factories and mercantile firms. The products of America’s farms, mines, and logging camps would have had to be traded for hard currency to pay for manufactured products from overseas. That would have locked the United States into the same state of economic dependency as the nations of Latin America, where British banks and businesses—backed whenever necessary by the firepower of the Royal Navy—maintained the unequal patterns of exchange by which Britain prospered at the rest of the world’s expense.<br><br>That possibility went whistling down the wind once the rising spiral of conflict between North and South exploded into war. Southern opposition to trade barriers was no longer an issue once Southern congressmen packed their bags and went home in 1860; with that difficulty out of the way, Northern industries got the protection they needed, and the requirements of the war poured millions of dollars—yes, that was a lot of money back then—into Northern factories. The North’s total victory put the seal on the process, and not incidentally put paid to any lingering thoughts of regime change in America that might have been aired in private among Europe’s upper classes. Prussian general Helmut von Moltke could glare though his monocle and claim that the American Civil War consisted of “two armed mobs chasing each other around the country, from which nothing could be learned,” but a great many others paid close attention, and blanched.<br><br>If the powers of Europe needed any reminder of these issues, it came in 1867, when the short-lived French colonial regime in Mexico was terminated with extreme prejudice. That’s another of those bits of history remembered by nobody north of the Rio Grande and everybody south of it, and it deserves discussion here for reasons that will quickly become apparent to all of my readers who have been watching the situation in Greece. The short version is that banks in Britain, Spain and France loaned large sums of money to the government of Mexico, which then fell on hard times—there was a civil war involved, the Guerra de la Reforma, which is a bit further than Greece has gotten yet—and had to suspend payment on its debts. The British, Spanish and French governments responded by putting pressure on the Mexican government to pay up; this being the 19th century instead of the 21st, that took the form of military intervention.<br><br>The British and Spanish forces were willing to settle for cash, but the French emperor Napoleon III had a wider agenda and launched a full-scale invasion. After more than a year of heavy fighting, the French army controlled enough of the country to install a friend of Napoleon’s, an Austrian prince named Maximilian, as Emperor of Mexico. That’s one of several good reasons the Union forces in the Civil War threw so much effort into seizing the Mississippi valley in the first part of the war; Napoleon III was known to be sympathetic to the Southern cause, and so any land route by which he could get money and arms to the main Confederate armies and population centers had to be sealed off. As soon as the Civil War ended, in turn, toppling Maximilian’s government became a top priority for the United States government; money and arms poured south across the Rio Grande to support guerrillas loyal to Mexican president Benito Juarez, while the French came under heavy American pressure to withdraw their forces from Mexico. Napoleon III pulled his troops out in 1866, and a year later Maximilian got marched out in front of a Mexican firing squad. That was the last time any European power attempted to expand its holdings in the New World.<br><br>North of the Rio Grande, though, the potential for further conflict was hard to miss. It’s a commonplace of history that the aftermath of a war normally includes quarreling among the victors, since all the disagreements that had to be kept at bay while there was still an enemy to defeat typically come boiling up once that little obstacle is removed. That’s what happened across the North in the wake of the Civil War, as the loose alliance between industrial and agrarian interests began to splinter about the time the last of the confetti from the victory celebrations got swept up. Alongside the ordinary sources of economic and political disagreement was a hard fact better understood then than now: the farm states of the Midwest were unwilling to accept the unequal patterns of exchange that the industrial states of the East required.<br><br>To make sense of this, it’s necessary to glance back at Alf Hornborg’s analysis of industrial production as a system of wealth concentration. To build and maintain an industrial system takes vast amounts of capital, since factories don’t come cheap. All that capital has to be extracted from the rest of the economy, placed in the hands of a few magnates, and kept there, in order for an industrial economy to come into being and sustain itself. That’s why, in a market economy, the technological dimension of industrialism—the replacement of human labor with machines—is always paired with the economic and social dimension of industrialism—the creation of unequal patterns of exchange that concentrate wealth in the hands of factory owners at the expense of workers, farmers, and pretty much everybody else. The exact mechanisms used to impose and maintain those unequal exchanges vary from case to case, but some such mechanism has to be there, because an economy that allows the wealth produced by an industrial system to spread out through the population pretty quickly becomes an economy that no longer has the concentrated capital an industrial system needs to survive.<br><br>That’s the problem the United States faced in the latter third of the 19th century. The rising industrial economy of what would eventually turn into the Rust Belt demanded huge concentrations of capital, but attempts to extract that capital from the farm states ran into hard limits early on. The epic struggle between the railroad barons and the Grange movement over shipping rates for farm commodities made it uncomfortably clear to the industrialists that if they pushed the farm belt too far, the backlash could cost them much more than they wanted to pay. During the Reconstruction era, the defeated South could have what was left of its wealth fed into the business end of the industrial wealth pump, but that only worked for so long. When it stopped working, in the 1870s, the result was what normally happens when the industrial wealth pump runs short of fuel: depression.<br><br>They called it the Long Depression, though you’ll have a hard time finding references to that term in most economic texts these days. The first warning came with a spectacular stock market crash in 1873. The US economy faltered, struggled, then plunged into full-scale deflation in 1876 and 1877. There were plenty of ups and downs, and some relatively calm years in the 1880s, but a good many economic measures stayed on the wrong side of the scale until better times finally arrived in 1896. <br><br>There’s one good reason and at least three bad ones that you won’t hear much discussion of the Long Depression in today’s troubled economic time. The good reason is that most of today’s economic theories came into being in response to a later crisis—the Great Depression of the 1930s—and the desire to avoid a repeat of the ghastly consequences of that latter collapse has inspired a certain amount of tunnel vision on the part of economic historians. The bad ones? Well, that’s a little more complex.<br><br>Many of my readers, to begin with, will have heard pundits insist that economic crises happen because modern currencies aren’t based on a gold standard, or because central bankers always mismanage the economy, or both. That’s a popular belief just now, but it’s nonsense, and it only takes a glance at American economic history between the Civil War and the founding of the Federal Reserve in 1912 to prove once and for all that it’s nonsense. The Panic of 1873, the Long Depression, the Panic of 1893, the Depression of 1900-1904, the Panic of 1907, and several lesser economic disasters all happened in an era when the US dollar was on the strictest of gold standards and the United States didn’t have a central bank. That’s bad reason #1: once you discuss the Long Depression, most of the rhetoric backing a very popular set of economic notions pops like a punctured whoopee cushion.<br><br>More broadly, across nearly all of the squabbling theological sects of modern economic thought, Adam Smith’s belief in the invisible hand remains glued in place. Smith, as longtime readers of mine will recall from an earlier series of posts, insisted that a free market economy is innately self-regulating, as though controlled by an invisible hand, and tends to maximize everybody’s prosperity so long as it’s left to its own devices. Exactly how much leeway should be left to the invisible hand is a matter of much disagreement among economists. There’s a broad spectrum from the Keynesians, who want government to cushion the market’s wilder vagaries, to the Austrian school, which insists that whatever the market does by itself is by definition right, but you’ll have a hard time finding anybody in the economic mainstream willing to consider the possibility that the market, left entirely to itself, might dive into a depression twenty-three years long. That’s bad reason #2; once you discuss the Long Depression, it becomes very hard to ignore the fact that an economy left to its own devices can dole out decades of misery to everybody.<br><br>Then there’s bad reason #3, which is that the cause of intractable problems like the Long Depression was well understood at the time, but nobody wants to talk about it now. That unwillingness, in turn, reflects the way that a concept once very widespread in economics—the concept of overproduction—came to be associated with a single economic school or, even more precisely, with a single economist, Karl Marx. Overproduction is one, though only one, of the elements Marx wove into his system of economic ideas, and generations of Marxist theorists and publicists used it as a reason why capitalist economies must eventually collapse; with the inevitability of Pavlov’s drooling dogs, capitalist theorists and publicists thus automatically shy away from it; and the Long Depression makes it excruciatingly hard to shy away from it.<br><br>For all that, overproduction’s easy to understand, and it offers a crucial insight into how industrial economies work—or, more precisely, how they stop working. An industrial system, as we’ve discussed already, rely on unequal patterns of exchange that extract wealth from the many and concentrate it in the hands of the few, to provide the capital concentrations needed to build and maintain the industrial system itself. The way this usually works in practice is that whatever the people on the losing end of the exchange have to exchange—whether it’s the labor of a work force, the raw materials of a foreign country, or what have you—is given an artificially low value, while the products of the industrial system have an artificially high value, so the people on the losing end get a pittance for their labor, their crops, and so on, while high prices for industrial products keep the factory owners rich.<br><br>The problem, of course, comes when the people who are getting next to nothing for their labor, crops, and so on are also the people who are supposed to buy those expensive industrial products. As the people on the losing end of the exchange get poorer, their ability to buy industrial products goes down, and unsold products pile up in warehouses. What happens next puts the entire system at risk: if the factory owners cut prices to move product, they risk dispersing the concentration of capital they need to keep the system going; if they cut production and lay off workers, they decrease the number of people able to buy their products even further; there are other options, but all of them add up to serious trouble for the industrial wealth pump.<br><br>That’s overproduction. In the Long Depression, as in the Great Depression, it was an everyday reality, driving, severe deflation and high unemployment, and we’d still be talking about it today if Marx hadn’t been turned into an intellectual figurehead for one side in the bare-knuckle brawl over global power that dominated the second half of the 20th century. There’s much to be said for talking about it again, since it’s becoming an everyday reality in America as we speak—we’ll be exploring that in more detail in later posts—but it also needs to be factored into any understanding of the rise of America’s global empire, because the decision to go into the empire business in a big way was driven, in large part, by the overproduction crises that pounded the American economy in the late 19th century.<br><br>Read the literature of empire from the Victorian period and the connection is impossible to miss. Why did industrial nations want imperial colonies? The reason given in book after book and speech after speech at the time is that the industrial nations needed markets. Free trade rhetoric, then as now, insisted that all an industrial nation had to do was to build a better mousetrap and the world would beat a path to its door, but then as now, that’s not how things worked; the markets that mattered were the ones where a single industrial nation could exclude competitors and impose the unequal exchange of cheap labor and raw materials for expensive manufactured products that would keep the wealth pump churning away.<br><br>That was the option that faced America as it approached the beginning of the 20th century. It says something for the influence of ideals in American public life that this option wasn’t chosen without a fight. The debate over an American empire was fought out in the halls of Congress, in the letters pages of hundreds of newspapers, in public meetings, and any number of other venues. Important politicians of both major parties opposed imperial expansion with every resource and procedural trick they could muster, and scores of cultural figures—Mark Twain was among them—filled the popular magazines of the time with essays, stories, and poems challenging the imperial agenda.<br><br>In the end, though, they lost. To a majority of Americans, the economic case for empire outweighed the moral and political arguments against it. By 1898, the pro-Empire faction had become strong enough that it could push the country into action; the annexation of Hawai’i and the Spanish-American War that year crossed the line and redefined America as an imperial power, launching it along a trajectory that would very quickly draw it into conflicts that generations of Americans had done their best to avoid. We’ll discuss that next week.<br><br>****************<br><span style=font-size:130%>End of the World of the Week #14</span><br><br>In apocalyptic belief systems, just as in baseball, you often can’t tell the players without a program, and it’s not at all uncommon for prophets of any given end-of-the-world prediction to provide helpful guides explaining which figure in contemporary public life ought to be identified with the Great Beast of Revelations or the equivalent. Life can get complicated, though, when competing prophets disagree about who corresponds with which legendary figure—and when the two sides of a savage political and religious quarrel end up accusing each other of being the Antichrist, it can be hard indeed to figure out who if anyone is on the side of the angels.<br><br>That’s what happened in the early thirteenth century when the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II faced off against Pope Gregory IX. The popes and the emperors spent most of the Middle Ages getting into it over a galaxy of issues that even historians have trouble remembering nowadays, but Frederick was not your usual medieval emperor. His contemporaries called him <i>Stupor Mundi</i>, which more or less translates out as “the astonishment of the world;” he was fluent in six languages, ruled a ramshackle empire that extended from Sicily to Germany with a bit of Palestine thrown in for good measure, and carried out a successful crusade while excommunicated by the Catholic church, which in medieval terms was definitely a puzzler.<br><br>It was probably inevitable that Gregory IX would call Frederick the Antichrist—it was par for the course for thirteenth-century popes to use that timeworn label for the people on their enemies list—but not even a pope could get away with doing that to the Stupor Mundi. Frederick immediately had his public relations people—yes, medieval emperors had public relations people, or at least Frederick did—start churning out tracts proving that the real Antichrist was Gregory IX. The two of them continued along the same lines for years, filling the medieval equivalent of the media with colorful denunciations extracted from the usual parts of the Bible .<br><br>Still, Gregory never made a convincing Antichrist to anyone but Frederick and his friends, since he was simply a common or garden variety medieval pope, and spent his career in the usual way, fighting bloodthirsty wars against his personal enemies and issuing proclamations condemning Jews, heretics, and cats. Frederick was another matter; a great many people in his lifetime thought that there was a good chance the Stupor Mundi might just be the Great Beast after all. In his inimitable way, though, he surprised them all by suddenly dying of dysentery in 1250.<br><br>—story from <a href="http://www.vivaeditions.com/book_page.php?book_id=25">Apocalypse Not</a>

I'd put it a little differently -- the rise of an industrial economy is itself the result of a complex set of feedback loops involving fossil fuels and capital concentration, which sooner or later runs into diminishing returns and begins to unravel, returning to a state closer to equilibrium. How close? Depends on circumstances. As for the Long Depression in Britain, yes, the reasons were similar -- I suspect running up against a shortage of new sites for colonies had a lot to do with it.<br><br><a href=america-crossing-line.html#c6183713880729143259 title="comment permalink">3/21/12, 11:41 PM</a><br><br>

I've read that because of the downturn in the US and European markets, European luxury car manufacturers are starting to dump product here (I'm sure they would consider the word dump a bit harsh for their products!). Apparently there's never been a better time to buy.<br><br>Retail is quite sad here too, both in the press and anecdotally. This is indicative of the beginnings of a general downturn over here. This is despite general retail prices coming down, again because Chinese manufacturers have been dumping (there's that word again) excess product on the Australian retail market.<br><br>Plus, petrol is most recently at AU$1.55 / litre (that is US$1.62 at today's spot rate). In your US gallon terms that is the equivalent of US$6.12 / gallon (3.78 litres to a US gallon).<br><br>Surprisingly for me, house prices here have been very resilient, but I don’t expect that to last if unemployment continues to slowly creep upwards.<br><br>Respect to you for producing these posts as they would be quite difficult to research, write and field responses (I bet you’ve had more than your fair share of trolls).<br><br>Plus, you nicely side stepped the wealth concentration argument. Tidy work. Apparently over in the US, right now, wealth concentration is at levels not seen since the 1920's and we all know what happened then. <br><br>Yeah, wealthy people may buy luxury vehicles, but the population at large is kept fed through the small value high volume transactions that keep people employed. <br><br>The banks here are complaining about a lack of people to loan money to. At the same time though, they are shifting jobs overseas and sacking people here. Self-defeating really.<br><br>Also, just a random thought which I'll chuck out there: The wealth is now no longer being concentrated into the hands of the owners of the capital, but the Boards that control that capital. Not that it makes any difference to the end game though.<br><br>Many regards.<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=america-crossing-line.html#c4715801843334627774 title="comment permalink">3/22/12, 12:07 AM</a><br><br>

But I did find this:<br><br>http://www.history.army.mil/books/OpArt/germany1.htm<br><br>"To astute students of military history, Moltke’s name signifies far more than a list of nineteenth-century battles. He recognized that in the years to come wars would be conducted differently from the way they were in his lifetime: as short, quick, and decisive conflicts. Instead, he predicted correctly that future wars would be lengthy and total. Still others have observed his contributions to the application of emerging technologies to the conduct of operations. He evaluated the increased lethality and range of rifle and artillery fires and realized the necessity of changing basic military doctrine accordingly. He perceived that offense would give way to the preponderance of defense on the tactical level; in his view enemy attacks of the future were destined to be shattered by a wall of German tactical firepower. Moltke also foresaw that mobility on the strategic level could be multiplied by employing railroads. He planned to utilize this mode of transport to speed German armies to the battlefield and thereby to concentrate overwhelming force at the right time and in the right place to ensure victory. Finally, by applying the telegraph to warfare, Moltke was able to direct large armies in the field from great distances, thereby enhancing strategic flexibility through what he would refer to as operational direction."<br><br>This sounds more like US Grant than Napoleon so despite what the Prussians said they must have learned something.<br><br>Some other liinks.<br> <br>http://www.cincinnaticwrt.org/data/articles/catton_cw_armies.html<br><br>http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=h-war&amp;month=0005&amp;week=b&amp;msg=zJcVMvxOMdeVm33rOHa8ag&amp;user=&amp;pw=<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia_in_the_American_Civil_War<br><br>www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA384203<br><br>I don't know how this Austrian Author Pohanka whose book I read (in German) could have made such a statement without mentioning the other standard evidence that says they ignored the Civil War despite all teh prussian generals and 30% german participation in the North.<br><br><a href=america-crossing-line.html#c8260692788971049648 title="comment permalink">3/22/12, 1:33 AM</a><br><br>

He discusses the Great Depression 1873 - 1896 as a world-wide phenomenon. It was less dramatic in Britain compared with USA and Central Europe and had less impact on the British working class compared with earlier and later economic calamities, but Hobsbawm argues that during this period Britain was overtaken by the advancing economies of USA and Germany. He argues that by the mid 1890s Britain woke to find itself sharing the world; "one of three great industrial powers and in some respects the weakest of them". The opening of hitherto inaccessible areas of raw material and agricultural production by railroads and trans-ocean shipping had boosted the mid-19thC British industrial expansion, but this phase had then brought about the inevitable fall in prices. "Squeezed between the upper millstone of price-reducing competition and the lower [millstone] of increasingly expensive plant, with increasingly large and inelastic overheads, businessmen searched anxiously for a way out". Hobsbawm argues that Britain was left with "only one major way out": imperialism. Not a new thing for Britain, but the new factor in imperial expansion was the emergence of a competing group of industrially advanced powers. This was also the era of 'agitations' among both industrial and agrarian labouring and peasant populations, and the emergence of ‘socialist’ politics, but where we were all actually headed was toward the politics of world war on a new industrial scale. (Lessons indeed were learned from the American Civil War?)<br>NB. Hobsbawm was a major source for Stephen G. Bunker who was a long term colleague of Alf Hornberg. Personal note; my grandfather was born into the British working class in 1872.<br><br><a href=america-crossing-line.html#c3290811832502919694 title="comment permalink">3/22/12, 5:30 AM</a><br><br>

Unlike here, where the fact of bankruptcy provides some check on over production, in China, since many of the manufacturers are state and/or party membered owned, when the firms can't pay their bills from revenues, they just borrow more money. The (state controlled) bank money, in terms, comes from the savings of the workers who reportedly save 30% or so of earnings despite wages of $2/hour or so. The inflation in China runs higher than the interest on the savings so that once a person has a certain amount, the new savings deposited is just to make up the loss on the existing savings from inflation.<br><br><a href=america-crossing-line.html#c4712275979280353930 title="comment permalink">3/22/12, 5:41 AM</a><br><br>

Producers (factory owners, corporations) will try to reduce wages and have less employees (or move production to Asia) in order to produce even more and thus be even more profitable; but exactly through these actions they reduce the purchase power of the populace, and the market for their products collapses.<br><br>I suspect that's the reason why the so-called "social market economies" as found in post-WW2 Europe and Japan are much more resistant to these crises of capitalism (i.e. the crises don't affect average people as much as in the US, for example). It's just a matter of redistribution of wealth. During boom times, this redistribution means less profits and a less dynamic economy, but during bust times the economy is more robust, i.e. more people keep their jobs and can still buy products.<br><br>It's probably no coincidence that the European economies (Germany, France et al) are still actually manufacturing things (machines, customer goods etc.) while the US, and to some extent the UK, have largely stopped manufacturing anything except "finance products". Still, even social market economies need fossil fuels, although they can probably cope better with high fuel prices as well, at least for some time.<br><br><a href=america-crossing-line.html#c4150772767742569378 title="comment permalink">3/22/12, 5:53 AM</a><br><br>

The government started issuing some of the first “greenbacks” during the civil war and after for Reconstruction. In turn folks could turn greenbacks in for gold. Some of the original “Robber Barons” during this period would buy up government sold gold causing stocks to run low which would then require the government to later have to dump gold on the market causing large price swings. One of the many factors in the 1873 depression involved an oversupply of silver which occurred once Germany decided to no longer mint silver coins and a large price swing down followed, culminating in the Coinage Act of 1873. Just to cover the full popular metal spectrum, the 1907 panic got kicked off with an attempt to corner the market in a “copper” company.

We've already done that with food and farming: from 90% of the population in farming (1800) to 2% (today), a tiny fraction of the population produces food for most industrialized nations. Then we thought industrial production was where it's at, and most of us would work in factories or related support industries. Well, guess what? with such enormous improvements in productivity (never mind most production moving to China), now only a small % of U.S. labor works in factories of any sort. Now it's "get a college eduction and write software, go to business school, it's the white-collar jobs, stupid!" to maintain reasonably full employment. You can see where this is all going: a small fraction of the population actually creates and grows everything the rest of us "need" (want, with the help of the huge advertising and marketing departments). But, we're not giving away food and HDTVs to those who aren't employed as farmers or factory workers. The rest of the employed population seems to be kept busy with "service" or invented careers like market analysts and prison administrators, fundamentally parasitic occupations that keep them out of trouble but don't actually produce anything used by the population.<br><br>I see this is all going somewhere, but it's hard to see how it all ends.

These outlets for the manic overproduction of low-end Chinese industry are now ubiquitous in Canada. They smell of VOCs, aromatic polycarbons, raw plastic. They are stocked with a bewildering variety of (for the most part) poorly-made goods, some of them staggeringly unnecessary and *odd* -- cultural and kitsch objects from some kind of mainstream Anglo tradition, designed and manufactured by people who perhaps only ever saw a photograph of the original. [Like Japanese technical manuals translated crudely into English, much is lost in translation. For example, English words printed on many products don't make any sense, but are mere decorative detail.]<br><br>But above all this stuff is *cheap*. Astonishingly, troublingly cheap. That's why it's called a Dollar Store -- many items are $1, some are as much as $2 or $3. There are aisles of canned food at $1/can, many with labels that look "kinda like" some familiar N American brand but not quite. Poor people shop there out of need, wealthier people for the fun of "getting a bargain." I have bought things in these stores myself, but always with a strange guilty feeling; nothing can be this cheap and be manufactured with any kind of honesty or integrity. Somewhere behind that $1 item is slavery, chicanery, fudged books, malfeasance of some kind...<br><br>The container ships come over from China to Vancouver and Prince Rupert in endless procession. They bring incalculable mountains of this CCCC (Cheap Chinese Consumer Crap) every week. What goes back is true value: coal, grain, trees. Overproduction on the one hand, liquidation on the other. Mountains of disposable short-lifetime (mostly bloody useless) consumer crud in exchange for the most valuable things on earth: fossil fuel, food, timber. Who's selling Manhattan now for a handful of trade beads? <br><br>And from the dollar store it is only one small step up the food chain to Wal*Mart, and from there to Zeller's. Canadian Tire (now known as Chinese Tire or Crappy Tire to locals) is yet another dumping ground for the ever-growing mountain of cheap, cheap, cheap Stuff. Cheap Stuff that is costing us everything. <br><br>Archaeologists often analyze the quality of artifacts and tools as some indicator of the health and life-stage of cultures; the shoddiness of our present artifactual world, as well as its sheer insane quantity, seems like a bad sign. It also seems like a bad (certainly odd) sign that we can buy such fabulous, nearly magical discretionary gadgets as cell phones and iPads (whose quality and features seem to improve over time) but we can't make or buy practical stuff like a decent pair of pliers or a good pair of boots....<br><br>Kind of like the phood system (or cable tv for that matter): cranks out Product in gobsmacking quantity, but it's 99% crap... I don't have a coherent point to make really, just my general aghastness at living in this river of cheap crud (and knowing that elsewhere, literal rivers are being poisoned, drained, destroyed in the process of churning out the cheap crud). Maybe I should just have a T shirt printed to read "Hornborg Was Right" and leave it at that...<br><br><a href=america-crossing-line.html#c8440502884031953701 title="comment permalink">3/22/12, 2:07 PM</a><br><br>

My sense that this is not always so for the final product sold, at least in terms of sales price. DeAnander touches on this issue in his response. Often, at least in America, it is the use of artificially low prices that allows the industrial producer to insert his wealth pump into a society/community and dislodge the local alternatives. For the society/community the price is artificially low since 1) long term they are going get much poorer if they don’t have any wealth pumps working for them to counter the ones working against them and 2) besides this, the industrial producer is usually off-loading many of his costs somewhere (externalities, I think the economists call this), often on to consumers in some hidden ways. Think of Wal*Mart store workers would can barely shop at Wal*Mart and are on public assistance, for example.<br><br>I'm not saying that the cost of industrial goods are always artificially low, it's just pricing goods artificially low appears to one very common strategy, especially for mass market goods.<br><br>Of course, if by artificially high prices, you include all these factors indicated above, then yes the idea may be almost universally valid.<br><br><a href=america-crossing-line.html#c8857081733646261766 title="comment permalink">3/22/12, 6:28 PM</a><br><br>

Especially the 19th century. Right on that cusp, where capitalism was in place but had yet to be really turbocharged by cheap energy inputs. Is there a lot of scholarship in this area? Canonical works etc.? Or is it under researched? <br><br>Among other things it's quite fascinating to me that Marx wrote precisely during this era. I've often wondered if his confidence in the demise of capitalism might have been borne out but for this unexpected infusion of high EROEI energy, overturning his whole model of how human labor (for him the sole source of surplus value/profit) would need to be concentrated to such an extent that it would grow more powerful than the capital that had brought it together. In a way not his 'fault' not to have anticipated that. One question is whether the peak oil-induced collapse scenario (stepwise or however) in a way places us back into Marx's pre-oil world, making his analysis more relevant with the energy 'distortion' removed.<br><br><a href=america-crossing-line.html#c2049624391948589674 title="comment permalink">3/22/12, 7:52 PM</a><br><br>

Like every other human creation, it has plenty of flaws, some fundamental, some less so; overproduction is up there, but so, for example, is the inherent drive of capitalism toward monopoly -- as Adam Smith said, people in the same trade never get together, even at social events, without coming up with a scheme to rig prices and cheat the public -- or its equally inherent drive to privatize benefits and dump the costs on the public. <br><br>Bruce, it's a commonplace of history that political movements and parties turn into their opposites if they survive long enough. Evangelical Protestant Christianity was a radical left wing movement in the 19th century, for example -- William Jennings Bryan, the great populist politician, was also a devout fundamentalist -- and environmental conservation was a right-wing concern until well into the 20th century. <br><br>Rainbow, you're welcome!<br><br>Cathy, Seattle also just barely missed being named Duwumps, which I think would have been a better name for it (full disclosure: Seattle is my home town). It didn't quite try to call itself "New York;" the actual name was "New York Alki," that last word being Chinook jargon (the local native trade language) for "in the future;" you indicated how long in the future by stretching out the A, and it was a running joke for many years to call it "New York Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalki." <br><br>Arthur, any general survey of panics and crashes -- Kindleberger's <i>Manias, Panics and Crashes,</i> Galbraith's <i>A Short History of Financial Euphoria</i>, or Reinhart and Rogoff's recent and very solid <i>It's Different This Time</i> -- ought to give you a good grounding. <br><br>Peck's, now <i>that</i> is an online handle most people won't get. As for the moai, well, yes. <br><br>Glenn, it was a bull, <i>Vox in Rama,</i>, and it was against heretics, but had some references to cats in it as well. <br><br>Phil, that's too funny. Wasn't it James Thurber who used to tell stories about an aunt who insisted that leaving a light bulb out of the socket would let the electricity leak out? <br><br>Jess, we'll get to both those points. I'm sorry to say that a win by the anti-imperialists would not necessarily have had a better outcome, since the US was far from the only country trying to expand into the vacuum as the British empire faltered. By the time push came to shove in 1940 or thereabouts, the choices basically amounted to Germany, Russia, and the US; the last (and still very substantial) opposition to US empire collapsed then, because it was all too clear what would happen if one of the other two contenders won out. <br><br>Escape, yes, Say's "Law" is one of those fallacies that keeps being rehashed by economics professors even though the real world doesn't work that way. As for Technocracy, it always made my skin crawl -- trying to run a human society by the rules of engineering is a good recipe for inhuman outcomes -- but in the context of the time, it's understandable that it would have been popular. Thanks for the links!<br><br>Prack, true enough. I'd also like people who insist that government regulation is always a bad idea to read a chapter of Upton Sinclair's <i>The Jungle</i> right before dinner every night. <br><br>Karim, that's an excellent question. In a deindustrial society, where concentrations of wealth, energy, and resources are on a much smaller scale than they are today, useful items of the sort you've described will have to be made by craftspeople rather than by factories; they will be a great deal more expensive and less common, but they will very likely exist -- lens grinding used to be done by hand; the philosopher Baruch Spinoza paid the rent by grinding lenses, for example.<br><br><a href=america-crossing-line.html#c5107652507139022973 title="comment permalink">3/22/12, 9:42 PM</a><br><br>

This isn't the first time the Left has been convinced that war with Iran was about to happen. <br><br>Brad, exactly. This is why it's absolutely crucial for individuals to get to work learning how to grow food in intensive gardens on a backyard and vacant-lot scale, small enough that they slip under the agribusiness radar. In the twilight years of the Soviet Union, small gardens like those played a huge role in keeping people fed, and they can do the same thing in the twilight years of the United States. <br><br>Dick, that exponential curve is a function of the replacement of human labor with energy from fossil fuels; a curve that showed production per barrel of oil equivalent would be a very different matter! Since fossil fuels are depleting rapidly, the curve of production per worker is also at or near a peak, and can be expected to fall off at something like the same rate as energy per capita in the years ahead. <br><br>Thus it's a self-correcting problem; as it becomes impossible to maintain fossil fuel production at the levels of the recent past, human beings with hand tools will become more economical as means of production than automated factories, as in fact they already are in many Third World countries. <a href=../../2010/04/twilight-of-machine.html rel=nofollow>This post of mine</a> discusses the issue in some detail, if that's of interest. <br><br>Prack, excellent! A few years back, there used to be a bunch of neoprimitivists insisting that once industrial society fell, we'd all have to go back to the stone age because all the concentrated metal ores had been dug out of the mines. Now of course they'd clearly never heard of bog iron, which is concentrated by chemosynthetic bacteria, but the point you've made is even more important: all that metal is now sitting on the surface of the Earth, and much of it will be concentrated in big urban ruins, where it can be hacked apart with hand tools, cut into workable lengths, and hauled to local blacksmiths and metalworkers. It'll be millennia before they run short, and by then there ought to be plenty of bog iron. <br><br>Rachel, thank you. See you there!<br><br>DeAnander, that's classic industrial economics at work. <br><br>Jennifer, we'll be getting to that fairly soon. Britain would have lost the First World War, too, without massive American help. <br><br>Wall, China's had some very substantial periods of empire building; it's simply that their focus, back in the day, was expansion into central Asia rather than overseas. As I'll be showing down the road a bit, they've very clearly learned some things since then. <br><br>Adrian, you're quite right -- the connection between overproduction and growth is that growth has been used in the past as a way to counter overproduction, by increasing the number of consumers with ready cash. That only works if you've got the energy resources to back it up. We did, back in the day; we don't now. <br><br>Doctor W., on the one hand, it's not always a matter of the final sales price; on the other, the major target for the wealth pump isn't the imperial nation, but other nations dominated by the imperial nation. Check out the retail price of manufactured goods from overseas in the Third World, as compared to the local average income on the one hand, and as compared to the cost of exports of raw materials on the other!<br><br>David, to the best of my knowledge it's massively under-researched.

It makes sense not just at the level of nations, but also at the personal level. <br><br>Home economics was, in the past, about home production. Consider how personal "tariffs" and "trade barriers" could profit the homeowners who grew their own food, made their own clothing, built their own homes, invested in their families and communities, etc., and "protected their industry" by refusing to sell their resources (labour) in exchange for overpriced goods from corporations. Homeowners who focus on production instead of consumption, who use their own resources (labour, land, tools, creative energy, knowledge) to produce things for themselves or to sell to others, or barter with others at a fair exchange, have a better chance of acquiring some wealth of their own, instead of seeing wealth acquired by the few elites. <br><br>In fact, home production is a direct threat to corporations who would much prefer that you use their overpriced services, goods, etc., exchanging them for your labour (resource) much like the resource-providing nations do for the industrialized nations. So growing your own herbs for medicine, taking care of your elderly or your children, sewing your own clothes or buying at thrift stores, growing your own food, making furniture, building your own house, etc., is much like nations erecting trade barriers. <br><br>And taking it one step further, if larger projects are made possible by the accumulation of wealth, why can't we pool the wealth we own collectively to create projects that would benefit us collectively, instead of accumulating wealth for a few private individuals? <br><br>The only difficulty is that a lot of land is so overpriced, that the struggle to pay the mortgage pretty much forces one to get a job.

First, your comment about economic theology struck a chord with me, as one of the first things I noticed about the neo-Austrian fans is that they seem to follow the myth of apocalypse religiously. They hark back to the golden age before the Fall of the Fed (without mentioning many specifics), then talk about how Keynes is the devil and Bernanke is the latest iteration of the Antichrist, and they one and all predict an impending day of reckoning when true believers will be saved (by their stockpiles of gold and silver) and the rest of humanity will suffer a dire fate. A familiar storyline dressed up in economic drag. It makes me wonder just what the whoopee cushion of the Long Depression would sound like in the church of Hayek.<br><br>Second, I'm reading Hobsbawm's Age of Extremes at the moment, and your themes of empire as wealth pump and industrial system as wealth concentrator translate nicely to the US post WWII that he describes. It seems that following the Great Depression American capitalists struck a bargain with organized labor that lasted for 25 years - namely that US workers would be the major market for US industrial production while the rest of the non-"communist" world faced the business end of the wealth pump to maintain capital concentration. When the crises of the 70s hit, the deal was off, and the American working class was arbitraged first, while purchasing power was propped up with easy credit. What we're seeing now is the next stage, when more and more of the US population can no longer participate as "consumers," and capitalists are using every tool available to keep the concentration of capital intact, which leads to overproduction. Meanwhile, China is quietly turning their own wealth pump on as DeAnander mentioned above, and all that most of us can do is watch it happen. Sure, it's much more complicated than that, but the perspective you're applying in these posts forms a very coherent narrative for making sense of the world. Thank you for that.<br><br>Also, for the coffee-drinkers, I've been thinking about this for a while as well, ever since I got a craving for chicory a few years back. Roasted barley and chicory make a great coffee substitute (or a coffee stretcher - that's my preference). My aunt from Montana actually markets a blend that tastes delicious and is cheaper than coffee, which makes sense because her husband farms a few hundred acres of barley.<br><br>p.s.

A brief synopsis:<br><br>After a period of revolution, social and economic collapse and 'Ecotechic' society reemerges from the ashes of the old civilization. 12 zones each specialized in one area of economic production; ie, mining, farming, fishing, ect; feed a wealth pump to a decadent police state at the core of this new society. The decadent core retains modern technology, minus cars, and used that technology to suppress the 12 zones and keeps the wealth pump functioning. Shown 75 years into this 'new' society, from the future it presented a possible, if bleak, post oil world.<br><br>It was amazing and heartbreaking at the same time; and it was almost as if you had written the screenplay yourself.

At the same time though, people also complain (elsewhere) about isolation, whatever that means. I've heard the complaint often enough that there must be some basis to it, but it is beyond my understanding? <br><br>The reason I say this is because, Australian culture is such that people hide in their houses and don't seem to socialise at night. Haven't seen any vampires yet, so they don't really have that much to worry about! <br><br>I'm reading a lovely book by Annie Hawes called, "Extra Virgin (olive oil reference people) - amongst the olive groves of Liguria". It documents two English female twenty somethings integration into a northern Italian rural community in the 1980's. It is a very interesting read into and insight into a different culture and possibly also a glimpse into the future? The culture that exists in that time and place is very different from the current paradigm here for sure.<br><br>Isolation is a fictional state of mind and to my mind people are more isolated in the middle and outer suburbs here than anywhere else. <br><br>If people broaden their search for land, they may just surprise themselves. Most soils can be improved if treated gently, oh well.<br><br>As to spending time on the domestic economy, well, it does have pay back. It has been quite interesting here in the garden because after several years, things are starting to self-seed. I may never have to purchase potatoes and carrots again at the rate they are popping up all over the place. Plus the flowers are starting to go crazy too: cosmos; california poppies; marigolds; calendula's; and russell lupins. It is nice to have the space to let them go wild and it keeps reminding me of your comment that a resilient system is not necessarily an efficient system. I’m free ranging the 14 chooks now – under supervision and they seem to be having a good time too.<br><br>Hey Lewis,<br><br>Tea - both green and black - comes from Camellia sinensis. It would probably love your part of the world, except for the cold winters, as it has a sub tropical derivation. It can be grown in pots easily or a greenhouse there though. I killed one here because it was planted to close to the eucalypts and died over summer – the plants like a drink of water during summer. Black tea is fermented, whilst green tea is gently steamed. It is a plant that is well worth the hassle. I've given up on dreams of coffee here because the occasional winter tends to kill them, although they do well the remainder of the year.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=america-crossing-line.html#c5765501697369932692 title="comment permalink">3/24/12, 3:25 AM</a><br><br>

It is easy to say that 'a market economy ... is always paired with ... the creation of unequal patterns of exchange that concentrate wealth in the hands of factory owners at the expense of ... pretty much everybody else.' It obviously happens. But assigning causal relationships is much less clear. You imply that there are some nefarious influences making this happen. But are there really serious competitors to the industrial system when the energy and resources are avaiable to make it run? It seems likely that demand for manufactured products means that the factories will be built somewhere. And the operative questions are where they are built, who owns them, and what profit margins they operate at. The first movers into lucrative industries achieve wealth and economic power. Sometimes that is concentrated in one nation and it looks like an empire. Seems this is kind of inevitable and is naturally unstable to what the Chinese are doing to US economic power right now..and what the US did to Britain a century ago.<br><br><a href=america-crossing-line.html#c2637780387059429010 title="comment permalink">3/24/12, 9:29 AM</a><br><br>

If Britain hadn't been able to pull in a huge amount of help from its empire in the Second World War, it would have collapsed in 1940. <br><br>Steve, you might consider giving roasted dandelion root a try, also -- very tasty stuff. <br><br>Repent, thank you, but I'll pass. I'm not much of a fan of mass media in general, visual or otherwise -- I don't read the latest heavily marketed novels, either. <br><br>Cherokee, remember that most Americans have no idea how to get to know their neighbors. Their social outlets consist almost entirely of businesses set up to charge them money for giving them a setting to relate to other people. <br><br>Richard, agreed -- there's no way to build a really viable financial system using credit. The problem is that there's no way to build a really viable financial system without it, either. That leads to an interesting conclusion...<br><br>Brian, that's why studying the fine details of history is so important! The version of history you get off the media is basically nonsense. <br><br>Ganv, it's not a matter of "nefarious elements" -- where on earth did you get that notion? If you don't have unbalanced systems of exchange, you can't maintain an industrial economy, so those who want to maintain industrial economies use their wealth and influence to get unbalanced systems of exchange in place -- it's that or go under. As for the replacement of Britain by the US and the US by China, well, yes -- I talked about that in an earlier post, and will be talking about it further later on. <br><br>John, er, that's an astonishing non sequitur. First, the people who were primarily on the losing end of wealth concentration in the middle of the 20th century were in the Third World -- were you under the impression that they were getting pensions from the US? Second, the fact that a trickle of money was handed out to privileged sections of the middle class to keep them happy and passive doesn't amount to a redistribution of wealth in any meaningful sense. You might want to try again, this time a little harder. <br><br>Lewis, Kaplan's a remarkable read, in several senses -- not all of them complimentary. I'll be discussing some of his work down the road a bit. <br><br>Dwig, depends on how much control the population has over the buildup of wealth and influence in the hands of individuals -- always the issue!

What defines unbalanced? The easiest way to define this is that there are some means of enforcing inequality that should not exist...slavery, military intervention, etc. It was these that I was lumping under 'nefarious'. Many exchanges are between people with different levels of economic power but are still viewed as a favorable exchange by both parties. It is much harder to call these exchanges 'unequal'. And I was identifying that it seems likely that even if one removes all nefarious influences, you still would end up with an industrial system and concentration of wealth as long as there are physical resources to support it. In short, I am not sure that any 'balanced' system of exchange exists, and if it were to exist I am quite sure it would be unstable. Without central control of an economy there is going to be concentration of wealth and production of an industrial system.<br><br><a href=america-crossing-line.html#c6582727948727641649 title="comment permalink">4/5/12, 7:15 AM</a><br><br>

The real question becomes "what do we replace it with?" As a heathen, I have found myself increasingly fond of Distributist approaches because they seek to undermine the distinctions that pump wealth to the top. I also think that there is some delicious irony in the fact that what may perhaps be the best approach yet to undoing the economic harm from the Conversion came out of English Catholicism....<br><br><br>As for retirement plans which Mr Wheeler thinks avoids this problem, I think there is a half-truth here but only a half-truth. In traditional times, one's retirement plan was one's children. Multi-generational households provided vital continuity for children, and support for raising children, as well as care for the elderly. We have lost this due to the retirement plans and this is a real shame.<br><br>On the other hand what retirement plans have done is distribute ownership of companies more widely. This is a good thing.
