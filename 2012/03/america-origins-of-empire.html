To understand the decline and approaching fall of the American empire, it’s necessary to understand how that empire came into being. That’s a complex issue, as all historical questions are these days, and a grasp of the tangled role of history in today’s political discourse may make it a little easier to avoid certain common but unhelpful habits of thought as we proceed.<br><br>Until the 18th century, in the Western world as elsewhere around the planet, the core language of political rhetoric came from religion. From monarchs who based their claims to legitimacy on theories of the divine right of kings, straight across the spectrum to revolutionaries who borrowed the rhetoric of Old Testament prophets to call for the slaughter of the rich, political argument drew primarily on theology’s vision of an eternal order imperfectly reflected in the material cosmos. Conservatives argued that the existing structure of society more or less mirrored God’s order, or would do so if the liberals would only shut up and behave; liberals argued that the existing structure of society was moving toward a more perfect reflection of God’s order, and would get there more quickly if the conservatives would only stop dragging their heels; and radicals argued that the existing structure of society was in utter conflict with God’s order, and had to be terminated with extreme prejudice (along, often enough, with the liberals and the conservatives) so that a new and perfect world can come into being.<br><br>The displacement of religion by secular ideologies in the 18th century left all three of these basic political viewpoints in place, but levered them neatly off their theological foundations, leaving their adherents floundering for new justifications. The standard response at the time, and ever since, was to force history to play theology’s role, by mapping theological ideas of good and evil onto the complexities of the past. Whenever a political question comes up for debate, accordingly, it’s a safe bet to assume that all sides will immediately drag in canned historical narratives that have been stretched and lopped to fit whatever simplistic moral dualism their ideology requires, so that they can tar their opponents by associating them with history’s villains (to the contemporary American right, socialists; to the contemporary American left, fascists) and wrap themselves in the mantle of history’s good guys.<br><br>Thus it’s vanishingly rare to see any public discussion of historical events these days that doesn’t fixate, often to the extent of caricature, on distinguishing the good guys from the bad guys—and when this is attempted, the first reaction of a great many listeners or readers is to figure out how to cram what’s been said into that same simplistic moral dualism. While there’s a point to applying ethical philosophy to history (and vice versa), though, there are entire realms of understanding that can’t be reached so long as the center of discussion is who was right and who was wrong. Over the next few weeks, I plan on talking about the rise of America’s current empire as a historical phenomenon and not a morality play, and leave my readers free to make their own moral judgments if they find those useful.<br><br>The use of history as moral ammunition in contemporary politics, mind you, accounts for only part of the complexity of the subject we’ll be discussing. Another part, a crucial one, comes from the intricate history of America’s empire itself; that, in turn, comes from the fact that the United States of America may be a single political unit but it has never been a single culture or, really, a single country; and the fault lines along which America has split repeatedly for more than three centuries can be traced right back to the European settlement of the continent’s eastern seaboard. We can start there.<br><br>When the first waves of colonists from western and central Europe arrived on the Atlantic shores of North America in the 17th century, none of them seem to have realized that they were the beneficiaries of a cataclysm. Around the periphery of the Old World, the European voyages of discovery found crowded nations with no spare territory for migrants, but the Americas and Australasia seemed all but empty. The native peoples of all three continents have reasonably enough objected to this description—after all, they were there—but the perception of empty space wasn’t simply propaganda. It reflected the aftermath of the most appalling demographic disaster in recorded history.<br><br>The accident of plate tectonics that opened oceanic barriers between the Old and New Worlds had an impact on disease that wasn’t clearly understood until quite recently. Most of the world’s serious human pathogens came to our species from domestic livestock, and nearly all of that happened in the Old World, because Eurasia happened to have many more species suitable for domestication than the New World did. One at a time, over the tens of millennia between the closing of the Bering land bridge and the voyages of Columbus, pathogens found their way from animal vectors into the human population, epidemics swept the Old World, and the survivors gradually picked up a certain level of resistance. Those pathogens didn’t cross the ocean to the New World until the first European ships began to arrive, but when they did, they hit the native people of the Americas all at once. Within a century of 1492, as a result, native populations collapsed to 10% or less of their precontact levels.<br><br>The scale of the dieoff can be measured by a simple fact still rarely mentioned outside of the specialist literature: in 1500 the Amazon jungle as we now know it did not exist. At that time, and for many centuries before, the Amazon basin was a thickly settled agricultural region full of sizeable cities and towns with thriving local and long distance trade. The first Spanish explorers to travel down the Amazon described it in these terms, which were dismissed as fables by later writers who knew only the “green hell” of the postcollapse Amazon. Only in the last two decades or so have sophisticated archeological studies shown that the conquistadors were right and their critics wrong.<br><br>The same collapse swept the eastern seaboard of North America, where settled farming villages were established by 2000 BCE, and complex agricultural societies with rich political, cultural and religious traditions thrived for many centuries before 1492. (A thousand years before the founding of Jamestown, the level of cultural sophistication in the Chesapeake Bay tribes was arguably higher than that found among the inhabitants of Dark Age England.) After a century of dieoff, the survivors were scattered in small communities across a mostly vacant landscape. That was what the first waves of European colonists encountered. They told themselves they were settling in a wilderness, but they were quite wrong: they were arriving in a land that had been settled and farmed for countless generations before their time, and benefited immensely from the legacies of the peoples whose surviving descendants they elbowed out of the way.<br><br>Compared to cramped and crowded Europe, the eastern seaboard of North America seemed almost unimaginably vast—the distance between the two early colonies at Jamestown and Plymouth is greater than the entire length of England from the cliffs of Dover to the border with Scotland—and the sheer impact of space, together with sharp differences in climate and even sharper differences in the people who came to settle, drove the newly founded colonies in radically different directions. In what would become New England, English religious minorities made up much of the first wave of arrivals, and the society they built replicated 17th century English rural society as closely as the new environment would permit. The result proved impossible to transplant further into the country, which is why rural New England remains something of a world unto itself, but it wasn’t accidental that the Industrial Revolution got started in New England not much later than it did in the English Midlands: the same cultural forms that drove industrialization at home did much the same thing in the transplanted society, and the industrial society that emerged out of the transformation spread westwards as the country did.<br><br>Far to the south, in the band of settlement that started at Jamestown, matters were different. The settlers in what became the tidewater South weren’t religious minorities fleeing discrimination, by and large, but the employees of English magnates who simply wanted, like their masters, to make as much money as possible. From Chesapeake Bay south, the climate was suited to grow tobacco, and like most drugs, this was a hugely lucrative cash crop; after a few generations, cotton joined tobacco, and the basic pattern of antebellum Southern life was set. Sprawling plantations worked first by indentured servants shipped over from Britain and Ireland, and then by slaves shipped over from Africa, became the defining land use pattern along the southern half of the coast, and spread inland wherever climate and topography allowed.<br><br>Between New England and the tidewater South lay a poorly defined intermediate zone, a scattering of small colonies—New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland—and one very large one, Pennsylvania. Maryland and Delaware were mostly tidewater and might have gone the Southern path, Pennsylvania and New Jersey weren’t and might have gone the New England path, but Pennsylvania and Maryland both enacted religious liberty statutes early on and welcomed all comers, so the middle zone got dealt a couple of wild cards that ended up transforming the entire colonial enterprise: a torrent of religious and political refugees from central Europe, who fled the aftermath of the Thirty Years War, and a torrent of economic and political refugees from northern Ireland, who fled England’s tightening grip on her first and most thoroughly looted imperial colony. West of Chesapeake Bay lay the Potomac valley, one of the few easy routes into the mountains, and it’s likely that somewhere up that way—by the nature of the thing, nobody will ever know when or where—German and Scots-Irish traditions blended with scraps of a dozen other ethnic heritages to create the first draft of American frontier culture. Think log cabins and long rifles, homespun cloth and home-brewed liquor, a fierce habit of local independence and an equally fierce disdain for the cultures of the coast, and all the rest: that’s where it came from, and it spread westward along a wide front from the Great Lakes to the middle South.<br><br>All this ought to be part of any basic education in American history, though as often as not it gets lost in the teach-to-the-sound-bites frenzy that passes for education in America these days. What doesn’t get in even in those rare schools that teach history worth the name, though, is that these three nascent American cultures—call them New England, Tidewater, and Frontier, if you like—also define three modes of expansion, two imperial and one much less so.<br><br>The first mode is the New England industrial model, which spread west to the Great Lakes early on and trickled gradually southward from there. It’s one of the shibboleths of modern thought that industrial systems create wealth, but as Alf Hornborg points out usefully in <i>The Power of the Machine</i>, their main function is actually to concentrate wealth; the wealth that would have gone to a large number of small proprietors and skilled craftspeople in a nonindustrial society goes instead to the very small minority with the money and political connections to build and run factories, control access to raw materials and energy resources, and the like. That’s why every nation on Earth that has ever built an industrial economy within a free market system has ended up polarized between vast fortunes on the one hand and an even vaster number of hopelessly impoverished workers on the other. That’s the New England model—it was also the English model, but that will be relevant a bit later on—and it drives a very specific kind of imperial expansion, in which sources of raw materials, on the one hand, and markets where industrial products can be exported, on the other, are the central targets of empire.<br><br>The second mode is the Southern plantation model, which spread due west from the tidewater country until it ran up against certain hard political realities we’ll discuss next week. The plantation model started out as a straightforward export economy, but found itself drawn into the orbit of the rising industrial system; cotton from Southern plantations was eagerly sought by the textile mills of the English Midlands, and the political economy of the cotton belt morphed into a pattern that ought to be profoundly familiar to Americans today, though it’s generally not: it’s the pattern found today in Third World nations under American or European domination, in which raw materials for industry overseas are produced under harsh conditions by a vast and impoverished labor force, while a small upper class is well rewarded for keeping the system running smoothly. That’s the Southern model, and it drives a very different mode of imperial expansion, in which arable land and cheap labor are the central targets of empire.<br><br>The Frontier model is something else again. It also had a powerful expansionist dynamic, but it was egalitarian rather than hierarchical, and didn’t provide anybody with a convenient place to hook up a wealth pump. What Frontier culture craved from expansion was simply real estate, where people could build a cabin, break the sod, plant crops, and make a life for themselves. Over time, as the model ripened and values shifted, it gave rise to a vision of American expansion in which an entire continent would be seeded first with frontier homesteads, then with prosperous farms and nascent towns, and replicate political and economic democracy straight across to the Pacific. What would happen once that limit was reached was a question very few Americans asked themselves.<br><br>Before that point was reached, though, these three cultures were going to have to sort out their relative strength and influence on the new American nation. We’ll talk about that next week.<br><br>***************<br><span style=font-size:130%>End of the World of the Week #12</span><br><br>Hegel, whose personal contribution to the history of false prophecy was the subject of last week’s End of the World of the Week, was one of dozens of 19th century intellectuals who were convinced that their careers marked a great turning point in human history. Unlike his competitors, though, Hegel proved to be a major inspiration to future generations. Most of the ideological follies of the 19th and 20th centuries drew on Hegel in one way or another; Marx was only the most successful of the people who fell under the enchantment of Hegelian dialectic and spouted prophecies that turned out to be just as wrong as Hegel’s had been.<br><br>Still, a special place belongs to Francis Fukuyama. A US State Department policy wonk turned neo-Hegelian academic, Fukuyama got his fifteen minutes of fame in 1989 by proclaiming, in a widely read essay and a book, that history was over. His argument, a sort of pop Hegelianism reduced to the lowest common denominator, was that history is a Darwinian struggle among different systems of political economy, in which whichever one crushes the competition is by definition the best; that the defeat of Communism showed that “liberal democracy”—that is, the country club Republicanism of George Bush senior—was the winner of the great contest; and that, just as soon as the last stragglers got with the program, humanity would henceforth bask in peace and prosperity forever.<br><br>What made all this a masterpiece of unintended irony is that almost identical claims were retailed by the Marxist regimes whose collapse Fukuyama’s essay was intended to celebrate. Not that long before, in fact, the American conservative movement was notable for its skepticism of Hegelian handwaving and grand theories of history’s march to perfection, while the Marxists they opposed spent their time proclaiming that history was on their side and everybody else simply had to get with the program. By Fukuyama’s time, that skepticism had given way to blatant imitation—compare the official US arguments for the invasion of Iraq with articles in <i>Pravda</i> justifying the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan sometime, and see if you can find a significant difference—and the neoconservative movement, which was heavily influenced by Fukuyama’s work for a time, proceeded to launch itself along the same track to history’s dustbin that the Marxist regimes they loathed had followed before them.<br><br>—story from <a href="http://www.vivaeditions.com/book_page.php?book_id=25">Apocalypse Not</a>

Interesting way of looking at US colonial patterns/cultures -- I am eager for the next installment! BTW, aside from '1491' which I read a couple of summers ago (and had the greatest of difficulty putting down), what are other best sources on the mind-boggling calamity of those first contacts between Eurolanders and the Americas? <br><br>It is still hard to wrap my head around the scale of the tragedy: a 90 percent die-off on two continents. I've seen some of the wreckage in person (in Haida Gwaii): the last funerary poles carved by artists who themselves were dying (of smallpox and TB). All the old village sites in the archipelagoes of BC -- some inhabited for 10,000 years prior to the arrival of Eurolanders and their "guns, germs, and steel." Now just middens with sometimes the contours of earthworks, house pits, a fish trap, a canoe beach, modified (bark-stripped) cedars, a clam garden -- maybe, rarely, the rotted remains of the last poles. The NW climate doesn't leave us much in the way of relics.<br><br>The Americas are a haunted landscape; OK, I guess all the world's inhabited landscapes are pretty well blood-soaked and haunted, but there is something about this particular holocaust -- its speed? its blundering semi-intentionality? the tremendous lies, denials, and misconceptions it fostered? the juggernaut of (first) Spanish gold and (next) American power that it enabled and unleashed -- that keeps making my brain stumble.<br><br><a href=america-origins-of-empire.html#c2169046476217831858 title="comment permalink">3/7/12, 11:22 PM</a><br><br>

Love the intercontinental germ warfare and the geography that results from settlement which as a Brit I have sensed at this distance without seeing the source of it.<br><br>I don’t know, JMG, if you saw my request last week for religion in the discussion, but thanks for including some in the conservatives/liberals/radicals description. I’ve always been interested in your own “conservatism” which doesn’t fit the description you give here. You’re no liberal either of course, since nature and history do not suggest automatic movement towards ‘something better’, nor a radical since destructive acts against society don’t improve matters.<br><br>So I’m coming to see you as a conservative on the scale of Nature, as befits a Druid. To you the natural system not only reflects the divine but immanently reveals it; civilised patterns intertwine with this wider revelation but not necessarily with any elegance, and may err badly in their understanding of the relationship -- as with Spengler’s descriptions of the late civilisation, and Vico’s of its increasing abstraction (idealisation). So that interface is a part of your conserving. Your awareness of how history rolls across geography seems to work off that perspective too. <br><br>Also, not trying to derail you but the definition of conservatism made wonder about your perspective on China. It seems to me that a great deal of what made China historically more conservative (and better at conserving culture and avoiding dark ages) was the ability to accept imperfection which stemmed from the fact that Tao is not claimed to be transcendently good and is not seen as separate from nature, but on the contrary as constantly present and fulfilling it. There may be less of ‘abstraction problem’ in that case since people are not expecting society to be inherently perfect just by conformance with Heaven.<br><br>Of course they then suddenly fell for a historical perfection when they took up Communism, which is out of character with their genius (or physiognomy) and was such a disaster. I wonder how that will play in to their future. Any thoughts?<br><br><a href=america-origins-of-empire.html#c6503334524789628919 title="comment permalink">3/8/12, 4:09 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c8303126403508238790></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/08724938709642010624 rel=nofollow>Mister Roboto</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>The "Frontier" subculture and its fierce independence may be the reason why the homosexual freedom movement ("gay lib" in the lingo of the late Seventies/ early Eighties) got its start in the unlikely locale of the hyper-religious USA. In the most remote of the frontier-outposts, available women were often few and far between, so it became common for men to form homosexual relationships with one another. The story-template of the movie <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> goes much further back than many people entirely realize. Of course, the fierce personal independence fostered by these environments made these men not at all predisposed to think of these relationships as something of which they should be ashamed, even if they didn't necessarily publicize them.<br><br>If this was fairly common, then it was something that likely to be fairly well-known, even if the social conventions of the era made frontier male homosexuality something about which people only spoke in whispers in the New England and southern Tidewater subcultures. The result of all this was both the peculiar American disdain for male homosexuality and the quest to legitimize homosexual attractions and relationships. In my personal opinion, it's a crying shame that the homosexual subculture that emerged from "gay lib" turned into its own form of conformity and repression. But all that you have taught your readers about social, political, and philosophical history over the past few years leads me to think that such bitter ironies are far from uncommon.<br><br><a href=america-origins-of-empire.html#c8303126403508238790 title="comment permalink">3/8/12, 6:15 AM</a><br><br>

A weaker form of malaria used to be present well into the north, but the far more serious and deadly strain was limited to the south. Charles C. Mann's "1493" goes into this in detail.

I asked a question last week wondering if “empire” is in our genes and your current post indirectly jarred a thought I have had floating around for awhile. After living in all 3 regions that pertain to your model and currently residing in the south (tidewater) region your post hits home.<br> <br>It appears just looking at US census statistics that folks more reminiscent of the indigenous cultures of the America continent climate seem to be making a comeback especially here in the US. States on the Mexican border and also Florida have gone from around 10% to over 30% (some 40%) from 1970 until now. Folks of Hispanic and African descent appear to have a much easier go of it when it comes to doing many of the more laborious tasks especially in the southern regions. Also looking at early tidewater colony history it appears that there is some correlation with when colonist struggles started to ease, the slave population started increasing fairly rapid. Most folks who I have observed of European descent (which I am part of) struggle when it comes to them having to perform laborious tasks in this region, many of which may be of necessity in our future. I consider myself in good shape (gym, walk, bike) however as of the last few years I have put the shovel to where my thoughts are and I am in the process of converting my lawn areas to food production along with the needed passive irrigation and it is a humdinger.<br><br>I am not stating all this to be insulting but just want to be honest in my observations and put it out there for feedback on what this might entail for the future of this region. Will the tidewater region along with other parts of the US revert back to more indigenous cultures as it appears to be?

At a fundamental level, the U.S. is composed of different visions of how society should be run, and those divisions are becoming increasingly irreconcilable. Add in the fact that highly productive "blue" states send more revenue to the federal government than they get back, while antigovernment "red" states are, in fact, welfare sponges. Finally, factor in that there are secession movements already afoot (Vermont, Texas, Alaska), which are minor, but may gain in popularity as conditions deteriorate.

In this he sees the origins of America's obsession with aquisition and expansion in oppostion to all other human values. He believes this is essentially "baked in" to American culture, and that the seeds of America's decline are essentially sewn by historical circumstance. Interestingly, he sees the antebellum South as the major historical opposition to the Yankee "hustling" lifestyle, and its destruction in the Civil War as assuring the primacy of the former over the direction of the nation. <br><br>Industrial systems and technology also concentrate <i>power</i> too, which is why I wonder why people are so enthusiastic about a future full of cell-phone implants, smart grids, autonomous robots, self-driving cars, and social media.

I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism. He cut me off. ''That's not the way the world really works anymore,'' he continued. ''We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality -- judiciously, as you will -- we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out.

In short order, thanks to Jobs &amp; Co., we've gone from a literate culture that had a human depth, and a sense of self, to a screen culture that has neither. All that remains is the flickering image of the moment—not exactly the stuff of revolution, or even serious protest. Really, what could be more congenial to the American corporate state?

The reasons behind this are another sticky historical issue for people of European descent that is often glossed over.<br><br>It is believed that there was trade / contact between the people of the Indonesian islands and the mainland of Australia. Dingo's are one of the outcomes of this contact. Until fairly recently Thylacines ranged the Australian continent and dingo's have replaced them and fulfil the same ecological niche.<br><br>Also it is believed that the stands of bamboo and strangler figs found on the north coastline of the continent were planted by mariner / explorers of Chinese descent far earlier than the Europeans and their expeditions.<br><br>Fascinating stuff.<br><br>By the way, the English had the whole system down pat by the time they settled the Australian continent. They exported their surplus population not as indentured labour, but as convicts! Nice work really. Anyway, the convicts were a source of cheap and expendable labour for the government and free settlers, until the gold rush made the entire activity pointless.

The British had been stuck on their islands for quite some time before becoming established as a naval power. Perhaps being an island nation helped with that, but it took quite a bit longer than in the US. The Romans had a similar expansionist drive, although theirs was one of (overt) military conquest, and once they reached the limit of their expansion, they stopped. Perhaps the Mongolians? Again, though, they engaged in overt and rather nasty military conquest rather than the American frontier-drive.<br><br><a href=america-origins-of-empire.html#c2839493261600459782 title="comment permalink">3/9/12, 9:09 AM</a><br><br>

(I speak as a 10th generation Yankee and identify myself as a New Englander before an American). One is that our cultural homogeneity owes much to the fact that the Puritan Great Migration lasted just 10 years (1630-1640), after which it was abruptly shut off once the English Civil War commenced. The 21,000 emigrants who came over during that period were all from a very narrow range of English society who then grew organically from within over the next 150 years, absorbing virtually no immigrants whatsoever, and in those generations created what we know as Yankee culture. The other is our geographic isolation from the rest of North America. New York City outgrew Boston in importance once the Erie Canal opened and we were cut off from the western trade which resulted (Hudson Valley to the Great Lakes). The north-south barrier of the Litchfield Hills, Berkshire and Green Mountain ranges prevents easy east-west communication (all our major rivers run north/south not east/west). To this day there are only a handful of connection points between New England and New York overland, and this includes all infrastructure such as road, rail, power, pipelines and communications. I am convinced that the reality of our geographic isolation will become significant again as the fossil fuel age winds down.<br><br>Another good book not mentioned yet is DW Meinig’s “Atlantic America” which traces the cultural hearths and their impact on North American settlement: http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300038828<br><br><a href=america-origins-of-empire.html#c1015146648638430854 title="comment permalink">3/9/12, 9:39 AM</a><br><br>

It propelled me to do a bit of research, and the history is fascinating:<br><br>American tribes such as the Mandan, Shawnee and others lived in the plains for milennia and hunted bison by herding and stampeding them into traps or corrals made beforehand, killing entire herds at a time. It seems that there were fewer bison then - none reported by Hernando de Soto in the Southwest area in 1540. The "hills black with buffalo" arising later may have been an effect of decreased human predation. <br><br>They bloomed just in time to support the much greater numbers moving into the plains as the European settlement continued.

There have been attempts at cooperatives where the means of production are jointly owned but they haven't really caught on. <br><br>I know that land in general becomes concentrated because of human nature. Take a patchwork of small farmers, one will be just a little more successful, buy out a neighbor, then someone else will have bad luck and have to sell at a bad price, someone else cashes out and gets a good price, after a few generations you have latifundias. <br><br>The point you were getting at about culture and empire and how a culture can survive the fall of an empire usually... What made the Indian civilizations more successful or at least more stable? <br><br>The great theory of explaining Europe vs. the rest of the world was that geographic barriers made defense very easy and offense very hard so multiple strong, viable, competing cultures could coexist in in close proximity. Elsewhere in the world there weren't the natural barriers so dominant cultures would sweep across the land forming empires, weaken and be swept away by another dominant culture. <br><br>The problem with the big theories is that a proponent might not be willfully deceitful but genuinely mistaken. He's not trying to shade the truth or massage the facts to fit a thesis, he's putting forward the most honest theory he can but he just happens to be wrong. <br><br>I will admit that my own biases are towards finding the greatest good for the greatest number. I think the liberal sin could be defined as "well-intentioned mistakes than only make the problem worse" and the conservative sin, to paraphrase Galbraith, is looking for little more than a "superior moral justification for selfishness." Usually the liberal is trying to make up for the sins of the father, the legacy of earlier conservative actions. <br><br>It's all a big, ugly, thorny mess and it's difficult to tell the difference between people who have the straight dope and are seeing clearly, people who are genuine and just happen to be very wrong, and people who are telling self-serving lies to advance a secret agenda.<br><br><a href=america-origins-of-empire.html#c8365768845752090401 title="comment permalink">3/9/12, 1:16 PM</a><br><br>

Trying to strip politics back to the most basic point, Lasswell said "Politics is who gets what, when, and how." That seems pretty elemental. <br><br>In terms of political conflict, it usually seems to boil down to a status quo: some have it good, some have it rotten. Those who have it good will be conservative because they don't want a good thing to change. Those who want reform are taking it in the shorts. They will be the liberals or reformers. <br><br>It seems to go against human nature to allow for a square deal, for all parties to negotiate as equals and come out of an exchange mutually enriched. According to theory trade and commerce should be about exactly that. Party A and Party B are this wealthy on their own, are this much more wealthy with trade. Seems fine in the textbook.

Woodard's project of mapping American cultural areas reminded me strongly of Joel Garreau's book "The Nine Nations of North America", which I read in the 80s. Interestingly, though, rather than taking a snapshot of current cultural divides, Woodard's approach focuses on the geographic origins and unique cultures of the original colonists in each area, and the subsequent historical development and interactions of the resulting "nations". He is clearly building on David Hackett Fischer's work on the cultural geography of the English and French colonies in "Albion's Seed" and "Champlain's Dream". <br><br>Woodard does break down the eastern seaboard more finely than the Yankee/Midland/Tidewater groups. In the mid-Atlantic colonies he distinguishes between the moderate, Midlands (with Quaker and German origins), the Appalachian backcountry (dominated by Scots Irish Borderlanders), and the New York area (which he argues still draws its commercial and multicultural character from its origins as New Netherland). In the South, he also distinguishes the Tidewater area around Virginia from the Deep South, which was more fundamentally a slave society from its outset (many of the original Charleston colonists having migrated directly from Barbados) and eventually became dominant over Tidewater in the Confederacy. In addition he discusses the French and Spanish colonial presence; briefly mentions the recent resurgence of Inuit and American Indian nations in Canada, Greenland, and Alaska; and argues that two new cultural nations have more recently developed along climatic lines in the Far West and Left Coast (see – Ecotopia).<br><br>My own background being mainly from Alaska and Oregon, the dynamics on the eastern seaboard sometimes seem to have been long ago and in a different country – which I suppose is his point – but it was fascinating reading and gave an interesting perspective on how political alliances, not to mention perspectives of various family members, are influenced today by cultural history. Certainly there is a real border between the east and west sides of the Cascades, which is at least as significant as the boundary between Washington and Oregon.<br><br>- Grant Canterbury<br><br><a href=america-origins-of-empire.html#c7470077565902233090 title="comment permalink">3/10/12, 9:48 AM</a><br><br>

Back in the 19th century, when American Empire was both more publicly acknowledged and limited to the continent, New York was dubbed the "Empire State." Later commemorated by a building.<br><br>The point made was that, though Washington may have been the political capitol, the commercial and population expansion that eventually filled the continent flowed through NY, which I guess was thought of as a city-state. Do you consider NY more New England, or Frontier? the industrialism of the former was certainly part of the export, but it seems to have had a more mercenary nature.<br><br>Much of the flow bypassed the American hearths and moved straight from Europe through the port of NY and to the Midwest. I guess you could call it the "soddy shack" culture. At any rate, their progeny, along with Yankee farm boys and more recent Irish immigrants made up much of the cannon-fodder that was instrumental in the decisive struggle to consolidate the nascent empire under a dominant regime.<br><br>Growing up in the South, it always seemed strange to me, and must have been truly bewildering to my ancestors, that these disparate groups could work up so much zeal for something that didn't seem to really be any of their business. To undergo the hardships and losses they did for four long years and to put in such superhuman endurance and effort (only exceeded by the defenders) so as to win a war that had no apparent benefit to them. My readings over the years has convinced me that the desire to secure the empire was indeed the motivating force for Lincoln, but that the soldiers who did the fighting were about equally divided between those who fought for the abstract "union" and those who had been preached at about the evils of slavery from the pulpits of the North and who genuinely fought to free the slaves. And, of course, a lot of draftees and adventurers, as always.<br><br>Anyway, I don't know if this is getting ahead of the story or not, but if the war was fought between the empire paradigms of the North and the South, the winner is clear, but which North are we talking about? On the one hand, you seem to be saying New England didn't reach beyond it's home turf, and on the other, Frontier wasn't really imperialistic. Something pretty serious put a whuppin' on the South.<br><br><a href=america-origins-of-empire.html#c141521020359008261 title="comment permalink">3/11/12, 9:40 AM</a><br><br>

In addition to the ones that moved across NY and PA to the Midwest, there were those who crossed the Cumberland Gap and moved into Tennessee. D. Boone et al. While some of them, like my g-gparents on my mother's side, went south into the Mississippi Delta and took up the plantation culture, others moved into the hill country of Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, or Mississippi, or crossed the wild lands of Arkansas and ended up in Texas. (Hence we get "T for Texas, T for Tennessee.")<br><br>They also, though they had little to gain by upholding the plantation culture, provided most of the cannon-fodder for the South.<br><br>Oddly enough, now this Scots-Irish culture has a dominant role in one of our major political parties, formerly referred to as the "Party of Lincoln."<br><br><a href=america-origins-of-empire.html#c6581866224298481319 title="comment permalink">3/11/12, 10:00 AM</a><br><br>

Almost too late, they finally realized the gold was the land underneath their feet. I've read London and southern England had grown so crowded that if the New World hadn't been discovered, millions would have simply died in poverty in England.<br><br>Thomas Jefferson's vision for Americans were for them to be farmers and help each other, excluding himself and Washington, plantation owners. Farmers are extremely vulnerable to agriculture disasters--weather, drought, pests, and that was the rise of tobacco as a cash crop. Tobacco strips the soil of nutrients, unlike cereal grains, so that Jefferson was only the third US president but sent Lewis and Clark to the west to look for land--for growing tobacco. Jefferson completed the Louisiana Purchase, again, land for growing. <br><br>The biggest mistake Jefferson made is in not recognizing the slave population of the south were exactly suited for being American farmers, according to his original vision. Slaves had the most experience at--farming. Jefferson focused on weak-wittedness, as evidenced by one of his ads for a runaway slave. Jefferson was disastrously myopic on this one point. Permitting slaves to transition to farmers might have side-tracked the Civil War. However, it would have been disastrous for the Industrial Revolution. Maybe American history will be seen as the continuing choice between competing evils? Someone always has to lose?<br><br>The colonies' debts incurred during the American Revolution (farmer became soldiers and crops disappeared for at time) meant the creation of the Federal Bank in New York, allowing states to transfer their debts to the fledgling US federal government, another mis- step. Soldiers just had to return home and return to farming, but they were rewarded "war pensions." My ancestor who fought in the American Revolution was granted 5,000 acres in southeastern Kentucky. I have no idea who or how "5,000 acres" was arrived at as the correct compensation, how the 5,000 acres were surveyed, or anything else. It would be fascinating to find out the thinking behind the American Revolution pensions. At the time, Kentucky was just an extension of Virginia, and given Virginia "belonged" to the King of England, after the American Revolution it belonged to the new Unites States.<br><br>My ancestor continued his primary career of building water powered sawmills. He didn't claim his 5,000 acres until he was 76 years old, when he moved to Kentucky along with his closest friends and built a sawmill and a home.<br><br><a href=america-origins-of-empire.html#c2121338353763004475 title="comment permalink">3/11/12, 10:45 AM</a><br><br>

He claims that many of the folkways noted by Northern and foreign visitors, such as horse racing, gambling, dueling, herding of cattle and pigs vs. mixed agriculture, etc. were a legacy of the Celtic origins of much of the population. <br><br>Things may have changed, but about 20 years ago I had an acquaintance in the California prison system who complained of the difficulty of getting a job. There were only a few clerical positions, much competed for. In the 50s and 60s the prison industries included dairies, orchards, canneries and furniture factories that provided much of the food consumed by the prisons, mental hospitals and other state institutions. I know the dairy and orchards at Folsom are gone, I don't know what remains (other than licence plates) of the manufacturing--office furniture was still being produced in the early 90s. Unions pressure was responsible for laws restricting sales of prison products outside of state agencies. <br><br>Early colonists were aware that disease had cleared their way--John Winthorp's journal records that "the small pox was gone as far as any Indian plantation was known to the west, and much people dead of it, by reason whereof they could have no trade. At Naragansett . . . there died seven hundred." I think there is also a passage in Gov. Bradford's account of sending exploratory groups out from Plymouth, who found many deserted villages, abanodoned fields and full graneries, which they looted. The Pilgrims saw this as God's work in clearing away their enemies.<br><br>A literay movement of the South, known as the Agrarians, opposed indultrialization and stood up for regional cultures. Unfortunately, opposition to Northern interference was often tied to racist sentiments. The persistance of the Civil War in Southern consciousness is an important theme for William Faulkner, one of the Agrarians. His declining gentry, poor whites and patient Negroes are often portrayed in opposition to Yankee hustlers, New York Jews and other representatives of the North.<br><br><a href=america-origins-of-empire.html#c4244211887561789105 title="comment permalink">3/11/12, 4:03 PM</a><br><br>

Hubbert’s peak occurs when approximately half the world’s accessible petroleum has been pumped out, and so the slope down from it will more than likely parallel the slope up to it.”<br>But you forget, I think, that the rate of usage—of depletion—on the downward end of Hubbert’s hill will countenance with a much-increased base of users and uses for fossil fuels, thereby precipitating a higher extraction rate that was found on the way up the peak. More-importantly, the methods of extraction are today several times more-efficient than before, meaning that the bite of reduced availability of oil will take longer to be felt than it would have, if we were using methods that do not scrape the bottom of the barrel quite so well.<br><br>Not long ago, in the Economist (http://www.economist.com/node/21547791) there was a piece that somehow celebrated the increased efficiency of extraction, even as it grimly noted that “Production is certainly past its peak, however. Since 1999, when Britain was the world’s sixth-largest oil and gas producer, yields have fallen by an average of 6.2% a year, reckons Oil &amp; Gas UK, a trade body (see chart); the country now ranks 18th. But the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) forecasts that over the next 30 years another 14 billion-24 billion barrels of the black stuff will be recovered. … There may yet be new finds … But much of the remaining British oil is hard and expensive to extract,”<br><br>The former Prime Minister of France said some days ago that peak oil was three years away. http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/01012393328-on-est-dans-l-imbecillite-politique-collective<br>And even in all that, of course, he said France should go nuclear like there is no tomorrow, because how else to maintain the cushy comforts without oil? Nobody is ready for smaller living; it will kill too many people, before a generation is born that thinks of smaller living as normal and nice.<br><br><a href=america-origins-of-empire.html#c6060987161572749106 title="comment permalink">3/11/12, 4:33 PM</a><br><br>

We had no centralized bureaucracy telling factories how many paperclips to make, allocating to other businesses. Anyone who wanted to make paperclips could do so. Anyone who wanted to buy paperclips knew where to go. The cost of mistakes in estimating demand or poor management would be carried by the manufacturer. If they did poorly, they would go out of business and a new competitor would step in. <br><br>In this model, the government's involvement was solely limited to setting regulations standards for safety and the courts for ensuring that contracts could be trusted to have teeth. <br><br>By contrast, the communist countries were ridiculed for being impossibly top-down in organization, trying to centrally control things that they were ignorant of and could only make worse with meddling. And as a matter of prestige, the state could allow no institution to fail. And it was impossible for good people to rise to the top because of cronyism and nepotism. <br><br>I find it fascinating how we've gone exactly the same route. Every single flaw of the Soviet model is being reinterpreted with a red, white and blue patina.
