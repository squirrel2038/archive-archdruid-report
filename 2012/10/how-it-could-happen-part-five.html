<span style="font-size: small">This week’s post is the last of five parts of a fictional narrative tracing out a scenario of American imperial defeat and collapse. As a bankrupt and divided nation stumbles toward its destiny, the question that remains is whether anything can be salvaged from the American experiment. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">*********</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Within hours, thanks to news media reporting minute-by-minute from St. Louis, word of the proposal to dissolve the Union circled the globe.  The most common reaction was to dismiss it as an edgy joke.  One pundit wrote hopefully that the prank might finally bring the convention to its senses. A few articles profiled the two delegates who had written the measure, giving them their first fifteen minutes of fame—they were back in the news two years later, on the occasion of their wedding—and then the media tried to move on to what it considered important news.</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Over the days that followed, however, the proposal took on a life of its own.  Across the country, in bars and living rooms and grange halls, people talked about little else; public meetings and rallies drew huge crowds, and with each passing day more of them backed the proposal.  Meanwhile the online forum set up for comment on the convention’s debates crashed three times in as many hours, flooded by posts about dissolving the Union.  By October 4th, the day that the proposal was scheduled for a vote on the convention floor, comments on the forum were running ten to one in favor of dissolution. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Politicians and pundits were discovering to their horror what more perceptive observers had noticed long before—that the United States had long since broken apart culturally, and stayed together only because the power of the federal government put disunion out of reach.  Now, though, the unthinkable was an option. Every region saw a chance to get what it wanted without wrestling with the country’s yawning cultural chasms; western states in which up to 90% of the land was owned by the federal government, and thus exempt from state taxes and fees, ran the numbers and saw how easily they could balance their budgets once all that real estate fell into their hands;  ambitious politicians on the state level began to dream of leading new nations; and the thought of getting out from under the massive Federal debt, by the simple expedient of dissolving the government that owed it, was on many minds.  For them and many other Americans, dissolution seemed to offer dazzling possibilities, and few considered the massive downsides.</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">On the night of October 3rd, opponents of the measure counted heads and found that they lacked the votes to stop it.  Parliamentary maneuvers kept it off the floor the next day, but that unleashed a popular reaction that convinced even the most sanguine observers that something drastic was afoot. Rallies had already been called for the 4th, and they exploded in size as word got out that the vote was delayed.  Across the country that night, crowds gathered and slogans sounded in the firelit dark.  St. Louis saw one of the biggest demonstrations, with shouting crowds marching past the convention center for more than three hours. Delegates looked down at the sea of faces, and wondered where it would end. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">The proposal to dissolve the Union finally came to a floor vote on the 6th. Despite impassioned pleas from opponents, it passed by a large majority.  Another vote abandoned the amendment that would have stopped unfunded mandates—in the absence of a federal government, the point was moot—and a third brought the convention to a close. The moment the final gavel came down, the floor erupted in angry words and more than one shoving match, but the thing was done: what would be, if it passed, the 28th and last amendment to the constitution was on its way to the final test of ratification.</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Now Congress’ decision to require amendments to be ratified by state conventions rather than state legislatures came back to haunt the Washington establishment.  The power struggle between the states and the federal government had suddenly been overtaken by the people, and if the delegates they elected to the ratifying conventions supported dissolution, there was no way under the constitution to stop them; by law, a US constitutional amendment took effect the moment it was ratified, with no need for enabling legislation or anything else  As the crowds marched, though, at least one person was thinking about ignoring the constitution—and he had, in theory, the power to make that happen. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">

<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Admiral Roland Waite, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, paced down a Pentagon hallway to “the tank,” the soundproof conference room where the Joint Chiefs met.  The Vice Chairman and the heads of the service branches were there, but so were the DCI and DNS, directors of the CIA and NSA respectively, along with key officials from elsewhere in the executive branch.  Most of the federal government’s remaining power to make things happen was concentrated in that one room. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“You’ve seen the president.”  This from General Mendoza, the Marine Corps commandant. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“Yes.” Waite settled into a chair at the long table in the room’s center.  “Every time I go there these days, I wonder if I’m the only adult in the building.” That got an uneasy laugh.  “He’s still dead set on a military response,” Waite went on, and the laughter stopped. “Today he ordered me—his word—to get things rolling: troop movements, logistics, everything. He’s got Justice working on the legal excuses.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“They’ll need ‘em for martial law,” said General Wittkower, the Vice Chairman. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“It’s not just martial law.”  Waite leaned forward. “He wants the whole country under military rule.  Homeland Security’s working on a list of people to round up, internment camps, that sort of thing.”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“Jesus,” said Wittkower. “He’s talking coup d’etat.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“Do you think we can make that stick?”  Mendoza asked. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">The DCI answered.  “Best case scenario, yes, but we get a major insurgency out West backed with arms and money from China—no way will Beijing be dumb enough to miss an opportunity like that. Worst case?  The National Guard and some Army units side with the states, and we get civil war, again with China backing the other side. Could we win?  Heck of a good question.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“That got asked a lot in 1861,” said Mendoza. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“In 1861,” said Wittkower, “one region wanted out and the rest of the country said no you don’t. Now?  The North wants to get rid of the South just as much as the South wants to get rid of the North, and let’s not even talk about the western states.  I wish I could say we could count on the Army, but what I’m hearing from our security people isn’t good—and the National Guard is worse.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“There seems to be a lot of money backing dissolution,” said Waite. “Chinese money?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“Heck of a good question,” the DCI said again. “America’s made a lot of enemies, and China’s only one of them. We’ve tried to trace the funds, but whoever it is knows how to hide their tracks.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“What does Wall Street think?”  This was from Wittkower. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“Depends on who you ask,” said one of the civilians, a career bureaucrat from Treasury.  “Some firms are scared to death of dissolution and some are eager to cash in on it. Military government?  That’s no problem, they know they can work with us.  Insurgency or civil war is another matter.  Even if we win, they’re saying, that’ll trash what’s left of the economy and hand the rest of the world to Beijing. If we don’t win, they’re going to be hanging from lampposts and they know it.”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“Right next to you and me,” Mendoza said.  No one laughed; they all knew the commandant was right.</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“Here’s the question that matters.”  Waite looked from face to face around the table.  “Do any of you think we can make it work?” Nobody answered.  After a long moment, Waite said, “Well.” He got to his feet.  “I think we all know what comes next.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-size: small">*  *  *</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">P.T. “Pete” Bridgeport showed up at eight the next morning for his weekly talk with the president.  A genial fixture in the Senate for three terms, he had been an obvious choice to take the vice presidency after Weed resigned.  He neither liked nor trusted Gurney, but politics was politics and a job was a job; he put on his friendly smile and went through the door.  He found the president staring at a flat screen with a face the color of putty and the expression of a man who had just been strangled. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“Good God, Lon,” Bridgeport said.  “What is it?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">The president kept staring at the screen and said nothing.  Bridgeport came around to see for himself.  A TV newscast showed Admiral Waite in uniform in one of the Capitol briefing rooms.  ADMIRAL:  GURNEY PLANS MILITARY COUP was splashed across the bottom of the picture.  “—a terrible idea,” Waite was saying, his face bland. The words at the bottom of the picture shifted:  RESIGNS AS CHAIRMAN OF JOINT CHIEFS.  “But if this is how the American people decide they’re going to exercise their constitutional rights, the military’s job is to salute and say, ‘Yes, sir; yes, ma’am.’” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“Lon,” Bridgeport said quietly, “did you?” He had been told nothing of the military planning, but the president looked at him, and Bridgeport could read the answer in his face.  “You’d better pack your bags,” he told Gurney then; his smile was gone, and his voice was suddenly that of the experienced politician explaining realities to a clueless junior.  “They’re going to have your guts on toast.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">A president with strong public or Congressional backing could have survived the news, but Gurney had neither. At ten o’clock that morning, the Speaker of the House, ashen-faced, announced that other business would be set aside to consider a bill of impeachment.  By the end of the day, nobody doubted that the bill would pass, and a head count of the Senate showed that conviction would follow.  That night, Gurney had his press secretary read his resignation and fled the country on a private jet. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">President Bridgeport took the oath of office a few minutes before midnight on November 12th, and his inaugural address called on Americans to join together and make the nation work again.  Though his personal popularity was high, his message fell on deaf ears. For a great many Americans, Gurney’s failed coup had been the final straw, and Bridgeport’s efforts to rekindle a sense of patriotism were openly compared in the news media to Gorbachev’s attempts to relaunch Communism in the Soviet Union’s last days. Even his executive orders bringing the last US troops home from overseas and scrapping the nation’s obsolete carrier fleet did nothing to shift the terms of the debate. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">There was little else Bridgeport could do, because the federal government was dissolving around him.  The collapse in the dollar made federal salaries worth next to nothing, when plunging tax revenues allowed the government to pay them at all, and most federal employees simply walked off their jobs.  Meanwhile, as the US dollar moved closer by the day to its ultimate value of zero, a pragmatic mix of barter, state scrip and Canadian dollars became the medium of exchange across much of the country. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">The first state to ratify the 28th amendment, in a fine piece of irony, was South Carolina, the first state to secede in 1861. The ratifying convention met in Charleston on December 6th, and it took them less than three hours to pass through the formalities and vote for ratification; crowds sang “The Bonny Blue Flag” late into the night.  Two days later Colorado met, and though it took longer—a loyalist faction fought hard—the results were the same.  Before Colorado voted, Michigan met, and startled observers by voting against ratification.  The next day, Iowa and New Mexico met, and voted to ratify. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">That was the way it went, day after day, week after week. A handful of states bucked the trend, but only a handful, and the count rose steadily toward the crucial number of 38 states, three-quarters of the total. On January 29, when the Nebraska convention assembled in Lincoln, the count stood at 37 for and 9 against.  It was a quiet, businesslike meeting.  Once the delegates had been seated and the preliminary business taken care of, by unanimous vote, the convention closed debate and went straight to a roll call vote.  By 118 to 32, the 28th amendment was ratified and the United States of America ceased to exist. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-size: small">*  *  *</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Three weeks later, Pete Bridgeport walked to the Capitol for lunch, greeting passersby on Pennsylvania Avenue as he went.  The Capitol doors were unguarded these days; he went to the elevator and punched the floor for the Senate lunchroom.  That was a restaurant now, serving the famous Congressional bean soup and sandwiches named after dead presidents to help keep the lights on in the old building. He knew the regulars at lunch, but this time Bridgeport spotted a crowd of unexpected faces. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“Pete!”  A senator from Pennsylvania—former senator, Bridgeport reminded himself—waved him over.  “Your timing’s good,” she said. “We’re inventing a country.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“No kidding.” He ordered a bowl of soup and half a Harry Truman, paid in Canadian dollars, and went over to a long table where a dozen former senators and representatives sat over half-eaten lunches. The senator’s words were no surprise. New England had just declared itself a republic, nine southern states had delegates in Montgomery hammering out what wags were calling Confederacy 2.0, the republics of Texas and California had been proclaimed, and word was that Florida would follow shortly</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">The senator filled him in.  “We’ve been at the Senate Office Building on the phones with the states all morning. The seven eastern states that voted against ratification are in. So are Ohio and Delaware—they called off their conventions once Nebraska made it moot. New Jersey only ratified because of Trenton; they want in, and Kentucky talked it over and decided they’d rather be with us than with the South. So what we’re saying is, okay, the rest of you don’t want the Union, that’s fine; we still do.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“Thinking of using the old name?” Bridgeport asked. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“It’s got a nice sound to it, doesn’t it?  Here, take a look at the map.”  She handed him a printout: the old United States with a new border, marking off twelve states across the eastern core of the continent:  from New York and the mid-Atlantic westward through Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky to Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin, linking the Atlantic, the Great Lakes, and the upper Mississippi.  It was, Bridgeport realized, a viable nation.</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">The senator looked past Bridgeport, waved.  “Hi, Leona. Care to pull up a chair?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Leona Price had been the District of Columbia’s nonvoting delegate to Congress, and was a lunchtime regular at the Capitol.  The senator filled her in, and asked, “How about the District of Columbia?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“How about the <i>state</i> of Columbia?” Price replied. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">That stopped conversations at the table for a moment, but only a moment; the district’s aspirations to statehood had been common knowledge in the old Congress.  “Rhode Island’s gone,” said an Ohio congressman down the table, “so, yeah, we’ve got an opening for a little state.  You want the position?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Price grinned.  “Have to put it to the citizens, but I’m guessing yes.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“Just a moment,” said Bridgeport.  He left the table, found another lunchtime regular, a former Senate staffer, and talked to him in a low voice. The staffer left the lunchroom and was back five minutes later with a bundle of cloth. Bridgeport stood up, and said, “Can we clear some space in the middle here? This might be useful.” He and the staffer unrolled the bundle. Thirteen stars in a circle, thirteen red and white stripes: a tourist-shop copy of the original US flag lay spread in front of them.</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“It was a pretty good country,” said Bridgeport, “back when there were just thirteen states, and we weren’t trying to run the rest of the world.  It could be a good country again.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">“It’ll take a lot of hard work, Mr. President,” said the senator from Pennsylvania. She emphasized the last two words.  “A lot of hard work.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">They were all looking at him, Bridgeport realized:  not just the senators and representatives, but people all over the lunchroom.  “I know,” he said.  “What do we need to do first?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">****************</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: large">End of the World of the Week #46</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">If you’re going to be wrong, there’s something to be said for being wrong on the grand scale, and the redoubtable Edgar Cayce certainly managed this when it came to his predictions of apocalypse. A devout if eccentric Christian with a talent for self-hypnosis, Cayce would put himself into trance and provide intuitive readings for clients.  The practical advice that came through these sessions was often remarkably sensible—clients who asked about investments all through the 1930s and 1940s were urged to buy and hold stock in electronics and technology companies, a tip that made millions for those who took it—but his scorecard when it came to the end of time was not quite so impressive. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Not that Cayce’s narratives were dull—far from it.  According to him, a cataclysmic sequence of earth changes would ravage the planet between 1958 and 1998. The earth’s poles would shift, bringing tropical temperatures to areas that are now frozen; vast tracts of the western United States, Europe, Japan, and other places would sink beneath the seas, and new land would rise out of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; Atlantis would return to the surface in 1968 or 1969; finally, the Second Coming of Christ would take place in 1998, the battle of Armageddon in 1999, and a Utopian future of perfect peace and enlightenment would dawn with the new millennium. It was a grand image, and formed the usually unmentioned backdrop for a great deal of the New Age movement’s more lurid fantasies of the future; it seems almost cruel to point out that none of it happened. </span></div>

New England would certainly think about going its own way as a whole, even though some parts of it are basically extensions of New York now. As for California, the main question is whether California would decide to resurrect the old "Bear" Republic, or to become part of a larger new country named Aztlan.

It seems in the story that they're already far enough down the Long Descent that there is almost nothing to lose by dissolving the union, which, as long as civil war doesn't break out first, sounds like a realistic basis from which to start the political conversation of breaking up the country via legal means.<br><br>At this point, as a Canadian, and as one living in a major city, I'm just hoping China doesn't break our backs from bending us over backwards. It seems the province of British Columbia and the federal government are already allowing China to bring in temporary Chinese workers to do what would be well-paid important resource extraction jobs. There is a new mine being built in B.C. by a Chinese firm that is going to use two hundred Chinese long-wall miners. Apparently the company said there were no Canadians with these long-wall mining skills but didn't ask the governments relevant to train any workers ahead of time (they must have heard about the provisions of the treaty by the PRC before it was implemented here). We recently signed some new treaty that benefits China more than us, and now it seems the chickens have come home to roost. This reminds me of what I've heard from my friends from Sudan, Chinese workers taking over jobs in exchange for tax revenues and some infrastructure building. Seems Canada is racing to the bottom with gusto. It would be such a pleasure if you guys would get your act together so that we'd at least have a bidding war for our resources.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c6806624046655669299 title="comment permalink">11/1/12, 6:29 AM</a><br><br>

Once everyone has experience with succession and rearrangement, there will be nothing sacred about the former State boundaries either. The Republic of California would have a heck of a time holding together; expect the secessionists in the State of Jefferson to begin a rebellion before even the rest of the states secede! Southeastern CA might belong more naturally with AZ, which would make them the Saudi Arabia of Colorado River water. And so on. No, this is not an ending, it is the beginning of a tumultuous era of redefinition, reimagining, and a lot of failed experiments. <br><br>Re: Not following the constitution, I might think that most future sub-USA Republics would take a good look at the exiting C for the USA and decide "Heck, that's not half bad as is! Maybe we should actually try using it for a change?" Add a few tweaks for specific regional interests, more safeguards against governmental overreach, and some funky little customizations here and there just to say "we're different" and presto! New Nation. If you look at the Constitution of the Confederate States of America, it was remarkably similar to that of the USA except for stronger explicit guarantees of private property rights and a 6-year term for the Presdent. The Bill of Rights was still there (including freedom of speech and religion), bicameral legislature, checks and balances, etc. Sure slaves and women were not citizens; nor were they in the USA. at the time. <br><br>Re: International relations -- This will be the life or death of any region that becomes autonomous.

Great pacing, details, characterization, etc. Oval office suicides notwithstanding, what struck me most about the story is the tone: it is far less grim than I expected. While I know better than to have expected mushroom clouds on the horizon, I was surprised to hear very little mention of starvation, collapsing health care infrastructure, blackouts, or the inevitable invasion from China or another foreign power one the new (weaker, but still resource rich) nations are established (Chapter 6?). Not a complaint, and gods know you have addressed your share of dire consequences in the past, both potential and inevitable; just an observation. For an Archdruid Report saga about the end of the American empire, it seemed downright sunny. Almost as if its author, acutely aware of the intractable regional and cultural differences currently extant in our country, might prefer things that way...<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c7443520197088304250 title="comment permalink">11/1/12, 7:15 AM</a><br><br>

Given that many Hawai'ians desire independence -- many making the very correct claim that they never really gave their lands over the US anyway -- it would seem that they would ratify such an amendment quickly. However, given its location and high percentage of Japanese, Korean, and Chinese folks already living there, I can imagine the Chinese jumping at the opportunity and trying to claim Hawai'i for itself, basically re-flagging Pearl Harbor with Chinese emblems.Does that seem like a reasonable notion?<br><br>At the same time, I wonder about the degree of reality for many of the regions of the country to keep on as the nation falls apart. What involvement do multinational corporations and banks have in this process? As they are the primary makers and movers of goods like food, it would seem that if the union dissolves there would probably be food shortages throughout the country.<br><br>I imagine DC &amp; New England would face many woes in any kind of economy under this scenario simply because I can't think of much of anything produced in that region for export. They have a lot of people skilled in finance, information management, administration and techno-woowah, but few natural resources and little infrastructure to support the creation of new industries. I don't think they have the military infrastructure either to enforce their role of wealth pump, whereas down south there are many massive military installations -- i.e. Ft. Bragg.<br><br>In many ways I imagine that politicos could redraw the lines of the map in this scenario, but for people on the ground it really wouldn't make much of a difference as the black market would come to take over a vast majority of economic activity. Then the political establishments would serve only as figureheads to the dying spectacle of politics but their ability to exercise power would be severely limited.<br><br>On the whole, though I have trouble believing in such an orderly dissolution, I appreciate this series of posts as a great thought-experiment that has certainly given me much to consider about future scenarios. But just sitting here puzzling over the numerous issues that come up just from this rather believable scenario boggles my mind, reminding me once again that the future will always cloak itself in clouds of unknowing.<br><br>cheers!<br>Evan<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c3035561255292092437 title="comment permalink">11/1/12, 7:19 AM</a><br><br>

I live on the Missouri side of the St. Louis area, not part of what would become the new union in your scenario. Reading the installment, I felt a pang of grief. I don't think of myself as being patriotic, but reading this, I know I have an attachment to the ideals I read into the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. And I have an attachment as a northerner since I grew up in Michigan. St. Louis is, as you and Woodard have noted, a border city, not really being northern, southern, eastern, or western. Right now it doesn't matter so much because we're part of a much larger union, in fact it adds a lot to the city's culture. In your scenario we might end up in a union whose ideals I wouldn't much like. Plus, located at a very strategic position at the confluence of the two largest rivers in North America, we could be the focus of a struggle for control by one or more unions. I hope for both idealistic and practical reasons that the US doesn't break up, but you've laid out a scenario that reads true.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c632608587553725762 title="comment permalink">11/1/12, 7:35 AM</a><br><br>

You had me hooked from the first paragraph of the first installment, and I am not exactly the target market for Tom Clancy-type fiction.<br><br>You had to dissolve RI and break my heart, didn't you? My first thought was "JMG didn't get the memo on how scrappy we've always been." But the more I think, the more I see that our economy is mostly a service economy that relies on outside money (largely from the NY area), RI's National Guard employs a lot of people who live in MA, there is a lovely deep harbor not far from where I'm sitting that is currently used mostly for pleasure boats but was once a busy shipping port and could be again... and so forth.<br><br>This line of thought brought to my attention state-centric prejudices that I am not proud of and would have previously denied having. I'm also reminded that it really wasn't all that long ago when one of my ancestors signed the Portsmouth Compact, saying in effect "Oh yeah? Watch us create something new and prosper as a result." That blood runs through my veins but could do with a bit of waking up.<br><br>Well played, Archdruid.

While I'm not rooting for doom and would be happy if things turned out well, I'm not sure how those problems would play out. <br><br>I do agree that there are a lot of ridiculous distortions in the existing economy. We pay farmers to not grow food, we pave over farmland for bedroom communities, spread everything out so cars are required to live when sensible people would build things closer together. <br><br>I agree with markets in theory and people voting with their wallets but the usual free market loonies refuse to admit that subsidies distort a market. When so much of suburbia is subsidized, people aren't presented with a true price for their choices. Or when it would make more sense to grow food locally, if factory-farmed food sets the price floor too low, no one can remain in business. We get obviously illogical situations like it being cheaper to buy garlic grown in China than garlic grown down the street. This goes beyond the usual textbook examples of comparative advantage, i.e. growing oranges in groves in Florida being cheaper than growing them in hot houses in New York. Likewise, it's cheaper to build a business twenty miles outside of town than to renovate a building downtown. <br><br>Personally, I'd like living on a smaller scale, not having an American empire, not taking part in an insane consumerist potlach of the world's choicest resources. I just have a feeling there will be a lot of fighting and shouting before such a change can be made.

As for the Constitution, no argument there; one of the few constructive ways out of the present mess, it seems to me, would be a movement to enforce its terms on a federal government that pays no attention to it at all. <br><br>Robert, I've commented before that the American settlement of the dryland West has failed, and the territory is in the process of being (re)absorbed by the nearest society with the population and cultural viability to tackle it.

That's one of the points I hoped to make -- that when push comes to shove, the survival of the US as a single nation might not be something anyone's willing to fight for, any more than anybody was willing to fight for the Soviet Union in its last days. <br><br>Bob, not really. My point is that, to recycle T.S. Eliot a bit, an empire can end with a whimper rather than a bang. The new post-US republics are all facing a difficult future with economies in freefall, pervasive poverty, and a huge amount of hard work to be done, but it's not that different from the task faced, say, by Lithuania or Armenia in the wake of the Soviet collapse. <br><br>Evan, what happens after the dissolution is, as Bill commented, more history. Some of the new republics may succeed, others will turn into failed states, still others will be absorbed by other powers -- that is to say, history as usual. <br><br>SLClaire, whoever owns St. Louis has the key to the middle of the continent, so it's likely to be a major flashpoint for political and military struggles for centuries to come. Michigan may be a good deal quieter. ;-)<br><br>Maria, nah, Rhode Island is one of six states in the Republic of New England. (Maybe seven -- it's not impossible, with Massachusetts' proponderance of population and money, that the other states would require a division into West MA and east MA as quid pro quo for forming the republic.) Still, the state loyalties you've mentioned are a powerful force in this country, and could become much more so as we proceed. <br><br>Auchris, here's hoping. <br><br>Jim, West Virginia will accept a union with Virginia when pigs sprout wings and fly to the Moon. That said, of course the borders might end up falling somewhere else -- the line I drew was just one of many options. <br><br>Reaper, I gather you didn't read the amendment closely. The nukes on US territory become the property of the state in which they're located; the nukes not on US territory are divvied up by agreement among the states. As for the evaporation of the US debt, remember that there's been panic selling of dollar-denominated paper going on for most of a year before dissolution; a lot of people lost a lot of money, but by the time it all became formally worthless, you could buy a $10K T-bill for a couple of dollars. Yes, it was a blow to the global economy, somewhat cushioned by an eager market for Chinese treasury bonds...<br><br>KMO, we'll see about the novel.

If an electoral-only win for Obama is recorded, we're sure to hear much more than the oft-repeated calls to eliminate the electoral college; we just might see the onset of the breakup you are envisioning here, beginning as early as next week.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c1192754634402486168 title="comment permalink">11/1/12, 9:34 AM</a><br><br>

This, taken together with its many fine harbors, gave New England a great economic advantage two centuries ago.

Awesome and realistic description of a scenario for the demise of U.S.A. <br><br>My first thoughts on reading the conclusion is what I'd tweak for a new constitution. Stronger freedom of speech (prosecuting/persecuting reporters &amp; bloggers somehow quashed). A more refined 2nd amendment - hunting arms good, militia style arms avaiable through your militia armory and supervised. And finally, a person is a person, a corporation is NOT a person.<br><br>One thing I could envision is a mass migration of people from region to region as they find themselves in regions whose political/social vibe don't match their personal beliefs. I for one would desire to find a more moderate home than I currently reside.<br><br>Speaking of which, the business aspects of this story would help flesh this out in book form as well. Would TBTF banksters crash and burn? How about those JIT supply chains. A whole lot of people would be out on the street and trying to find ways to survive if business collapses as I would expect under the scenario you describe. In a way, this could be the new beginning of the "localization movement".<br><br>So under your scenario, Fort Knox is sitting pretty, and NYC is sitting pretty with all those gold piles.

Federal lands transferred to state ownership? No problem. Weather satellites? NOAA? Coast Guard? I can see that becoming a continental "international" sort of program, like INTERPOL or the ESA. The nations of North America pay for it because they all benefit. <br><br>As for the nukes, facilities are scattered throughout the nation and there's a lot of high-level maintenance required. Some figures I've read say the tritium needs replaced every few years with the plutonium cores requiring a full remanufacturing every decade or two. Russia did not give up her nukes after the USSR ended. Russia proper is a huge country even without the satellite states. Maybe none of the successor states would have the means of keeping them maintained? <br><br>Aircraft carriers probably aren't seen to have much value given the scenario that played out so I doubt any of the coastal states would want one even if they were free. Attack submarines would remain incredibly useful but there's no way to divine something like that equitably, let alone the question of whether any coastal state would have the financial wherewithal to pay for them. Some things may be considered axiomatic and agreed upon without debate right up until the solid ground everything was built upon turns to quicksand. "Of course Great Britain will have a navy twice as large as the rest of the world! We have a global empire to run and this goes without saying, pip pip!" Genteel poor living in the ruins of great mansions on the hill still imagining themselves the betters of their social inferiors in town who are actually solvent. So of course nobody would willingly give up their nukes, maybe they'll just quietly go bad in their silos? "Jeeves, what's the status of our strategic deterrent? Non-functional, you say? Double the guards, we must make it look like we have something worth protecting. Keeping up appearances." <br><br>I know that the whole scenario is taking place a few years in the future, not Next Sunday AD, but I do have to wonder what a sudden collapse of the American presence in the world would mean elsewhere. Politics abhors a power vacuum. I wonder how cozy Russia and China will remain when their interests come into conflict.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c8414728041276876287 title="comment permalink">11/1/12, 10:27 AM</a><br><br>

This kind of prophetic fiction is very difficult to do well, and I think you do it well (It reminded me of the 1987 TV miniseries "Amerika" which attempted the same ur-narrative of national breakdown and renewal, in light of the political currents of its time). <br><br>As a story, these 5 parts lack a strong central character. I think these parts would do very well as chapters, alternating with other chapters recounting the lives and choices of one or more people experiencing these changes from the ground. At least one of these people might be an incipient green wizard. I think if it were brought together right, it would be very marketable. <br><br>I think the story overstates China's current or future global power, but China is a perennial target of emotional engagement for Americans, so this doesn't hurt marketability at all. We all know that the purpose of such fiction is not to accurately predict the future, but to remark on the present.<br><br>Beyond what I've said above, I'd like to offer two more suggestions. First, I think the story should do more to depict the thoughts and motivations of the two Presidents, perhaps reflected in dialogue, meditations, quoted writings or interactions with their wives. Both of them seem a bit cardboard to me, and the "coup" is not described enough to seem real. Second, the dissolution of the Union seems too easy and glib. This may reflect your actual view of the case, but I think the story could well handle at least a few discourses, quoted writings or conversations forming a sort of "new anti-Federalist." The statement that in 1861 one part of the country wanted out but the rest wanted it in, seems like an attempt to put away a complex argument with a simple, dubious assertion. The US was, if anything, more diverse in 1861 than today and many in the North, including several of Lincoln's generals, were not at all sure they wanted the South in. That's the sort of thing that needs unpacking. <br><br>Many thanks for your most entertaining and thought-provoking efforts.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c6692282638780295591 title="comment permalink">11/1/12, 10:49 AM</a><br><br>

Living as I do within the metropolitan area of New York City, this is now our second climate-change-related storm (if you count Hurricane Irene).<br><br>I encountered a strange new creature who is filling a newly-opened ecological niche. Walking around my town the day after, I came across an unfamiliar sound, that although new to me, has proliferated quite quickly, and I'm sure will become a familiar sound in the years to come. Every block or so, one of the houses would have a generator. I felt like I was walking around some new and strange post-peak world of haves and have-nots. The generators were like gigantic white-noise machines scattered across the landscape, identifying those who were attempting to sooth themselves, perhaps by blocking out the sounds of passing sirens and the rest of the world.<br><br>I can't say I'm fond of them: they're very loud and can be heard for quite some distance. They sound to me like a garbage truck revving its engine--continously. Until now, I had only read of generators on peak oil blogs and "prepper" websites and I didn't realize they'd be so dang loud. They are taking away one of the silver linings of this hurricane for me: quiet, and at night on my street at least, darkness. <br><br>My other observation is that their owners don't seem to be much concerned with conserving what energy they produce. Glancing inside one generator-owner's house, I could see the lights on in an empty room. During the height of the storm, the generator at the business across the street kicked in, whose sole purpose it seemed (being as it was the middle of the night) was to shine a security light through my bedroom window. This has continued each night since, and frankly, it seems wasteful to me to run a generator just to turn on the TV or illuminate an empty parking lot. Can't we just enjoy our few dark quiet nights while the power's out?<br><br>p.s. A friend and I drove around an hour ago looking for gas. Visited six stations and got nothing. I didn't realize you needed electricity to pump gas. Not a fail-safe method.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c4783055889146056885 title="comment permalink">11/1/12, 10:55 AM</a><br><br>

Buyer's remorse still seems a likely outcome, though. The post-Great Power years are going to be hard with or without a breakup, and folks who grew up expecting a, well, American standard of living will be looking for scapegoats. You seem to have done your best to finish the story on an optimistic, "let's get to work" note, and that's certainly the reaction one would hope for; but is that really the reaction you expect? I'd think there would at least be some kind of Unionist irredentist movement, proclaiming that we were stabbed in the back by traitors and foreign agents, and our only hope is to overthrow the new governments and reconquer each other - uh, I mean reunite the country.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c5133832383483440663 title="comment permalink">11/1/12, 11:21 AM</a><br><br>

NATO? A lot depends on whether the nations of Europe step up to the plate and pay for their own defense for a change. Israel? One way or another, it's toast once the US goes down; I may have to address that in a future post, though I know it's going to get screaming trolls from all sides of the issue. <br><br>Shark, this is a narrative scenario, not a novel. If I were writing it as a novel, I'd have two sets of central characters, one at the top level of DC politics -- Pete Bridgeport and his good friend Weed's secretary of defense would be good choices -- and the other on the ground level -- a working class family in Pittsburgh, say, with a son in the Army who ends up in Kenya.

Excellent series, and well thought out. <br><br>That said, I think the larger issue ignored within this excercise (in what would be a messy post-script) is the fact that while these 'sub-nations' can work out over time viable economies of their own, what they can not do is adequately do is support any type of viable lifestyle for the current population size. <br><br>Contraction would necessitate a Darwinistic minimalization of huge swaths of the population without viable skillsets or adaptability (or means or access to power). <br><br>That would be messy, and likely create large scale civil unrest by economimcally displaced. <br><br>Nature has provided many instances of when large animal populations are suddenly deprived of their habitats or food supplies, by some type of unexpected disloaction.

The political will to pay for a common Euro defence would require an external threat sufficient to unite the Euro countries. I don't see Russia as a serious threat to the interests of Britain and France who would form the core of any European military. Estonia and Latvia would just have to clean up their act. Poland might be hostile to Moscow but as long as Russia maintained a decent working relationship with Germany Warsaw would be marginalised.<br><br>Israel yes raising the subject tends to generate a lot of heat. I'd be interested to hear your take. For what it's worth I'm sympathetic to Israel before 1967. I don't condone everything they did in 1948 but I don't believe the Jews behaved any worse than any other group would have done in their situation. After 1967 however Israel has gone further and further off the rails. The situation in the West Bank is one of apartheid and it is futile for Friends of Israel to deny it. The perpetrators of Operation Cast Lead are war criminals. <br><br>I also belive that the Israel Lobby in the US is in reality no friend of Israel's true interests at all. By protecting Israel from any effective Western pressure to make a meaningful peace deal with the Palestinians they will succeed in destroying any possibility of a two state solution until the balance of power eventually swings decisively against Israel as it eventually will. When that happens the Palestinians will no longer be interested in a two state solution, they will demand all their country back.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c9155553779568181466 title="comment permalink">11/1/12, 12:50 PM</a><br><br>

This could not normally be work in our state-or-province legislature, or even in that key forum (key because, the Abbot reminded us, all politics is local) the Town Council. But we did have a political duty of witness.<br><br>In what (he asked) might our Abbey's labour of witness now consist? <br><br>We had, he said, a duty of joy, for in a time of public anxiety a burden had been lifted. <br><br>We knew Uncle Sam well, he said. <br><br>Many of us in the Abbey had learned, he said, from writers such as Chris Hedges and Morris Berman how Uncle Sam had been promoting a hustler individualism from the very earliest years of the now-defunct Union. <br><br>((/FICTION_PART_ONE_OF_TWO))<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c7815905634142419664 title="comment permalink">11/1/12, 3:05 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not at all sure what to make of it. I didn't intend it as a pilot for anything, just as a narrative exploration of the themes I've been discussing; we'll see where it goes from here. <br><br>Robert M, oh, granted, it's already the first kind. <br><br>Lugnut, like so many people, you're stuck on fast-collapse imagery. Population can contract in many ways, most of which don't require bodies littering the landscape. One way or another, of course, the human population of this planet is going to decline to roughly preindustrial levels, but "one way or another" includes a great many options, especially when the decline is stretched out over a century or two, as I expect it to be. <br><br>Robert, a huge amount depends on just what Russia's long term intentions are. If they simply want to control their near abroad and provide for their own security, Europe could be a fairly peaceful place, until the Middle East overflows and you start getting mass migration. As for Israel, we'll leave that for a future post. <br><br>Malcolm, I don't think you really read my suggestion. Vermont is poor by American standards today; in the event of independence, it would very quickly become poor by African standards. Are you prepared for that? <br><br>Rashakor, possibly.

I note the FSU didn't break into civil war, although it was a violent place for some time, that was less political and more criminal.

I've always thought the US would break up sooner or later, although I had never considered it happening through a constitutional convention before. Its a pretty soft landing compared to the scenarios I've tended to think about.<br><br>Even if the US as a whole breaks up peacefully, I wonder what wars the new nations will end up fighting, civil wars as well as wars against each other, especailly with the ongoing climate changes shifting which areas are habitable.<br><br>The Republic of Florida of your scenario, for instance, would face a nasty future. I would imagine that many forward-thinking people would have fled the state before the break-up was complete, and those who stuck around would face a future in which their country steadily shrinks from rising sea level, and either becomes a failed state overflowing with refugees, or else starts a war as a desperate move to claim territory that's above the rising waters.<br><br>The southeastern coastal states have the most land to lose when the sea rises, and I imagine that at some point in the next few decades, the time will come when few will be able to deny it anymore even in the most conservative areas. If the US manages to hold together until that time, we could even see a situation where all the coastal states from Louisiana over to Florida and up to Delaware oppose dissolution of the union because the predicament of losing so much to the rising seas overwhelms the grievances they have with the north, with the northern states and the inland south all wanting dissolution so they can close their borders to the refugees that they can't deal with because they've got their hands full with their own issues. In this circumstance, Michigan would probably be one of the ones pushing for secession (and proabably joining together with other nearby states with similar predicaments) for the purpose of being able to close their borders to immigrants, as Michigan and surrounding states will likely be a major destination for climate refugees.<br><br>Texas could be a viable nation as things stand now, but I see climate change putting them in a very hard position too.<br><br>Continued in next post<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c7165629068416679218 title="comment permalink">11/1/12, 6:46 PM</a><br><br>

The American settlement of the inland west has never been sustainable, and always been heavily subsidized by the federal government. I can't see any state or coalition of states in that region avoiding a nasty collapse in this scenario. I can't see California doing that great either. With climate change drying up the snowpacks, huge internal cultural differences, and agriculture that's dependent on large scale water diversion projects, I could see civil war breaking out in an independent California easily. If water gets scarce, northern California would see that it would still have plenty of water if they didn't have to share it with the southerners. The state as a whole would likely not vote for a peaceful breakup, as the majority of the population in the south would realize that without the water from the north, they become poor by African standards. If neighboring states/countries were dragged in, it could blow up into a major war.<br><br>New England might be able to do well for itself for a while, but at some point along the peak oil curve they're bound to face a crisis due to the large population size for its land area and poor soils, as well as losing some land to the rising ocean, although not as much as the southeast will.<br> <br>The state where I live, Missouri, would have plenty of issues of its own in such a scenario, and I imagine we wouldn't go it alone but would end up joining up with some other states, although which others they would be could go a number of ways. We do have several things going for us, such as we're not overpopulated, not coastal, and have a reasonable climate. I am worried about climate change and our summers, but even with the extreme drought this summer, it's been wetter than a normal year in, say, central Kansas.<br><br>Canada, with its small population and large land area is going to be attractive to many refugees in a hotter climate. With Canada becoming a Chinese client state, I wonder if the Canadians will have to deal with a large influx of some of China's excess population, but also receive Chinese military aid to keep its southern border secure from immigrants from the former USA.<br><br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c8001031303235794607 title="comment permalink">11/1/12, 6:47 PM</a><br><br>

I don't watch the news (or virtually any television) and only read the paper about once a week, but I sort of saw the provision of news to society as a ritual of sorts. We as a society kind of look at the news as an end in itself (it is like a ritual, well, sort of). Also the documentation and presentation of that news by the people providing it is also seen as an end point (the important bit for them), when to my mind it sort of seems like a beginning and it is the analysis and what you do with the information that is the important bit that often seems left out. Too often, I think we as a society sort of go, tick, done that and then get on with whatever grabs our attention next. Dunno, I still haven't quite worked it out in my head, but we sort of lack a narrative which could provide us with societal cohesion? Perhaps hard times can provide this cohesion? This has been the case after natural disasters here.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c3416814605364144645 title="comment permalink">11/2/12, 4:37 AM</a><br><br>

I have one here that is used about 50 hours per year and am hoping to phase it out of the system before next winter.<br><br>As you rightly point out they are noisy. What you may not know is that they are really inefficient for producing electricity and can use upwards of 1 litre of fuel per hour just doing nothing. Without a large battery bank, it is impossible to use all (or nearly all) of the electricity generated which is why they are running lights for no reason - because they can.<br><br>Still, my experience here is that they quickly use up all of their stored fuel at which point the generator is useless. This is what happened here after the Black Saturday bushfires in February 2009 and people were more or less demanding fuel be brought into these areas - which were locked down for very good reasons (no going in or out).<br><br>They are also amazingly unreliable and will break down when least expected!<br><br>You may get your quiet back before too long and I'd be interested if you could let us all know how it goes.<br><br>PS: There is no (or very little) light pollution here at night and on clear nights the sky puts on a huge show.

Such storm events are made more probable by climate change (isn't that correct?). <br><br>Both the governor of New York State and mayor of New York City stepped carefully over making any connection between recent storms and global climate change. I believe the governer said it feels like we've had several 100-year storms in the past few years (another adulteration of meaning--although whoever chose the phrasing "100-year" anything made a poor choice in phrasing! everybody assumes it means that thing will come every 100 years! .....communicating science to the public may be more difficult than the science itself.....) <br><br>I can't recall their exact words, but I was left with the impression that their words were politically-motivated: they were only being cautious as not to offend climate-change deniers!

This is going to be due to an increase in the price of energy and a lack of intensive capital. When you compare energy cost per mile, trucks and autos are the worst. Rail is far superior and barges are better yet. You can make this comparison with straight diesel but it holds true for whatever hypothetical power alternative you can imagine. <br><br>I think that this is very clear in the way our houses are constructed. In Florida, the old cracker homes were built before air-conditioning and every effort was made to use passive means to improve livability. Elevated off the ground, multiple floors, designed to provide a good cross-breeze. They're more expensive to construct this way. With AC, we could build simple boxes that had terrible thermal properties and use AC to make up the difference. You want the house to cost an extra $100k to build or do you want to give up less than 1% of your annual income to heat and cool it? It's a no-brainer. <br><br>If electricity costs increase to the point that the AC represents 30% of your annual income, if you can't even afford to replace the equipment when it breaks, cracker-style construction starts looking a whole lot more attractive. <br><br>He feels that these economic realities will bring back cities that were marginalized by 20th century transportation. We won't be able to maintain the interstate highways.

Thanks.<br><br>Ozark wrote:<br> “I can’t see California doing that great either. With climate change drying up the snowpacks…”<br><br>Regarding our fate here in California, I don’t see us doing that great industrial-wise either. However, in regards to weather patterns, they will change, but the entire state isn’t gonna turn into the Sahara. From studies I’ve read, in the state overall, amount of water will be about the same or only slightly less. Wet season is shortened and dry season is longer; fewer storms per year on average, but increasing intensity of storms, i.e., more water per storm. Sierras aren’t expected to get that much drier; though, type of precipitation will change with increasing percentage as rain vs decreasing percentage as snow. So, runoff will be more concentrated and not spread throughout the year as currently from snowmelt. Things will change for sure, but California, particularly the coastal areas, the north, and mountainous areas, will still have a relatively pleasant climate.<br><br>As far as Spanish becoming the dominant language and California becoming an independent Hispanic republic, Mexican state, or whatever, I have no problem with that myself. Hispanic culture has many strengths. I think another possibility is that China might look to California for lebensraum and/or agricultural wealth pump.<br><br>Civil war could happen here, but maybe not. Given JMG’s scenario, I think first there will be a mass exodus of, um, “Americans” from here and all over the west headed east (a lot of people came here for the money and have no connection to the land, and IMHO, there isn’t really any non-Hispanic culture of any depth to speak of). Many large cities, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Tucson will probably become ghost towns. The coastal California cities will probably retain remnant populations. I think if this happens, there may be no need to fight over the water. SoCal has three big straws – one (California Aqueduct) to NorCal, one (Los Angeles Aqueduct) to the eastern Sierra, and one (Colorado River Aqueduct) to the Colorado River. The CA is the only one dependent upon fossil fuel to actually pump the water and, considering the degrading condition of the Bay-Delta levees, that issue could be rendered moot. The LAA is gravity and siphon fed, and the CRA is run on hydropower provided by dams. In addition to all this, lower elevation SoCal areas average 10-15 inches of rain per year and there are several large, deep groundwater basins. The main issue will be maintaining these systems without the fossil fuel infrastructure. It may still be possible to transport plenty of water to SoCal and no one may object, but it will still need a local distribution system and a significant portion of the existing one is rather aged.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c7144875797002224502 title="comment permalink">11/2/12, 1:20 PM</a><br><br>

Is it possible to set up a local hydro-powered industrial infrastructure to produce the necessary materials for maintaining the system? In addition, could this system produce additional electricity for supporting other small-scale industry and even a small-gauge, regional rail system? It is my understanding that the dams themselves are rather substantial and will probably remain intact for a few centuries at least.<br><br>Considering this possibility, I have been playing with the idea that a modest post-peak culture could develop along El Rio de Colorado and that hydropower would help sustain it for a while. Currently, there is significant agriculture in the Imperial and Coachella Valleys using aqua del Rio. However, I expect that within 200 years, these areas, which are already below sea level, will be flooded by the Gulf of California (once it reaches Estacion Coahuila, Baja California) due to rising sea levels (and Yuma, Arizona becomes a port city at the mouth of El Rio). Still, there may be enough arable land above sea level adjacent to El Rio and within the watershed for growing a not insignificant amount of food.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c6595034150939725781 title="comment permalink">11/2/12, 1:27 PM</a><br><br>

A few comments about the Rocky Mountain states.<br><br>They're geographically hostile. There's a reason that they were some of the last states to join the Union: no one lived here, mostly because you can't easily farm.<br><br>The biggest issue on the flatlands is lack of water. Water runs off the high-clay soil. We have frequent droughts. The high altitude promotes rapid evaporation, and winters are bitterly cold and dry. The natural flora on the plains is prairie grass, sagebrush, and cactus, and without irrigation, you can't get much of anything else to grow. New Mexico: desert. Arizona: desert. Utah: desert. Nevada: desert. Colorado and Wyoming: high plains desert. Idaho and Montana have some interesting regions that will become even more interesting as the globe warms, but they are still some of the least populous states in the country.<br><br>The mountains themselves are called "rocky" because they are: there's little soil in which to grow anything, and the climate is fierce and hostile. Cheyenne (where I grew up) sits at 6000 ft. elevation in the middle of a vast, rolling plain. Laramie, in the bottom of a valley only fifty miles west of Cheyenne, is at 7000 ft. Most mountain peaks are above tree line, and one of the bragging sports in Colorado is "peak bagging," meaning climbing to the tops of all the "fourteeners" in the state (peaks above 14,000 feet in elevation.)<br><br>There are lush pockets scattered throughout the RM states, but they are profoundly isolated and relatively fragile environments. All the big population centers, like the cities along the Colorado Front Range, are technological artifacts. Most of our local history starts in the late 1800's, after the transcontinental railroad was completed. Without extensive irrigation and cheap interstate transport, cities like Denver would have dried up and blown away a long time ago.<br><br>The entire region has been subject to boom-and-bust cycles from the start, mostly built around mining and timber. We have repeatedly had a massive influx of population supported by outside money, followed by a population collapse when the money stops.<br><br>This is the land of the quintessential "ghost town." Every dried up town you ever saw in an old Western was talking about the RM states: whether Tombstone Arizona, or Buford Wyoming.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c4045191338679654611 title="comment permalink">11/2/12, 1:41 PM</a><br><br>

I would guess, then, that Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota, Nebraska, and possibly Kansas would form at least a trading alliance, if not a more formal union -- there is a lot of cultural sympatico (once you exclude all us liberals who have settled along the Colorado Front Range.) Wyoming and Colorado have minerals, and it's a very short trip back to cattle ranching; the other three have good farming.<br><br>New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah will not be part of that group. They're culturally distinct, they don't have a lot to offer the partnership, and they're on the wrong side of the mountains.<br><br>What will make this very, very interesting is Cheyenne Mountain, just outside Colorado Springs: the nerve center for NORAD. It will undoubtedly remain allied with the politicians in DC, and it is designed to close up for years, withstand nuclear and conventional assault, and still serve as the nerve center for coordinating a global nuclear counter-attack. It has access to some very heavy ordnance, and lots of it.<br><br>It is the Holy City, the Primal Archetype, of every guns-and-canned-goods barbed-wire redoubt dug into a Wyoming hillside.<br><br>It will remain a Power.

Words like “vacuum” and “emptiness” when used about a national catastrophe such as an alien occupation are simply insufficient: They cannot convey the anger people felt at their prewar and wartime leaders, their failed political systems, their own “naive” patriotism and the wishful thinking of their parents and teachers. Different parts of Eastern Europe experienced this collapse at different times.

The issues are population density and adaptability, of course. Rocky Mountain peoples had many ways of dealing with the complex distribution of warmth, water, biota, and net ecosystem productivity. Unless climate change dries them up all the way to the top of Pikes Peak (probably unlikely) they will almost surely maintain the ability to support some human societies. Whether these will be dense enough or have enough economic activity to warrant supporting a larger-scale government or be of interest to the more powerful nation states is another matter. But so long as there remains enough water to make a river flow from the mountains into a valley somewhere for at least part of the year, I expect you'll find a settlement in that valley getting by on corn, beans, poultry, hardy grazing beasts, hunting, and foraging. Not the easiest life, but not the hardest either. <br><br>Re: Sandy, etc...<br><br>The Mid-Atlantic hurricane with a direct strike on the NYC-NJ shore has been one of two nightmare hypothetical worst-case hurricane scenarios for many, many decades. The other was a levee-breaching hit on New Orleans. These have been talked about by climatologists etc. for as long as I can remember (and I started paying attention to this stuff as a young boy), with few in government wanting to listen. These nightmares were based on historical records, not climate change predictions or whimsical fantasies. The Mid-Atlantic scenario generally even included collision with a blocking Greenland high pressure ridge resulting in a sudden westward turn of the storm into the NJ shore to bring it in rapidly with intact wind field and full storm surge, focused right into the NY bight making Manhattan ground zero. <br><br>In the last 7 years we have finally seen both of these scenarios play out in the real world, in ways amazingly similar to how they were hypothesized. These storms are not a "new" normal; they are the (somewhat overdue) manifestations of the normal we have always been living in. Now... they do serve to point out how vulnerable these coastal population centers HAVE ALWAYS BEEN, which of course is relevant to how increasingly vulnerable they will surely become in an era of rising sea levels and POSSIBLY increased intensity of storms. But they are mostly demonstrations of the dangers we have always been living under yet have chosen to ignore.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c8012732194498209685 title="comment permalink">11/2/12, 10:08 PM</a><br><br>

Meanwhile gays and Jews, and in some areas women, would be fleeing the reddest of the red states. There would be quite an uptick in not-so-voluntary mobility.<br><br>And yes to Merle, above: living in BC I agree that China's clout in Canada is getting strangely obvious, and further imho is as good a signal of the failing power of the US as any lost ground war. Harper's just unveiled yet another sweetheart deal, negotiated in secret, months or years in the making, that would sign over a substantal chunk of our energy resources to a Chinese company or consortium. <br><br>Where's the payback? well I dunno what Harper personally may or may not have received, but there is a reciprocal (if you can call it that) sweetheart deal which would allow Canadian businesses preferential access to Chinese cheap labour and building sites or facilities there. In other words, our bizpeeps are eager to close shop here and move to China where there are none of those pesky environmental regs, where labour is cheap and intimidated, and where they won't have to pay Canadian taxes. Any disputes regarding this agreement -- an international treaty of significance and consequence, not quite a FTA but close -- would be resolved by an arbitration board of 3, count 'em, three people. Not people elected by any of the multi-millions of lives touched by the "gentlemen's agreement". Democracy? har har.<br><br>It's hard to figure out how the general public can ignore the boldly-written power relations underlying this deal; even if we're naive enough to think only in terms of "jobs," we ought to be able to figure out that this deal means fewer of those, not more. And it's even harder to understand how the US, that self-proclaimed hegemon, traditionally claiming Canada as its own turf (NORAD etc), can ignore this obvious incursion into its sphere of influence. As I say, it looks to me like the USA is a has-been. Could this have anything to do with the number of US Treasury Bonds Beijing is even now holding? I shrug, and pack my potato harvest carefully for winter storage :-)<br><br>I keep thinking of that bit of doggerel I learned as a kiddie: "I do not like the human race, I do not like its silly face..."

While there is no clear consensus in international law, what usually happens is that the successor states jointly assume the original state's obligations, under pressure from powerful creditors:<br><br>"Though scarce, there are historical cases of debt division. Armendariz de Aghion and Williamson (1993) review five of these: Great Colombia, the Central American Federation, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Central African Federation. Three debt division rules emerged: population in the first two, fiscal (revenue contribution) in the third and fourth cases, and GDP in the final case. In all five cases the eventual division of the debt was largely determined and enforced by foreign governments, and in many cases the acceptance of these imposed settlements was seen by the new states as necessary for their “consolidation of sovereignty” (Armendariz de Aghion and Williamson 1993, p. 4)." - http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/pub/cpp/March97/Rowland.pdf<br><br>On the plus side, the collapse of the dollar should make most of the debt a moot point.<br><br>Incidentally, Deborah: Tunisia's becoming democratic makes it considerably less likely to ally with Israel, not more; and even if this weren't the case, Tunisia is militarily the least powerful state in North Africa, and located quite a long way away.

This is a prime idea of permaculture, and one about which I know a bit, having studied widely the advice of the appropriate re-pioneers of these ancient ways, whilst at the same time working on the sharp end myself, hands in -- well NO, not IN I suppose, but let's say hovering just above the soil, mostly.<br><br>I have beds here, both raised and deposited directly onto uncultivated turf, which have developed hugely rich, quite deep, and highly fertile and productive soils within a couple of years of the first establishment work, despite the substrate being -- allegedly -- difficult, and genuinely wet and heavy clay.<br><br>I've been following the -- strictly no-till, low-labour -- paths pioneered by such as Ruth Stout, Emilia Hazelip, the now-legendary Fukuoka, and others of that persuasion. <br><br>In the matter of difficult, more extreme weather, the premier agroforestry apostle here in Britain, Martin Crawford (http://www.agroforestry.co.uk/) asserts that his permanent-woodland food/fibre/fuel/medicine/plus operations scarcely seem to notice either droughty or rain-drowning or ice-storm episodes, taking all in their stride.<br><br>I have less direct personal experience of dealing with either extreme desertification, derelict soil, constant wet and chill, or other allegedly impossible weather/soil states. But veteran masters of the art of permaculture have indeed accrued decades' worth of dealing with such more difficult (but emphatically not impossible) conditions, and by following the basic permaculture idea of observing extensively, and going cooperatively with what the local land and weather seem to want to do, and also by adding some of the sheaf of crafty helping tricks which permaculturists have accumulated over time, even these greater challenges seem to be surmountable.<br><br>See MOST PARTICULARLY this short vid by Geoff Lawton (Bill Mollison's successor) about their seemingly-impossible transformation of a salinated, hyper-hot, almost rainless piece of desert in Jordan:<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ8pjOG4pXI<br><br>And tell me then that these same masters of the art couldn't do similar things -- mutatis mutandis -- with the comparable cold, wet, stormy 'impossible' lands further north; near the US/Canadian border, for example...<br><br>Since permaculture is a big idea whose time seems to have come, because of its acute relevance to the new era of the Long Descent, doesn't it seem too pessimistic to say that some areas of the US are unviable without amalgamation with other areas?

This may have been a function of my complete ignorance about military history, strategy, technology, and all related matters.<br><br>However, my vast ignorance does not extend to the domain of American cultural psychology. As a son of Washington, DC who now lives in Canada, I would love to believe that the future you describe -- DC statehood at last! The Canadian dollar miraculously surviving the collapse of the US dollar! -- is plausible. But the truth is that this last installment reads quite differently from the previous four, and frankly, it reeks of fantasy and wish fulfillment. A peaceful dissolution of the Union, sparked by the suggestion of two spunky young constitutional conventioneers... in love! I don't want to be too harsh, but this is bad, sentimental writing, and also bad prophecy.<br><br>Americans have demonstrated time and time again that, in times of crisis, they desperately cling to the breast of Big Brother. Sometimes Big Brother has been a lone demagogue, but for the last 100 years it has almost always been the federal government itself. This is true for Americans across the political spectrum, even those who like to think of themselves as rugged individualists, from the angriest Tea Partier to the most hard-core anti-imperialist leftist. Do you remember the late 90s? This was a time when anti-institutional rhetoric was at a fever pitch, from both left and right. The New World Order black-helicopter militia crowd and the multi-culti leftist anti-imperialist crowd were united in their opposition to the feds. Crash planes into two buildings in New York and 99.9% of those people started screaming and crying for the state to protect them from the Evil Terrorists.<br><br>My point is that all the talk about a cultural divide in America is drastically overblown. The divide is laughably superficial. At the end of the day, all Americans think of themselves as US citizens first, everything else second. Show me a Tea Partier in a "Don't Tread On Me" shirt, or a loudmouth in a cowboy hat and a "Don't Mess With Texas" shirt, or an NPR liberal in a Che Guevara shirt, and I'll show you somebody who cries out for state protection, state violence, and state supervision as soon as the lights start to flicker. "Get your socialist government hands off my Medicare!" was a profound comment, not just because it was hilarious, but because it illustrated so vividly the superficiality and ultimate meaninglessness of the supposedly "anti-government" sentiments being expressed by Americans. The feds are so much a fundamental part of their worldview that they cannot even conceive of a world without the benevolent hand of the federal government shepherding them from cradle to grave. To imagine these people actually trying to unseat the federal government is implausible in the extreme.<br><br>Are there a few Americans who genuinely don't feel this way? Of course. In fact, you probably spend a lot of time with these people, and you no doubt are one of these people yourself. But these people -- the survivalists, the off-the-grid organic farmers, the hard-core urban anarchists -- constitute a minuscule fraction of one percent of Americans.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c2837095167622800896 title="comment permalink">11/3/12, 11:01 AM</a><br><br>

Southern blacks consider the south home as much as southern whites do, they are in no hurry to flee.

The idea in my earlier comment about the news has had an elusive quality to it, and I can almost feel that there is more to it, but then it goes away and is out of reach. Very annoying, but that's life. Oh well.<br><br>You know, I wonder whether the provision of news from an external centralised source is actually a weakness and risk for society? I mean historically people would have had to maintain relationships to exchange news, but now it sort of seems that we are outsourcing it and as such it breeds a disconnect in society about the news and between individuals. One part of it is that people think that news is something that happens to other people and that they are somehow not involved with the ongoing thing that is life?<br><br>Anyway, I really don't have any further insights / thoughts on the matter, but something is bothering me about.<br><br>Oh well.<br><br>Regards.<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c5589481428897827564 title="comment permalink">11/4/12, 3:00 AM</a><br><br>

I am impressed by the regional understanding many readers have demonstrated in terms of the ecological, economic, social and political consequences of dissolution. However, there seems to be little realisation that a breakup is in some sense the easy way out that would leave the nation at square one or more likely even worse than that. All of this talk of regional alliances having to be formed to make certain regions economically and militarily viable is moot if the unity and might of the U.S. is kept intact. I understand that peak oil is inevitable and I understand that the nation has some huge problems that must be solved to keep the nation viable. However, rather than wishing for dissolution or fantasising about how it might lead to some almost utopian future it seems to me that the better option would be getting to work on fixing some of the problems besetting the nation. This is the much harder option in many senses to just dissolving the whole thing but it is the smarter and more fruitful one. <br><br>Why such a great and powerful nation would want to give all of that up and start from scratch creating smaller and vulnerable entities is beyond me, especially when the threats in the world seem to be multiplying. Dissolution would be a gift to various hostile and potentially dangerous nations and factions. Why hand them such a gift? Why leave yourself so exposed? <br><br>I realise that one can argue that dissolution will happen regardless and that the best course of action is to prepare for it. This is understandable but another course of action is to try to solve some of the problems and mitigate some of the predicaments before they fester to the point where the momentum towards dissolution becomes irresistible. <br><br><br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c1892100967691036776 title="comment permalink">11/4/12, 2:42 PM</a><br><br>

A lot of the time and energy we spend just to keep the colossus afloat could ideally be spent elsewhere. We started out as 13 colonies with 2.4 million citizens, now we're 50 states with 311 million people. I don't know what the magic number was, but I do get the distinct sense somewhere along the way we got to the point where our system of representation no longer scaled. It's just a matter of logistics, no handful of evil masterminds with a taste for unearned power are really required. Our government is largely unaccountable to us in no small part because it has to be in order to function, there's no malice required on the part of the myriad functionaries who keep the system running. I'd hazard a guess that it would actually be beyond the scope of a person to know the details of all the laws and regulations that affect them if they committed their entire life to that one single task, much less made some attempt to change them.<br><br>As far as defending ourselves, I don't know, what size population do you need to defend yourself?

Wealth is privilege, and privilege is insulation from reality.<br><br>The top will add escalating insult upon injury to the lower castes, often unaware, until something pops -- an especially nasty riot, a bombing, something that makes the top feel unexpectedly vulnerable. They then protect their interests with excessive force: they always control the military and the police, so they use this power to "crack down" on the "evildoers." Which happens to be everyone not in their own caste. The omelette gets made, and more than a few cases of eggs get broken.<br><br>The repression doesn't sit well, so it starts breeding a culture of sedition directed at those in control. The culture of sedition eventually bleeds into the military/police caste, who work for the top but are not of the top. That's when it gets dangerous.<br><br>What happens next depends on how arrogant the upper classes have become. If they back off, offer concessions, reparations, and amnesties while saving face for themselves, they can de-escalate. Otherwise, things get gnarly.<br><br>Depending on which way the military goes, you get a continuation of the same-old, or you get a coup. Either way, democracy goes out the window and you end up with a repressive military-police state. Repressive because they have no other way to maintain control.<br><br>The problem now is that the military-police state lacks legitimacy. It is in power only because it has power.

Given the present propensity to keep driving right at the brick wall, you have a point.<br><br>It is a bit like asking us to take advertising out of a society based on low unit-cost mass production. Or to remove organised money from politics. The overriding problem though as you rightly discuss is how, despite being, as one commenter here put it, "great and powerful", the Union can survive the loss of vast overseas resources of imported oil et al, at the same time as it must lose much of its overseas military network? <br><br>The USSR needed to change everything all at once and didn’t manage it. Breaking a ‘command economy’ is different from breaking up the commanding chunk of world capitalism, but the effects could be similar and create a discontinuity in US institutional structures. However, it is unclear to me that control of local regional (‘States’) currency, ‘tax &amp; spend’, and/or local control of military assets, or the need to find smaller profit-centres, is such an overwhelming requirement that it is likely to break the USA into fragments. This is not the Eurozone, let alone a re-balkanising Yugoslavia. I could be wrong: depends a bit on the nature of that oncoming ‘brick wall’. Change will happen, and it does rather depend on what the other world ‘actors’ and their fortunes have to say about it. <br><br>Globalization seems to be an inevitable trajectory for commerce linked to industrialization and also seems inevitably competitive and innovative. The old Imperial structures of Europe and Asia (China and Japan) and the sub-continent did not survive; nor did the more contained and self-resourcing USSR.<br> <br>My guess is that globalization, like industrialization and mega-urbanism, has a Phase 3 or 4, etc. to run yet, before the gradual failure of large scale energy sources brings about the inevitable retraction.<br><br>The loss of hegemonic power over competitors by the USA is of course, as you discuss, going to bring about dramatic changes on the home-turf.

My guess is that various rising regional and global powers will bid for some of them. <br><br>Cherokee, it's an interesting idea. I'd encourage you to keep exploring it. <br><br>Raven, funny. Of course the author of the essay doesn't ask how he proposes to see to it that his nonelected leaders are going to be any better than the masses he despises. Historically, of course, they aren't; the value of democracy is that it keeps the ethical level of a nation's leadership from dropping too far below that of the nation as a whole; but those who crave unearned power -- and the whole Nouvelle Droite has a whopping case of that common syndrome -- always duck that issue. <br><br>Yooper, my scenario is not going to happen as written. The same was true of Cayce's. The difference is that I'm aware of this fact!<br><br>CGP, good. My scenario is not a sales pitch for dissolution; it's a discussion of the fact that that's one plausible way for the US to cease to exist as a nation. You're right, too, that it's interesting to see how many people like the idea. <br><br>Phil, no, globalization was a temporary blip caused by a brief interval of very cheap energy. Now that energy costs are becoming a growing fraction of the cost of everything, only a narrowing circle of rich nations can continue to import most of what they consume -- and that circle is going to get steadily smaller in the years to come, as petroleum sunsets out.

It has been more than a century since Americans had to worry about foreign powers interfering in our domestic affairs. We take that security for granted and do not think about how awful life would be without it.<br><br>I do think the United States may be near the upper limit in both physical size and population of a country that can be governed democratically. Perhaps there is no upper limit, since India has about triple the U.S. population and is a parliamentary democracy with robust civil institutions. <br><br>On the other hand, I believe that maintaining just the contiguous forty-eight states as a single democratic nation will require at least enough of an industrial base to support transcontinental railroads and telegraphy. California joined the Union before those things existed, but I don't think the future population of California can be effectively defended from three thousand miles away or will be remitting taxes to the federal government if the fastest communication with the capital is via Pony Express or clipper ships round the Horn.

(It ended I think in tears in WW1.) The late Stephen Bunker (colleague of Alf Hornborg) made a case for the rise of such world trade in the very beginnings of industrialisation, with Portugal and then the Netherlands expanding the outreach for resources, including the very resources, mostly timber and iron, needed to expand the outreach of the necessary shipping. Britain did not gain the decisive competitive edge until well into the 19thC and did not benefit as the new hegemon until British iron/steel and coal made the big break, through probably not confirming full dominance until after 1840; (Bunker, quoting Hobsbawm). Bunker goes on to illustrate the iterative expansion inherent in the combination of industrialisation and globalization using the example of the vast expansion of Japan post-WWII.<br><br>The whole lengthy succession depended on transition from ‘wood &amp; wind’ based technology, via ‘coal &amp; steel’, leading finally to the post-WWII expansion of oil and NG. The last phase arrived on the back of existing world coal production and, by then, modern industrial temperate farming. There is no obvious successor to continue this expansion. I agree that any further expansion is probably limited to some countries and will lead, likely rapidly, to a decline in imports of resources for many countries currently dependent on them. What degree of industrial civilisation is possible without being able to maintain the existing full access to global resources is a moot point. Whether whole relatively prosperous regions could be deprived of sufficient of their key imports to fall off the cliff, and how soon, to me also appears moot. <br><br>I don’t at the moment differ from you very much I think. Approaching a brick wall without brakes does seem a touch fool-hardy for the leading proponent (still) of industrial ‘progress’; i.e. the USA. The ‘successor’ hegemon is likely to follow the same fate if resources are rapidly constrained, even with the US shunted into serious decline. <br><br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c341134330457208729 title="comment permalink">11/5/12, 9:34 AM</a><br><br>

My comment that this is a grand idea to introduce to the cultural narrative was based on my take of what JMG was trying to do with this series. It looked to me like an exercise in ternary thinking. <br><br>Consider the polarity represented by the presidential perspective (both Weed and Gurney were bent on maintaining the US as an imperial nation, regardless of how badly that aim failed to square with reality, which sounds all too plausible) and the insurgent perspective (the governor of Texas basically organized a multi-state insurgency to throw out federal troops, along with the comment by JMG that had Arkansas not moved to amend the constitution there would have been armed insurgencies in several states, and the fact that the last time states wanted out of the union the country was plunged into a horrific war). To me this looks like the myths of progress and apocalypse dressed up in American Civics garb. <br><br>In that context, introducing a peaceful, legal mechanism for breaking up the union is a "third way" of dealing with a particular situation. We can all think up additional scenarios, but I think this idea fit the scenario JMG presented very well. Given the references he made to people's widespread loss of faith in and then animosity toward the federal government, a relatively bloodless breakup is preferable to a successful coup and subsequent crackdown on dissidence led by Gurney or a civil war predicted by the joint chiefs.<br><br>In a broader context, of course the breakup of the union isn't desirable, especially not for so many of us who benefit from the arrangement of cheap energy and the export of violence provided by the imperial power of the federal government. But, given the future sketched here about how it <i>could</i> happen, and given that many of the events portrayed here (the loss of a foreign resource war, the collapse of the dollar and the decline of many major regional economies, widespread impoverishment and homelessness, and many other politically destabilizing things) are pretty likely to happen in some way at some point in my lifetime (I'm 31), I'm happy to have this option introduced to the conversation.<br><br>That said I'm still quite grateful for much of what our flawed, corrupt, constitution-ignoring, power-grabbing, confused, incomprehensible bureaucracy of a federal government does, including funding the research that pays my salary, running Amtrak across the country, and helping to clean up and rebuild after major disasters, just to mention a few.<br><br>In the meanwhile, I'll be spending my government paycheck this month on cellulose and caulk to get the attic in shape for winter, now that the salvaged solar hot water system is plumbed through it.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c3491484421529226901 title="comment permalink">11/5/12, 2:38 PM</a><br><br>

Maybe it's too vulnerable to 'tall poppy syndrome'<br><br>Even the Athenians famously executed Socrates, and exiled Aristides the Just, but twice allowed themselves to fall under the blandishments of the glib rogue and traitor Alcibiades.<br><br>Ethical quality in leaders and followers is not produced or promoted by voting but by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical cultivation. That is not the business of political processes and institutions, but politics can certainly degrade or reduce the level of ethics in populace and politicians.<br><br>Those for whom 'it's the economy, stupid!' will not permit themselves or their leaders to rise above the level of greed. The level seems to fall over time, so it's not surprising that society becomes dominated by the few big thieves at the top and the multitude of almost equally greedy small thieves demanding that the state give them more handouts at the expense of someone else.<br><br>The practical wisdom of the American Founding Fathers suggested that the best available system would be, not a democracy, but 'a Republic, if you can keep it.' Small government and division of powers was supposed to limit opportunities for oppression and corruption and allow jealousies to enable politicians to restrain each other. <br><br>That hasn't worked for a while, and it isn't likely to be restored. It depended upon the independence of the electorate, people who largely worked on their own small farms or businesses and were reluctant to pay most of their income to bureaucrats and politicians to spend for them. When most of the population is 'on the take' either as employees or claimants or administrators of payments from the state or as contractors for state programmes it is too late to change back. Anyone who exceeds the herd level is more likely to be destroyed than followed. (Up on that cross, Jesus!) <br><br>Although the form and rhetoric of 'democracy' may be retained, the reality comes more and more closely to approximate Communism or Oriental Despotism where the only ethical choice is how to most extravagantly adulate the ruler. North Korea may be the not so distant future!<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c3311033519795303328 title="comment permalink">11/6/12, 8:18 AM</a><br><br>

However, I think democracy is only as good as the society in which it is exercised. Education, values, the way the economy is practiced, spiritual cultivation and so many other factors all determine the quality of specific democracies and their outcomes. The way a specific democracy is functioning is one of the best reflections of how healthy or unhealthy a society actually is. I really do think that as a society we get what we deserve in terms of our elected officials and their behaviour. Democracy's flaws are less a reflection of its inherent inadequacies (although of course it has some) and more a reflection of societal inadequacies in my opinion. We should all do our best to respect and nurture democracy.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c1826423140478317795 title="comment permalink">11/6/12, 11:35 PM</a><br><br>

Many rural areas suffer the political domination of distant cities that don't care about their needs and contribute little to their economy. Upstate New York, Downstate Illinois, Eastern Washington and Oregon, California's Central Valley, etc. After the red states secede, many of those regions will try to break away and join them.<br><br>In my scenario, Texas secedes first, followed by most of the red states. They form the Rattlesnake Confederacy, fly the Gadsden flag (usually <i>below</i> the state flag), and thanks to the Internet, decide they don't need a capital city. With Fort Knox and most of the military on their side, the Rattlers negotiate with the rump USA (still flying the 57-star flag) to divvy up national debts and assets. Years later, in a dispute over oil revenues, Alberta secedes from Canada and joins the Confederacy.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c9184743088465158921 title="comment permalink">11/8/12, 3:40 PM</a><br><br>

I'm just not persuaded that things would fall apart quite as quickly and peacefully as you depict. I think the citizens of the USSR had long been relieved of their illusions of national invincibility before the collapse in 1991. I don't think that's true in the US, even among those who pay lip service to "small government" etc. These people still think that the US is the greatest nation in the world, they still support massive military interventions, etc. Look at the polling numbers on Iran, here:<br><br>http://www.pollingreport.com/iran.htm<br><br>Doesn't look to me like "ordinary Americans" have any interest in dismantling their empire any time soon.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-five.html#c7614669363903400 title="comment permalink">11/9/12, 9:20 AM</a><br><br>

Two miles from our little enclave of Canyon Crest (home to UC, Riverside Professors and students)I have my pick of barrios with the corner market with Spanish only signage packed with Mexican products. Over half of the radio stations are Spanish language, the schools are predominantly Hispanic.
