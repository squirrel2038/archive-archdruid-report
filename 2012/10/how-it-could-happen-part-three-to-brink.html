This week's post is the third of five parts of a fictional narrative tracing out a scenario of American imperial defeat and collapse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the war in Kenya reaches a climax, the action shifts to the United States—and to a president who has his back to the wall and very few options left. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
*********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Back in the United States, few people had any clear sense of how bad the situation had become. The major news media, as they had done for decades, accepted whatever came from the White House and the Pentagon at face value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Internet news sites contradicted the official story in every detail, but the internet’s low signal to noise ratio made an accurate picture hard to assemble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, cracks were spreading in the wall of denial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The photo of the USS George Washington wrecked and abandoned on a Kenyan sandbar was an internet sensation; two members of the House of Representatives had called for hearings on the war, though their request was stonewalled by the House leadership; through the sullen air of late summer, a sense was beginning to spread that something had gone very wrong. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the White House, President Weed did not need to guess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Reports from the US forces in Kenya came in daily via the diplomatic line; when Nairobi fell, after a bitter three-day battle near Konza, a new line was jerry-rigged from Kisumu in the far west of the country. Most of the news was bad. The Chinese had brought in more planes, as well as air-defense systems that were making B-52 raids from Diego Garcia risky—two of the bombers had been shot down by surface-to-air missiles already.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Meanwhile, there was no way to get supplies in to the American forces and their Kenyan allies; another fleet could not be sent as long as Chinese cruise missiles might be waiting for them, and the loss of air superiority made airlifts equally problematic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We tried to get Predator drones in to hit their air defense radar, but they were spotted and taken out,” the DCI—Director of Central Intelligence, the head of the CIA—was saying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>“Chinese technology is, well, as good as ours these days.” What he was not saying, Weed knew, was that Chinese technology was better than its US equivalents these days, and half a dozen other countries had the same advantage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The reason wasn’t a mystery, either; most of the officials in the room, starting with Weed himself, had taken donations now and then in exchange for promoting or approving programs that were far more profitable to their manufacturers than they were useful to the US military. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The Chinese this, the Chinese that,” said the president’s national security adviser. “We’ve talked about them every single day since this started. We need to do something about them.” The vice president, sitting next to her, nodded, and President Weed tilted his head toward her, listening. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All at once, the Secretary of Defense decided that he’d had enough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He slammed his folder of briefings down on the table, pushed his chair back, and stood up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“You’re crazy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I mean that in all seriousness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since day one you’ve acted as though nothing could go wrong, and when it does, all you can think of is doubling down.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He turned to the president.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Jim, you’ll have my written resignation tomorrow.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Bill,” said Weed, “for God’s sake, not now!” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Personal reasons,” said the Secretary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Health concerns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ll give you all the plausible deniability you want, but I’m through.” The door slammed behind him a moment afterward.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>*</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Marines on perimeter guard spotted the messengers first, walking up the main road from Kitale under a white flag.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Word came by radio a few minutes later to GHQ in the town of Endebess further west, under the slopes of soaring Mount Elgon. The reply came back at once:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>get a technical and bring them in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Marines had a few of the pickups left, though fuel was scarce, like ammo, food, everything else; they managed to scrounge enough gasoline for the trip, and sent the messengers on their way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The technical skidded to a stop in front of a commandeered primary school not long thereafter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Lieutenant General Jay Seversky, the American commander, greeted the messengers glumly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
After introductions, the Tanzanian colonel who led the group said, “I think you know why I am here, General. You and your men have fought very well, but—” He shrugged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“There is only so much a man can do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Coalition command has ordered a final assault on your positions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I will not say when, but soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Maybe you will survive that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Maybe you will survive the next one, too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But—” Another shrug.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“The matter is settled; it is merely a question of how many more lives are lost.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Seversky nodded, once.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>“I assume you’ve got terms to suggest.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Of course.” The colonel pulled an envelope from inside his jacket and handed it to him. Seversky opened it, glanced over the sheet of paper, and nodded again. “I’ll need time to consult with my staff.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Of course,” the colonel said again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Twenty-four hours?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I think we can allow that much.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When the men had gone, Seversky took the sheet of paper back inside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The remaining officers of his staff and the commanders of the four divisions were waiting. He handed the paper to the nearest, waited until it had circled the table.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Anything from Washington?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>This from Tom Blumenthal, the commander of the 101st Airborne. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Seversky snorted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>“They’re, quote, evaluating options for a relief force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unquote.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Meaning the bastards can’t do a thing,” said Blumenthal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nobody argued with him.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For a long moment nobody in the room said anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They were looking at Blumenthal, and after another moment, Seversky figured out why.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The 101st Airborne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Battle of the Bulge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Nuts.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Blumenthal cleared his throat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“If I thought it would gain anything,” he said, “I’d say fight to the last man. But—” His gaze dropped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“This isn’t Bastogne and Patton’s not on the way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I think we have to face the fact that we’ve had our clock cleaned.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Word of the American force’s surrender reached the White House half an hour before the story broke in the international media.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was a Tuesday morning in September, with the first hint of autumn in the air.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Weed stared out the windows of the Oval Office, wishing he could take that September fishing trip he’d planned months ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No chance of that, not now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Grimly, he turned to his press secretary and told him to have the news media ready for an important press conference at 6 that evening. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Before then, he would have even worse news to face. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">

<div class=MsoNormal>
At 2 in the morning local time, Chinese special forces personnel left a submarine in the middle of the Indian Ocean and climbed aboard radar-evading inflatable boats. An hour later, they crawled up a poorly guarded beach near the southern tip of Diego Garcia and found hiding places in the thick jungle just inland. Silenced weapons and explosive charges were passed from hand to hand as the four strike teams prepared for their missions. The first explosions hit without warning; by the time the garrison realized what was happening, the heavily guarded island’s radar stations and air defenses were already disabled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ten minutes later a dark winged shape—the first of a dozen stealth-equipped troop transports packed with Peoples Liberation Army soldiers—came hurtling out of the night to touch down on the captured main runway. By dawn, the entire island was in Chinese hands. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As details trickled into the White House situation room, what kept circling through Weed’s mind was sheer disbelief.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Diego Garcia was the beating heart of the entire US Indian Ocean presence, a key logistics and intelligence center and a base from which B-52s could pound trouble spots from Africa to Southeast Asia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Losing Tanzania was a problem; losing Kenya was a crisis; losing Diego Garcia...<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He shook his head, tried to think.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sir?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>An aide had come in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“The press conference.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yes. Yes, of course.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>He drew in a deep breath and went to the door. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was by all accounts one of the best speeches of Jameson Weed’s political career.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Extempore—he had drawn up a draft before the news came about Diego Garcia, but it was sitting on a desk in the Oval Office as he walked up to the podium—he sketched out the situation, explained what had happened in Kenya, denounced China’s behavior in thundering terms, and broke the news of the fall of Diego Garcia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Let the Peoples Republic of China make no mistake,” he said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“The United States will not let this unprovoked aggression stand. We will respond with all the forces at our disposal. Nothing is off the table.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He leaned forward, haggard and minatory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Nothing.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Half an hour later, the American embassy in Beijing filled in the details for the Chinese government’s benefit:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>unless China withdrew its forces from East Africa and Diego Garcia, the United States would respond with tactical nuclear strikes. The Chinese response was swift and public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Speaking to a crowd of reporters, the Chinese premier informed the world tartly that China would never bow to threats, and that any attack on Chinese territory or military forces would receive a corresponding response. As he spoke, Chinese diplomats were making it clear to their American opposite numbers that “corresponding response” in this case meant Chinese ICBMs heading for American cities. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Later that evening, the president of Russia appeared on television screens around the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>With Slavic bluntness, he brushed aside the evasions the other leaders had used in public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“The Russian Federation has been informed,” he told the world, “that the United States has threatened China with nuclear attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Such threats are impermissible in today’s world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is therefore my duty to state that treaties between the Russian Federation and the Peoples Republic of China require us, if China is attacked with nuclear weapons, to respond with our own nuclear arsenal.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
No one who lived through the three days that followed would ever forget them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Seven billion people who had come to think of mushroom clouds as a bad memory of the Cold War suddenly had to face the imminent prospect of nuclear war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Defiant words from Washington, proud rebuttals from Beijing, and frantic diplomacy by the United Nations punctuated the panic that gripped the globe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The words of the Emperor of Japan, broadcast live to a worldwide audience—“Japan alone among nations has suffered attack by nuclear weapons, and it is Our deepest wish that no other nation should share that same bitter fate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We ask—no, We plead—that the leaders of the contending powers step back from so terrible an abyss”—spoke for billions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Meanwhile, in missile silos, bomber bases, and submarines, young men and women waited for orders that, for all practical purposes, would mean the end of the world.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the United States, civil defense plans dating back to the Eisenhower administration were dusted off and activated. One of them mandated that the National Defense Highway System—better known as the nation’s freeways—be closed to civilian traffic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>There were good practical reasons for that step, but nobody had thought about what would happen when millions of Americans tried to flee urban targets and found the freeways barricaded. On the first day of the crisis, most people were too stunned to do anything but follow the instructions that filled the media—stay put, seek cover, you are safer at home than out in the countryside—but the following night brought second thoughts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The next morning, people in large cities all over America tried to get out. Surface streets quickly filled up, turning into bumper-to-bumper jams that in one case stretched for forty miles. Inevitably, those who found that route closed turned again to the freeways, where police, National Guard units and Homeland Security troops in black riot armor manned the barricades.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The flashpoint arrived toward sunset in Trenton, New Jersey, where a terrified mob, convinced that the missiles were already on the way, tried to rush the barricades on the John Fitch Parkway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Someone in the crowd had a handgun; shots rang out; an inexperienced Homeland Security officer panicked, and ordered his troops to open fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the time the shooting stopped, thirty-seven civilians were dead and more than a hundred wounded. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The government scrambled to keep word of the Trenton Massacre, as it came to be called, from getting out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>News media had already been put under wartime censorship, and social media online were pressured into deleting references to the shootings as they appeared, but email and telephones were harder to stop. Worse, the lack of accurate information fed terrifying rumors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As Americans huddled in makeshift bomb shelters across the country, it was all too easy to believe that a government willing to plunge the world into nuclear war might be capable of anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the process, for a very large number of Americans, the United States stopped being “us” and turned into “them.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That would have immense results in the near future, but there were also more immediate consequences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In Austin that night, after a flurry of calls from worried constituents, the governor of Texas pulled rank on the phone company, got a line through to a business friend of his in Trenton, and obtained a good account of what had happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The governor could all too easily imagine what would happen if such an incident happened in proud, gun-loving Texas, and his next call was to Homeland Security. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The official cut him off halfway through a sentence with a brisk we-have-our-orders brushoff, and the conversation went downhill from there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally the governor slammed down the phone with a roar of polymorphous profanity that left his assistants awed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He flung himself up from the desk and paced around the room—a danger sign everyone in the state government knew and feared—and then returned to the phone, calling the old Army buddy of his who was the commander of the Texas National Guard, and the close political ally of his who was the head of the Texas Rangers. Both had been put under Homeland Security authority by executive order for the duration of the crisis, but a clash between Washington orders and Texas loyalties could have only one result.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then the governor called Homeland Security back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“You listen to me, sumbitch,” he said, stabbing the air with a finger the size of a sausage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“You’re out of a job in this state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Texas National Guard and the Texas Rangers will be handling public safety in this state, under my command.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You can’t do that,” the official spluttered.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Try me.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Another jab with the finger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Get your thugs out of my state in twenty-four hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You hear me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Twenty-four hours.” He slammed down the phone, hard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Minutes later, on a new phone, he was calling drinking buddies of his who happened also to be the governors of half a dozen Southern states. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Across the nation, as the third day of the nuclear crisis began and the news of the Trenton Massacre spread, the same pattern played out on many different scales, and the federal government began to lose control of its security forces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Police officers in some places refused to man the barricades or pulled them open and waved people through. National Guardsmen in some cities stayed in their barracks or simply joined the crowds, taking their guns with them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Texas was openly defying the national government—the Homeland Security director there, after frantic calls to Washington, fled to Denver—and four other states were on the brink of joining in. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It may have been this hard reality, added to the other pressures he faced, that convinced Jameson Weed to take the only way out of the crisis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That night, just before midnight, he met with the secretary general of the United Nations and agreed to a ceasefire. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
****************</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: large">End of the World of the Week #44</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
While we’re on the subject of ice, could we please talk honestly about the great global cooling scare of the late 1970s?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yes, it happened; books such as Nigel Calder’s <i>The Weather Machine</i>, which publicized the threat of an imminent ice age, can still be found in used book stores and those libraries—increasingly rare these days—that hang onto books old enough to contradict today’s conventional wisdom; those of my readers who have the chance to visit the Smithsonian Natural History Museum may yet have the chance to see a display announcing that a new ice age is on the way, with an embarrassed note taped next to it stating that this no longer reflects current science. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What happened was this: a number of climate scientists noted that global temperatures had declined somewhat between the 1940s and the 1970s, that it had been about 11,000 years since the end of the last ice age, and that the intervals between ice ages average around 11,000 years. They hypothesized, on this basis, that the world might be about to begin the descent into the next round of glaciation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That hypothesis—quite a reasonable one, given the data available at the time—got picked up by the media and assorted science writers, and turned into something much more definite than a hypothesis. Before long, <i>Time</i> and
<i>Newsweek</i> were announcing that catastrophic global cooling could begin within a decade, and science fiction novelists started setting stories on future Earths mantled in snow—Poul Anderson’s <i>The Winter of the World</i> was a favorite of mine, and indeed still is. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All that was needed to turn this into a good solid apocalyptic scare was a theoretical mechanism to allow an ice age to begin in less than a thousand years or so, and Nigel Calder provided it with his “snowblitz” theory—a proposal that heavy snowfall across the northern temperate zone could produce a feedback loop by reflecting too much solar heat back into space, cooling the planet drastically. Before long, large areas of Canada and Russia would be under permanent snow, with plunging temperatures worldwide adding to the fun. The math didn’t really work that well, but it made for great prophecy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For a few years in the early 1980s, some people waited breathlessly for each year’s report on the planet’s annual temperature, expecting steep declines. Instead, the modest declines that had been ongoing since the 1940s turned around, and the planet began warming up instead. </div>

I wonder at your last sentence though... If you had left it out, you'd have an amazing cliffhanger - what's the 'only way out' J.Weed has left? Is he going to commit suicide (technically, that is a way out of every predicament, so if you have only one way out that should be it, although it would be against character in this case)? Abdication? Ceasefire? Just go ahead and damn the torpedoes?<br>I kind of enjoy being, so to speak, cliffhung. So your last sentence, which had the president clambering out of the moral abyss he was dangling over, more or less had me going 'Whew' and 'Awww' at the same time.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-three-to-brink.html#c1630767963079943136 title="comment permalink">10/17/12, 8:48 PM</a><br><br>

A rising power would not miss an opportunity like this to take advantage of an adversary's fall, especially not one as careful as China with such a long memory. <br><br>The political implosion of the US is pretty clear in this picture: longstanding resentment of DC is a cultural phenomenon across most of the country, especially in the south and west.

The scenario needed a sudden shock to push Weed to the point of threatening nuclear attack; Diego Garcia was simply the one that fit the strategic situation best -- in today's world, China's already establishing naval bases in Myanmar and Sri Lanka to give it force projection capacity in the Indian Ocean, and Diego Garcia would be a prize worth having as well as a masterstroke against American interests. As for the insulation and the leaves, make that happen!<br><br>John, looking at the last ten million years or so of climate history, it's quite possible that you're right -- climatologists of the far future, distantly descended from raccoons, will note the sudden heat spike that happened before the next round of glaciation, and scratch their heads, wondering what caused it. <br><br>Tim, thank you! I'm tempted to do a sequel talking about the historical examples I used as models for the scenario; it'd be serious history geekship, but then I'm a fairly serious history geek.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-three-to-brink.html#c7766578994700441501 title="comment permalink">10/17/12, 9:30 PM</a><br><br>

I think the problem is the next-to-last sentence: you imply an inevitability to this decision.<br><br>I don't think it's inevitable at all, or (for that matter) even all that likely. That's why your next-to-last sentence rings false.<br><br>I was recently skimming comments by Chomsky about the Cuban Missile Crisis, and he managed to convey a sense of how very close we came to mutual incineration, largely due to an ingrained culture of the Divine Right of US hegemony in the world. We see no shortage of this arrogance in the current US government, and it is my general observation that people become more rigid (rather than more flexible) as you put their core unexamined assumptions under challenge. <br><br>It's absolutely fine that Weed backs down in the end, for the purposes of storytelling -- that's entirely plausible. What isn't plausible is the omniscient third-person commentary claiming this was "the only way out of the crisis."<br><br>My two cents.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-three-to-brink.html#c6195404372255052922 title="comment permalink">10/17/12, 10:31 PM</a><br><br>

Sort of Tom Clancyish, but much better, because of the realworld realism.<br><br>I notice a somewhat uncomfortable fact about my own response to your story, though, which may upset you and other USAmerican readers a little; it's this: <br><br>A lot of the satisfaction that the story gives comes -- for me -- from seeing the US empire begin to get its comeuppance, and all the overwheening arrogance of its protagonists -- the massed Clancys as you might call them -- having to confront a realworld nemesis which they never imagined to be possible. Oh naughty schadenfreude!<br><br>I suppose you tend to feel like that when all your lifetime, and longer, your own people have lived under the oppression of someone else's empire. Doubly so for such as me, with my patrial nations, Cymru and Eire, having been subsumed under Anglo-Norman imperialism for the better part of a thousand years (though 'Yma o hyd!' -- We're still here! -- as Dafydd Iwan famously sings*); and now included also into the province of the US empire which England and its rump-empirette have now become. Briefly...<br><br>It will be seriously interesting to watch the knock-on effects of Scotland's progress towards sovereign independence after the referendum in 2014 -- the seven-hundredth anniversary of Bannockburn -- on Cymru, on the foreign-occupied six counties of north-eastern Eire, and even -- in my fond dreams -- on Kernow; a little submerged Celtic country where I lived briefly as a child. (The white-cross-on-a-black-ground flag of Kernow flies constantly over Redruth town-hall these days; the union flag doesn't :-))<br><br>All of these become interesting live issues again, real possibilities taken out of the deep-freeze and thawing right now even if small, parochial and far away from your viewpoint, as the US empire begins its final death plunge, and its outlier provinces such as the wretched fake-democratic uk-state -- and apartheid zioIsrael too, of course -- are left totally without overlord support, like Wile E Coyote, feet spinning frantically in thin air over the void.<br><br>Interesting Times...<br><br>* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WooUv0QttKs<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-three-to-brink.html#c1836276232742994449 title="comment permalink">10/18/12, 12:53 AM</a><br><br>

But how certain can we be that this will indeed be the case in real life as industrial civilization falls apart? <br><br>You have been an outspoken defender of the slow protracted collapse view, and if there is indeed nothing qualitatively different about a global industrial civilization compared to all other civilizations who have walked the overshoot and collapse path in history, it is true that this is the more likely course of events. <br><br>But there is a qualitative difference and it is the nukes. There are two possibilities for their fate - they either get used eventually or they are dismantled and/or left to rot as the technical expertise on how to manufacture and maintain them is gradually lost. A lot of things will have to happen right so that not a single nuclear weapon is fired between now and the moment nobody has the ability to fire one any more. In your scenario, the war is averted because the people in power behave at least somewhat rationally. But what if the president is not someone named Jameson Weed, who would rather go fishing than have to navigate such situations, but a Michelle Bachman-like figure and there is no official threat sent to the Chinese but a direct strike instead (after all it's not as if the Chinese officially declared war either)?

The Chinese shouldn't be able to resupply much of anything in an open war, the US should be able to interdict on the high seas. But the same goes for the Chinese, they can threaten any vessel nearing the theater. This would make for a weird tactical situation but with the advantage to the Chinese of having prepositionsd critical supplies and fighting defense for a population that wants them there, relying on local ties and resupply, beans if not bullets. While both sides are in a rough spot with few resources, the US has it worse. <br><br>I also really want to see the calculation made in the highest levels of the Chinese political structure. This whole affair is one hell of a gamble and I keep coming back to the Japanese misread in the pacific. The Japanese were a local power who wanted to become a regional power, displace the old colonialists and become the new masters. They had a pretty good read on the commonwealth powers and at that could have forced the Brits out. They misread the abilities and will of the US. They also could not create a situation where we were forced to accept that we would lose more by fighting than surrendering. The Japanese national myth could not accept that foreigners had fighting spirit like the Japanese or the stomach to do what was necessary to hold on to empire.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-three-to-brink.html#c1214560460283548756 title="comment permalink">10/18/12, 4:22 AM</a><br><br>

When I lived in a small Oregon town 14 miles north of the California border, people were very standoffish until they found out I'd moved there from Washington state, not from California. The Californian expat community there had a massive and, I'm sorry to say, well-earned reputation for arrogance and smug sanctimoniousness.

For reasons I'll discuss in detail in a future post, I don't think nuclear war on the large scale is likely except by sheer dumb accident. As I mentioned in response to an earlier post, though, there's no need to presuppose sane people in charge of nuclear weapons; Stalin and Mao were homicidal megalomaniacs in possession of nuclear weapons, and you notice that they didn't blow up the world.

Still, this is all just the old geopolitics geek in me asking too many questions. For the purposes of the story, the how and why of an American military defeat really doesn't matter because we are looking at the aftermath on the American political structure.

We will make tactical strikes in the theater. Or what about a conventional cruise missile strike against the Three Gorges Dam? That could wreck their economy and kill millions. This is a nation with its back against the wall resorting to terrorism but calling it foreign policy. <br><br>Ugh. There's just too much to this scenario to be satisfied with a thumbnail treatment! Even if the military disaster were left out completely and the story consisted solely of a pov slice of life of a family that doesn't follow the news living through the end of belief in the American dream, a great constitutional crisis, only the briefest news clips of what had happened leaving the reader to infer almost everything, that would still be a big story.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-three-to-brink.html#c8031822938301381430 title="comment permalink">10/18/12, 4:35 AM</a><br><br>

Long odds but you can sell the story if its written well enough. Al Capone becomes president? Not very likely. Openly gay man becomes president? Wow that would be really hard to write convincingly. Openly atheist anyone becomes president? Even less believable.

Seriously, you have a best-seller here if you wanted to invest the effort into it. The time is right. You could do a bit of good with what that would bring, no doubt. Hang on to the movie rights.<br><br>For what it is worth, my long-standing observation (~40 years) is that the US is delusional in thinking it is a military (i.e. martial) power. That Americans are a martial people. Before anyone gets hot under the collar and all indignant and quoting this battle or that war at me, I'm not saying Americans aren't tough or aren't fighters. Sure they are - more than some . . . but not as much as some others. But as a people they have never had - and never had to develop - the qualities that define a people as "martial". Like the Romans, as a for instance.<br><br>The qualities that built their empire were indomitability, steadfastness in adversity and boldness. Now they were a martial people.<br><br>I say this as someone with military experience in an army small enough that it cannot afford the profligacy of granting subalterns the authority to call in a million dollar airstrike, but where it was actually expected that you have to think and fight your way out of tough spots. An army that has operated at close quarters with the US military over many, many decades and as a result has accrued a corporate wisdom that recognises that when the Americans are your allies you are much better off keeping your distance from them and engaging the enemy on your own terms. It is safer that way. No matter what your own politicians might say.<br><br>America's power is based on wealth. America's prodigious economic power has been projected as firepower at times, but firepower does not - of itself - represent military prowess. Much as many Americans would like to believe otherwise, they did not "win" WW2. The USSR won the contest on the ground by breaking the back of the Wehrmacht, with heartbreaking sacrifice and vast quantities of US supplied materiel. Japan was never an existential threat to the US, though they worked wonders militarily with many disadvantages. America became the global hegemon because they were the only major power not significantly damaged by the war.<br><br>Circumstances have been such that it has been possible to spin a national myth of warrior-heroes that in a time of decline can only serve to create the hazard that believing your own b.s. always does. That arrogance and misplaced pride always have. Of a very hard fall.<br><br>For outsiders with some knowledge of the US military, they have never deserved respect. US soldiers have been observed to be over-specialised in training, over-indulged and lacking in the basic skills of soldiering. US senior ranks are corrupt and thoroughly politicised.<br><br>(For an American insider's similar conclusions see David Hackworth's "About Face".)<br><br>Hitler's prophecy that Russia was a rotten structure that would collapse when the door was kicked in may prove to be much more true of the US. American wealth has cultivated softness. Dangerous when you like picking fights.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-three-to-brink.html#c7867365038024529790 title="comment permalink">10/18/12, 5:11 AM</a><br><br>

And I remember the national conventional wisdom (because it wasn't just Clinton) at the time was, "Oh, that's nice" (chuckle). Somebody somewhere in the bureacracy knew he had the capacity to do it. Clinton could have been the one to steal Obama's moment of self-congratulation and nail Osama. (Either Bush could have done it too.) But I think he really thought we were invincible.

If the answer to "But what if he doesn't go along with it" is "Let's hope he does," that's not any plan I want any part in. <br><br>All that being said, there's always the gap between theory and reality. The war college professor will tell you why you should never ever invade Russia in the winter, get involved in a land war in Asia or go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line. And then the reality of the situation is you're forced to do something against your better judgment. <br><br>Come to think of it, in the doorstop treatment your admiral would probably be having exactly those thoughts as he's sailing up to the coastline, making a mental checklist of his known-knowns, known-unknowns, unknown-unknowns, and exactly how exposed and vulnerable his battle-group is. And when the you-know-what hits the you-know-what, he'll have a name for the scenario he's getting hit with. "Ah, so it looks like War Plan Yellow, Scenario 4. Ran that one and won it. Of course, I was playing as OPFOR then. Crap." Five minutes later he's one of the casualties. What we got of him in the thumbnail sketch was, by necessity, sketchy. <br><br>Someone going into a situation against his better judgment because of the mistakes of superiors he's unable to question, that feels real.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-three-to-brink.html#c7471110783928578687 title="comment permalink">10/18/12, 8:12 AM</a><br><br>

And the edges between regions seem more sharply visible to me lately. For instance, while camping in New Hampshire on the shore of Lake Champlain this summer, I heard an educated man expound on how important the battle of Plattsburgh was during the War of 1812, because otherwise New England would have become part of Canada. My internal reaction as a native Georgian and current Floridian was that it woundn't make the slightest difference in my life if suddenly I was transported to an alternate universe where New England was the 11th Canadian province. <br><br>More darkly, I stumbled upon an anti-Southerner diary on a well-known liberal website, and I was a bit taken aback by the hatred towards white Southerners which many of the site users exhibited. These same users showed no cognitive dissonance when they wondered aloud why Southerners don't vote their way, apparently oblivious to the fact that it's against human nature to make political allies with those who hate you. Many would be glad to kick the South out of the Union, expressing no concern about the fact that such a move would instantly create a neighbor with a powerful military, indigenous oil production and refining capacity, control of the Mississippi River outlet, etc. <br><br>Then I was in the bookstore and saw Colin Woodward's "American Nations," which openly discussed the US being an empire in decline and subject to breakup - it surprised me to see this in a mainstream publication.<br><br>It made me wonder about how an independent South might be governed - would the crazies be in charge? Would we see an exodus of intellectuals, bright young people, and minorities, the decline of our universities and creative classes, rule of the countryside over the cities? Or would pragmatists put an end to the political grandstanding to the far right, and fashion a reasonably tolerant and inclusive society? Would Southern women rise up to preserve their rights, the same way Southern blacks have organized to become an effective political force?<br><br>Thanks for the thought-stimulating writing!<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-three-to-brink.html#c2408248028195757910 title="comment permalink">10/18/12, 9:13 AM</a><br><br>

Of course it doesn't, but try telling that to the true believers in their own sense of entitlement who dominate American culture these days. <br><br>Ian, the nation-state in its modern form is not long for this world, but then it's a fairly new thing; the older model of nation-state might be more resilient, but we'll see. <br><br>Sue, today's nuclear weapons are less powerful than the ones you grew up with -- as the technology has developed and missiles have become more accurate, the bomb geeks have moved away from extra megatonnage.

As for cutting off the Appalachians from the rest of the world, no question there -- if folks here decided to do that, it would be a piece of cake: a few blasts to bring hillsides down on freeways and rail lines, a few more to vaporize bridges in awkward places, and you're good. <br><br>Reaper, if the doorstop version ever happens, Admiral Deckmann's POV is going to be central to the early part of it. <br><br>Hal, as I see it, Russia has much more to gain by backing China and humiliating the US than by letting China get boxed into a corner where nukes might end up flying. An American president might gamble on a first strike against the Chinese nuclear arsenal in the hope of taking it out all at once; nobody's going to try that on Russia's nuclear force, because it's so big and dispersed that even a really effective counterforce strike will leave Russia with enough to bring the history of the United States to a sudden and incandescent end. <br><br>I'll consider a contest for end of empire scenarios, though I won't have the spare time to do an anthology this time around.

Yes, it's upping the ante considerably for them to do so, but they have important reasons for the move -- tactically, it hampers any further US military action against China's East African client states; strategically, the Indian Ocean is crucial to China's own imperial ambitions, so seizing Diego Garcia gives them the same kind of advantage the US previously had there. <br><br>As for Diego Garcia's defenses, those are no highly classified; my guess, and it's only a guess, is that there are holes, and that a sufficiently clever and well-informed enemy could find and exploit them. The specific trick used by the Chinese in the narrative was inspired by the German seizure of the supposedly invincible Fort Eben-Emael in Belgium in 1940: in that case it was a small force of glider troops landing right on top of the fort, where nobody thought to put defenses, and using shaped charges to cripple the fort.

No empire has ever been short of collaborators from the conquered nations, willing to throw in their lot with the imperial thugs, and change their spots to suit. <br><br>The DicSionDafyddau swarmed to London after Henri Tewdwr's victory at Bosworth field. The native cockneys would complain hyperbolically at their incessant chattering in Yr Hen Iaith, though in fact chances are that the old British language had never actually disappeared entirely from LLoegr: take a look at the number of places in Domesday Book called Walton, Compton, Comberton, and such (= Welsh Village), even in places like Essex and Walton-on-Thames...<br><br>But come on Phil: TBH, who can pretend that the English empire has ever had anything but its essentially English character, despite the steady trickling in of such as Dafydd LLoyd-George, Gordon Brown, and all the rest the collaborationist politicians from all the Celtic nations. And now, of course the leader of the current unmandated, power-usurping, US-compliant junta in Westminster, the thoroughly anglicised David Cameron. <br><br>And then add on all the deluded young Celtic men -- and women enough too -- who've volunteered, or been dragooned, to fight in England's imperial wars.<br><br>But despite all this -- and you're right, it's been a steady influx from the first -- the English empire has always been controlled from London, and has been hatched and masterminded from the first by Anglo-Norman uchelwyr; and characterised in its world-known manners by the English raj of the Home Counties (for English [sic!]speakers in other parts of the world, thats the counties immediately surrounding London, where the English imperial ruling 'elite' have usually based themselves in large numbers, and their most loyal henchpeople too.)<br><br>Go to Gwynedd, in Cymru Gogledd, and speak of Dafydd LLoyd George there, where he was born, and in a considerable percentage of cases, your interlocutors will murmur, at some point in the conversation: "Bradwr...." As would Michael Collins and friends after the Easter Rising in Eire, too, though probably they'd use the Gaelige equivalent there: "Brathadoir"; those of them who still happened to know their own language...<br><br>Despite all the collaborators, the empire was -- and in its uk-state remnant still is -- essentially an English racket. You won't hear any Cymraeg, Broad-Scots or Gaelige spoken in the private Board-Room meetings of the ponzi-gangsters in the City of London. All those scams are operated in the upper-crust accents of the English 'aristocracy'; chap-speak, exclusively; and I do mean exclusive. For contemporary English imperialists (the last generation of them, I do hope!), the City is the last gasp of their world-looting imperialism; that and the current English military; both very much US-compliant and US-serving, note. <br><br>You have to be as much of a several-generation assimilated English chap as David Cameron is, before you can even get to be one of their leading political servants.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-three-to-brink.html#c5054229900077986907 title="comment permalink">10/19/12, 4:06 AM</a><br><br>

Not to really question the validity of the scenario, but just that there are so many big complications that there is no way of knowing how this thing would land (though probably not butter-side-up for someone).<br><br>Wouldn't the overt invasion of Diego Garcia bring NATO into the mix? I know all sides would be honoring treaties as convenient, but it seems to me that NATO's alliance with the US is at least as strong as Russia and China. Anyway, there are at least two more nuclear powers dragged in.<br><br>How would India take all of this? A rising economic tiger with a very uneasy relationship with China. Possible gain with, as you point out, the big energy consumer taken out. But I think they perceive themselves as having a lot more to lose with China rampant in the region than the US, which, besides being the devil they already know, speaks their language and has a pretty high amount of economic connectivity (or maybe I'm making too much of call centers). There's another nuclear power.<br><br>Pakistan? Nominally a US ally, but not a very happy one at the present. Could go either way, but more nukes in the mix. Or maybe they see an opportunity to take on India?<br><br>Gulf Arab nations? Iran's gain is their pain, and the US' pain is Iran's gain. No, they don't love us as is, and who knows who will be in charge of SA, Yemen, UAE, Iraq, etc., by the time this plays out. But China and Europe get a lot of their fuel from them. Just adds a lot of complications. The US has a lot of bases in those countries, and could do a pretty good job of putting a strangle on the flow.<br><br>Then, of course, you have Israel. Fair bet for the current home of a lot of those missing nukes. The loss of their biggest ally would be an existential threat. They could probably pretty quickly take out a lot of production and refining capacity in the region.<br><br>Yeah, this could be a mess.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-three-to-brink.html#c7134431543301771810 title="comment permalink">10/19/12, 11:15 AM</a><br><br>

This is the best I can do at the moment.<br><br>"We see WW I as a global war. After the war, a curious thing happened. The United States was clearly the strongest nation in the world after WW I and did decisively defeat Germany. The U.S. certainly had the resources to establish naval dominance after the war, but did not. The U.S. certainly could have joined the League of Nations and when Hitler invaded the Rhineland drive him out (with French and British help) just as Saddam Hussein was driven out of Kuwait. Instead, the Americans turned inward and retreated behind her flanking oceans desiring a "Return to Normalcy". The result was a postwar "world power" phase with nobody filling the role of world leader. As a result, Hitler's ambitions were unchecked and World War I was replayed as World War II, with virtually the same actors. This time, the U.S. did behave as a world leader afterward.<br><br>We call this failure of national will the World War anomaly because it happened after the first world war and led to the second. The anomalous position of World War II with respect to the Kondratiev cycle (it occurred at a trough rather than a peak like all the other war cycle peaks) is a direct result of this anomaly. Another consequence of this anomaly is the overlap of naval and army peaks by the world leader and future challenger right after World War II. In previous cycles, the naval power peak (which defines the world power phase) precedes the army power peak (which helps delineate the delegitimation phase).<br><br>This replay of global war did not affect the timing of the cycle, however. Toynbee, Dehio, Modelski and others identified the Soviet Union (before its collapse) as the next challenger. The rise of this challenger was immediate. There was no "world power" period of calm after World War II during which the Americans exercised hegemony. With the Berlin crisis in 1947, the Korean War conflict in 1950, and the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, the Soviet Union was exhibiting behavior typical of the delegitimation phase. Figure 4 shows Soviet (Russian) army share rose to a dominant positions immediately after the war, which is typical of the delegitimation phase, not the world power phase. Although one can argue that the rise in naval share after World War II is characteristic of the world power phase, we argue that it was the United States, not the Soviet Union, that behaved in an anomalous fashion after the first world war. We suggest that anomalous behavior should not be used to define the cycle. We should instead draw our boundaries based on the challenger actions rather than the leader actions. The rise in Soviet (Russian) army share about 25-30 years after World War I is consistent with the behavior of previous challengers at a similar distance from a preceding global war."<br><br>The next step is Global War (China) set for 2030 as the macrodecision point chaotic attractor.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-three-to-brink.html#c3112631919672675930 title="comment permalink">10/19/12, 12:05 PM</a><br><br>

My understanding is that it emerged as a way for people from all over the UK, speaking a variety of dialects, accents, or languages, to understand each other when they gathered at court. In the same spirit, I was happy to adopt it when I worked in Asia because, proud as I am of my own strong Welsh accent, nobody could understand me.

I've spoken with influential Chinese in positions of some authority who see it as being entirely natural that the empty spaces of Africa could be used to settle some of China's surplus population. I'd say that attitude might be entirely mainstream in China.<br><br>That China will go through major internal problems seems to be inevitable. The drying up of major, glacier-fed rivers, horrific pollution, and systemic corruption will ensure it once economic growth falters and the people's dreams become obviously unattainable. The social consequences of the one-child policy are also something that will lead to big trouble. Russia is quite right to worry about the future of Siberia.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-three-to-brink.html#c7189491858938836059 title="comment permalink">10/20/12, 2:55 AM</a><br><br>

The breakup of imperial states into quarrelling fragments is pretty common in history, after all. <br><br>Carp, I sometimes wonder whether the "ghost cities" are a deliberate strategy to stockpile useful resources in a form that will require much labor to extract. If China's export economy breaks down suddenly, due to war or some other cause, all those empty skyscrapers and shopping malls will have to be salvaged for their metal and other raw materials, and a couple of million people will be employed for a while doing it. <br><br>Reaper, where speculative bubbles are concerned, history doesn't just rhyme, it repeats. The identical slogans used to pitch investment trusts in 1929 were used to pitch tech stocks in 1999. <br><br>Joseph, don't mistake the bad habits of industrial society for those of humanity in general. Our species, in resource-constricted environments, has proven itself to be extremely good at finding and maintaining stable ecological relationships. Once the rubble stops bouncing from our decline and fall, I expect that a very much smaller human population will reestablish itself in less self-destructive lifeways and proceed from there, as so many other formerly invasive species have done across evolutionary time. <br><br>JP, well, to each their own. I don't find quantitative cycle models that useful in making sense of the historical past, and predictions made on the basis of cycle theories far more often than not turn out to be inaccurate -- I should give some time on "The End of the World of the Week" to a book, a fairly large seller in the late 1970s, which insisted on the basis of cyclic theory that a new world war ought to break out by 1986.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-three-to-brink.html#c2385351844748922202 title="comment permalink">10/21/12, 9:39 PM</a><br><br>

The Aboriginals did it here for somewhere between 40,000 to 60,000 years even after they ate all of the mega-fauna causing massive environmental changes and damage right across the continent.<br><br>Dude, I see the term, "overbreeding" (your term) and I wonder whether you have contributed to the issue at hand?<br><br>In my mind, you can only be referring to a population larger than the available resources - particularly food and water (all other considerations are secondary). <br><br>I'd reckon that places like the UK and the US (and here) have certainly hit that cliff, although they may not realise it just yet. They are either dependent on food imports like the UK or they are flogging the remaining soils to death like in the US (and here too).<br><br>I'll qualify that opinion firstly by pointing out that in these first world economies approximately only 2% of the population are involved in food production. This is a massively risky strategy that is bound to end in tears. It is actually unprecedented historically.<br><br>For the past 7 years I've been mucking around / learning trying to produce food on a long term sustainable basis on acreage and it is mind-bogglingly complex. The more time I spend on the project, the more humbled I am by it and my awareness of the complexities of the ecosystem becomes greater.<br><br>Yet the alternative system which the majority of the population benefits from is dependent on both fertilisers and oil. Scary stuff, I haven't yet seen a tractor that can run for any length of time on batteries! Also, try transporting fertilisers (mined or synthetic) without oil.<br><br>So, when you use the term, "over breeding" make sure you think about your own location and choices, the choices of your own society and whether you actually mean, someone, somewhere else? <br><br>I'm not having a go at you, I'm just trying to get you to think about the issue at hand before you make sweeping generalisations.

I made an out of date calculation of the significant fraction of world exports of crude oil that is imported by the USA. The USA has actually significantly reduced its imports of crude since the 2008 financial crash. However, oil import costs have increased due to rising prices, which more than offset the savings from lower import volumes. I find interestingly the situation follows a previous pattern (mid 80s). But even more significantly for me I realise for the first time the extraordinary build up in US oil imports to 2005 to an all-time high. This build up seems to me the USA finally banging its head on the ceiling! See revelatory Figure 1 in this Congressional Research Service paper, <br>http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42465.pdf <br>The USA is importing a lower proportion of world oil exports than it was a short while ago, (see my error; down from 20% of world exports to nearer 15%) but it seems to me the country is very unlikely ever to recover its ability to compete for this resource in the way it has up to the recent past. What do you think?<br>It also seems to me important that US Gross National Income per person/capita, (current US$) hardly changed at all overall 2008 to 2011, having dipped in 2009. http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD/countries/US--XS?display=graph<br>(US population is still growing @ 0.7 to 0.9% per year).<br><br>Phil<br><br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-three-to-brink.html#c7774538279796694951 title="comment permalink">10/22/12, 6:49 AM</a><br><br>

The Chinese empire will likely be the dominant force in the industrial world during what I've called the age of scarcity industrialism, when resource nationalism and political control over energy sources will enable some countries to maintain an industrial economy while others slide down the slope into full deindustrialization. The fall of the Chinese empire, in turn, may well be a good marker for the end of scarcity industrialism and the beginning of the much longer age of salvage societies.

Let's compare China rocket (first half of 21th century) to USA rocket (first half of 20th). I find lots of crucial differences:<br><br>USA: Can choose its enemies, its territory is not at risk.<br>China: Cannot chose its enemies, India, Japan, Russia are at the borders or very close. That said, internal enemies and strifes seem to be the chief worry.<br><br>USA: effectively controls population and neutralises dissent by thaumaturgy.<br>China: rules by repression and crude censorship. Dedicates more resources towards internal than external threats.<br><br>USA: Excess capacity in natural resources and food. Can export both.<br>China: Lacks oil. Only has 7% worlds of arable land and 20% of population. Coal-to-oil projects will be an ecological disaster. <br><br>USA: Majority of the resource pie still intact, USA eats it in very devious and seemingly benovelent manner: thaumaturgy of democratic values and stealthy acquisition of Lebensraum.<br>China: More than half of resources used up already, backlash to Chinese expansion is already happening. China needs Lebenraum way more than USA ever did and is not nearly as sophisticated in securing it as USA used to be.<br><br>USA: Comes out of WW2 as the hegemon with no damage to speak of (at least compared to rest of the world). No rivals.<br>China: Not nearly close to a hegemon. Many rivals. Probably comes out of WW3 as (nuclear?) a wasteland.<br><br>USA: Future Fukushimas and Cherhnobyls not built yet.<br>China: Has to rely on Fukushimas and Cherhnobyls. Serious damage in years ahead<br><br>USA: the great depression<br>China: the coming real estate collapse alone may be worse than great depression. Many chances of perfect storm brewing.<br><br>USA: 80-160 million consumers, plenty of room for growth and consumerist thaumaturgy. Young population.<br>China: 1.3 billion consumers. Large domestic consumption equals ecological catastrophe. Aging population.<br><br>USA: mostly self-sufficent.<br>China: would collapse without ever-increasing exports of products and imports of resources. China basically depends on well-being of its rivals to keep economy afloat and its people fed.

Clans and regional loyalties suppressed during Mao's reign are back with a vengeance. For example:<br><br>“Clan wars continue to be waged largely out of sight and out of mind in many rural areas, some of them having their origins in events long before the Communists took power, and even from imperial days. In August 1993, for example, in Hunan Province, birthplace of Mao, thousands of villagers fought a pitched battle armed with home-made guns, grenades and explosives that left at least five people dead, 12 seriously wounded and several buildings in ruins. Security forces had to fire tear-gas into the crowd to split up the warring factions"<br><br>“Inter-regional conflicts are no longer confined to the coast-versus-hinterland syndrome. Rich provinces and cities are pitted against each other even as poor areas pummel one another with stunning ferocity. The reasons are little more than money, resources, and greed. Take the scuffles over the delineation of borders between provinces. Since 1980, more than 10 bloody clashes have taken place between the cadres and residents in Guangxi and Hunan provinces. Fifteen hundred people were allegedly killed or seriously injured in quarrels over land and water rights. Equally venomous battles have been fought between villagers living on the Qinghai-Gansu border over gold-mine rights. Two special work teams sent by the Communist Party and State Council to the area failed to solve the problem….<br><br>“Inter-provincial confrontations, of course, go back several centuries. Since 1949, thousands of Chinese have died in more than 1,000 armed conflicts over the imprecise demarcation of frontiers. They have worsened owing to the eclipse of central authority. For most of the new-style ‘economic warlords’, local development bringing tangible benefits such as wealth to close relatives and business associates is more important than heeding Beijing’s call to promote national cohesiveness“<br><br>(China: The Next Superpower: Dilemmas in Change and Continuity, page 58)<br><br>China likes to present itself as monolithic Han (90%). But Han themselves are far from homogeneous, there are various subgroups which thought of themselves as quite distinct until forcibly hammered together on great anvil of Communism by divine hammer of Mao. Even if Han were indeed welded together (and they're not), several repressed minorities happen to live in quite strategical and resource-rich places (Sino-Indian boundary, Mongolia). And there is inherent tension between rich regions where profits flow in and regions which are pumped for resources and low cost labour. The latter outnumber the former, obviously. Contemporary China coast vs hinterland represents larger divide than North vs South in USA. I find USA much less divided and more effectively centralized than China. North-south divide ? If USA were China, homemade rockets would be flying over contemporary Mason Dixie line every week ;/<br><br>It's obvious that both China and USA are very corrupt countries, but quite different in how corruption works. Still I find Chinese kleptocracy is even more damaging to its host society than current USA one. That's really bad. You can't even compare either of these kleptocraries to USA in say 1930 ...<br><br>(My China data is primarily from http://www.amazon.com/Chinas-Trapped-Transition-Developmental-Autocracy/dp/0674021959 )<br><br>Space station USA is clearly on descending orbit, crashing towards the earth. But Space Station China may be too fragile to ever get there. Not all Chinese dynasties were long lived, and I don't think Mao dynasty will.

First, domestic unrest scenario happening in China as well, but on a much larger scale which would overwhelm central authority maybe even break the China itself. Second: USA is certainly heading toward a surveillance society that suppresses dissent with violence. It's possible that future repression in USA could be much effective than in China, USA being more isolated and centralized. In such future, 36 killed in homeland security incident may simply be business as usual, with news of the incident censored and those who could do something about it either complicit or too afraid do do anything.<br><br>Regarding ghost cities, I don't think there is/was a plan. Construction is great for money laundering and short term profits for aparatchiks. Cities decay very quickly if nobody lives in them and it's very hard to salvage anything of value from them.<br><br>Finally, regarding USA foreign debt and leverage it gives China: I think it may be overestimated. First reason is that leverage is mutual: China has to keep both USA and EU afloat or China exports and economy are in free fall. Second: Japan owns almost as much US debt as China does and keeps buying it. Anyone talking about Japanese leverage nowadays? And there is this interesting historical precedent with Communist China defaulting on its debts to USA.

I have still some work to do but at last get the feeling I am reading a proper account of the history of money and usury; quoted example:<i>[Zarlenga] does not adopt the common but simplistic definition of usury as the charging of “excessive interest”, but rather as “taking something for nothing” through the calculated misuse of a nation’s money system for private gain.<br>Historically this has taken two forms. ... </i><br>Times they are a changing - or at least in theory. Implications for 'wealth pumps' I guess, and, Evans Pritchard thinks, for the City of London.<br><br>best<br>Phil<br><br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-three-to-brink.html#c6001373564098775340 title="comment permalink">10/22/12, 2:47 PM</a><br><br>

Old stories come around.<br><br>My comment re "usury" got a bit shortened late at night. The Telegraph did not actually mention the word 'usury',and sadly did not use the quote that I did. But Pritchard recognises the historical and monetary validity of the arguments, and is fair to the "modern tools" deployed to run numerical versions of later plans, e.g. Irving Fisher in the 1930s, up the flag pole, as it were; quote<br><i>"The Athenian leader Solon implemented the first known Chicago Plan/New Deal in 599 BC to relieve farmers in hock to oligarchs enjoying private coinage. He cancelled debts, restituted lands seized by creditors, set floor-prices for commodities (much like Franklin Roosevelt), and consciously flooded the money supply with state-issued "debt-free coinage."</i> <br><br>Pritchard adds a bit about the role of later Roman elites' accumulation of wealth; quote: <i> "Money slipped control of the Senate. You could call it Rome's shadow banking system. Evidence suggests that it became a machine for elite wealth accumulation."</i> <br>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/9623863/IMFs-epic-plan-to-conjure-away-debt-and-dethrone-bankers.html<br><br>The actual IMF 'working paper' is here.
