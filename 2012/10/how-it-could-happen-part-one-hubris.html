Over the course of this year, my posts here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> have tried to outline the trajectory of America’s global empire and explore the reasons why that trajectory will likely come to a sudden stop in the near future. To bring the issue down out of the realm of abstraction and put them in the context of history as lived, I’ve returned to the toolkit of narrative fiction, and this and the next four posts will sketch out a scenario of American imperial defeat and collapse. The narrative takes place at some unspecified point in the next two decades; it’s probably necessary to say outright that is not how I think the end of America’s empire
<i>will</i> happen, simply one way that it <i>could</i>
happen—and thus a model that may help expose some of the vulnerabilities of the self-proclaimed hyperpower currently tottering toward history’s compost bin.

<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
*********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The news of the latest Tanzanian deepwater oil discovery broke on an otherwise sleepy Saturday in March. Thirty years before, a find of the same size might have gotten two column inches somewhere in the back pages of a few newspapers of record, but this was not thirty years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In a world starved for oil, what might once have been considered a modest find earned banner headlines.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It certainly loomed large in the East Wing of the White House, where the president and his advisers held a hastily called meeting that evening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“The Chinese already have it wrapped up,” said the Secretary of Energy. “Tanzania’s in their pocket, and there are CNOOC people—”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>CNOOC was the Chinese National Overseas Oil Corporation, the state-owned firm that spearheaded China’s quest for foreign oil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>“—all over the place on site and in Dar es Salaam.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Is it close enough to Kenyan waters—” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not a chance, Mr. President. It’s 200 nautical miles away from the disputed zone, and that last clash with the Tanzanians isn’t something Nairobi wants to repeat.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Dammit, we need that oil.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The president turned and walked over to the window. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He was right, of course, and “we” didn’t just refer to the United States. Jameson Weed won the White House the previous November with a campaign focused with laser intensity on getting the US out of its long and worsening economic slump.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Winning the country a bigger share of imported oil was the key to making good on that promise, but that was easier said than done; behind what was left of the polite fiction of a free market in petroleum, most oil that crossed national borders did so according to political deals between producer countries and those consuming countries strong and wealthy enough to compete.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These days, more often than not, the US lost out—and the impact of that reality on Weed’s upcoming reelection campaign was very much on the minds of everyone in the room. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“There’s one option,” said the president’s national security adviser.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Regime change.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
President Weed turned back from the window to face the others. The Secretary of Defense cleared his throat. “Sooner or later,” he said, “the Chinese are going to stand and fight.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The national security adviser gave him a contemptuous look. “They don’t dare,” she said. “They know who’s boss, and it’s too far from their borders for their force projection capacity, anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They’ll back down the way they did in Gabon.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The president glanced from one to the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“It’s an option,” he said. “I want a detailed plan on my desk in two weeks.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>* </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Regime change wasn’t as simple as it used to be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That was the sum of scores of conversations in meeting rooms in the Pentagon and the CIA headquarters in Langley as the plan came together. Gone were the easy days of the “color revolutions,” when a few billion dollars funneled through Company-owned NGOs could buy a mass uprising and panic an unprepared government into collapse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The second generation strategies that worked so well in Libya and half a dozen other places—backing the manufactured uprising with mercenaries, special forces, and a no-fly zone—stopped working in turn once target governments figured out how to fight it effectively.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now it usually took ground troops backed up by air power to finish the job of replacing an unfriendly government with a compliant one. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, it was a familiar job by this point, and the officials in charge got the plan put together in well under the two weeks the president had given them. A few days later, when it came back signed and approved, the wheels started turning. Money flowed to CIA front organizations all over East Africa; Company assets in Tanzania began recruiting the ambitious, the dissatisfied, and the idealistic to staff the cadres that would organize and lead the uprising; elsewhere, mercenaries were hired and the usual propaganda mills went into action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The government of Kenya, the nearest American client state, was browbeaten into accepting American troops on its border with Tanzania, and a third carrier strike group was mobilized and sent on its way to join the two already within range. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It took only a few weeks for the government of Tanzania to figure out that its recent good luck had put it in the crosshairs of American power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One afternoon in early May, after a detailed briefing from his intelligence chief, the president of Tanzania summoned the Chinese ambassador to a secret meeting, and told him bluntly, “If you abandon us now we are lost.” The ambassador promised only to relay the message to Beijing, but he did so within minutes of returning to the Chinese embassy, and included a detailed and urgent commentary of his own. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Three days later, a dozen men sat down around a table in a conference room in Beijing. A staff member poured tea and disappeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After an hour’s discussion, one of the men at the meeting said, “What is it that the Americans say? ‘Draw a line in the sand?’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I propose that this is the time and place to do that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A quiet murmur of agreement went around the table. In the days that followed, a different set of officials drew up a very different set of plans. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">

<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The port at Dar es Salaam, Tanzania’s capital and biggest city, was a busy place, thronged with oil tankers carrying black gold to China and its allies, and container ships bringing goods of every description, mostly from China, for the booming Tanzanian economy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In the bustle, no one paid much attention to the arrival of a series of plain shipping containers from Chinese ports, which were offloaded from an assortment of ordinary container ships and trucked to half a dozen inconspicuous warehouse districts along the coast between Dar es Salaam and the northern port city of Tanga.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>CIA agents watching for signs of a Chinese response missed them completely. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
More generally, the number of container shipments to Tanzania and half a dozen other Chinese client states in Africa ticked up slightly—not enough to rouse suspicions, but then nobody in the US learned how many African companies found themselves facing unexpected delays in getting the Chinese merchandise they had ordered, so that other cargoes took the space that would have been theirs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nor did anyone in the US worry much about the increased number of young Chinese men who flew to Africa during the four months before the war began.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>US intelligence did notice them, and their arrival sparked a brief debate at Langley—military observers, one faction among US intelligence advisors insisted, there to snoop on American military technology; military advisors, another faction claimed, there to assist the Tanzanian army against the American forces that were already gathering in Kenya. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Both factions were wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Most of the tight-lipped young men went to ground near those same warehouse districts between Dar es Salaam and Tanga, where the contents of those shipping containers were assembled, tested, and readied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Meanwhile, thousands of miles away, the Peoples Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) shifted six fighter wings, equipped with some of China’s most advanced aircraft, to Central Asian bases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Chinese government had announced that it would be holding joint military exercises that August with Russia, and so the satellite photos of Chengdu J-20 fighters parked in the deserts of Turkestan got an incurious glance or two in Langley, and went into filing cabinets. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

<div class=MsoNormal>
After years of budget battles on Capitol Hill, the US military was not quite so powerful or so swift to deploy as it had been in the last years of the twentieth century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Only two of the remaining eight carrier strike groups—CSGs, in naval jargon—were on station at any time, one in the western Pacific and one shuttling back and forth between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean; transport was a growing challenge by sea or air, and borrowing airliners from the civilian air fleet, a mainstay of late twentieth century Pentagon planning, was less simple to arrange now that air travel was only for the rich again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, the units assigned to the first phase of the Tanzanian operation—the 101st Airborne, the 6th Air Cavalry, and the 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions—were used to rounding up transport in a hurry and heading off on no notice to the far corners of the globe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first units of the 101st Airborne landed at Nairobi in the middle of May, when the heavy rains were over and the first riots were breaking out in Dar es Salaam. By the time President Weed gave his famous speech in Kansas City on June 20, denouncing atrocities he claimed had been committed by the Tanzanian government and proclaiming in ringing terms America’s unstinting readiness to support the quest for freedom around the world, all four divisions were settling into newly constructed bases in the upland country south of Kajiado, not far from the Tanzanian border. Alongside them, logistics staff and civilian contractors swarmed, getting ready for the two armored divisions, on their way from Germany by ship, who would fill out the land assault force, and the bulk of the supplies for the assault, which were on their way by sea from Diego Garcia. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile three CSGs, headed by the nuclear carriers USS Ronald Reagan, USS John F. Kennedy, and USS George Washington, headed at cruising speed toward a rendezvous point in the western Indian Ocean, where they would meet the ships carrying the armored divisions from Germany and a dozen big supply ships from the Maritime Prepositioning Squadron based on Diego Garcia. Two Air Force fighter wings had already been assigned to the operation, and would arrive just before the carriers reached operational range; they and carrier-based planes would then take out the Tanzanian air force and flatten military targets across the country during the two weeks the armored divisions would need to land, join the rest of the force, and begin the ground assault. It was a standard plan for the quick elimination of the modest military forces of a midsized Third World country; its only weakness was that the US force was no longer facing a midsized Third World country. </div>

In times of peace, August and September are the peak tourist season in East Africa; inland from the always humid coast, the climate is cool and dry, and the wide plains of the interior are easy to travel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since plains in cool dry weather are among the best places on earth for an assault by tanks and attack helicopters, these were also the months the Pentagon’s planners assigned for Operation Blazing Torch, the liberation of Tanzania.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Briefing papers handed to President Weed in late July sketched out the final details, and he nodded and signed off on the final orders for the invasion. The Secretary of Defense looked on from the other side of the room with a silent frown. He had tried several times to bring up the small but real chance that the Chinese might retaliate, and had his advice dismissed by Weed and mocked to his face by the president’s national security adviser and Vice President Gurney. As soon as this thing was over, he told himself for the fifteenth time, he would hand in his resignation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

<div class=MsoNormal>
Outside the White House windows, barely visible in the distance, a small band of protesters kept up a desultory vigil in the free-speech zone set aside for them. Pedestrians hurried past, ignoring the chanted slogans and the protest signs. It was another brutally hot summer day in Washington DC, part of the “new normal” that the media talked about when they couldn’t avoid mentioning the shifting climate altogether.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Out beyond the Beltway, half the country was gripped by yet another savage drought; the states of Iowa and Georgia had just suspended payment on their debts, roiling the financial markets; eyes across the southeast turned nervously toward a tropical storm, poised off the Windwards, that showed every sign of turning into the season’s first big hurricane. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What many perceptive observers recalled afterward was the sullen mood that gripped the country that summer. Only the media and the most shameless of national politicians tried to pretend that the approaching war with Tanzania was about anything but oil; the president’s approval rating drifted well below 25%, which was still three times that of Congress and well above that of any credible candidate the other party had to offer; the usual clich<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">é</span>s spewed from the usual pundits, but the only people who were listening were the pundits themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Across the nation and across the political spectrum, the patience of the American people was visibly running short. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those who were dissatisfied had plenty of reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The intractable economic slump that had gripped the country since 2008 showed no sign of lifting, despite repeated bailouts of the financial industry that were each proclaimed as the key to returning prosperity, and repeated elections in which each candidate claimed to have fresh new ideas and then pursued the same failed policies once in office.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The fracking boom of the early twenty-teens was practically ancient history; energy prices were high, and straggling higher; gasoline bumped against $7 a gallon that summer before slumping most of the way back to $6.50.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>None of these things were new, but they seemed to infect the national mood more powerfully than before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Shortly they would help spark an explosion—but there would be other explosions first. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At the end of July, the invasion task force assembled in the Indian Ocean almost two thousand miles east of the Kenyan coast. Fleet Admiral Julius T. Deckmann, commanding the task force, made sure everything was in order before giving the orders to sail west.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>A career officer with half a dozen combat assignments behind him, Deckmann had learned to trust his intuition, and his intuition told him that something was not right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From the bridge of the USS George Washington, his flagship, he considered the assembled fleet, shook his head, and ordered reconnaissance drones sent up. Real-time images from US spy satellites showed nothing out of the ordinary; data from the AWACS plane circling high overhead confirmed that, and so did the drones, once data started coming in from them. Deckmann’s unease remained as days passed uneventfully and the task force neared East Africa. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The fleet reached its assigned position off the Kenyan coast on schedule. Final news came via secure satellite link from Washington: the Air Force fighter wings had arrived and were ready for action; the Tanzanian Freedom Council, the puppet government-in-exile manufactured by the State Department, had called “the nations of the world” to liberate their country, a plea that everyone knew was directed at one nation alone; the CIA-led mercenaries who spearheaded the second, violent phase of the uprising had withdrawn from Dar es Salaam, leaving the local cadres to their fate, and were moving toward the Kenyan border to open the way for the invasion. Deckmann made sure every ship in his fleet was ready as the sun set in red haze over the distant African coast. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Very few of those involved in the war got much sleep, that last night before the shooting began. On the three carriers, and at two newly constructed airfields in southern Kenya, aircrews worked through the dark hours to get their planes ready for battle, unaware that other aircrews were doing the same thing thousands of miles away in Central Asia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Soldiers of the two armored divisions that had been brought down from Germany prepared for a landing in Mombasa most of them would not live to see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, presidents met with their cabinets and then headed for heavily guarded bunkers; elsewhere in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>the world, heads of state read intelligence briefings and braced themselves for crisis. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Two hours before the East African dawn, the waiting ended. Two people ended it. One was Admiral Deckmann, barking out the orders that sent the first fighter-bombers roaring off the deck of the George Washington and the first Tomahawk cruise missiles blazing skywards. The other was an officer in a Chinese command center deep in central Asia, who watched the planes take off and the missiles launch, courtesy of a high-altitude observation drone—one of three that had been following the George Washington since it went through the Suez Canal, and were now stationed high above the fleet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As infrared images showed planes and missiles hurtling toward Tanzania, the officer typed rapidly on a keyboard and then hit enter twice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With the second click of the enter key, the Chinese response began. </div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the world of apocalyptic fantasy, an engineer’s degree is very often a passport to success. An engineer’s training focuses on figuring what can happen, not what did happen or will happen, and so engineers reign supreme in many fields of rejected knowledge; from creation science through the quest for ancient astronauts to past and present claims of imminent apocalypse, books by retired engineers are usually the most imaginative and least inhibited works on their eccentric subjects. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Retired electrical engineer Hugh Auchincloss Brown was a classic of the type, and had an even more vivid imagination than most of his peers. In his book <i>Cataclysms of the Earth</i> (1967), he argued that the amount of ice at the south pole was steadily increasing, and the excess weight would eventually cause the planet to unbalance and flip over in space, devastating the entire surface of the globe and leaving few survivors. Moreover, he insisted, this had happened before:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the present Antarctic ice cap was “the successor to a long lineage of glistening assassins of former civilizations on this planet.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Brown died in 1976, convinced to the end that the cataclysm was already overdue and might occur at any moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His theory found eager listeners among late 20th century fans of apocalypse, but lost market share as better measurements made it clear that the ice cap on Antarctica is contracting, not expanding.</div>

Glad to see the fictional scenario making a comeback for such an interesting topic.<br><br>I've got some guesses where the scenario is going based on your recent series of posts, but I'm just impressed by two things: first, your cliffhangers are getting more exciting. Second, it's impressive how in this scenario there's been nothing but more of the same taking place in the US (a warmongering president named after a nondescript plant type, a VP whose name ends in "ney," persistent high unemployment, bumpy-plateau energy prices and availability, widespread political disaffection, etc.). That brings to mind that this type of scenario doesn't require any substantial change in politics, the economy, military technology, or much of anything else in order to happen. I know that that's one of the main points in this series, but so far this scene is uncomfortably familiar. Well done.<br><br><a href=#c8102793572930437897 title="comment permalink">10/3/12, 8:13 PM</a><br><br>

That's exactly the point, of course -- the sort of thing the narrative will describe could happen without any significant changes to the way the world works. I've always thought that the sort of future scenario that assumes that all kinds of improbable events will happen first is saying, "Look, you don't have to worry about something like this really happening; it's just a story." <br><br>Bill, excellent! I wondered how soon somebody would catch onto that. If you know anything about the kind of trip you get from that particular plant, the point of the name may be clearer. (No, I haven't used it, but I've talked to folks from one end of the Sixties scene who did.)<br><br><a href=#c5463477316321102685 title="comment permalink">10/3/12, 8:27 PM</a><br><br>

Hadn't realised how much time it took to read your blog + comments and respond until it was no longer there. Tick, lesson learned. <br><br>It has however been a fruitful time as I've pumped out 4 articles in quick succession.<br><br>The latest was on water harvesting:<br><a href=http://permaculturenews.org/2012/09/29/food-forests-part-5-water-friend-and-foe/ rel=nofollow>Water: friend and foe</a><br><br>haha! I snuck in a shameless plug. <br><br>I hope readers can take the time to have a look and I hope they all enjoy it.<br><br>Speaking of which, communicating via a story is a valuable and time honoured way of getting a message across. Your story was a gripping story too, can't wait to see where it ends up.<br><br>I thought that "Weed" was very cheeky and enjoyed the humour! FYI, weed is not for me.<br><br>I trust that you and all of the readers here have learned recently that QE1 and QE2 (not the monarch or the ship!) have since become QE Infinity (Quantitative Easing ie. Printing money). This is not going to end well at all.<br><br>Firstly, observation shows that there are diminishing returns with such a program (and the US program will be US$50bn/month). Japan is a very good example of this, however, they differ from the US in that most debt is held within Japan and this is significant. <br><br>Secondly, the UK, the ECB and Japan are all following suit. Well done you!<br><br>Thirdly, down under, we aren't pursuing this policy and it is wreaking havoc on the exchange rate. This in turn makes imports cheaper and is gutting our manufacturing industries and making our exports more expensive (lucky for us we still have food products to export). Interesting times.<br><br>Historically, printing money has always resulted in hyper-inflation. Yet at a glance this doesn't seem to be happening.<br><br>I've been thinking about this for a long while and reckon that it may be because manufactured goods are being imported rather than produced locally. The lower labour and environmental cost component of these imported goods are cushioning the impacts of inflation though in your country. <br><br>However, the papers here are reporting that whilst official US unemployment statistics are about 8.1 to 8.2%, unofficially they are saying that unemployment is around 18%.<br><br>So, I keep wondering when inflation will pick up in the US? Then I read an article stating that the median house price in the US has risen 17% this year alone, which is strange in the circumstances. Then the light bulb went on and I thought to myself, there is the inflation.<br><br>I bet, anecdotally, imported energy prices (ie. oil) have risen too, even though demand for oil has dropped in the US due to the recession.<br><br>Has food prices risen too?<br><br>All of those statistics were being presented in the articles as a positive, when I think they may actually be an alarm. Could be wrong, but only time will tell for sure.<br><br>Thanks for taking the time to write the blog. As a rock star might say, "we're back, baby!"<br><br>PS: As I'm writing this, there's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt1zI23umKk" rel=nofollow>Southern Boobook Owl</a> hooting away outside the window. Apparently the name has some link to a Terry Pratchett story (Sir Terry, by the way too), but the owl was named first.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c388097340494263905 title="comment permalink">10/4/12, 3:28 AM</a><br><br>

There are a few twists still to come...<br><br>Paul, if the price of gas goes up too far too fast, it clobbers the economy, decreasing the number of people who can buy gasoline at all and bringing the price back down. Since this scenario is set at some point in the next two decades -- which, please note, could mean as soon as next March -- $7 a gallon doesn't seem out of range to me. <br><br>Ben, there's a reason why all that saber-rattling at Iran has remained at the level of saber-rattling. For a declining empire, the art of evading confrontations you're sure to lose is an important survival skill -- but sooner or later somebody always makes a misjudgment. <br><br>Raven, the competent martial artist knows when it's time to end the artful weavings with a sudden kick to the face. <br><br>Cherokee, the Fed and the US Treasury are pretty clearly hoping that the inflationary effect of all the money they're printing will be balanced by the deflationary effect of massive deleveraging in the US economy and elsewhere. In the short term, they may be right; in the long term, the US dollar is toast, but the scramble for short-term survival in Washington DC is desperate enough that nobody's worrying about the long term. <br><br>Raven, that's not a project that interests me just now, so I'll leave it to someone else. <br><br>Eric, thank you!<br><br>Renaissance, thank you too! One of the things I did over the September break is a bunch of research into how the US makes war, so I could make the scenario as realistic as possible. <br><br>Ando and JC, thank you!<br><br><a href=#c8010316261594806253 title="comment permalink">10/4/12, 7:28 AM</a><br><br>

These days, everybody knows that when you take the same product X and simply jack up its price tag, that is a public admission that your business model is failing. Price inflation is the _last_ resort of a desperate company, not the first.<br><br>Instead, in the last couple of decades, we've had "Stealth Inflation". Your favorite candy bar keeps the same price tag, but without any announcement, it is gradually shaved down from 2.5 ounces to 2.1 ounces. Same for your cereal box. Your toilet paper keeps the same price tag, but instead of 500 sheets that are 4 inches wide, it becomes 450 sheets that are 3.75 inches wide. Your favorite restaurant starts using frozen fish from Costco in its most expensive specials, rather than local fish hand-caught.<br><br>This has been going on for many years if not decades. Industries that cannot adopt those tactics -- such as, say, housing and gasoline -- simply raise their price, and hence that's why those particular industries are specifically excluded from government inflation indexes. <br><br>It will only be later, after years of teetering on the edge of economic chaos, that we are going to see price-tag inflation like most people expect.<br><br><a href=#c4556893069262906128 title="comment permalink">10/4/12, 10:12 AM</a><br><br>

A few days ago, I saw an article about gas prices in California. It promptly disappeared, but I did a little Gogleing around ...<br><br>In Bakersfield and LA, today, some stations are charging $5 per gallon. Reason? "Combination of low inventories and multiple refinery problems."<br><br>In many places dealers are shutting down their pumps due to "not being able to obtain gasoline from their regular distributor or cannot afford the break-even price of almost $5 per gallon."<br><br>@Cherokee Organics - Yes, food prices have risen. I've noticed it particularly in canned goods. I've always been one to stock up on good grades of soup, good chili and solid white tuna. <br><br>Two years ago, I could usually find some sales where I'd stock up on the above at less than $1 a can. On sale, I can't find soup for less than $1.39. And, that's for the all vegetable varieties. Anything with meat in it either never goes on sale or, the sale price is around $2. I notice prices up on a lot of other things, but the canned goods are the thing I can most easily make a comparison. <br><br>So, my first year out here in the country, I'm planting and harvesting more. I made my first forays into canning. Hundreds of pounds of fruit are going to waste in my area, and next year I'll be better prepared to take advantage of that bounty.<br><br><a href=#c1714467052982298299 title="comment permalink">10/4/12, 11:08 AM</a><br><br>

Surely no president would be able to allow such an overt move on the Chinese part, with the inevitable loss of US lives, without pushing The Button.<br><br>I see it more likely for the move to come from a "rogue nation" like Iran, or possibly a relatively small military defeat from some group like Al Qaeda and the Chinese step into the breach when the US loses the ability to project power.<br><br>The Chinese, in the scenario you've pointed out, could be very plausibly expected to sponsor a long-term insurgency as in Iraq/Afghanistan. Possibly a destroyer sunk by a Chinese-supplied missile, a monthly American body count, and a ballooning deficit to pay for it, and the results would be the same.<br><br>Anyway, maybe I'm just rationalizing to get rid of the sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.

The U.S. Carriers have rarely been an important component in the recent small wars. The usual modus operandi has been to camp out in the neighboring country and blast them with AF assets. The navy and tomahawks are often involved because their brass wants to get into the act. With the potential for an intervening foreign power (obvious) they would stay off shore and keep moving.<br><br>Don't forget that the big decks are not our only carriers. Our amphibious assault ships are the equivelant of a jump jet carrier. That's why we have marine hawker jump jets (blown up) in Afghanistan.<br><br>The U.S. Navy has had its failings, but of our various military services, by far has the most distinguished record of accomplishments.

If JMG's scenario is set at least 20 years in the future, Cherokee may have a point that $7 is an under-estimate.<br><br><i>&gt; What were the prices of oil and gasoline in 1998? Do you remember? Without looking them up...<br>Most guesses have clustered around $2.50 to $3 a gallon for gasoline (in the US). Only one person could come up with a crude oil price which she guessed was around $55 a barrel. The answers show a vague recollection that oil and gasoline were cheaper than they are today. But just how much cheaper has been lost down the memory hole.<br><br>Okay, I know the suspense is killing you. Here's how gasoline and oil fared in 1998. The nationwide average price of a gallon of gasoline in the United States in December of that year was 95 cents. The closing price for a barrel of crude oil sold on the New York Mercantile Exchange on December 31 was $12.05. Just three weeks earlier the price of oil had hit its nadir for the year at $10.72. ...<br><br>Why does the oil industry want you to forget this? Because after a 10-fold increase in the price of crude oil and a fourfold increase in the price of gasoline, the industry is once again trying to sell the same story of continued abundance that they were selling back in the late 1990s. But the manyfold increase in oil prices ought to make everyone doubt an industry which has repeatedly told us that huge supplies are just around the corner, and prices are headed for a crash.</i><br><br><a href=#c694671046308080648 title="comment permalink">10/4/12, 1:02 PM</a><br><br>

I hope the month was productive!<br><br>I've spent the hiatus obtaining and reading Alf Hornburg's <i>Power of the Machine</i>.

While I'd been moving in Distributist and other similar circles for some time, I hadn't yet found anyone who could explain concretely the ways that exploitation happens. Hornburg performs admirably there; thank you for recommending him.<br><br>***<br><br>An interesting start to the scenario. Considering the realities of the post-peak world, the military planner's job gains some interesting wrinkles. One can imagine it as a game; perhaps it could be named "Jennel's Dilemma." The rules are simple:<br><br>1) The army operating at a Higher "Level" of Energy Use wins.<br><br>2) The army better trained within its Energy Level wins.<br><br>3) The army that doesn't have enough cheap energy to actually perform at its chosen Energy Level loses.<br><br>4) The winner of one conflict obtains control of a larger percentage of the energy left, to use in the next conflict.<br><br>5) Switching Energy Levels is a non-trivial task, and makes you temporarily vulnerable to rule 2.<br><br>6) The total supply is decreasing - don't let rule 3 catch you!<br><br>These rules lead to some interesting strategies. Do you "use it while you got it"? Or do you deliberately low-ball your Energy Use and then hit your enemy hard when he overreaches? Can you play the diplomatic game well enough to stall for time?

The military is often portrayed as incompetent bumbleheads, but what sort of military to have and how to deploy it isn't a purely military decision, it's a political one.<br><br>When I read the previous posts and the comments, I often got the impression that the US military was just waiting for a defeat by any minor opponent with a bit of creativity, but in this scenario, the adversary is more or less at par, technologically.

I've observed it in the shops here which is why I cook so much food at home now - recently started making my own muesli using local honey because of this very issue.

Raw sugar retails here for AU$1/kg which is about 2 pounds. Isn't it amazing how much sugar you go through in jam making and preserving. <br><br>You know, if things ever became unpleasant, I'd nab all of the sugar and salt I could lay my hands on as it makes preserving that much easier.<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c389035978253146144 title="comment permalink">10/5/12, 6:11 AM</a><br><br>

In where I live we are already in 7$/gallon for atleast 5 years ago and now we are in 8-8,5 territory. I guess that the american governement indirectly props down the gas price by not taxing it as hard as a lot of countries ( just se the price of gas in UK, that by my math should be around 9$ a gallon, all because of taxes, in spite of technically the UK being a gas producer ) ... or it is a still lingering residue from the time the US was actualy a gas producer and that they could play Arab on oil prices to the final consumer ?<br><br>Back on the topic, Pres. Weed and Admiral Deckmann ... by that logic the Sec of Defense that no one listened to is called Cassandra ? ;)<br><br> On a more serious tone in certain aspect there was already someone that draw a line in the sand to the US: Russia in 2008 about Georgia and the shenigans in Ukraine after that ( where the "western" darling, Timoshenko, was arrested most likely with the hand of Moscow pulling some strings behind ). OFC that the US governement did not took the lessons it should had, but rarely any imperial governement does :p and decided to let the Russian "front" to cool down and press China and Iran via proxies ...<br><br>Anyway, I do think that something on this lines <i>will</i> happen ( not necessarily in Tanzania, though ) but I have some questions:<br><br>a) I assume that we are going to see some action with the Chinese carrier buster balistic missiles, no? <br><br>b) Looking at the intel known on the J-20, they should get from the Central Asia ( even if from the Uzbek base the Russians rented some time ago ) to Tanzania in fumes or pretty close. That means IMHO that either they will refill somewhere in the way ( and there goes stealth ) or their real target is closer than Tanzania ( say, Qatar ;) ? ).

Looking forward to installments. And it was great meeting you again in PA!<br><br>A question and a comment.<br><br>The question is, to what extent is the QE simply vanishing into debt holes? Let's say I (the government) were to print up a billion trillion dollars. But instead of putting it into circulation, I give it all to Vice President Gurney, who puts it into a bank that was holding a billion trillion dollars in bad debt, that they had in turn loaned out to American consumers who had used the money to buy bubble-gum cards from Gurney's company, Holoburden, at MASSIVELY inflated prices -- a million trillion dollars a card. The bubble-gum card market then crashed to real market values (about ten cents a card), the consumers shrugged and defaulted on their vast loans, and the banks suffered huge paper losses that have now been paid back by fake money. VP Gurney is now some kind of gazillionaire -- on paper -- but he still has only a few dozen homes, one yacht, etc. That is, his actual circulation of his gazillions is still limited by his mortal frame.<br><br>I would think there would be very little resulting inflation. If Gurney ever tried to <i>spend</i> his gazillions, there'd be Hell to pay, but instead, he "invests" in the stock market, causing it to inflate again even as the rest of the economy stagnates...<br><br>In other words, if a money tree explodes in a virtual forest, does it cause inflation?<br><br>The comment is this. If the US is going into imperial catabolism, and if the end is more-or-less inevitable, is it more just (or merciful) to drag it out, or to bring it down hard?<br><br>I may be offering the Republicans more credit for intelligence than they are due, but their extremism is so ... well, <i>extreme</i> that I can't help wondering if they've actually given up on a future, and are a) cynically grabbing for themselves everything that isn't nailed down, and b) telling themselves they are performing a mercy-killing.<br><br><a href=#c8011759988413042685 title="comment permalink">10/5/12, 7:18 PM</a><br><br>

This is part of the whole stealth inflation thing too, because rising costs of society are kept down by a lack of maintenance of the existing infrastructure which was built up over a long period of time and therefore slowly decays. <br><br>This is the case with our electricity distribution system here and there is a lot of whining going on here about the cost of electricity which has risen this year between 10% to 18%. Much blame has been heaped on the carbon tax, but it should actually be directed at the lack of investment in distribution infrastructure over the past two decades (plus increased household consumption).<br><br>Something is also nagging me at the back of my mind about Libya and it may or may not be relevant. My understanding was that many years back, the Colonel sent his son to the UK so that Libya could come in from the cold. I remember at the time reading that in later meetings with Blair that Gaddafi welcomed Blair in a most truly disrespectful manner and it was a glossed over matter.

If your aim was to convey insight and produce a few unsettled chuckles, you did a fine job. :)<br><br>As to Syria, Stephen Waldman (blogging at interfluidity.com) observes that recent targets of US economic and/or military belligerence also happen to be nations with introverted economies, less oriented toward global investment and private ownership and more toward the broad economic betterment of their citizens. For instance, Libya did not have the "freedoms of conscience" so promoted in the US, but had an economy that functioned for Syrians. Waldman hasn't written on this yet, but the shift in the US' attitude toward Burma, moving from the US' hit list to the shining beacon of freedom in Southeast Asia list, coincides so uncomfortably closely with their new head of state announcing pro-market reforms as to risk whiplash. Interestingly, a piece on the Guardian's website explores the connections between anti-Assad figures and neocon/neoliberal elites: http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/12/syrian-opposition-doing-the-talking <br><br>A desperation among the global investor class to grow their portfolios when they already own most everything currently on offer in friendly markets would surely inspire governments well-steeped in capitalism to manufacture new properties for that money, whether through new exclusive rights in property law (as in cap-and-trade, or novel exclusive rights in intellectual property), privatization by consent of the government (as the IMF/World Bank does) or privatization by force of wrecking up the joint (Iraq, Libya, Syria, and no doubt others). I don't claim this is the only force at work, but the hypothesis fits recent data far more closely than does the conventional "wisdom" of shallow, counterfactual appeals to personal freedom.<br><br>Looking forward to the next installment.

I never feel that your posts are preachy but they can be intimidating to me because I spend more time trying to make sure I understand all the information than I do actually reading. This presents the material in a more relatable fashion. The content is a bit different than most of your other posts but the message is easier to digest.<br><br>Digesting a lot of good information should be work, it helps me actually learn something.

The American mistakes seem pretty believable. I'm curious to see how it plays out for China. The scenario I'd most buy is the US and China knocking each other's teeth out and a third party moving into the power vacuum. <br><br>What would be an interesting WWIII scenario is a low-energy future with powers still attempting to play in the Great Game. You can't afford carrier battlegroups anymore? Can't afford the sea lift for an armored division? But drones are cheap. Hmm. <br><br>I've speculated before about the potential for schizo-tech. I continue to maintain that it seems plausible we might have packet radio networks and smartphones even as the average citizen (in the States) can no longer afford a car. <br><br>It would be kind of funny to imagine a mid-21st century expeditionary force heading out with bicycles and pack animals because nobody can spare the petrol but they have solar-charging microdrones and every soldier has instant communications with militarized iphone20's. <br><br>Right now, fossil fuels are cheap enough you can put any kind of factory you want anywhere you want. When fossil fuels become ridiculously expensive, places with cheap power advantages could become major manufacturing centers, exporting to the rest of the world.<br><br><a href=#c5342089314062161593 title="comment permalink">10/10/12, 10:46 AM</a><br><br>

With modern computerized xband radars and infrared sensors etc its getting awfully hard to hide a plane and these things are getting cheaper as allot of people have the requisite computing power in there cell phones now. That combined with modern anti aircraft missiles means that dominance of the air power especially the extremely expensive manned fighter jets may be coming to an end.<br><br>So instead I would replace the stealth drone with a satellite photo the Chinese have a few of them and a carrier is big enough to show up on a weather satellite.
