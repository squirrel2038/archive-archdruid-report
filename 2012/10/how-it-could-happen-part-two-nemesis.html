<div class=MsoNormal>
This week's post is the second of five parts of a fictional narrative tracing out a scenario of American imperial defeat and collapse. As already mentioned, this is scenario rather than prophecy—an outline of what could happen rather than a prediction of what will happen, and thus an exploration of some of the major vulnerabilities in America’s faltering empire. It may also be worth saying that no real aircraft carriers were harmed in the making of this narrative. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
*********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The missiles and fighter-bombers launched from the fleet were the second wave of the American assault, not the first. Attack helicopters from Kenyan bases took off a few minutes later, but went in ahead to target Tanzania’s air defenses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their timing was precise; by the time the first US jets crossed into Tanzanian airspace, the four military radar stations that anchored the northern end of Tanzania’s air defense system were smoking rubble. Real-time satellite images brought news of the successful strike to Admiral Deckmann and his staff aboard the USS George Washington, and to President Weed and his advisers in the situation room in the White House. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those images were on the screens when the whole US military satellite system suddenly went dark. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In US bases around the world, baffled technicians tried to reconnect with the satellite network, only to find that there was no network with which to reconnect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>NORAD reported that all the satellites were still in their orbits and showed every sign of still being operational, but none would respond to signals from ground stations or send data back down. Analysis quickly ruled out a technical failure, which left only one option; the president’s national security adviser glanced up from a hurriedly compiled briefing paper outlining that one option, to find the Secretary of Defense regarding her with a level gaze. She turned away sharply and snapped an order to one of her aides. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Analysts long before the war had noted China’s intense interest in antisatellite technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>After the war was over, however, it turned out that what took out the US satellite system was not advanced technology but old-fashioned espionage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Chinese agents more than a decade earlier had managed to infiltrate the National Reconnaissance Office, the branch of the US intelligence community that managed the nation’s spy satellites, and data obtained by those agents enabled Chinese computer scientists to hack into the electronic system that controlled US military satellites in orbit and shut the whole network down, robbing US units around the world of their communications and reconnaissance capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Within minutes, cyberwarfare teams were at work, but it took them most of a day to get a first trickle of data coming in, and more than a week to get all the satellites fully operational again—and that was time the US invasion force no longer had. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Chinese technicians who had slipped into Tanzania in the months before the war had strict orders that no action was to be taken under any circumstances until the US began active hostilities. The terse radio message announcing the destruction of the northern radar stations removed that factor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The crews knew that they might only have minutes before American bombs began falling on them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their mission was precisely defined by the logic of “use it or lose it,” and so everything that had arrived in the shipping containers went into the air in well under ten minutes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Survivors’ accounts of what happened aboard the naval task force over the next hour are confused and in places contradictory, but apparently shipboard radars detected nearly a thousand targets suddenly airborne on the southwestern horizon. At least half of those were false echoes, electronic decoys produced by Chinese “spoofing” technology, and many of the remainder were physical decoys meant to draw fire away from the supersonic cruise missiles that constituted the real attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even by the most conservative estimates, though, there were at least 200 of the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The task force had some of the best antimissile defenses in the world, but naval strategists had determined decades beforehand that a sufficiently massive attack could be sure of getting through. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those cold mathematics worked themselves out in a chaos of explosions, burning fuel, floating debris, and dead and dying sailors and soldiers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of forty-one ships in the task force, three made it safely to harbor in Mombasa, and eight more—including one of the troopships—were able, despite damage, to fight their way to the Kenyan coast and get surviving crews and passengers ashore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The others were left shattered and burning, or went to the bottom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The fate of the three carriers was typical: the John F. Kennedy took three cruise missiles in close succession and sank with nearly all hands; the Ronald Reagan was hit by two, caught fire, and was abandoned by its crew; the George Washington was hit astern by one, staggered in toward the coast despite crippling damage to its steering systems, and ran onto a sandbar near the Kenyan shore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A Japanese news photographer on assignment snapped a picture of the abandoned ship—broken, ghostlike, the deck tilted nearly into the surf on one side—and that photograph, splashed over the media worldwide in the following days, became for many people the definitive image of the East African War. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>*</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Long before the George Washington reached its final resting place in the sands off Kilindini, US forces on the scene were doing their best to respond.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The loss of satellite intelligence did not prevent the launching points for the cruise missile attack from being spotted from the air by drones, and US fighters hurtled south to hammer them; only the orders that scattered each of the Chinese crews the moment their last cruise missile went up kept them from suffering horrific casualties, and as it was, more than a thousand Tanzanian civilians were killed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More than half the planes on the three carriers had taken off before the carriers were put out of action, furthermore, and those that made it safely to Kenyan territory were refueled and put to use immediately, carrying out punishing strikes against Tanzanian military and political targets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Back in Washington DC, President Weed ordered a media blackout on the disaster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His press secretary announced merely that the task force had been attacked by missiles, and that details would be coming later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That night, meeting with his advisers and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he reviewed what was known about the fate of the task force, frowned, and muttered an expletive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>“They bloodied our nose, no question,” he said. “If we cave in, though, we’re screwed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We’ve got to reinforce the troops in Kenya and proceed with the operation. I want a plan on my desk first thing tomorrow.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs that year was Admiral Roland Waite, a patrician New Englander with Navy ties going back to an ancestor who sailed with John Paul Jones. “You’ll have it, sir,” he said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“If I may suggest, though—”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The president motioned for him to continue. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“A plan for extracting our forces, sir.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just in case.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We can’t.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The president all at once looked older than his sixty years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“If we cave in, we’re screwed. The whole country is screwed.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The plan was on the president’s desk at 6 am: a sketchy but viable draft of an airlift operation, using most of the Pentagon’s available air transport capacity to get troops and supplies from Europe and the Persian Gulf to Kenya in a hurry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the time it reached the Oval Office, though, the unfolding situation had already rendered it hopelessly obsolete. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>*</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The planes took off from airbases in Central Asia as soon as word came that the enemy satellite network was disabled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A flurry of secret diplomacy in the months before the war had cleared flight paths through Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Iran, and positioned tankers for in-flight refueling in the latter country; Iranian civilians waved and cheered as the planes roared by, guessing their destination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As ships burned and sank off the Kenyan coast, six Chinese fighter wings were on their way to Tanzania, with more to follow. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Their route was not quite direct, since Tanzania was under heavy air attack by the Americans and thus could provide no safe airfields.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Instead, an airbase in the Chinese client state of South Sudan served as a final staging area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More shipping containers had ended up there, and some of the tight-lipped young men as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Fresh pilots climbed aboard the fighters, fuel tanks were topped up, aircrews loaded and armed weapons, and the first wave of the air counterattack hurtled southeast into Kenyan airspace. American radar crews on the ground misidentified them at first as friendly craft, delaying an effective response for a few minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The moment the newcomers began attack runs on one of the American airbases, though, that mistake was cleared up, and US fighters already in the air pounced on the Chinese fighters while those on the ground roared up to join the fight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
An hour into the air battle, the American commanders on the scene and in the Persian Gulf were clear on three things. The first was that the planes and their pilots were Chinese, even though every plane had had the red star of the Peoples Liberation Army Air Force carefully painted over with the green roundel and white torch of the Tanzanian Air Force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The second was that, at least at the moment, the Chinese had the advantage of numbers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That was less of a problem than it might have been, since the US had plenty of fighter wings available to join the conflict, and four more were already being shifted to Persian Gulf airfields within striking distance of the combat zone. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The third realization, though, was the troubling one: the Chinese pilots were at least as good as their American counterparts, and their planes were better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Both US fighter wings in Kenya flew the F-35 Lightning II, the much ballyhooed Joint Strike Fighter, which had been designed to fill every possible fighter role in the NATO air services. That overambitious goal meant that too many compromises had been packed into one airframe, and the result was a plane that was not well suited to any of its assigned missions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The Chinese J-20s had no such drawbacks; faster and more heavily armed than the F-35s, they had a single role as a long-range air superiority fighter and they carried it out with aplomb.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the end of the first day, though both sides had been bloodied, US losses were nearly half again those of the Chinese force.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
News of the arrival of the Chinese fighters forced the plans for resupplying the four US divisions in Kenya by air into indefinite hold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Until we have air superiority back,” the Secretary of Defense explained to Weed and the other members of the team, “there are hard limits to what we can do. Even if we send them with fighter cover, the big transports are sitting ducks for their air-to-air missiles.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The president nodded. “How soon can we expect to retake control of the air?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Within a week, if everything goes well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve got four fighter wings on the way in tomorrow, and four more following them in two days.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“What about the airbases in South Sudan?” the president’s national security adviser asked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Those should get hit, hard.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That would mean,” the Secretary said, picking his words carefully, “widening the war to include another Chinese ally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Maybe more than one, if the other African countries in their camp get involved.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“They’re already in,” President Weed growled. “Diego Garcia’s in range; I want a B-52 strike on the South Sudan bases as soon as possible.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>*</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Two days later, a mob sacked the US Embassy in South Sudan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The staff barely escaped by helicopter from the roof.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The B-52 raids the night before had cratered one of the two Chinese airbases, but also flattened two nearby villages and killed several hundred people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Across Africa, Chinese allies took turns denouncing America’s actions in East Africa and threatening war against Kenya, while the few remaining American allies lay low. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The denunciations were for show.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The real decision had been made more than three months earlier, as Tanzanian and Chinese diplomats made secret visits to half a dozen Chinese-allied nations in Africa, explaining what America was about to do and why it mattered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The prospect of a Chinese military response made a difference this time; so did China’s offer to cover the costs of the plan being proposed; so did the cold awareness, inescapable as one head of state after another stared at maps and briefing papers, that if the Americans overwhelmed Tanzania, any of China’s other African allies might be next.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One after another, they signed onto the plan, and began an indirect process of troop movements.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As news media flashed word of the South Sudan riots around the world, accordingly, the ambassador from Tanzania presented himself at the Kenyan presidential palace to deliver a note.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Despite the studied courtesies with which it was delivered, the note was blunt. Since Kenya had allowed a hostile power to use its territory and airspace to attack Tanzania, it stated, the Tanzanian government was declaring war on Kenya—and over the next few hours, six other African nations did the same.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Three hours before dawn the next morning, an artillery bombardment silenced the animal and bird sounds of the coastal forest on the Tanzania-Kenya border, some fifty miles south of Mombasa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Tanzanian troops surged over the border at first light, backed by the first contingents from the other members of the Chinese-supported coalition and by a wave of Chinese ground-attack aircraft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By day’s end, forward scouts riding the armed light trucks that African armies call “technicals” were halfway to Mombasa, Kenya’s second city and largest port. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That night, Kenyan and American military officials held a hastily called meeting in Nairobi, chaired by the Kenyan president. The original American plan of action was fit only for the shredders, everyone recognized that, and the issue at stake now was not the liberation of Tanzania but the survival of the US-friendly Kenyan government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The next morning, after hurried consultations with Washington via the secure diplomatic line from the US embassy, the four American divisions left their bases and headed toward Mombasa, running up against Coalition forces two days later. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Under normal circumstances, the US forces would likely have seized the advantage and the victory, but these were not normal circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The air war continued, but the Chinese edge was widening; the US air bases in Kenya had been bombed repeatedly, and efforts to resupply them by air even at a minimal level were running into increasingly fierce Chinese fighter attacks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Furthemore, the four US divisions had only part of their normal equipment—the rest was at the bottom of the Indian Ocean—and the troops they were facing included seasoned veterans of some of Africa’s most bitter wars.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The major issue, however, was air superiority.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The US military had made air superiority so central to its military doctrine, and had achieved it so consistently in past campaigns, that nobody had any clear idea how to fight and win a battle without it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Generals who were used to aerial reconnaissance and lieutenants who were used to being able to call in air strikes were both left floundering when these and many other mainstays of the American way of combat were no longer available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the Chinese pressed their control of the air further and ferried in more ground-attack aircraft, US forces had to face the unfamiliar threat of air strikes, and US generals had to cope with the fact that it was their movements that were being spotted from the air. Finally, there was the impact on morale: troops who had been taught nearly from their first days in boot camp that air superiority guaranteed victory were unprepared to fight against an enemy that had taken air superiority away from them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Which of the many factors decided the Battle of Mombasa remains an issue for military historians. Still, the results were not in doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After a week of hard fighting, Coalition forces took Mombasa and began to advance up the main highway toward Nairobi, while the battered US divisions and their Kenyan allies retreated before them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Kenyan president fled to Kisumu, in the far west of the country, with his mistress and his cabinet. Jets still screamed south from US bases in the Persian Gulf to tangle with Chinese fighters based in half a dozen African countries, and land-based cruise missiles and B-52s from Diego Garcia pounded anything that looked vaguely like a military target, but it was hard for anyone to miss the fact that the US was losing the war. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

****************</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: large">End of the World of the Week #43</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Speaking of cod theories involving lots of ice—the theme of last week’s failed apocalypse—any collection of predicted cataclysms that never quite managed to happen would be incomplete without a reference to the inimitable Hans H<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">ö</span>rbiger and his Welteislehre or World Ice Theory. H<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">ö</span>rbiger<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>was a brilliant Austrian engineer whose mechanical inventions made him a well-earned fortune, but like many another engineer, his ability to figure out ingenious mechanical devices did not translate into a capacity for critical analysis of his own scientific theories.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The World Ice Theory is among the more complex of alternative cosmologies, and no attempt will be made here to summarize it in any detail. The important thing to have in mind, for our purposes, is that space is full of ice. The Milky Way isn’t a galaxy full of stars, it’s a vast cloud of chunks of ice, and they’re all spiralling slowly inwards...toward us. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Moon is one of the blocks of ice. It’s not the first Moon the Earth has had, either. Every so often the Earth’s gravity captures a big chunk of ice, which then proceeds to spiral inwards until it finally disintegrates and bombards the Earth with ice-meteors, causing vast destruction followed by equally vast floods. That’s what killed the dinosaurs, and the most recent moon of ice broke up recently enough that myths and legends are full of garbled references to the cataclysm. What’s more, the current Moon is very close, and someday soon it will break up in its turn, obliterating our civilization. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
H<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">ö</span>rbiger’s theory first saw print in his book <i>Glazial-Cosmogonie</i> in 1913, and between the two world wars it was extremely popular. It still retains a following today, even though astronauts have been on the Moon and found that it was a ball of rock, not ice. </div>

It is a very fast paced story and I'm enjoying the minimal dialogue whilst you concentrate on providing us with a ripping yarn. The story oozes of over confidence and hubris. What do they say, “act in haste and repent at leisure”?<br><br>I'm reading Jared Diamond's book, "Collapse" at the moment and am about a third of the way through.<br><br>As a general observation of the book so far, Jared suffers a bit from the Gore phenomenon, except that he seems to be looking down on it all from the lofty heights of academia and basically in the meantime going about in the real world doing whatever he pleases. I may be wrong in this assessment and only time will tell as I progress further through the book. No disrespect to him, it is merely an observation that bugs me and I could not have written that book.<br><br>Back to your story though as the previous reference to the book "Collapse" actually does relate.<br><br>For your interest, it appears that the Vikings were at first traders and then shortly switched to the more profitable industry of raiders. Once transport routes and suitable targets were identified, it became only a quick change of plan and marshalling some resources. This is a similar tale to the Chinese in your story is it not?<br><br>That game can be played by anyone though and I came across this article in Rolling Stone Magazine about the prior activities of your GOP presidential candidate in his days at Bain capital in the pursuit of leveraged buyouts:<br><br><a href=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/greed-and-debt-the-true-story-of-mitt-romney-and-bain-capital-20120829 rel=nofollow>Greed and debt the true story of Mitt Romney and Bain capital</a><br><br>It is a sad state of affairs when such an article is published in Rolling Stone magazine than in the major tabloids. Still it shows anyone can move from a trader to a raider given the right circumstances and incentives. This private equity firm stuff goes on here too and I worked for a while at a major manufacturer (who no longer manufactures) whilst it appeared that exactly this scenario went on in the background. So many people were put out of work...<br><br>Incidentally, the US leaders in your story have clearly forgotten the long term objectives in their quest for prestige and short term goals. This is symptomatic of our current society and I've seen many references to such thinking in the actions of many of the societies leaders discussed in the "Collapse" book. It didn't lead anywhere nice. Was it my impression or did Jared really seem to overly relish retelling the tales of cannibalism? Perhaps as a mostly vegetarian I am overly sensitive to such things?<br><br>Anyway, my favourite paragraph so far was, "Easter's chiefs and priests had previously justified their elite status by claiming relationship to the gods, and by promising to deliver prosperity and bountiful harvests. They buttressed that ideology by monumental architecture and ceremonies designed to impress the masses, and made possible by food surpluses extracted from the masses. As their promises were being proved increasingly hollow, the power of the chiefs and priests was overthrown around 1860 by military leaders called <i>matatoa</i>, and Easter's formerly complex integrated society collapsed in an epidemic of civil war".<br><br>The promises of the chiefs and priests sound chillingly like a political sound bite from a politician today.<br><br>Can't wait to see where your story ends!<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c2145040254601472926 title="comment permalink">10/11/12, 4:10 AM</a><br><br>

I share your belief that the US Empire is crumbling and is likely to crash hard in the next decade or two, most likely from a combination of military and economic forces. However, I think one has to be wary of attributing too much competence to China and the Chinese. Don't forget how everyone feared that Japan was going to take over the world in the 80s (Black Rain anyone?) and now they're the sick man of Asia: a stagnant aging economy that cannot even maintain control over a few rocks in the South China Sea. <br><br>Don't forget how rife China is with corruption; how saddled they are with an entrenched and self-serving elite; how much the average Chinese person would much rather make money than war; and how China will be hit as hard as anyone else by resource limitations. Yes, if China successfully teamed up with Russia and, say, Iran, they might be able to take down the States militarily. But, on their own, as they are now or will be in 10 years, I don't see it. <br><br>I'm not sure where you are heading with this and I eagerly await your next installment, but I do have to say this: since it is almost inevitable that America will elect some loose-cannon right-wing fascist to the presidency as the economy continues to disintegrate, the willingness of the nation to rain down nukes on any potential adversary increases as we go forward, and I don't think the Chinese would be unaware of this. So, unless you have some plot twist in which they also hack into America's network of ICBMs, subs and tactical nukes, I don't see the Chinese being foolish enough to engage the States in a hot war any time soon. <br><br>All that said, I'm all ears and my mind is open.

A good friend of mine used to work at an Air Force base whose sole purpose was to communicate and control spy satellites. He related to me this real life incident:<br><br>Military satellites use low polar orbits. When you look at the night sky and see a bright spot slowly crossing from North to South or visa versa, you are seeing a spy satellite. The orbits take less than 90 minutes, and as the world turns on it’s axis the ground moves laterally under the satellite orbit so the satellite effectively sees every square mile of the earth in a 24 hour period. The view from these close orbits is good enough so that these spy tools, which are essentially Hubble Space Telescopes pointing down at the ground, can identify what brand of cigarette pack a person is holding. On an individual basis though, a satellite’s view of a particular spot of ground is only available for about 20 minutes as both the satellite and the Earth turns. There is a whole fleet of them up there, switching from one satellite to the next to maintain surveillance of a particular spot. <br><br>At the time of my friends experience, communication with each satellite was direct, and thus limited to that 20 minute window. A password would be sent to the satellite to trigger data retrieval, and then before communication was interrupted by the orbit a new password would be sent up to be triggered for the next orbit. Each password would time out in 90 minutes, so you gave it a new password or that’s the end of it. This was a very secure procedure to prevent highjacking of the satellite. However, the new passwords where generated in a physically different location in the building and carried by handcuffed briefcase every 90 minutes. Distributing authority this way also increased internal security. <br><br>One day there was a general alert in the building. The base security chief decided to have his crew run a surprise security sweep of the building. They were stopping everyone and requiring identification verification. The fellow carrying the security code for a particular satellite had inadvertently left his badge on his desk. The security guards assumed the worst and hauled him off, handcuffed briefcase and all, to a detention room and began grilling him. Meanwhile, the control room goes into a panic because they don’t have the code to the satellite and if they don’t get it before it goes over the horizon, they will forever loose contact with a $100M+ piece of hardware.

And we're all amateurs speculating into the wind, even the professionals. :) <br><br>That being said, my own take. <br><br>Knocking out three carriers feels optimistic. Yeah, we have the example of Midway but it feels a little too yay, Clancy! on behalf of the Chinese, weapons working just as well as advertized in the sales brochure. Granted, going into the exact details of what happened blows this up from a blog post to a techno-thriller novel. How were we ignorant of Chinese weapons capabilities, now did we miss the movements, how did we leave ourselves so exposed, etc. <br><br>All that aside, the question of logics would be key here, even more important than the results of the initial battle. As mentioned above, Guadalcanal -- two industrial powers fighting at the end of long logistic supply chains. The US could not effectively embargo Vietnam due to political reasons. China could not have pre-positioned sufficient weapons and supplies to fight with what they have in-country. Both parties will have to run long supply chains to keep the war going. <br><br>Oh, another comparison, North Africa in WWII. Rommel had the Allies' number there but was constantly hampered by a lack of supplies. Different scenario from the war in Europe where the Nazis were pushing supplies through occupied-if-not-friendly territory. Aerial interdiction hurt but ships are a lot easier to stop than trucks and peasants pushing bicycles. Both the US and China have sea lanes to control. And if the Chinese have decent-enough subs, they could have the US running around in circles trying to protect the convoys. <br><br>And this then brings about the next question of strategic goals. The war we're talking about here is really the biggest we've had since WWII. It's potentially a Korea Part 2. <br><br>We know what the US wants: break some third-world heads, cheap oil, USA! USA! <br><br>Why does China want? What do they expect to happen? They're turning a US smash and grab operation into a major international crisis. My druthers would have their reason for starting the war be a terrible mistake, the results being two gunfighters managing to fatally wound each other, bleeding out in the street. <br><br>The Japanese thought that the Westerners would accept defeat in WWII. The high command was convinced they could knock the US out of the war with a few swift blows and that would be that. Wargammers and staff college professors with access to archives and capabilities and studies of both sides have tried for years to figure out a way the Japanese could have won WWII and it just doesn't seem possible. Start a war they can't win, obviously. Hurt the US even more than they did in reality, make the war last a few more years? Yes. Force the US out of the war through sheer dint of fighting? No. <br><br>So I assume the Chinese guess is the US would be bloodied and humbled and forced to give up the fight, international pressure and the like. Accept our losses because the next step would be escalation and the potential there is doubling down and putting a whole lot more at risk. <br><br>Ugh. Keep coming back to the thought the Chinese are making a shrewd and cunning mistake to match the imperialist hubris of the Americans. A bad time will be had by all. India will emerge as a regional superpower in the aftermath.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c5001761237975229838 title="comment permalink">10/11/12, 12:37 PM</a><br><br>

Certainly if there's a plan of enriching themselves serving the rival they plan to topple, this would factor into their thinking. <br><br>But really stupid, idiotic miscalculations are incredibly possible. If WWII was a novel, I would be tearing the author a new one for handing Hitler the idiot ball and invading Russia. "Look, you wrote this guy as a shrewd operator! He went from nothing to running a nation. He's got military experience. Sure, he's also got an irrational hatred of the Jews but he needs to make a more subtle mistake than this. Even if he does believe the Russians are a rotting shed waiting to collapse when the door is kicked in, he's going to want to finish taking out the UK before opening another front in the war. He leaves the UK intact, that's ready staging base for continental invasion if the US ever gets dragged in. And you know FDR wants to with the lend-lease stuff, all he needs is an opportunity." <br><br>The trick to writing a proper mistake in fiction is you need to be convinced that the character can sincerely make a bad decision, either because his judgment is clouded or because the facts available to him are too muddy to clearly see what's actually occurring. Especially tragic when the reader does have those facts at hand.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c7999161172521427847 title="comment permalink">10/11/12, 12:46 PM</a><br><br>

It's very popular to assume that the corporations have all the power, but every so often you get to see where the real power is, and it's political and military. The oil companies sell oil as cheaply as they can in the US because it's a political necessity to the US government that they do so, and the US government has ample formal and informal means of making sure the oil companies do as they're told. <br><br>DeAnander, that's no joke.

I find it both fascinating and entertaining--though it would be far from entertaining in real life, of course.<br><br>I actually had plans to get some fiction-writing done this summer, but then the craziness of gardening and farming and other such things interrupted those plans. Still, I don't regret allowing those activities to take over my focus; it's been a productive summer. In fact, I've managed to get over 100 jars of food canned up over the last month or so, both for my own winter eating and for Christmas gifts. Blackberry jam and syrup, tomato puree, tomato jam, apple sauce and butter, salsa, pickles, pickled beans. Plus, the hoop house is still pumping out tomatoes, peppers, eggplant and cucumbers and I'm hoping to get more salsa, tomato puree, apple sauce and pickled peppers canned. It feels so good to be putting all this food away!<br><br>I'm also highly anticipating winter, though. I don't know if you've heard, but it's been an unusually dry summer here in the Northwest after our wet spring. Portland actually set a record--only a quarter inch of rain from July through September. We've gotten a touch more out here on the north coast, but not much. Maybe an inch. The rain's finally supposed to hit tomorrow and I have to say that I'm really looking forward to it. It's gotten to the point that quite a number of my friends out here are actually anticipating rainy weather. And they haven't even had to look at and worry about the barely-trickling creek that provides our water out here or eyeball the dried out pastures that means more hay-feeding than normal here on the farm I'm living on. We get 90-100 inches of rain here annually, and yet it still only takes a couple months of no rain to put you on the edge. It never ceases to amaze me that so many people in our society don't understand just how little control we really do have and just how quickly and easily nature can smack us down.<br><br>Anyway, it's fun to have you back writing. It's helped inspire me to return to my own blog now that things are starting to vaguely slow down. I'm looking forward to a good winter of thought, writing, and reading. (And some work, of course!) I'm excited to see how your story plays out.<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c5797360868937337901 title="comment permalink">10/11/12, 1:50 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks for the link. Haven't really been reading on US elections. They seem pretty meaningless for americans themselves, so it's natural that they mean even less for people outside the borders.<br><br>To the people that compared this scenario to Vietnam or the pacific campaign in WW II:<br><br>While there were political constraints on the way the war was fought by the US forces there, and they certainly influenced the outcome, there was ALSO a constraint on the communist side. Or do you think the USA would have managed to hold on Vietnam if the PLA came streaming over the border in large numbers? Or the russians sent a couple of attack subs into the Gulf of Tonkin to play a little hide and seek game witht he US carriers conveniently parked there? The scenario proposed here is one where the gloves are off, for the most part. The closest thing that came to that was Korea, and while the US managed to hold off a communist takeover, the result there was basically a return to status quo.<br><br>About WWII, that's a very flawed comparisson, IMO. It's like saying that because the Gauls were devastated by Julius Ceasar it would be unthinkable that the much more barbaric germans would have any chance against Rome. The situations are different. In WWII the USA was probably at the peak of its productivity, wealth (including oil and other natural resources) and probably also on more intangible things like a cohesive political system and national identity. None of those things are present anymore. <br><br>As for why the chinese would pick a fight, meh, that's like asking why war exists in the first place. It's rarely "in the best interest" of anyone to go to war, and even so we do. Why did the europpean contries decided to pound each other to rubble into WW I, ending a three century long streak of europpean dominance over the world? And do the same thing again 20 years later?<br><br>While I think the military details are a bit skewed here and there (not that much, though), and it is much more plausible that something like this will happen somewhere in the Middle East (possibly with Israel in place of "Kenya", and getting equally invaded by it's neighboors after the US is forced to leave), the piece reads like eery foreboding. I expect to see something resembling this happening in my life time (I'm 29, so there's some time). <br><br>I think reading about ALL sorts of empires and their fall is necessary to gain a proper perspective, since applaying lessons from just one or two cases, however instructive, is a flawed methodology because, well, the USA is note Rome or somesuch, but all empires have stuff in common. For example, I think that for this immediate situation, the paralelles of the Spanish Empire are enlightening. It managed to get diplomatically isolated and picking quarrels with almost everyone at one time or another (usually winning), until there was a confluence of bad events and overreaching that managed to crack it's aura of invencibility and then it was a very quick and steep fall, as everyone else piled on to kick the proverbial man down. <br><br>In JMG's scenario, for example, I would expect that things would escalate, at diplomatically, if not military. Russia and Iran would probably side with China over this. India would be a wild card. As JMG's wrote, there would be a lot of african chinese client states willing to side with the guys who appear to be winning. It's doubtful that Europe or Japan would contribute materially to a US blunder like that, and after it NATO would possibly go to the same trash bin where the Entente and the Warsaw Pact are.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c5588527506287982056 title="comment permalink">10/11/12, 2:09 PM</a><br><br>

From the earlier comments, it sounds like you have. I'm looking forward to the religious meditations book, to go with the handbook of rituals for meetings you've already given us. That was very useful.<br><br>While I recognize that this is fiction, do you think that the collapse of American power is likely to be so bald and obvious as this?

It will probably dismember itself in a few parts (same as the USSR), it will NOT go crazy and detonate nuclear weapons but it will descent into a period of chaos and really bad economy until some kind of strongman (think Putin) pulls the contry (or the parts of it that are not totally seceded) somewhat together, minus the empire side of things, and we go from there to a more distant future, where my magic eight ball has no powers. Meriga doesn't sound implausible in the long run :)<br><br>Lastly, also aimed at the WWII comparissons: The way the US military is geared today it would be impossible for it to sustain a "hot" war with someone that manages to fight in the same league as itself. Even discarding casualities and destroyed equipment, the sheer ammount of ammunition that would be spent would deplete the US stockpile quite rapidly. And the kind of equipment that gives the US it's qualitative edge can not be manufactured in a emergency to fill the voids. Specially not if the US loses acess to strategic materials, there's a lack of funds, etc. Even if the country somehow made a very desperate effort at producing stuff quickly and there was wild popular support for a foreign war (doubtful), by necessity the kind of equipment that could be produced quickly would be of much inferior quality and much more old fashioned. <br><br>Nowadays, the USA has 187 modern air superiority fighters (F-22's). Well, not all of them are operational yet, but this is a pretty firm number. But there's no budget for anymore of those. There's still some 230 F-15's, but they are getting reaaaally old, and are supposed to be swapped with the new F-35. The USAF received a total of a little over 1.100 F-15's of all variants troughout it's 20 year production run, just to give a sense of scale. The F-35 itself, though produced in bigger numbers, will be available (even without any further cuts in it's projected number) in much smaller numbers then the array of planes it's supposed to take over. There's a grand total of 20 B-2's. There's no plane to take over the heavy bomber role from the B-52's. <br><br>Just regullar attritional losses due to carrying multiple sorties would put a lot of strain on those fighter numbers, without a single loss to enemy action. With the kind of commitments the USA has, I don't think it can lose much more then a 150 planes or so before things become totally unmanageable. And, like I said, they are not easily or quickly replacable, and without them, bye-bye the empire game. The US doesn't know how to project force without them. <br><br>It's the same math that faced the spanish tercios, really. Even if they will every battle and kill 5 guys for every one of theirs that dies, they can't replace them. Specially at the same level of competence. And that's not even counting someone else evening the odds...<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c4255461264228075118 title="comment permalink">10/11/12, 2:32 PM</a><br><br>

In addition, the US would have all kinds of short-range aircraft and missiles to fire at China from its own ample set of bases ringing China during all the African events. <br><br>The US could easily have used these resources to execute a successful nuclear first strike against all China's nuclear capabilities (which are in fact quite minimal) while the Chinese were focusing their attention on events in and around Kenya. China would then be finished permanently as any kind of serious projective military threat. They would have won the battle in Kenya, and inflicted substantial military losses on the US, but they would have lost essentially all their own in the process.<br><br>Also, I think it is wrong to assume that the Americans are idiots compared to the Chinese when it comes to the ins and outs of cyberwarfare, or in general when it comes to the matter of military strategy and tactics. On the contrary, I think there is good reason to assume that the US is the world leader in the field of cyberwarfare and computer security in particular. It certainly is a very hot employment field at this time in the DC area, and the US has a long history of cutting-edge leadership in the most advanced forms of electronics and computer wizardry. Thus, the very premise of your scenario on the basis of which the Chinese are able to inflict serious damage on the US in the first place is highly questionable.<br><br>Further, I think it is simplistic to suppose that US intelligence agencies would be completely oblivious to the large-scale secret buildup of Chinese fire power within Kenya in the manner you describe. These things in the shipping containers would all first need to be produced, and I have little doubt that US intelligence has the capacity to keep a close watch not just on production, but also on subsequent deployment. Surely they wouldn't just lose track and forget about all that stuff in the manner your scenario presupposes.<br><br>What’s more, for every high level Chinese mole in the US, why shouldn’t there be a corresponding high level US mole in China, telegraphing key strategic decisions, software weaknesses, and so on, to the US?<br><br>In short, the Chinese may be very smart, but that neither implies that they aren't seriously outgunned by the US (which in fact they are - to the point that the US could easily take out their entire nuclear arsenal in a first strike without threat of reprisal), nor does it imply that the US is any less smart than the Chinese in using their own military capabilities<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c5564602597295854406 title="comment permalink">10/11/12, 3:04 PM</a><br><br>

It's one thing to wave around abstractions about military power (as Nestorian, just below your comment, does), and quite another to check the numbers and realize how poorly prepared the US is for any kind of serious war. <br><br>Nestorian, er, you've been reading way too many Pentagon press releases (or Tom Clancy novels, which amounts to the same thing).

In your wet dreams -- the Chinese would be on high alert, and the moment their radars and satellites picked up the sign of our SLBMs, a whole bunch of Long March 4s would head skyward.

I think you miss my point. I wasn't saying that China was incapable of turning into a world empire. They're presently in the process of doing so. However, I'd take issue with one of your rebuttals of my argument. I said that corruption, an entrenched elite, a populace more concerned with money than war, and resource limits would work against Chinese imperial ambitions. You dismissed my comment by saying that none of those things stopped the United States from becoming an empire at the start of the 20th century. Well, first, the US wasn't facing resource limits at the start of the 20th century. I also argued that China would be put off by the threat of nuclear retaliation by the US. <br><br>But, this is beside the point. I wasn't arguing that China cannot become a world empire. I was arguing that they cannot defeat the US in a hot war (not anytime soon). I think you are too quick to dismiss posts like mine and Nestorian. A rigid unwillingness to listen to reasonable criticism is not the hallmark of a true (or truth) seeker. <br><br>In shooting down Nestorian's post, you argued that the Chinese "arsenal" of Long March missiles would quickly overwhelm America's ICBM network. Really? Do you know the numbers each side has? Furthermore, do you recall the existence of America's nuclear-armed subs, as well as nukes that can be deployed from bombers? <br><br>I'm loving your story and can't wait for the next installment, but I'd counsel adopting a somewhat less dogmatic approach to input that doesn't jibe with your opinion. Have a look at some of China's failed cities, their incredible rates of corruption and things like the recent train crash they had before painting the Chinese as infallible geniuses.

So I disagree with you; deal. <br><br>As for Nestorius and his ICBMs, er, are you under the impression that ICBMs somehow cancel each other out? If the US launches a thousand missiles and China launches a hundred, the US still gets hit with a hundred missiles, which would be quite enough to cripple us economically and militarily for quite a while. That's why the US didn't chuck nukes at China during Korea or at Russia during Vietnam, you know -- even if you do more damage to the other side than they do to you, the cost to your own nation and its infrastructure is so massive that it's not worth doing.

There's no telling how wrong things will go but I note that weapons and tactics developed between wars tend to encounter rude surprises when the wars start. <br><br>I'm curious to see how the Chinese imagine the war will go and what actually happens. I tend to fear intense escalation but that is no guartantee. I didn't think the ussr could fall without things going nuclear and I was obviously wrong. <br><br>I'm thinking of how Iraq was sold to us. Yay, patriotism. The thing I don't know is if the secret war aim was to get the oil and it all screwed up or if the only goal was to start a war and make some bucks and the damage done to the US wasn't even a consideration. Rather than Machiavelli pulling off something worthy of a moustsche twirl its more like mafia parasites destroying a business for profit. <br><br>While I'm sure the details will have quibble room, a mass missile attack from onshore launchers against carriers is pretty much my go-to scenario for the next great American defeat. If they could fit these things with extended range tanks, there's no need for a bomber fleet or missile sub to carry them within range. Give them a 2000 mile range, good search radar, there's no way the US could locate all the possible launchers. The only question is ensuring that there is total saturation of the defenses. Even one serious missile hitting a carrier could be a mission kill, flight operations over, return to port. And after the first time that happens, carriers have to be kept so far offshore as to be useles.

One must reckon with the likelihood that the US would take this step in the course of the kind of crisis you describe as soon as they had reason to believe the Chinese were in the beginning stages of the laborious and lengthy process of getting their missiles ready for launch.

You have indeed pointed this out many times before; may I ask, which do you think is the biggest factor that makes the utopian survival camp meme a mere fantasy and nothing more? Is it the practical challenges such as the fact that actaully providing for 100% of your own needs takes skill most americans don't have and can't just learn overnight, despite how "easy" it all sounds. Or do you think the social factor matters more, or the fact that having a utopian community where many people live together holding everything in common and functioning perfectly without any formal authority and structure is nothing more than a fantasy; this is ironically coupled with the fact that the very people who most desperately would want to escape society to live in a utopia of their own are the very people whose personality problems currently impede their functioning in society and those same personality problems will prove to be even more disruptive in a utopian community with no formal structure or authority in it. Therefore, these people are even less likely to exist contently in an isolated surival camp than they would in mainstream society.<br><br>Good work, keep it up.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c7626823050546925498 title="comment permalink">10/12/12, 8:34 AM</a><br><br>

For those who don't know, Ambrose is what I would consider a very mainstream US historian - he was at the University of New Orleans. Anyway, during the latter part of the Vietnam War, some Air Force general suggested dropping a nuclear weapon on Hanoi to bring the North Vietnamese to terms. Quoting Ambrose (from memory - should be close): "If the US had done that, most likely the Chinese would have dropped a nuclear weapon on Saigon. What would happen next was anybody's guess, but no one, not even Richard Nixon, wanted to find out."<br><br>Mr. Greer, I was expecting some infrastructure warfare to be part of your scenario. I've thought for some time now that infrastructure will be one of the next battlefields. Indeed, if you combine nuclear and infrastructure warfare, and imagine nuclear targeting of key infrastructure sites, you quickly realize just how few weapons it would take to render the East Coast, for instance, without electricity, water, or fuel. <br><br>Furthemore regarding nuclear weapons, apparently the Chinese are making efforts to upgrade their missle arnsenals (http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/capabilities/china-cdi.htm). So while today their long range missles might require a lengthy preparation process, that may no longer be true in a very short time.<br><br>Personally, I think the belief that any nuclear power can successfully launch a first strike and get away clean is very dangerous idea. Hopefully there are strategic thinkers in the military in all countries who would disabuse the politicians of such ideas.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c1614127136105327238 title="comment permalink">10/12/12, 9:16 AM</a><br><br>

I think that to make your scenario realistic, you have the burden of proof of demonstrating that the Chinese could actually pull something like that off - even though there is every reason to believe that US intelligence has the capacity to carefully monitor all of their manufacturing activity and military deployments. </i><br><br>Intelligence screwups remain highly realistic. Several classic blunders have been mentioned above. <br><br>I look at scenarios the same way cops look at crimes: means, motive, opportunity. <br><br>A Red Dawn scenario is a non-starter. There's no possible way to imagine the Russians or anyone else capable of invading the United States. If you want to tell a story about Americans becoming insurgents, it will have to be a civil war situation. The remake of the movie changed the invaders to Chinese and then later North Koreans. Sorry, not happening. <br><br>JMG's scenario falls just within the bounds of means. I think the motive is still likely a miscalculation but it fits within the range of historic blunders we've seen before. Rockstar overdosing on drugs? No, when has that ever happened? Conservative religious figure undone by scandals involving sex and money? Who has ever heard of such a thing? <br><br>If there's already a significant amount of traffic between Chinese ports and the pending warzone, it would be difficult to notice the containers are not what they should be. The prepositioning of warplanes is disguised as part of a planned military exercise which is straight out of WWIII scenarios. Note: in actual history, the Russians were more than half-convinced our Able Archer exercises were cover for a decapitation first strike against them. Read up on it, pretty scary. <br><br>Like I said, if I were writing it I'd want one carrier sunk outright, one crippled and limping back to port, one partially-damaged and carrying the survivors that made it into the air from the other two. Several of the escort ships would have been hit and destroyed. This just makes the defeat more protracted and painful and also gives the president more to worry about: keep the carrier in the fight and risk destruction in another attack? Bring it home with the survivors and leave the American troops unsupported? <br><br>The funny thing about techno-thriller novels is that they never ever EVER imagine the US getting defeated. I can only think of one techno-thriller featuring the defeat of the protagonist army and that was one written from the Soviet perspective!

From Wiki:<br><i>The Schlieffen Plan was the German General Staff's early 20th century overall strategic plan for victory in a possible future war in which the German Empire might find itself fighting on two fronts: France to the west and Russia to the east. The First World War later became such a war, with both a Western and an Eastern Front.<br><br>The plan took advantage of expected differences in the three countries' speed in preparing for war. In short, it was the German plan to avoid a two-front war by concentrating troops in the West and quickly defeating the French and then, if necessary, rushing those troops by rail to the East to face the Russians before they had time to mobilize fully. The Schlieffen Plan was created by Count Alfred von Schlieffen and modified by Helmuth von Moltke the Younger after Schlieffen's retirement; it was Moltke who actually implemented the plan at the outset of World War I. In modified form, it was executed to near victory in the first month of the war. However, the modifications to the original plan, a French counterattack on the outskirts of Paris (the Battle of the Marne) and surprisingly speedy Russian offensives ended the German offensive and resulted in years of trench warfare. The plan has been the subject of intense debate among historians and military scholars ever since. Schlieffen's last words were "remember to keep the right flank strong," which was significant in that Moltke strengthened the left flank in his modification.</i><br><br>Chinese opening move is devastating but follow-ups have problems and the two great war machines collide with each other and begin grinding themselves to pieces.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c5402414380270805568 title="comment permalink">10/12/12, 11:20 AM</a><br><br>

Keep in mind that the pre-positioning of all the various military means required to rapidly execute a successful first strike against the Chinese nuclear threat within a short range of the Chinese mainland is an abiding, everyday reality (via submarines, East Pacific carriers, close-in Asian military bases, strategic bombers approaching from the arctic, etc.) Keeping things that way is in fact one of the principal U.S. strategic objectives.<br><br>What's more, U.S. intelligence is surely in a position to detect clearly when the Chinese commence the lengthy, hours-to-days-long process required to fuel and prepare their few ICBMs for launch, and could give the signal for all the above resources to launch a devastating counterstrike that would hit the Chinese targets squarely within minutes - since, as I mentioned, most of the US assets I mentioned are pre-positioned within short range of the Chinese mainland as a matter of course. <br><br>Keep in mind also that, in stark contrast to all the short-range, trigger-ready weaponry the US keeps pointed toward China, China for its part has NO blue water navy, NO world class carrier groups, NO nuclear-armed submarines, NO string of military bases in client states located close to the US mainland, and just a relative handful of very outdated and very vulnerable ICBMs. They are thus not in a position to pose any serious short-range threat to the US mainland, and the only long-range threat they possess, their few ICBMs, are effectively useless given the relative balance of forces that prevails.<br><br>The US, on the other hand, has about a dozen world-class carrier groups, 18 or so state-of-the-art nuclear powered and nuclear armed submarines, pre-positioned state-of-the-art weaponry in South Korea, Japan, Iraq (don’t let the “withdrawal” propaganda fool you), Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Diego Garcia, one or more of the central Asian “’Stans,” etc. They don’t maintain 700 or so military bases around the world in a “lily-pad” type of system for nothing.<br><br>By the time an historical scenario such as you describe gets off the ground, there is a decent likelihood that the US will have in place a formidable space-based weapons threat as well. Granted, there is unquestionably a lot of waste in US military and intelligence spending, but they don’t get absolutely nothing out of it for spending nearly a trillion dollars a year on it either. <br><br>For all these reasons, the Chinese threat to LA would in fact be minimal to negligible under the conditions you describe, and the President's decision to eliminate Chinese nuclear capabilities would actually be fraught with minimal risk, and thus relatively easy to make if the stakes were sufficiently high (which they aren't yet, at the present historical juncture, but certainly would be under the kind of scenario you lay out).<br><br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c7839985552712976475 title="comment permalink">10/12/12, 11:35 AM</a><br><br>

I never received your earlier attempt to post the piece on a US nuclear first strike; that's why it didn't appear. I appreciate that you're willing to defend your viewpoint in a courteous and reasoned manner, unlike too many people on the internet; I think you're wrong, and that ideas such as yours may cause a great deal of unnecessary death down the road, but I see no reason to ask you to leave the conversation. <br><br>That being said, your information on the Chinese ballistic arsenal is, as Kieran points out a little further down, rather out of date. The Chinese are currently putting a great deal of money into modernizing their nuclear arsenal; the DF-31, their new mobile frontline missile, doesn't need hours or days to prepare for launch, and neither do their JL-2 SLBMs, which are in testing stage right now and should be fully operational by the time my scenario plays out. (They have one nuclear-armed submarine and are building more, by the way, so that's another place your facts are out of date.) There are also plenty of other ways to deliver a nuke -- my scenario of nukes sitting in storage lockers is only one of the options. <br><br>That's why nations don't use nukes: the price tag of even a minor retaliatory strike is far greater than anything a nation can gain by nuking an enemy. The value of nuclear weapons is as a threat, not as a functional weapons system -- a point that I plan on discussing in much more detail down the road a bit. <br><br>Robert, I've heard rumors about that. It would be fascinating to know just who has those nukes. <br><br>Kieran, many thanks for the data. This matches what I've found. <br><br>Phil, and of course that's the elephant in the living room of current geopolitics: nearly every other nation on earth would benefit significantly if something messy happened to the US. That's a very uncomfortable situation for a nation to be in, especially when it's headed for bankruptcy and dependent on an outdated military machine. <br><br>Lewis, I hope no US state is ever idiotic enough to allow such a thing to happen.

I find it highly plausible. As for the fighters on exercises, if you were writing this as a bigger novel, there would of course have to be a scene of a junior analyst correctly twigging that this is a little too convenient and his superior ignoring him. Shades of Tora, Tora, Tora. But since this is not meant to be a doorstop novel, I'll just imagine that went down. <br><br>@Nestorian <br>As for all the lovely weapons systems you mentioned, my fear is that we are supremely equipped to fight a war that isn't going to happen. <br><br>The fall of the Roman Empire is a complicated subject and not something to gloss over lightly but I keep flashing back to the BBC series I CLAVDIVS and Augustus Caesar screaming about wanting his eagles back. These eagles, of course, are the standards for his legions lost to German barbarians. Anyway, there's a whole series of posts on this blog about how invincible military systems became vincible. Note the points made about the economic systems those militaries exist to support. The United States is a maritime nation. We lose access to the sea, we are up a certain stream lacking for paddles. <br><br>The thing that never gets covered in techno-thrillers is the cost of supporting a military machine. You really need to play a proper game like Civilization to get an appreciation for the opportunity cost of arming up. You have to sacrifice on domestic improvements to field an impressive military and, as Eisenhower said, every bomber and bullet is a bridge and library not built. <br><br>You get a sense of this reading middle age histories as kings lament over the cost of putting an army in the field and lacking a decisive battle to make such an expense worthwhile. It costs money to project power and you can bleed your treasury even if there's not much blood to show for it. An enemy can bring you to ruin simply by making you preserve a force in the field. This is what we are seeing in Iraq and Afghanistan. There's no way either of those countries could have kicked us out by force but these occupations could not pay for themselves. <br><br>If you want another analogy, think of it like opening a new store in a territory. The company expects there to be a heavy capital investment at first but eventually that store needs to turn itself a profit. If not, the store needs closed because it is a terrible investment. This brings us back around to the wealth pump example as elaborated on at great length on this blog. <br><br>Point is, what are you going to do with all those weapons? If our economy is based on China, are we going to shoot them hard enough to put things back to the way they were before? If not, can we shoot other people hard enough to make them supply us the raw materials we need to bring all our manufacturing back to the US? And if we can't do either thing, how are we going to support our war machine? <br><br>Personally, I find the idea of war repugnant and there is at minimum one jerk. If it's a single aggressor, he's the jerk. Many wars have more than one. About the only just war I can think of is a defense against aggression, either for yourself or in the name of another. But that's often the coloring used to make a jerk's war look pretty. We went into Iraq as liberators, don't you know. Saddam was the jerk. We had to do it, he was a meanie.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c8703255341511393840 title="comment permalink">10/12/12, 5:49 PM</a><br><br>

It was also extremely common in Britain before 1914, when it was unthinkable to most Brits that the Royal Navy's battleships would be scrap metal in forty years. It's precisely because so many people believe so firmly in the myth of America's invulnerability that defeat, when it comes, will be so stunning a blow. <br><br>Dr. Omed, nuclear strategists I've read suggest that, rockets being the complicated objects they are, only about 60% of our missiles can be counted on to launch on order under the best of conditions, and not all those that do launch will get to their targets. Factor in aging systems and the other problems you've named, and the usefulness of nukes as anything but a threat becomes a very dubious point.

It is still too cold during October for the tomato seedlings which are still happily sprouting inside, but it’s all about in now. <br><br>Nature constantly reminds me that if you want to grow a large portion of your own produce then you really need a resilient system. This requires a lot of space, because today the summer vegetables went into the most fertile beds, whilst the winter vegetables were transplanted to another location so that they could go to seed. I'm finding that letting a lot of the vegetables and herbs go to seed is creating a huge seedling bank here, plus it is a lot less work in the long run.<br><br>So, I'm out there planting and transplanting and it occurred to me that in the story, the Chinese are actually doing the US a long term favour. Seriously, I'm not kidding. The loss of those carriers, plus aircraft, plus combat forces etc. in the story is actually a crash program of forced simplification on US society. This reduces the overall burden of maintenance of that military cost on a declining society.<br><br>Obviously, the ability of that society to extract resources from the rest of the planet also declines at this point too. <br><br>I expect that the loss of extraction benefits for the US would be greater though than the reduced demand for resources given your scenario. I don't know how it would roll, but I'm reasonably certain that you've already considered this aspect.<br><br>It would be interesting to know what the impact of a reduction in access to imported oil would be in the US? It would almost certainly impact the US food supply system - as it would here too. Very unpleasant.<br><br>The garden reminds me constantly how far beyond our environmental budget we live every day.

So, if it came down to war, the US cyber offensive wouldn't do much damage because there's not much to damage, but the Chinese effort would be in a target-rich environment. Same with satellites - since the Chinese don't field them as much while the US appears heavily dependent on them, wiping them all out would disproportionally hurt the US. <br><br>Regarding the possibility of an EMP strike, there's actually been an in-depth study of this - tax money well spent, IMHO: empcommission.org.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c3032075543479251055 title="comment permalink">10/13/12, 6:37 AM</a><br><br>

I agree with others that you have gone quite Chinese in this, but it is definitely inside the scope of possibilities. That said, I'm somewhat baffled by the lack of attacks to the US Persian gulf bases, with Iran as a friendly proxy so close and with the americans using them to assist their Quenian forces... or that is for the next chapters ? ;)<br><br>As everyone is talking about nuke deterence and whatever, I would like to remember a similar case: chemical weapons in WW II. If you don't remember their use is because they weren't used ;) and that is the point in question, since neither of the sides in WW I was shy on using them and all the participants in WW II has sizable stocks that were left pristine even when Germany attacked the USSR ( note that the germans argued that, as the USSR had not signed the Geneva convention, all weapons were fair against them ) and even when the Soviets were nearing Berlin ( "apres moi le deluge" was in vogue in the nazi elites in those days ).<br><br>So why weren't they used, even by people that considered their foes not human and by people that weren't shy of making cities to turn in fire tornados and nuclear mushrooms ? Your guess is as worthy as any other, but I remember reading a nice story that happened during "le drole de guerre" before the invasion of France. During that time the French captured ( "a little bit too easily", according to the source I read )a marauding group of German soldiers and noticed that brought gas masks with tampoons soaked in copper sulfate. Thinking that the Germans were on the verge of launching a gas attack that could only be stopped by copper sulfate, the French were quick to produce their own copper sulfate tampoons for their gas masks and to enforce their usage. A couple of days later, pretty much all of the French gas masks were corroded beyond repair by the copper sulfate ... and that was the German plan all along :p<br><br>(continues ... )<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c4670364731122179333 title="comment permalink">10/13/12, 7:41 AM</a><br><br>

In the nukes case, in spite of no one having a decent known counter ( all the "shields" so far proposed are really bad or worse ), there are massive uncertainties if you want to make a nuke attack against other country: the launch orders will work ? ( apparently the US ICBM launch system was never tested "in vivo" with more than one missile during the cold war (!!!) and I would bet that it was also not tested after it, so no one knows if the system can really handle mutiple launches even in it's best days ) The rockets will fire? Their guidance system will work good enough? The nuke bombers will get to the target area unharmed ? Will the enemy intercept them or the ICBM ? Will the nukes detonate ? Will the enemy retaliate fast enough? Has the enemy a " dead hand" mechanism? ( the Russians have it, so it would be reasonable to assume they aren't the only ones )? Can we intercept their nukes ? Their nukes will get to target and detonate ? Do they have smuggled nukes already in our land waiting to detonate ? ( that is huge concern for a place like the US with it's gigantic land and sea borders ). <br><br>All of this uncertainties ( and I politely removed the post nuke aftermath, like dealing with the destruction of infra and the popular reaction to a governement that let them get nuked in name of forsaken piece of land or sea ) add up really fast: even if you had a 95% chance on your side in all of the above ( and even today the US can't have it against China or anyone else in the nuke club ), 0,95^14 ( the chance you have a positive result after 14 positive eliminatory tests with a 95% sucess chance ) is already 0,48 , less than a flipping of a coin. Unless the reward in case of sucess is on the level of the punishment you get in case of failure or better, that is not a risk worth taking and normal cases the reward simply is not big enough ...<br><br>There is a reason with the game theory was invented mainly to assist nuke related decisions ;)<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c5062495484414382166 title="comment permalink">10/13/12, 7:46 AM</a><br><br>

Their usage complicates battlefield situation immensely, you have to protect your own troops which makes fighting very hard for them, other side also has this protection available, etc.<br><br>But maybe reasons were merely tactical: for example Germans relied heavily on horse transport in WW2, so using poison gas would cripple their own army. Or even personal quibbles: there's a story that German generals wanted to use poison gas at Stalingrad but Hitler refused. He was gassed in WW1 and found it problematic. As for the opposite side: Churchill wanted to 'drench Germany in poison gas' but his generals were against it. See http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v06/v06p501b_Weber.html<br><br>(I'll reproduce part of his memo here for its sheer bloody mindedness)<br><br>"I you to think very seriously over this question of poison gas," the four-page note began. Britain's wartime leader continued: "It is absurd to consider morality on this topic when everybody used it [gas] in the last war without a word of complaint from the moralists or the Church. On the other hand, in the last war the bombing of open cities was regarded as forbidden. Now everybody does it as a matter of course. It is simply a question of fashion changing as she does between long and short skirts for women."<br><br>Churchill's directive bluntly stated: "I want a cold-blooded calculation made as to how it would pay to use poison gas ... One really must not be bound within silly conventions of the mind whether they be those that ruled in the last war or those in reverse which rule in this." Specifically he proposed: "We could drench the cities of the Ruhr and many other cities in Germany in such a way that most of the population would be requiring constant medical attention ... It may be several weeks or even months before I shall ask you to drench Germany with poison gas, and if we do it, let us do it one hundred per cent. In the meantime, I want the matter studied in cold blood by sensible people and not by the particular set of psalm-singing uniformed defeatists which one runs across now here now here now there."<br><br>In closing, I don't think that apparent self-restraint on use of poison gas means that we'll see such restraint in the future. Even less that we'll see restraint in use of nuclear weapons. Compared to poison gas, they are much less unwieldy, incomparabily more lethal and there's no protection against them. Maybe the most important reason: they are present and operational in every conflict that USA participates in. That was never the case for poison gas.<br><br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c1139314824507458859 title="comment permalink">10/13/12, 12:33 PM</a><br><br>

Meaning that they will indeed cause terrible damage to the USA itself, but also that they will be used because their use will seem justified in political/military circles. With arguments not unlike the one Nestorian makes.<br><br>And when there is war, there is fog of war. It's frightening how close to nuclear war we've been during the Cuban missile crisis:<br><br>http://suite101.com/article/vasili-arkhipov-the-unsung-hero-who-prevented-nuclear-war-a411219<br><br>During the Cuban Missile Crisis Arkhipov was second-in-command of the Soviet Foxtrot-class submarine B-59 which was operating near Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. During the crisis -- clearly unaware of the fact that Soviet submarines operating in the area were carrying nuclear torpedos -- U.S. naval vessels dropped depth charges on those Soviet submarines in a bid to get them to surface so that they would not bypass the United States naval blockade on Cuba.<br><br>When they did so on the B-59 the captain Valentin Grigorievitch Savitsky believed that war had broken out and accordingly wanted to fire a nuclear torpedo at the vessels firing them on. The three officers who were authorized to launch this torpedo -- which included Arkhipov, the captain and the vessel's political officer Ivan Semonovich Maslennikov -- quickly reviewed their options. The captain and the political officer were in favour of firing. Arkhipov argued against launching the torpedo stating they should await orders from Moscow. They were forced to surface at the behest of the eleven U.S. Navy destroyers and the aircraft carrier that were engaging them. It was then they learned that no shooting war had broken out between the US and Soviet forces there, but by not launching the nuclear-tipped torpedo Arkhipov in effect had averted the starting of a nuclear war between the two superpowers."<br><br>(Anyone seen Crimson Tide ? Similar situation, with American nuclear submarine instead of Russian one.)<br><br>As for hidden nuclear bombs in cities and extortion: I wouldn't do it if I were Chinese. If 9/11 is any indication there would be hysterical popular support for nuking the whole world if one American city goes down in a mushroom cloud. Sadly, this also makes it an attractive false flag operation.<br><br>WRT Sir John Hackett: he had placed initial CCCP incursion which starts WW3 into former Yugoslavia, and my (very small) birth town right into the first page of the book. This propechy of his was a popular feature during annual Day of the Fools (not to be confused with Fools day) celebration for several years before and after 1985. One of national newspapers had also published excerpts from the book for the laughs.<br><br>I was in primary school when reading these, but one of the things which seemed dangerously implausible to me even then was the idea of limited nuclear war. It seemed very clear to me that you can't contain nuclear genie in conventional warfare bottle. But military experts (who fought in real wars) and political leaders obviously thought they could.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c8537464686606373832 title="comment permalink">10/13/12, 12:36 PM</a><br><br>

A statistic I ran across recently was that if the US was to do blazingly well and attained a 3.5% average growth rate for the next couple of decades, which does not seem very likely but let’s be optimistic. While China actually slowed down to just 7% growth, which could happen. China’s economy will still exceed the US economy’s size by about 25% in 2030. It seems to me that the tide is definitely running against us at this point.<br>The second discount that intrigues me comes from my son. While he was in engineering graduate school at Columbia University he made friends with several Chinese students. He told me several times: “Dad we’re screwed, these kids are unbelievably smart, they don’t party, they work all the time and they are all going back to China because that is where the opportunity is.” Anyone who thinks the US has one up on China for brains and work ethic hasn’t met their students.<br>Lastly it seems to me that if I was in China’s shoes I would be weighing two items. The value of the US market to my economy and the interference the US provides in the international market for raw materials. In terms of the US economy compared to the Chinese economy it strikes me that the US economy is mature and does not have much potential for growth with the aging baby boomers contracting their spending and not a lot of market expansion potential. However this is not true of the Chinese economy with 4 times as many people as the US and most of them at a lower standard of living there is a massive opportunity for increased consumption. In the meantime the US presence in the international materials market has a certain cost to the Chinese economy and when that cost exceeds the value of our market to their business interests it seems to me that China has no reason to not pull the plug on the dollar.

They have not used it because it does not pay them. The greatest temptation ever offered to them was the beaches of Normandy. This they could have drenched with gas greatly to the hindrance of the troops. That they thought about it is certain and that they prepared against our use of gas is also certain.

Here's another: <br><br>About ten years ago one of my sons (a physicist) was carpooling to UC's Lawrence Lab in Livermore, Calif. One of the others in the carpool was several decades older than he, and had had a long past in the CIA.<br><br>They all got into the habit of talking, since it was a daily commute of an hour each way. Early on, the CIA man had established that there was a lot he couldn't talk about, but that he would certainly answer questions when he could do so. <br><br>One day the topic of nuclear war came up, and how close we had ever come to it. Everyone knew about the Cuban Missile Crisis, of course, but my son asked whether there had been other close brushes with nuclear war. The CIA man said that there had been more than a half dozen others, and that many (or was it, most?) of them had been much closer calls and much scarier than the Cuban one everybody knew about. He also said that he couldn't be more specific.<br><br>My son was enormously unnerved by the answer he had gotten, which is why he replayed the conversation to me. <br><br>So in addition to Hubris and Nemesis, Tyche (= Fortune or Chance) also plays a large role in such matters. So far she has smiled more than frowned. So far.

My preference for tracking a carrier group would be to make use of the dramatic improvements in high-speed signal processing, and have a number of distant aircraft and drones, with large antenna, and underwater manned or unmanned craft listening to all the radio emissions of a carrier group. Along with satellites, for confirmation, I think it would provide sufficient resolution during the cruise phase. Just before the CSG moves into JSF or Super Hornet range, then the high-altitude drones move closer to provide the higher resolution needed for initial aim of the missiles. Yes, the CSG might detect the drones, but do they have the time for an effective response? And no, it wouldn't be as elegant as one invisible drone, but I think it would be far more likely to work.<br><br>My objection to the stealth drone is that stealth doesn't make aircraft invisible, but it drastically reduces the probability of detection. A high-altitude, slow-moving, long-endurance drone with a high-powered sensor package doesn't sound very small to me, and and since stealth can be countered effectively (for example, using multi-static or low-frequency, as in VHF, radars), and since the US has more experience with stealth than anyone else, I find it implausible that the drone could loiter in that particular place for days (weeks?). Look at the F-22, the stealthiest aircraft in the world by most accounts. It has well-designed stealth properties - but it also has supercruise, so as to minimize the time spent in range when it could be detected. (This leaves it vulnerable to IR tracking - you can't get it all.)<br><br>You may have other information on the US Navy's actual capabilities with regards to stealth, and I'm quite aware I might be wrong. Also, what I point out above are technical capabilities, but a Navy in decline might have had to strain just to maintain more basic skills, and so may miss a sufficiently stealthy drone despite what the radars could see. Gadgets are no good in war if you haven't practised thoroughly with them. I got the sense that the scenario Navy is more or less up to current standards, though. <br><br>Regarding this week's post, good work again! I like it that you went for the supersonic cruise-missiles, which sound much easier to deploy in containers than ballistic missiles, I think the attack on the military comms network shows by far the most likely attack vector, and I like the way the ground units become rather less fearsome when losing air cover. My only question is why the USAF sent the F-35 and not F-22's?<br><br>I don't think it would tip the balance, but the F-22 would be much more of a challenge for the Chinese fighters. And from the sound of it, the carrier-based F-35's were supposed to do the majority of the ground strikes anyway. Still, that's a nit.<br><br>Enough of this war business, I'll end on a brighter note: yesterday we brought in nearly the last harvest: about 12 kg's of pumpkins, and several cabbage heads to be turned into sauerkraut. It turned into a decent year in the garden after all!<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c3819820626467571204 title="comment permalink">10/15/12, 7:24 AM</a><br><br>

A few times you have indicated that the US government subsidizes businesses, corporations, etc. I agree that this is so, but don't quite grasp the mechanisms or ways by which this is done. I understand the subsidies for agriculture, which are more direct, but I expect that the supports for commerce are indirect. If you could provide a quick summary or outline of these subsidies, or at least point me towards a good summary elsewhere, I would greatly appreciate it.<br>2. A few times in different posts and in comments, you and others have alluded to the belief that California may not be the best place to be in post-peak years. As a lifetime resident of SoCal, I can maybe see that perhaps earthquakes may be a challenge, but I don't see that California has any particular corner on challenging conditions. Tornadoes and hurricanes can be just as devastating. Climate change will have widespread effects. Implementing your recommendations will be a good thing to do no matter where one might live. So, if you could provide a little insight about the varying regional post-peak challenges here and elsewhere, again, I would greatly appreciate it. <br>Thanks and very much appreciate all your work.<br><br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c7821318018927635070 title="comment permalink">10/15/12, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

Now of course mistakes are possible, and so is sheer human stupidity, but the nuclear powers are as aware of that as anybody else. More on this down the road. <br><br>Robert, I'm not surprised.

No doubt a good scenario could be put together in which the Chinese response centered on hacking, or something like that. <br><br>Jim, economic disruption is an ordinary feature of warfare -- a lot of people just before the First World War insisted that war between the European powers was impossible because of the sheer economic damage it would cause. They were wrong, of course. As for ice, I'm very fond of it myself, especially in bourbon on a hot summer night. <br><br>Will, quite a few of my readers with military and political experience disagree with you. As for the one objection you've bothered to make in detail, China is already in the process of transitioning from an export-driven to a domestic consumption economy -- they'd be idiots not to, after watching Japan run the export model into the ground by pursuing it past the point that domestic wage and price increases eliminated the competitive advantage that makes it work; furthermore, the payoff to be won by supplanting the US as global hegemon -- which is pretty clearly the overall goal of China's grand strategy -- makes any short-term impact on exports a minor issue. Try again. <br><br>Johan, thank you! I'll look into that, and consider integrating that approach into the published version of the scenario. As for the F-35, that's partly because I used the JSF as a bad example of dysfunctional weapons procurement in an earlier post, and partly because the USAF is chugging ahead with plans to make the F-35 its frontline fighter, despite its many limitations. It makes a good model of the way that political and economic considerations so often trump military reality, over the short term in today's America.<br><br>Valekeeperx, I don't have any way to respond to offlist questions if you don't give me an email address -- Blogger doesn't fill that in. Since they're relevant questions to the broader project of this blog, though, I'll respond to them here. <br><br>Government subsidies to US industry happen through a dizzying array of programs ranging from a tax code that allows many large US corporations to pay little or nothing in taxes, through government purchases of products and services at inflated prices, to straightforward giveaways in the form of grants, loans, credits, and so on. Here's <a href=http://www.progress.org/corpw30.htm rel=nofollow>a bit from Bernie Sanders</a> talking about one particularly egregious program, and from the other end of the political spectrum, a <a href=http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/corporate-welfare-federal-budget rel=nofollow>Cato Institute</a> paper on corporate welfare. <br><br>As for California, I wasn't thinking about earthquakes; every corner of the US has some kind of natural disaster that hits it at regular intervals. No, my take on California is that it's rapidly shaping up to be the Rust Belt of the early 21st century. Between a corrupt and gridlocked state government, sky-high costs of doing business or much of anything else, entrenched ethnic conflicts primed to explode in various unpleasant ways, and economic shifts that are cutting the ground out from under the state's economy, all the pieces are in place to make LA and San Francisco in 2025 look like Detroit and Pittsburgh did in 1985 -- bleak, crumbling, crime-ridden, bankrupt icons of urban blight -- and give the rest of the state all the charm of, say, Gary, Indiana and environs. It's just not going to be a good place to live, at least for several decades.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c8539969829551219128 title="comment permalink">10/15/12, 10:02 AM</a><br><br>

It's a very important fact which I haven't seen factored into official military thinking anywhere. Well, apart from fantasy scenarios where US missiles are 100% reliable and Soviet/Chinese ones are in state of total decay, so US finally can exercise first strike option with missile shield taking care of the feeble retaliation strike.<br><br>But let's look at it another way: if it takes obscene 8 billion dollars anually to have a somewhat functional nuclear missile system with 60% (it's probably better that that but by 20% at most) accuracy, how can China or Russia compete ? It's same wasteful technology, where lots of crucial details are arcane black art, only available through lots of experience.<br><br>Wouldn't that actually mean that USA is at advantage here ? IIRC, the China nuclear retaliation study I've linked does not account for ICBM reliability in its calculations. It just assumes 100% effectiveness.<br><br>The big question to me is: are Chinese really doing anything different or are they just playing the same idiotic game as the USA. The problem with idiotic games being, the idiot will drag you to his level and beat you with experience.

See, for example, "Archeofuturism: European Visions of the Post-Catastrophic Age."<br><br>The basic idea here is that a new European empire will emerge from the ruins of Pax Americana, one which has rediscovered "Apollonian" values and become assertive in the world again. I find this vision both appealing and probable; the idea that the West is just going to lay down and die in the face of rising empires like the Han and Islam seems absurd. More likely, I expect a new militancy to emerge once Europeans realize that they can no longer live a complacent existence under American protection, and have to begin to reassert their collective Will to Power.<br><br>As for America, I agree that we are probably in for a dark period, as our current mythology collapses and our citizens begin to look for deeper allegiances than liberalism, capitalism and constitutional democracy. The challenges of “National Socialist” China and Islam could prove fatal to us, or they could be the catalysts for a new and stronger civilization. I would be interested to hear your thoughts on some of these New Right ideas, because overall they seem fairly compatible with your vision.<br><br>And one last thing: Is it your belief that humanity’s power has forever peaked, and that we are now facing a terminal decline, followed by extinction? Knowing what we now know about the hostile universe, don’t you think we must at least make every effort to increase our power and cosmic reach, as an alternative to going the way of the dinosaurs?

Regarding Johan's point "Gadgets are no good in war if you haven't practised thoroughly with them." - the Air France flight that crashed into the Atlantic a few years back did so because the least experienced pilot kept his yoke pulled back while the other two pilots tried to figure out why the plane kept stalling.

Sure, there have been insane leaders with potent weapons before. But Stalin, Mao, and even GWB were never faced with a game-changing defeat at the hands of an upstart power after generations of supremacy and the near-mythologized belief that they possessed the ultimate ace-in-the-hole to reset everything. Add to that the belief in a divine mandate, and you have a dangerous combination.<br><br>I'm even more concerned about the pressure that individual would be under to pull out a victory, or at least a major payback, from a population that believes in the myth even more than they do. Look at the calls to go to war against Iran, some coming from some people who were or are serious contenders for president.<br><br>Now, I think after the disasters of Afghanistan and Iraq, to call for another war in that area, one has to be so delusional as to be unable to conceive that the US can lose. Too much Hollywood and Disney, I think. The good guy always wins before the credits roll, and all that.<br><br>I realized when I was writing it that all of my examples were coming from the Right, and it would look like I was demonizing that end of our so-called political spectrum. I really don't particularly identify with the other end, which I observe as being as deluded in their own areas. But the seriously dangerous initiatives have all come from the Right for the last generation or so, that's just a readily-observable fact.<br><br>I think if you reread my post, you'll see that I was mostly supporting your scenario.

I would not consider it likely. I see a low energy future as likely. What are the odds for things remaining more of the same? Hard to say. How long can we keep the plates spinning? I can show you newsletters that said we should have collapsed by now. I can show you others that would say gasoline would be pennies a gallon. <br><br>I don't trust anyone in the debate who says they know what's exactly going to happen but I do take far more seriously people who can lay out their arguments clearly, with support, and are quite clear on how they arrived at the asumptions that underpin their scenario. And I'll really respect a person who admits getting it wrong and goes into how he made a well-reasoned mistake. Honesty is impressive.<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c8063716887921129871 title="comment permalink">10/15/12, 8:46 PM</a><br><br>

They're doing it the smart way -- just enough nukes to guarantee mutual assured destruction. <br><br>Darth, I figured we were going to hear something from the Sith point of view sooner or later! Yes, I'm somewhat familiar with the Nouvelle Droit, enough to know that when you say "Apollonian" you probably mean "Uranian" as opposed to "Demetrian." If Europe's going to pull much of anything together in the wake of the Pax Americana, it's going to have to get a move on -- right now the most likely future for today's European nations is submergence beneath a Muslim voelkerwanderung over the next century or so. <br><br>As for survival as an imperative, I hope I won't be insulting you if I say that I've always found that a creed for cowards. You, and I, and everyone else are ripening toward death with every breath we take; clinging to fantasies of indefinite survival simply gets in the way of appreciating life. For heaven's sake, if you're going to embrace the sort of warrior creed the Nouvelle Droit seems to favor, the joyful acceptance of the imminence of death is a basic first step in that direction!<br><br>Finally, no, I don't think our species faces a terminal decline; if anything, we're just coming to the end of humanity's giddy and wasteful adolescence, and over the millennia to come we may finally manage something closer to adulthood. The average mammalian species, as I recall, lasts ten million years; that means that 90% of our species' lifespan may yet still be ahead of us, which ought to be ample time to work through all the possible ways of being human. Then we can leave the world to the distant descendants of raccoons, and let them see what they can do with it. <br><br>RPC, that's a good point. It would be very embarrassing if a nuclear war broke out, and everybody's arsenals just emitted a vague whimper and sat there in the silos!<br><br>Euro, now let's see if they can get Congress to buy them something that makes smaller profits for the defense industry!<br><br>Cherokee, the wrong kind of magic. There's way too much corrupt thaumaturgy and way too little theurgy. <br><br>Hal, you're right, I did misunderstand. Still, I'd encourage you to notice that neither Hitler nor Saddam used their substantial nerve gas stockpiles even when facing total defeat.

At very least, I would hope so: chemical weapons have been used quite a lot in Iran/Iraq war, by both sides. As for why Saddam Hussein didn't use them against coalition forces: he couldn't. Air strikes in first few days destroyed CW stockpiles, factories, logistics and air force (prefered method of delivering CW). And after the strikes Iraq army was in such disarray that any chemical warfare would prove far more lethal to them than to coalition soldiers. I guess that almost complete destruction of Iraq CW capacity was the reason why they were never used, not so much fear from nuclear retaliation (far too dangerous, just think of Russia and China).<br><br>As aside: the same idea of air and missile strikes disabling the opponent capability to retaliate is alive and well in USA grand plan called Air Sea Battle (for China, most certainly). <br><br>Why Germans (or Hitler, more precisely) did not use Tabun during WW2 can be debated indefinitely. I believe that it was a combination of factors: Hitler's personal views on poison gas, hazardousness of Tabun to German troops and false intelligence that Allies also had something as devastating as Tabun (they didn't). That didn't prevent Germans to manafacture quite a lot of Tabun artilery shells. If British army (which blissfuly dismissed warnings about German chemical weapons as propaganda) used mustard gas (as Churchill wanted and as they had before WW2), these shells would most probably get used.<br><br>Nuclear weapons are really an unknowable unknown and only real deterrence from their usage is that they never get built. I find that somewhat similar to nuclear powerplants: given their risks and ultimate cost nobody sane should build them (at least with current technology). Still, we do, and they're considered safe enough. Such false idea of their safety was instrumental in Fukushima disaster.<br><br>I find the whole deterrence theory unconvincing and nuclear deterrence theory a willful blindness. End of this page on Wikipedia has some good reasons why:<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory<br><br>Actually, the sole existence of plans like Air Sea Battle proves that nuclear deterrence doesn't work that well :/<br><br><a href=how-it-could-happen-part-two-nemesis.html#c8363704167284801630 title="comment permalink">10/17/12, 5:04 PM</a><br><br>
