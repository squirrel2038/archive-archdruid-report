<div class=MsoNormal>
This week’s post is the fourth of five parts of a fictional narrative tracing out a scenario of American imperial defeat and collapse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the war ends, the price has to be paid—and paying it will push the already fractured United States toward a crisis few citizens could have imagined a short time before. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
*********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The church bells rang all night; perfect strangers embraced and kissed each other or fell on their knees and prayed together, depending on inclination; a baby boomlet nine months later revealed how many Americans celebrated the sudden discovery that life would go on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Around the world, crews in missile silos, bomber bases and submarines sagged with relief as they got the order to stand down. In the US, the few police and National Guard units still barricading freeways and guarding government assets melted into the cheering crowds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The threat of nuclear war was past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As a cold gray morning spread over Washington, though, Jameson Weed surveyed what was left of his presidency, and dropped his head into his hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A negotiation team would soon be its way to Geneva to meet its Chinese and Tanzanian opposite numbers and settle on a peace treaty. No matter how hard the spin doctors worked it, he knew, that treaty would mean a bitter defeat for America, and his solid grasp of the realities of American politics told him exactly who would be blamed for it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The treaty, as it turned out, was surprisingly generous.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No one had to admit fault or pay reparations; the United States simply had to accept the status quo in East Africa and assign its rights over Diego Garcia—which was owned by Great Britain anyway—to the Peoples Republic of China.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Since the United States had no effective way to contest either demand, there was clearly no point in quibbling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The treaty was signed at the beginning of October, and ratified by a glum Congress three days later. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Before that happened, though, two things pushed the country deeper into crisis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first was that one of the television networks broke the story of the naval disaster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That was partly political—the network had close ties to the most likely presidential candidate from the other party—and partly the ordinary business of the news media, but it dealt a body blow to the nation’s morale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The network found surviving crew members who had been evacuated to Europe before Mombasa fell, and brought in testimony from analysts who spent decades trying to warn the Navy of the obsolescence of carriers in an age of cruise missiles. The rest of the news media quickly joined the feeding frenzy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second was more serious still.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the world began to grapple with the fact that the United States was no longer the world’s strongest nation, investors began selling dollar-denominated investments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The selling began in the most risky kinds of speculative paper, but spread rapidly from there, sending the dollar down hard. Frantic attempts by central banks to stop the collapse crumpled in the face of a self-feeding panic, as investors all over the world and in America scrambled to get out of the dollar at any cost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the dollar plunged against foreign currencies, the price of gasoline shot upwards to $12 a gallon and kept climbing, and many other imported goods became unavailable at any price.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then, a week before the signing of the treaty, one of the nation’s biggest investment banks went broke. Its traders had used inside knowledge of US policy to take huge positions in derivative markets that would pay off once regime change took place in Tanzania.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The possibility that the US might lose had never occurred to them, and the unhedged risk left them hopelessly in the red.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Bankers hurried to Washington, only to find that printing trillions of dollars for a bailout when the dollar was already in freefall was not an option.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The following Friday, after markets closed, a grim-faced executive from Goldman Sachs announced that her firm was bankrupt and would go out of business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Over the next six weeks, US stock market averages lost a third of their value, erasing tens of trillions of dollars in paper wealth, and eight other major financial firms that had been considered too big to fail failed anyway. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Well before that process was over, though, the country had a new president.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Two days after the peace treaty was ratified, as planeloads of American POWs were leaving Nairobi Airport to begin their trip home, Jameson Weed stood behind the presidential podium one last time and resigned his office. His final speech was simple and dignified; he took full responsibility for the mistakes made during his presidency, expressed his total confidence in his vice president and successor, and asked God’s blessing for the nation. When he was finished with the speech, he went to his private quarters, took a revolver from a desk drawer, and shot himself through the head. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>*</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The new president, Leonard Gurney, was arguably not the best man for the difficult job into which he was so suddenly thrown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A gifted communicator, skilled at finding and shaping the pulse of the public, might have done much, but Gurney had no such talents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The scion of a wealthy family, brought onto the ticket to conciliate a powerful faction of his party, he had little grasp of practical politics and no sense of the plight into which the East African war and its aftermath had flung most Americans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To him, the crucial issues were reestablishing the authority of the executive branch and funding a military buildup that would enable the United States to retake the lead from the Chinese and regain its former role of global dominance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was an agenda hopelessly out of touch with the times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The wildly cheering crowds in Beijing were welcoming a new international order in which America was no longer the sole superpower, and might not be a superpower at all for much longer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the wake of the East African war, a growing number of erstwhile US allies told the US military units based on their territory to leave, and made overtures to the Chinese.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For that matter, between plunging tax revenues, the collapse in the dollar’s value, and the ongoing bear market in treasury bills, the US could no longer afford the bases it maintained around the world, and the carrier groups that had been the keystone of American power were as obsolete as Old Ironsides.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Gurney and his advisers could not grasp this, and demanded money from a nearly bankrupt nation to fund the grandiose military projects they thought could rebuild America’s power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Meanwhile China scrapped its one carrier and fielded a new navy of small, fast, expendable ships, a move copied promptly by such rising powers as India and Brazil. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Worse still, Gurney’s efforts came at a time when economic issues had taken center stage in the minds of most Americans. The collapse in the dollar and the drying up of imports gutted the economies of both coasts; while the farm belt enjoyed a modest boom and manufacturing firms that produced goods for the domestic market found themselves profitable again, these upticks did not begin to balance the impoverishment of tens of millions of Americans whose wealth depended in one way or another on the imploding financial sphere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From retirees on fixed incomes to upper-crust families with hereditary wealth, those whose fortunes depended on paper assets found themselves plunged into poverty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There had been tent cities surrounding most American cities before the war, but their number and the number of people living in them soared as autumn turned to winter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Stories about deaths from cold and malnutrition began to appear in the media.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Added to the failed war, the Trenton Massacre, and the utter disconnect between the new adminstration’s policies and the new realities of the postwar world, the ongoing implosion of the American economy pushed the nation into a crisis of legitimacy—a crisis that Gurney and his advisers apparently did not notice at all. Speech after presidential speech insisting that the solution to the economic crisis would come from defense jobs and a restoration of American power in the world bred resentment and, worse, contempt. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Lacking meaningful leadership from the White House, the pressure on Congress to do something, or at least to appear to do something, about the rapid increase in poverty became too great to ignore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The gridlock between parties rewarded by their constituents for refusing compromise remained frozen in place, and though the speeches grew more shrill as the crisis deepened, few substantive steps could be acceptable to both sides. One party insisted on increased spending, the other party insisted on lower taxes, and the bear market in treasury bills made it increasingly clear that the old days of borrow-and-spend could not be revived without turning the dollar’s ongoing slump into a death spiral.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was out of desperation at that gridlock that the New American Prosperity Act was drafted by a bipartisan committee. It was thicker than the Los Angeles phone book and packed with giveaways to a galaxy of pet causes and special interests, but the core of the proposed act was an expansive new social welfare program, the costs of which would be borne almost entirely by the states. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Unfunded mandates—programs imposed on the states by the federal government, which provided no money to pay for them—had been a bone of contention for decades.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>NAPA was arguably no more onerous for the states than earlier unfunded mandates, but it came when many states had suspended payment on their debts, and some were struggling even to pay salaries. State governments lobbied hard to keep NAPA off the books, to no avail; the act passed the House in January and the Senate in early March, and was signed into law by President Gurney a few days later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The following week, the state legislature of Arkansas passed, with no dissenting votes, a resolution calling for a constitutional convention to pass an amendment that would outlaw all unfunded mandates. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>*</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The initial reaction of the Washington establishment and the national media to the Arkansas bill was hilarity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The US constitution gave state legislatures the power to call a convention if two-thirds supported the proposal, and pass the resulting amendment if three-quarters of the states approved it, but that provision had never been used; it had been more than a century since it had even been tried.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Jokes about rewriting the constitution in Arkansas dialect made the rounds of the late night talk shows. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The next week, Montana and New Hampshire passed identical resolutions, and the laughing stopped. Pundits churned out essays explaining why tinkering with the constitution should be left to Congress if it had to be done at all. Canned polls insisted that most Americans opposed a convention. The state legislatures ignored them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>They had their own ways of gauging the temper of the public, and what they heard was that people were eager to see the constitution amended. It wasn’t just unfunded mandates, either:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>somewhere in the course of the past year, most Americans had become convinced that the system under which they lived was broken, and needed much more than cosmetic change. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Four state legislatures called for a convention the following week, and five the week following. After that, the floodgates opened, as state governments realized that the chance to force major change really was in their hands. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Two weeks later, the magic number of 34 states was only a few more votes away. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At that point Congress panicked, repealed NAPA, and began to draft an amendment of its own that would limit, though not ban, unfunded mandates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was much too little and far too late.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The idea of a thorough revision of the constitution was everywhere; state politicians were advocating this or that reform; a few members of the House of Representatives, sensing which way the political wind was blowing, joined the agitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>President Gurney denounced the proposed convention repeatedly in his weekly internet videos on the White House website, but few people were listening. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On April 24, Oregon became the 34th state to call for a constitutional convention; five more did so over the course of the next month, making any legal challenge moot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Washington establishment fought to have the new convention in Philadelphia, but lost; the delegates would meet in St. Louis, Missouri at the beginning of September. Congress exercised its right to decree that any new amendment would have to be ratified by conventions in at least three-quarters of the states, rather than by three-quarters of state legislatures, in the hope that this might stymie a power grab by state governments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It was a disastrous miscalculation, though no one would know that for months. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Rallies, speeches, and demonstrations framed the elections that, state by state, chose the 250 delegates charged with reinventing the constitution. More than two hundred books urging one or another reform to the constitution saw print during those frantic months. People at all points of the political spectrum placed extraordinary and incompatible hopes on the convention, extending to the wildest fantasies of left and right. Years afterward, rumors claimed that the national political parties had encouraged this explosion of extreme views, and helped extremists get elected as delegates, in the hope that this would cause the convention to deadlock. If this was true, it was an even more disastrous miscalculation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>*</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The constitutional convention opened on September 5 in the full glare of the world media. At first, all went smoothly; an amendment banning unfunded mandates and several other abuses of federal power over the states was introduced, debated, and passed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The leaders of the moderate factions then moved to declare the convention over and go home. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The motion was heavily defeated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most of the delegates who had come to St. Louis, and most of their constituents at home, wanted more—much more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The difficulty that surfaced, as the convention continued, was that what the people wanted varied so drastically that common ground was impossible to find. Red states wanted the right to own guns strengthened; blue states wanted it abolished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some Americans wanted to make the right to private decisions about abortion sacrosanct; others wanted an amendment guaranteeing the rights of the unborn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Nearly every fault line through American society gaped open in the debates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>New issues—hard limits on the power of presidents to wage war without consent of Congress, hard limits on the power of Congress to pass laws without consent of the states or the people, and many more—rose up to join existing divisions, and sparked fierce debates of their own. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It so happened that delegates to the convention were seated by state, in alphabetical order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a result, one of the delegates from Utah sat next to one of the delegates from Vermont. Late in the afternoon of the 18th, after a day of bruising debates, the Utah delegate slumped back in her chair and said wearily, “I’ve got an idea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Why don’t we just dissolve the Union and let everyone have what they want.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I could live with that,” snapped the delegate from Vermont.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She considered him for a long moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I’m starting to think a lot of people could.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They worked out the details in the empty meeting room after a dinner of takeout Thai. Both were state representatives with law degrees, and every delegate had been issued a copy of the constitution with all its amendments, so it took only a short time to work out what would become the 28th Amendment: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Article I:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Union of the States is hereby dissolved, and the several States shall be free to make other arrangements for their welfare. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Article II: All property of the former federal government in each State, at the time this amendment is ratified, shall become the property of that State.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Article III:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All property of the former federal government outside the territory of the States shall be divided by agreement among the several States.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The proposed amendment was presented by both delegates to the relevant committee the next morning. The response was stunned silence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The amendment was found to be in proper form, and a hearing was scheduled for the next day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Long before that happened, everyone at the convention from the delegates to the kitchen staff at the convention center sensed that something immense had happened. A line had been crossed, and there might be no going back. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: large">End of the World of the Week #45</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Sudden ice ages, the theme of last week’s End of the World of the Week, got picked up and used for local color in a number of other apocalyptic prophecies of the 1970s and 1980s. One of the most colorful was the prediction of cataclysmic earth changes retailed by psychic archeologist Jeffrey Goodman in his 1977 bestseller <i>We Are The Earthquake Generation</i>. Basing his prophecy on the future visions of seven popular psychics, Goodman painted a terrifying picture of cataclysmic earthquakes that would plunge the western half of North America beneath the sea, turn Kansas into a seacoast state, and tear huge rifts in the earth’s crust.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Meanwhile Europe would be plunged into an ice age as land rising from the Atlantic deeps cut off the Gulf Stream.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The New Age press fastened on Goodman’s prophecies with enthusiasm, and when Mt. St. Helens erupted in 1982, there was no shortage of predictions that the rest of the Earthquake Generation scenario would follow shortly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The twenty-year “season of catastrophes” Goodman predicted, though, somehow failed to show up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Western Kansas was supposed to be beachfront property by 1992, and the whole world transformed by 2000; instead, the earth kept on producing distressingly ordinary earthquakes instead of the gargantuan (and physically impossible) ones Goodman expected. </div>

You can quickly find information on your first question with a little time on Google, you know. <br><br>Glenn, Vermont has an active secessionist movement just now, so I'd add New England to that list. One of the complexities to any such splintering is that most states east of the Mississippi have boundaries that follow natural features, and so make at least some sense, while most states west of the Mississippi have boundaries that make no sense at all. There would have to be a lot of sorting out, probably involving the business ends of various weapons systems, before the bad decisions of 19th century politicians are finally laid to rest.<br><br><a href=#c1238622668806493589 title="comment permalink">10/24/12, 8:38 PM</a><br><br>

You have me completely hooked. Last week's installment left me feeling extremely uneasy at the thought of a military defeat and potential nuclear war--I may have to eventually write a blog post about that sensation once the feelings have percolated enough for me to get some coherent grasp on them.<br><br>This week's installment provided a bit more morbid excitement, though. I could easily see the population latching onto a constitutional convention in the hopes of remaking an ever-more-distressing reality. Of course, it could easily end up being a disaster, but that utopia/apocalypse idea is just so enticing and a convention could seem like an end run around the hard work and long grind of actually trying to create fundamental shifts in national politics to get the policy changes you want. Why not just lay it all out in a convention instead?<br><br>And then the dissolving of the union. I could easily see that, as well, and more and more so with each presidential election that rolls around. The divides are so heated and bitter and there's such anger being directed all over the place--someone somewhere is always responsible, it seems, for all that ails us. I'm here in the northwest, and the idea of Cascadia seceding and becoming its own entity is not a new idea. And I do have to admit to it having a certain appeal. But wow, what a can of worms to open. How would it all turn out? I wonder if a desire and need for sovereignty would create a movement toward more appropriate living based within local ecosystems, or if we would just hastily slap together a series of trade agreements with the other states or regional governments to essentially continue the same economic arrangements as we currently have in the country? The potential impact on the food system alone would be fascinating (and that's my particular interest.)<br><br>Anyway, I guess I don't have much to add beyond various musings. I love this story--I'm glad to know it's proven particularly popular for you. I'm very excited to see how it ends next week.<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=#c7558344336952756320 title="comment permalink">10/24/12, 8:43 PM</a><br><br>

This hearkens back to your post(s) on the dissing of democracy by people across the political spectrum in the US.

This sounds like a case of collective thaumaturgy about to rear its ugly head. Be careful what you wish for, eh?<br><br>Your comment about always leaving your reader hanging from a higher cliff with each installment was very instructive. In this series you went from the start of a war to the loss of a war, then to the threat of nuclear war and surrender, and now to the threat of the dissolution of the United States. It makes me wonder - you wrote early on that you already knew who the next two presidents of the US would be: number one is Gurney, is number two Russell Eigenblick?

Yet, how could the Arizona family imagine having a fresh supply of water while those in New England have plentiful rivers, springs and natural lakes? In other words, we may need to have a 'succession of energy generation' to save us locally. Sorry for the tangent, but succession makes me happy. We have been brainwashed to think that if you want to succeed, you must eat fried chicken, root for Little Dale and wear a white hood, when in reality, our founders realized that while all are created equal, our upbringing shapes us to be regional in reaction to our environment.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br><br><a href=#c6224754427157956780 title="comment permalink">10/24/12, 10:12 PM</a><br><br>

I understand that the purpose of the exercise is to educate on the possible mechanisms and scenarios that could lead to a breakup of the states, and the constitutional convention is something we all ought to know about. But on reflection, I think this is a unlikely scenario. First, this really is a very patriotic nation. Not so much in substance as in symbolism, but it takes some pretty powerful forces to wrest people from their symbols. The people elected to such a convention would include a lot of people with powerful ties to flag and oath. After the convention, when it comes time for the people to vote, there would be a lot of people thinking of all of the years of patriotic inculcation.<br><br>Second, and this also would mostly apply after the convention, almost everyone has family in other regions of the country. Certainly there would be an organized, concerted effort to remind people of that, availing itself of all of the tools of electoral thaumaturgy.<br><br>Finally, the large at-scale corporate powers would have a lot to lose in a breakup, and would use their considerable power to fight it.<br><br>I see a much more likely scenario being something like the Texas incident in the last post. Not necessarily all at once, but repeat such scenarios during multiple crises, and at some point, as unifying infrastructure breaks down, it just gets harder to put it back together. Even so, I imagine, as hinted in Stars Reach, there would be some collection of states claiming the mantle of the USA, with flag and all, far after regional splits. Maybe even competing claims. I think it would not be at all inconceivable that the Southern states would keep the name long after the rest of the country, an ironic echo of the Eastern and Holy Roman Empires.<br><br><a href=#c101608426103260174 title="comment permalink">10/25/12, 7:08 AM</a><br><br>

Something like the Watts Riots in LA back in the whenever, but all over the country. The resulting disorder would almost certainly evoke a military response from the Feds, especially in the hands of a clueless incompetent like Gurney: the constitution would almost immediately be suspended under "temporary" martial law, for the duration of the crisis.<br><br>Martial law would breed sedition, of course. What they would call "home-grown terrorists." Which would only reinforce the Fed-perceived need for stronger controls over the population. Since the dollar is worthless and international trade is at a virtual standstill, ordinary people, particularly the young and inexperienced, will need work, and the government will offer it in the form of homeland security soldiering, which will be increasingly needed.<br><br>I'm not sure where that would lead. The US is geographically isolated and still quite resource-rich in a survival sense. Your opinion on how long a US totalitarianism could last?<br><br>It's a different breakdown scenario.

I know you spoke about the transformation of America’s industrial hinterland into the rust belt. That transformation was related to the fact that China and other countries that were poor at the time opened their economies up meaning that a huge additional cheap labour force became available as well as the recovery of Europe meaning additional competition. Also the oil crises of the 1970s may have had something to do with this change, presumably because this cut into profit margins making it more important for greedy corporations to tap into cheap labour. Another reason might have been because energy during the 1980s became cheap enough (due to political machinations and some luck) to justify offshore production of goods as shipping was cheap making this business model more profitable. I also realise that cheap goods produced overseas benefited American consumers and offset the effect of stagnant wages. I could go on but I won’t. So you see I am not as prone to oversimplification as you seem to think. However, if you’re not going to answer posts that require too much detail what’s the point of me going into detail? It’s a waste of my time. <br> <br>So with all that said if the American government had stepped in and put the national interest first, if it had employed a form of protectionism that actually protected American jobs and allowed wages for the working and middle class not to stagnate, rather than allowing so much wealth to accumulate in the hands of the super-wealthy, then is it not fair to say that American could have prevented China from rising to the extent that it did? If the government has shown long term wisdom and put the nation above the plutocracy is it not fair to say that it could have retained its pre-eminence for longer than it did? I do not remember you ever addressing this hypothetical scenario. I feel that you do not like this line of thinking, that you feel it is too partisan and too much in line with bobo (bohemian bourgeois) thinking. However, this is a reasonable question whether or not you feel you should answer it. <br><br><br><a href=#c6931613216281208633 title="comment permalink">10/25/12, 3:43 PM</a><br><br>

The alternative would have been trade barriers that would have preserved the relative prosperity of the working class, but driven up prices for most consumer goods -- especially the electronics, autos, and other middle class toys that Japan produced in such abundance in those days -- thus effectively lowering the standard of living for the middle class. Nobody in the political sphere was willing to risk the electoral backlash from that, and so the working class got thrown under the bus. <br><br>You can no doubt argue that they should have done something else. Still, what's the point of such an argument? That's water under the bridge at this point; it may be useful to understand why certain decisions were made, not least because the middle class is now getting thrown under the bus in its turn, but I don't see much point in Monday-morning quarterbacking about decisions made decades ago. <br><br>Richard, nah, the red-blue thing is far too simplistic. Most "swing states" have values of their own, which they share with some of their neighbors, and which don't correspond closely to the values paraded (though not practiced) by the two parties. My guess is that a lot of "swing states" would choose their own paths in a situation of the sort we're discussing.<br><br><a href=#c6132269853448857827 title="comment permalink">10/25/12, 4:58 PM</a><br><br>

The same goes for many other states, e.g. Northern Virginia vs. the rest of the state, SW vs Northern Ohio, etc etc. While the boundaries of the states east of the Mississippi may make more sense geographically, many of them are no more culturally relevant than the arbitrary boundaries drawn by colonial powers in Africa or the Middle East.<br><br><a href=#c30750803341679153 title="comment permalink">10/25/12, 6:15 PM</a><br><br>

The ending of each episode has a distinct tone, sometimes affirming the melodramatic cliffhanger model, others bypassing it altogether. The end of the third episode beautifully releases the military tensions built up to such frenzy, but only after introducing a new theme of political discontent, thus keeping the reader hooked. <br><br>This fourth episode has my favorite ending yet -- a political cliffhanger drawing a distorted parallel to the military cliffhanger at the end of the first. Whereas the second episode fulfilled most of the readers' expectations (fantasies?) from the first, you have introduced a doubt that the fifth installment will be as gentle with our assumptions. "A line had been crossed, and there might be no going back." Looking forward to the unexpected.<br><br>Also, you have conceived a beautifully crafted piece of magical literature. By that I mean, behind the radical subject matter most of us find so satisfying, you are discretely challenging how we think. After luring in an audience with wish-fulfillment, you encourage us to move beyond our preconceptions and find fulfillment in the challenge of thinking about reality. You are a dangerous writer.

It's not about me though - so back to the topic at hand! <br><br>Most, but not all, comments tend to view the breakup of the union as a foregone conclusion. So, applying ternary thinking (nod of the hat to yourself for this useful tool), what people are looking for is a political response that resolves the existing problems. The sticking point for me is, why would replacing one lot of politicians with another lot, solve any of the long term problems facing the country? <br><br>I don't get the excitement in comments as it is my view that overall the population may be in for a massive disappointment should these circumstances actually come about? To my mind, the population in the story is looking for someone to blame. Change for the sake of change has been historically pretty dodgy!<br><br>Sure, in the story, the federal government has made mistakes, and that entity has also proven that it has difficulty pursuing long term objectives that are of benefit to the population. But still, surely there is more resilience to the system than it has shown? For example, over here they'd most likely have a Royal Commission or the Governor General could sack Parliament or some such thing. Surely, there must be some process with which to have a post-mortem about the crisis?<br><br>The thing is, whilst abandoning or killing off the US dollar seems like an attractive option to get out of a lot of financial problems, default, will push your import costs up (think energy especially) and kill your standard of living. Perhaps states may be able to sell off assets, but it wouldn't be good for the population at large - and it wouldn't be a long term proposition. What is worse is that there would be sharks swimming around that would take a hefty profit off these state asset sales.<br><br>By the way, it is a chilling thought, but China's overall goals can only be attained by sinking the US economically. How else do they get access to those resources which the US now enjoys? It’s not like the country’s goals are secret or anything.<br><br>Not trying to be a bummer, as I am really enjoying the story and can't wait to see how it ends up.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c5532492785037784014 title="comment permalink">10/26/12, 3:33 AM</a><br><br>

Sooner or later, someone or something will tap that effectively, and the system we have is going to come apart in a hurry.

Of course, that doesn't stop them from delegating more powers to the states as a way to resolve conflicts that can't be bought off with the federal printing press anymore...until the union is but a hollow shell, the people realize that their state is what they're stuck with and then all that is left is to legalize the de facto situation. But that process will take generations. And much like the Roman Empire, people will try to reestablish it or claim to be its successor for centuries. The most likely future for the USA is some kind of Holy Roman Empire.<br><br>But again, many people will be averse of a quick split. For every American with strong local ties, there's another one with family all over the union who has lived in several states in his life. Yes, there are dozens of gaping faultlines in American society, but these are social and not geographically concentrated. Many minorities won't look forward to lose the option to defend their interests on a federal level.<br><br>From the POV of the states it's not clear either. California and Texas would benefit from it; most inland states will recognize that they're at mercy of the coastal states in a formal split; many will think they're shafted in the proposed division of the federal inheritage, Hawaii and Alaska will feel terribly exposed without union, and so on.<br><br>And additionally, it all seems to go against the underlying idea of a slow but inevitable collapse, even allowing for dramatization..

As I see it there would be two possiblities <br><br>a) keep a monetary union with a single currency across the Confederacy but drastically reform the Federal Reserve. Either abolish it or reform it so it is accountable to the elected Confederate government. At present the Fed is a private cartel. Many Americans believe it to be a arm of the federal government but in reality is is a private institution set up by a cartel of bankers in 1913. The President should have the power to sack the Chairman and governors of the Bank with a snap of his fingers. <br><br>Problem would be that a monetary union without fiscal union is probably unworkable in the long run as the Eurozone mess indicates.<br><br>b) abolish the US dollar with each state issuing a currency of its own. Full fiscal and monetary powers devolved to the states. This would give poorer states the chance to regain competitivness by devaluing against the stronger states. This would probably be necessary in order to make up for the loss of federal subsidies to the poorer states which exist now.<br><br>The present mess in the Eurozone demonstrates pretty convincingly that a monetary union is unworkable without fiscal union and large transfers from richer states to poorer ones. This requires an elected federal government to make such transfers as without that there is no democratic legitimacy for the scale of transfers necessary to make the union work. There is not going to be a democratic federal government in Europe because the national governments are not prepared to give up their fiscal sovereignty. <br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if the European Union collapsed before the American one does.<br><br><a href=#c8682781072912214525 title="comment permalink">10/26/12, 2:27 PM</a><br><br>

For example, FDR introduced the new deal, JFK handled the Cuban missile crisis well, Richard Nixon signed the EPA into law as well as opened up diplomatic channels with China and Jimmy Carter warned the American people about the perils of over-reliance on fossil fuels even going so far as to place solar panels on the white house (which were taken down by the Reagan administration). I am certainly not saying any of these administrations were perfect or that they did not make mistakes (sometimes major ones) but there certainly are examples of American governments showing good long term judgment. Therefore, to say that it is a sheer impossibility to entertain a thought experiment in which the American government shows good judgement is incorrect in my opinion. However, I do agree that over the past three or so decades there has been deterioration in the political climate which has made it far less likely for wise decisions that are in the people’s long terms interests to take place. There are a number of factors at play there but one of the most important factors, in my opinion, is the increasingly powerful role of money in politics.<br><br><a href=#c7176812767549540570 title="comment permalink">10/26/12, 2:42 PM</a><br><br>

Families living in multiple states? People move frequently in search of jobs or whatever? I fail to see how this is a fertile ground for a dissolution that would be the most monumental political fact of the last hundred years or so (would beat the breakup of the USSR and only lose out to the world wars, IMO).<br><br>I mean, the USSR had probably a worse crash than this, and it did breakup, but you have to remember that there WAS a sucessor state to the USSR (Old Russia), which inherited the lion's share of the former state. What truly broke out where the periphery zones. Later on, the West has managed to exert some influence into Belarussia and the Ukraine (which, IMO, is core russian territory), but I expect these gains to be short lived.<br><br>I don't know, the scenario is immensely entertaining, and I can agree that North America will probably look very different on an atlas later in this century, but I don't quite see this happening over a constitutional convention. Civil war seems much more probable as a mechanism for breakup.

In the USA of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, small businesses have had about the same political influence as individual citizens. Medium sized to large corporations preferred power to reside in the states, because they had enough economic power to bend state legislatures to their will.

I think the "culture wars" are less likely to define separations. They are for the most part over-hyped subjects that the two major parties use to keep adherents voting for them. Most people are more concerned about jobs and the economy; all the hot air about the environment, gay rights, gun rights, fetus' rights &amp; etc. is mostly a distraction. I think it more likely that different economies, such as between the North and the South before the Civil War would define the splits.<br><br><br> I've got relatives all over the country in at least four other states in three different regions. I would have no problem with those being other "countries". It really wouldn't change how often I see them (very rarely) or how we communicate. Now, the end of cheap travel and the crash of the internet _would_ change this dramatically, but not, say Rhode Island per see being in another country.<br><br> Some states were technically independent countries before joining the U.S. Specifically the Republics of Texas and California, and the Kingdom of Hawaii. While the boundaries of some of the Western States are arbitrary geometric lines, ignoring natural features; most of them are large enough and contain enough resources for independence. I wouldn't say the same for Rhode Island or Delaware, no matter which natural features form their borders. I believe that Mountain Ridges make more logical borders than rivers for natural borders. A river valley is a natural economic and biological region, a border down the middle is rather foolish, no matter how attractive a moat it makes to the military mind. Using mountains as defensible walls makes more sense.<br><br>Regarding Economic changes, I think JMG has nailed it. Currently the coastal "Blue" states subsidize the interior "Red" states through Federal taxes. This is in part because our economy greatly undervalues agriculture. The collapse of the dollar and the resulting slump in international trade will nail both continental coasts hard. One of the U.S. few strong spots would be the agricultural economy of the agrarian interior, the wheat belt.<br>The initial reaction of the coastal states to cast off the "flyover zone" would prove catastrophic when the economy shifted to a domestic agrarian one; as well as domestic manufacture after the remnants of the U.S. are priced out of international trade.<br><br> The three west coast continental states are net exporters of food, they'd be okay, though suffer from the lack of shipping. I'm not sure about Alaska; whether the value of the fish catch being exported exceeds the value of virtually all the other food being imported is a question I can't answer. I would certainly expect Anchorage's population to decline rapidly by emigration though.<br><br>Glenn<br>Marrowstone Island<br><br><a href=#c2102002593189013956 title="comment permalink">10/27/12, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

How can one show long term wisdom in any way other than through the decisions they make in the here and now? Long term wisdom is about making smart decisions which often have short term costs but long term benefits. Second, when a president signs legislation into law that legislation first went through congress so even if I refer to a particular president signing something into law congress was obviously a part of that. <br><br>Our debate started with your argument that it is totally implausible to entertain a thought experiment where the government makes wise decisions. I disagree with you in a broader and more philosophical sense (and in terms of what could have happened a few decades ago) but in terms of the here and now I think we agree that it would be naive to expect governments to make wise decisions in the interests of the majority. The system has become too corrupted by money and self-interest for that to happen and quite frankly the range of options that any government can take has narrowed significantly. JMG, talks about how our options for dealing with peak oil have narrowed to the point where we moved from it being a problem to a predicament and I agree with this thinking.<br><br><br><a href=#c3011619014145194206 title="comment permalink">10/27/12, 5:12 PM</a><br><br>

This would have much to do with the fact that they either come from, or end up in, the plutocracy meaning they live in a bubble of wealth, privilege and power. Hence, politicians do not tend to understand the suffering of the broader populace as they do not see it or experience it in any meaningful or day to day sense. How can they when they live in mansions (or at any rate luxurious houses in the most sought after suburbs), have private jets (or at least fly first or business class) and are surrounded by people tripping over themselves to tell them how smart and spectacular they are? How can one really understand deprivation when their life is defined by abundance or injustice when their life is one of power? Expecting these sorts of people to make decisions that will benefit anyone other than the plutocracy is ludicrous but funnily enough many of the decisions they have made and continue to make undercut the very system that has been so good to them.<br><br><a href=#c5542822827120903814 title="comment permalink">10/27/12, 5:15 PM</a><br><br>

I thought the missile attack was public knowledge. I know the Japanese tried to keep Midway a secret but contemporary accounts showed that the Japanese citizens still knew something bad had happened. And in this age of Internet, even if the pentagon is keeping mum and even if American media complies, we can watch the bbc, al jazzera, etc. Not to mention all the means of personal communication had by the survivors. Can't keep them all quiet. <br><br>I don't have a problem with a sudden collapse or dissolution of the union. My money would be on more fighting beforehand as a poster above suggested but these are just competing scenarios, none more likely than the other. It's all speculative territory. But what I don't think is speculative is that however the breakup happens, things will not do well. It will not be a cozy devolution. <br><br>Who gets the nukes? How are military forces divided? Red states are revenue sinks. What happens when those federal payments go away? What about people living on government pensions? How will large businesses be affected? Oh yeah, what about the national debt? The whole world is tied into t-bills and I don't see anyone agreeing to even take on a portion of that debt. <br><br>As I understand it, oil is why we got away with that. We sell debt we can't pay back and people buy it because you need dollars to buy oil. And the dollar is worth a dollar because the full faith and credit of the US is backed up by nuclear bleeping weapons along with the rest of the war machine. <br><br>You lose the dollar, tankers stop sailing. All the cheap crap from china probably stopped the same day the war started. So the US is looking are bare shelves at Walmart even before the breakup. <br><br>I think what might be an equally plausible scenario is the mismanagement of the constitutional convention causes a confidence crisis and panic dumping of the dollar and the union is forced into bankruptcy just like a Wall Street bank that gambled too dangerously. Rather than ratifying a breakup, it just happens as the wheels fall off. <br><br>So what would the leaders do? The DC guys. Their entire power base is tied into the status quo. They lose the federal government, they've got nothing. How will they scramble to preserve it? How will things go wrong?<br><br>The more I think about it, the more I realize there are is many things I probably haven't even considered that could take equal billing with "that's actually the real problem here." <br><br>I like the bad calls you included in your scenario.

The fall of the ussr was not pretty but at least it didn't go nuclear.

By and large, they aren't, and so the cultural schisms may prove to be as powerful as, say, the fine points of Christian theology were in splitting up the post-Roman world. <br><br>DaShui, er, no. You need to read those websites a little more carefully. <br><br>Jennifer, no. If you read the US Constitution -- I highly recommend doing that someday, btw -- you'll find that a constitutional amendment can be ratified either by state legislatures, or by state conventions whose delegates are elected for the purpose. Congress has the right to decide which one a given proposed amendment will use. In the narrative, Congress voted to require state conventions, the delegates to which are elected by the voters of each state. <br><br>Sooper, I suspect you would be surprised -- some states, or new nations composed of states, would be much more inclined to censor and control the internet, and all of them would probably tax it, since they'll need money and won't have the option of borrowing until they've demonstrated some stability. <br><br>Cherokee, thank you! We should be fine here -- we're around 200 miles in from the coast, on the far side of the Appalachian crest -- but I'll certainly post something to let people know how things fare. The upcoming post is already uploaded and set to go Wednesday night, so even if I'm without power, you'll get to see how the story ends. <br><br>Reaper, yes, there was a photo of a wrecked carrier all over the internet. Very few people in the US knew what happened -- there were all kinds of rumors on the internet, but the evening news didn't say anything, and a lot of people dismissed the rumors -- there were plenty of claims, for example, that the carrier photo was photoshopped. The shock of finding out that the rumors were true, and that the US government hid the scale and nature of a major military disaster from the people, was a good deal of what made the revelations in September so hard a blow to the nation's self-confidence. <br><br>Chris, the cultural differences in the US today are a source of strength, or could be, if the habit of collective demonization hadn't gotten so deeply entrenched all over the political spectrum. It's that latter habit that's threatening to tear the country apart -- not cultural differences, but the absolute intolerance of them that's cultivated so assiduously by left and right alike. <br><br>Paradigm, thank you! <br><br>John John, sure -- a handful of people on the fringes of one end of the political spectrum, with no influence on the wider political or cultural conversation.

I'd be cautious about releasing pigs. <br><br>In Northern California, hunters introduced nonnative wild pig/domesticated pig crosses into some of our oak woodlands so they could hunt them later. Pigs are onmnivores, they root up the soil, and the sow like the rabbit is an emblem of fertility. <br><br>Two of the large predators formerly part of the California ecosystem (wolves and grizzlies) were hunted to extinction a century ago. Coyotes and cougars hunt solo, and a fully grown sow or boar is more trouble than they want to take on. I would think black bears could go after a feral pig, but AFAIK they don't. The human hunters aren't keeping the pig population in check. <br><br> Pigs eat acorns; their rooting destroys habitat for plants that need undisturbed soil and creates habitat for invasive plants that like it, such as Russian thistle. These multiplying feral pigs have done enough ecological damage in some of our state parks that the park service has paid to have them rounded up and slaughtered by the hundreds. <br><br><br><a href=#c1253232440799728417 title="comment permalink">10/29/12, 2:16 AM</a><br><br>

"We're the living dead," she says. Isn't she troubled by Golden Dawn's violence? "The boys in the black shirts are the only ones I'm not scared of. I feel they'll protect me." I ask her mother, old enough to remember the junta, what she thinks of their far-right views. "I heard Michaloliakos say on TV that their sign isn't Hitler's sign but a patriotic one," she says, and then looks down at her feet. "It does upset me a bit. But I haven't heard of anyone else giving out food.""<br><br>" In June, many voted for Golden Dawn as a protest against the parties that brought the country down: "I want them in parliament to beat the others up." Now they are turning to it because hope is exhausted; because things are out of control and they want someone to take charge; because it's "doing something".

"Greece can't be saved.""<br><br>Lots of warning signs about the failure of the governing parties to do much of anything useful for the average person whose job, house, and identity have been lost.

While the quality of the novel itself was akin to a Young Adult version of Atlas Shrugged, I was struck that it was still a powerful format for exposition. <br><br>In retrospect I realized that there were other novels I'd read that were much better at being great stories but were actually vehicles for exploiting serious ideas. <br><br>This may seem like a distinction without a difference but for me it helped reshape how I looked at writing and storytelling. I could now tell when a writer had obviously written an essay on some topic and then stuck in a few quotation marks and stage direction to make it not look like an author tract. <br><br>I think the key ingredient in doing it effectively is the sympathetic character you identify with. Tell a kid to be careful in the woods and watch out for snakes, it doesn't stick. Tell the kid about another kid much like himself who didn't listen to his elders and got snakebit and how much he suffered before he died, that will stick. You can talk about the future portended by authoritarianism or you can run Winston Smith through the wringer and really drive the point home. <br><br>The only problem with this approach is you can prove anything you want in fiction and yet some people will take it as experimental proof that can be cited for the real world. Objectivism works in Rand's novels! Yeah, and in Rowling's novels boys and girls can become wizards but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for an owl from Hogwart's.<br><br><a href=#c1659178989626683206 title="comment permalink">10/30/12, 3:02 AM</a><br><br>

You may have misinterpreted my post. Yes, rabbits are a real drama here. Did you know the original settlers tried introducing 5 different species before the current Spanish wild rabbits established themselves here?<br><br>It is really interesting that those same rabbits are about 2 kilometres away from me and have been for some time, but they never made it here because being in the middle of some older forest with lots of bird housing in older trees, the wedge tail eagles (and foxes) take them out during the day and the southern boo-book / powerful owls (and foxes) eat them at night. It is a precarious life for a rabbit here (not to mention my chooks!).<br><br>The majority of native animals (except the echidnna which is a marsupial ant eater) are only active at night here. During the day I let the dogs roam through the orchard and they'd kill and eat any rabbit they'd find. The miniature fox terrier (a very common farm breed here) would even venture into the rabbit burrow. The dogs are in an enclosure at night and the native animals here know it and ignore them – even eating my herb garden which is right against the dog enclosure.<br><br>The original mega fauna which were mostly herbivores have long since been eaten by humans, upsetting the entire fragile ecosystem and changing it completely.<br><br>The other problem with Australian forests is that the soils here are old. Some of the oldest rocks on the surface of the planet are in Australia. This means that they don't have a lot to offer plants. Everything grows slower here. Seriously, this is why I squirrel away all this organic matter that most people consider to be waste product.<br><br>I'm in an area of relatively recent volcanic activity (6 million years ago) which is a bonus. However, the continent is pretty flat, so the last ice age didn't produce much glaciation which renews soils. In addition to this it is relatively geologically stable (regular readers may remember a reference to a recent earthquake in a comment, which was a rare occurrence), so there hasn't been much uplifting of the crust. All of these activities renew the soil, but it is not happening and the soils are exhausted and/or low in nutrients.<br><br>The theoretical pigs would be run in rotating plots and not running loose and feral in the forest. Their purpose would be for meat, manure and soil creation processes. They would effectively be concentrating organic matter and nutrients into the soil.<br><br>Yes, this does change the ecosystem and soil here, but the whole of the country has been so badly managed and strip mined that, whilst things could possibly get worse, they'd mostly likely get better.<br><br>By the way, deer, goats and pigs already roam through this mountain range. All of them are escapees. Apart from humans (and the accidental snake bite), there really is no other predator, but soil nutrients are so low that they don't breed massive populations either.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c1811609871315592233 title="comment permalink">10/30/12, 3:30 AM</a><br><br>

If you're keeping the pigs controlled, by all means; they're very efficient at converting vegetable matter into high quality (and very tasty) protein.<br><br>Mark, the current plan is to put the narrative into a forthcoming book on the decline and fall of the American empire. Still, if some big publisher wants to offer me a lucrative contract for a book version, I'll talk. ;-)<br><br>Sooper, perhaps you can tell me why this is relevant to the topic of this post. <br><br>Unknown, I'd encourage you to consider the fall of the Soviet Union. Would anybody have believed, as late as 1985, that the Soviet Union could simply fall apart, without civil war or nukes flying? The sudden collapse of imperial states, especially but not only in the aftermath of a failed war, is tolerably common in history. <br><br>Clifman, you're quite right, of course. My error. <br><br>Sooper, true, but again, in what way is this relevant to the post? <br><br>Bill, and a happy Samhuinn to you too! Mind you, I'll probably be on the keyboard a bit this evening anyway.<br><br><a href=#c636217295005352602 title="comment permalink">10/31/12, 8:15 AM</a><br><br>
