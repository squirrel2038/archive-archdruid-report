An irony I’ve had the chance to relish repeatedly, over the five years or so since <i>The Archdruid Report</i> first ventured onto the blogosphere, is the extraordinary grip of convention and conformity on exactly those sectors of American society that take the most pride in their rejection of convention and conformity. It’s reminiscent of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQqq3e03EBQ">the scene from the Monty Python film <i>Life of Brian</i></a> in which a crowd of adoring followers, told that they are all individuals, chants back in perfect unison, “Yes, we are all individuals!”<br><br>It’s easy enough to laugh, but there’s much to be learned from the beliefs that are taken for granted by those who insist they take nothing for granted. The subject of today’s post is one of those, one that’s deeply entangled with the cult of nihilism I dissected in last week’s essay. It’s a credo that’s embraced with equal enthusiasm straight across the political spectrum from left to right, and from the middle of the road out as far toward the fringes as you care to look. There are few better examples of groupthink in contemporary American life, and yet nearly all the people who accept the notions I have in mind are convinced that they’re rebelling against conformity by conforming to a belief system shared by nearly everybody else in the country.<br><br>The credo in question? It’s the belief that all the decisions that really matter in the United States today are made by a small elite, insulated from the democratic process, who are pursuing policies that would be rejected by the American people if the latter had the chance to make up their own minds.<br><br>Those of my readers who happen to be Democrats may find it educational to sit down sometime with a stalwart Republican, perhaps over a couple of beers, and ask whether this is the case. You can count on getting an earful about the corrupt liberal elite that pulls all the strings in this country. If any of my readers happen to be Republican, and try the same experiment in reverse, they can expect an equal and opposite earful about the corrupt corporate elite that pulls all the strings in this country. Step outside the two main parties and ask the same question, and you’ll get at least thirty-one different flavors of the same claim, topped off, perhaps, by some follower of David Icke insisting that the corrupt elite that pulls all the strings is actually the cabal of evil space lizards that Ickes appears to have lifted from one too many viewings of the otherwise forgettable Eighties science fiction TV series <i>V</i>.<br><br>Nearly everyone agrees, in other words, that there’s a corrupt elite pulling the strings, even though no two factions can agree on who it is and what they want. Next to nobody challenges the assumption that democracy is a charade controlled by unseen hands. Still, I’m convinced that it’s high time to question that assumption, and to trace out its links to the cult of nihilism and the profoundly troubled national conscience that have exercised a corrosive influence on this country since the end of the Seventies.<br><br>It’s probably necessary to say right off that challenging the credo I’ve outlined here does not require believing in the fairy tale version of democracy too many schools still insist on dishing up to our children, in an apparent attempt to apply Huckleberry Finn’s famous definition of faith – "believing what you know ain’t so" – to the political sphere. In the real world, a democratic society is not a Utopia that guarantees everyone perfect liberty and equality. Rather, it’s simply one way of managing the chore of making collective decisions, in the context of a society that – like all human societies everywhere – distributes wealth, power, rights, and responsibilities unequally among its citizens. I tend to think that democracy deserves our support because, by and large, it produces fewer and less drastic human rights violations and allows somewhat more individual freedom than the alternatives, but those are relative distinctions, not absolutes, and democracy also has a bumper crop of problems of its own that are hardwired into its basic architecture.<br><br>For instance, democracies always have severe problems with corruption, because democracy is one of the few systems of government in which the rich aren’t automatically the ones who make collective decisions. In a hereditary aristocracy, say, the people who have the political authority also have most of the national wealth, and thus can afford the disdain for the merely rich that aristocrats so often affect. In a democracy, by contrast, there are always people who have wealth but want influence, and people who have power but want money, and the law of supply and demand takes it from there. Those who claim that the existence of political corruption in America shows that it’s no longer a democracy thus have the matter exactly backwards; it’s precisely because American national, state and local governments are more or less democratic that corruption flourishes here, as it has in nearly every other democracy on record.<br><br>There are plenty of other problems endemic to democracies. A glance over the ancient Greek literature on the subject, just for starters, will provide any of my readers who are curious about this with an uncomfortably exact autopsy of the current problems of American politics. Still, the most important problem with democracy is one that’s inseparable from the basic idea of handing decision-making over to the citizens as a whole, because no law of nature requires a majority to be right.<br><br>Now it’s central to most versions of the credo of elite rule I mentioned earlier in this post to claim that the majority is so thoroughly manipulated by the corrupt (insert partisan label here) elite pulling all the strings in this country that it can’t make up its own mind about anything that matters, and simply follows the lead of the elite. Democrats, Republicans, believers in evil space lizards, and nearly everyone else pass easily from this claim to the insistence that if the majority was able to think for itself, it would back the Democrats, Republicans, believers in evil space lizards, or whoever else happens to be speaking at the time. This may in itself suggest one of the motives for this very comforting notion, but there may be more going on here than simple sour grapes.<br><br>There is, to be sure, plenty of manipulation of the public in America, as in any other democracy, for reasons identical to those behind the prevalence of corruption in democratic systems. At any given time, there may be a couple of dozen organized groups or more trying to push some set of ideas on the public by fair means or foul. What is not often recognized is that the public is not merely a passive participant in this process. Multimillion-dollar marketing campaigns routinely flop because the American public, motivated by its habitual perversity, shrugs and walks away from the most carefully crafted marketing pitch to embrace some fad or fashion nobody on Madison Avenue saw coming. That is to say, manipulation works in both directions; those people who try to bend public opinion to their own ends can succeed only by telling the public what it wants to hear.<br><br>The same thing is equally true in politics, as a glance over the history of the last half dozen decades of American political life will show clearly enough. Perhaps the best example of all is the abandonment of the movement toward sustainability in the wake of the Seventies.<br><br>That movement was backed by a loose coalition with diverse and often conflicting goals, and it faced strident opposition from a large sector of the public, but it had the support of government officials who were worried about the price of dependence on Middle Eastern oil, and who also felt the perennial need of politicians to appear to be doing something about the crisis du jour, which at that point was the high cost of energy. Some members of both parties opposed the movement, though others on both sides of the aisle backed it; some corporate interests opposed it, while others recognized that alternative energy just might turn out to be the next big thing. The entire movement, however, was based all along on the gamble that the American public would be willing to tighten its belt and plunge into the transition to an ecotechnic society even when the bills started coming due in earnest.<br><br>On the other side of the game was a coterie of Republican politicians and strategists who guessed that when push came to shove, the American public would crumple. When a chapter of accidents put their candidate into the White House, they bet the future of their party on that guess, and won. The election that mattered here wasn’t Reagan’s relatively narrow victory in 1980, but his landslide in 1984, when most of the nation registered its approval of a policy shift that spared them the costs of the transition to sustainability. It was after the latter election that the axe came down on funding for appropriate tech, and Woodsy Owl’s iconic "Give a hoot – don’t pollute!" ads vanished from the airwaves.<br><br>Notice also what happened as the Eighties unfolded. It wasn’t just the American public that crumpled; the sustainability movement did, too. There were some who stayed the course, who saw that the plunge in energy prices bought by breakneck pumping of the North Slope and North Sea oil fields would turn out to be one of history’s classic short-term fixes, and kept the green flame lit. Still, by and large, most of the people who had been subscribers to <i>Rain</i> and <i>Coevolution Quarterly</i>, and had been nervously trying to work up the courage to accept the restricted lifestyles they knew would be required , talked themselves into believing that the time for that was over. Several commenters on last week’s post have recalled the guilty relief with which they, and so many other people, welcomed the end of gas lines and the return of cheap gasoline; it was a common sentiment at the time.<br><br>The price for that failure, though, was not limited to the collapse of a movement that might just have gotten us through the end of the petroleum age without a long and bitter age of contraction. The payoff the Reagan administration offered the American people was the same unearned prosperity that wrecks most democracies in the end. That payoff was cashed in, in turn, by cultivating a degree of fiscal irresponsibility no previous American administration had ever considered: cutting taxes, increasing government payouts, and simply borrowing the difference.<br><br>When the aftershocks of the dizzying 1987 stock market crash made the first Bush administration veer slightly in the direction of fiscal prudence, in turn, the mild economic contraction that followed was more than enough to allow Clinton to breeze to victory in 1992 with a platform that amounted to very little more than "I’ll make you richer than he will." That’s been the model of American politics ever since; it’s not accidental that the Republican and Democratic plans to "decrease the deficit" under discussion at this moment both involve big increases in government spending, because bribing the electorate and inflating financial bubbles for their benefit are essential to get or keep office these days.<br><br>It’s in this light that the behavior of the two main American political parties over the last thirty years needs to be understood. Since 1984, the Democrats’ strategy has been to denounce the Republicans during each presidential campaign and then, once in office, copy GOP policies letter for letter, with the occasional sop thrown to their erstwhile allies now and then for form’s sake. The hangdog, foot-scuffing spinelessness displayed repeatedly by Democratic politicians in the face of Republican pressure, I’ve come to believe, has its roots here; it’s hard to stand firm against the opposition if you’re covertly imitating all its policies.<br><br>The Republicans, for their part, have traveled an even longer road from their roots than the Democrats. Fifty years ago, the GOP was the party of small government, fiscal prudence, local autonomy, and a healthy distrust of foreign military adventures; for that matter, from the founding of the National Parks by Theodore Roosevelt to the sweeping environmental reforms enacted by Nixon, the GOP had at least as good a record on environmental issues as the Democrats. Had a delegate to a 1960 GOP county convention proposed today’s Republican policies, in other words, he would have been thrown out of the hall with enough force to leave a faceprint on the pavement. The near-total betrayal of its historic commitments and ideals by today’s GOP has left deep scars; I suspect that the shrill fury with which so many Republican spokespeople denounce everyone else comes from the deep and unadmitted discomfort they feel at that betrayal, and their own complicity in it.<br><br>Finally, the behavior of the Bush and Obama administrations in the wake of the 2008 crash needs to be understood in a very different sense than it’s usually given. Much of the economic history of the last thirty years has been driven by the need for the political establishment to keep giving the American public what it demanded, even when those demands could only be met by a series of increasingly risky high-stakes gambles and dubiously legal expedients. The borrow-and-spend Republicans of the Reagan years relied on the ability of global capital markets to absorb an endless supply of US Treasury debt, but the imbalances set in motion by that decision forced each administration deeper into market manipulations than the last.<br><br>The huge financial corporations that played so central a role in the housing bubble, and are equally central to the current attempt to inflate a new bubble, are by all accounts key players in these schemes. Certainly there’s plenty of corruption involved – again, that’s endemic to democracy – and huge and arguably dishonest fortunes are being made, but there’s also the hard fact that the big banks have become crucial organs of US economic policy and will be propped up by any means necessary as long as their usefulness remains. That policy has many goals, to be sure, but maintaining the facade of American prosperity demanded by the electorate, long after every real basis for that prosperity has evaporated, ranks well up among them.<br><br>Does all this mean that the electorate is uniquely responsible for what happened in the wake of the Seventies? It’s hard to think of any sense in which that notion could have meaning. An entire nation made a disastrous wrong turn at that time; millions of people, each in his or her own way, contributed to that wrong turn, and very, very few opposed it. At this stage in the game, trying to affix blame to any narrower subset of the nation may be popular but it’s also useless, as it simply feeds the nihilism this series of posts is anatomizing. Clinging to the fashionable belief in the omnipotence of evil elites is the extreme form of that blame game, and even more useless than most of the others. The hard but necessary task before us, instead, is to come to terms with the fact that our nation made a catastrophic mistake thirty years ago, and that most of us who were alive at that time either backed that mistake or acquiesced in it.<br><br>Ironically enough, given that this series of posts started with a reference to a bit of Seventies popular music, it was another Seventies band – Styx, in the closing lines of the 1975 hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0HBXxzqwTI&amp;feature=fvst"><i>Suite Madam Blue</i></a> – that did as good a job as anyone of stating the challenge we as a nation faced at the close of that decade:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic">America, America, America, America</span><br><span style="font-style: italic">Red White and Blue</span><br><span style="font-style: italic">Gaze in your looking glass</span><br><span style="font-style: italic">You’re not a child any more</span><br><span style="font-style: italic">Red White and Blue</span><br><span style="font-style: italic">Your future is all but past</span><br><span style="font-style: italic">So lift up your heart</span><br><span style="font-style: italic">And make a new start</span><br><span style="font-style: italic">Lead us away from here</span><br><br>We failed that challenge then. In the final part of this series of posts, we’ll talk about the options for meeting it now.

On the other side of hte peak oil blogosphere, Mr. Kunstler's blog seems to be becoming darker and weirder as he tries to defend his political choices and as the commenters become more bitterly partisan. Really- how much does any of this really matter? <br>It's hard not to embrace nihilism when there's such a vacuum of original thought and truth-telling in this time and place. I was born in the early 70's and by the time I reached college, cynicism was the common language spoken by everyone- all of my peers would say something ironic in order to say something else- and still do.

When I first learned about peak oil, Mike Ruppert was who I paid the most attention to, and focused a lot of energy on the elites' role in the situation. After several miserably failed predictions of his, including saying that hurricane Rita would bring down America, I started paying less and less attention to Ruppert and those like him. I never did fall for anything as extreme as David Icke though.<br><br>I've realized that even those who don't go as far as saying the elites are space lizards still attribute things to them that don't jive with normal human experience. Conspiracies happen all the time, look at how many people are convicted of crimes with conspiracy in the name. Obviously the elites do the same sort of thing, but what so many people (including myself in the past) don't think about is that conspiring gets more difficult the more people who are involved. I was having a conversation recently about someone who first was talking about how evil and greedy the elites were, and then that they were all (or at least a large majority) were working together in a grand behind-the-scenes plan to exploit the people. I responded that while there is plenty of exploitation by elites and there are plenty of greedy, power hungry people in those positions, when have you ever seen anything close to that many people get along smoothly. Considering the elites are people, some of them are friends and do conspire, while others hate each other or are rivals, while some would love to control the world if they could, the world is way to complex for that.<br><br>Since I've started firmly taking the position that the American people are still responsible for their decisions, I'm amazed at how many people get to the point of anger when trying to convince me they're not. <br><br>As an example, so many people are blaming Wal-mart for destroying local businesses, I'm certainly no fan of wal-mart either, but wal-mart only can do that because people shop there rather than at the local businesses, of course once the other places have closed up it's true that there's nowhere else left to get some things (I'm not even going to go into which of those things are best done without to begin with). However if when a wal-mart moved in, people ignored it, then it would soon close and the local businesses would be unaffected, and if that happened in many places wal-mart wouldn't be so powerful anymore. Wal-mart is a clear example of those in power following the wants of the masses, if wal-mart hadn't com along some other company would be in the same place, but people still always want to blame the elites.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c5591290306214207845 title="comment permalink">4/20/11, 8:53 PM</a><br><br>

Even given how much we are pushed towards it, resistance &amp; alternatives - if there was a real widespread desire for them, instead of just the desire to wear them as revolutionary garb - are very possible. At least possible with less sacrifice in our country than in occupied Poland in the 80's.<br><br>However, I don't see why such thoughts are antithetical to seeing the conspiracies among certain groups of the privileged and influential? Yes, 1) these group don't control us, and 2) there is no singular, omnipotent, evil "they" -- but certain members of the aristocracy form shifting alliances to get what they want (the Federal Reserve, Iraq, Libya...). Such coalitions (or conspiracies or whatever) can and have been resisted, yes.

Such a concept, imo, doesn't denote the control and direction of events by an elite. Rather Zeitgheist relates to how large swathes of a given population, with the current doyens as mere subsets, having accepted often competing premises about how society should work, react to events - rather than directing them. The competing premises (or inherent tensions) of differing groups don't amend their premises when adverse events occur. They try to find out why the world isn't working according to their premises. They believe they need to change the world rather than amend their premises.<br><br>As events throw up ever more inconsistencies in their premises, they search for other groups to blame for queering their live's ideas (ideals). Also, the doyens of a given society become captured by the Zeitgheist they think they're have control over, and may even believe they've created all by themselves.<br><br>(I would posit there is one fly in the modern ointment, and that is the media. As they shrink and become concentrated into fewer corporate or private entities, they've largely stopped reporting news and become editorials on news items focusing on their own particular biases. Rather than trying to capture the essence of our era, they elide into stereotypicalising those groups or individuals they blame for for the inconsistences thrown up by events. This process becomes, in a manner, a sub-Zeitgheist of its own that reinforces and communicates adverse evebts, in essence, as uncontrollable and therefore liable to conspiracy by someone, some group, somewhere.)<br><br>As a Zeitgheist example, Ireland stopped being a country about 10-15 years ago with a unique culture and society. It was rebranded as Ireland Inc. The doyens of political Ireland became the new business managers. As long as the unregulated free-market premises held true during the housing bubble the ruling Fianna Fail Party ruled the roost. Bankruptcy put an end to that party (in every sense), so we elected new management who sees a queen's visit as an "investment opportunity", and selling the state's profitable infrastructure for peanuts as "sound business". That 10's of 1000's will lose their decent paying jobs with pensions to be replaced by minimum wage workers whilst the new wealthy owners become wealthier leading to more penury and debt accumulation for working folk seems irrelevant to the doyens. [The reasoning: The premises failed, we need to purify the premises and practices. The fall guys: working folk and newly unemployed.] They doyens been truely captured by the prevailing Zeitgheist.<br><br>And the opposition, largely left wing, fall back onto tired and failed policies. My strategy is to look for a new party or group that everyone hates - they, more than likely, represent new thinking. (New gadgets we like, new thinking, not so much.)<br><br>anon-anon<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c3439539855552469611 title="comment permalink">4/20/11, 11:50 PM</a><br><br>

The decline of the American economy for the average worker began in the 1970s.

As a cynic of the first order (The Disappointed) it is hard to accept that the distortion and corruption inherent in the democratic process is somehow open to all members of the society. While "market forces" do work against well financed market campaigns from time to time, it is hard to ignore the fact that the major media organs are owned and therefore, amplifications of the message of five corporate behemoths.<br><br>I will concede that the "smoke filled rooms" of conspiracy theories do not in fact exist, but I can't accept that the corporate interests of profit and power do not tacitly conspire to produce a rigged game. In that the right-wing can point to some "pointy headed liberals" as a secret cabal of "controlling everything," they do so only with the approval and at the behest of the oligarchs. Thus, the "corrupt and irresponsible forces" that emerge behind every democracy are always the same people. As long as money equals speech, those of us digging gardens and not watching the hallucination will be nudged out of the conversation, in this "democracy."<br><br>I also agree that this society is on a path to ruin typical of all failed empires (because empire is a failure every times its tried.) But to say it is ONLY because 'merican's desire for sugary treats, fast cars, and cheap thrills (all things easily marketed) is to ignore the "man behind the curtain," pulling the levers. To dismiss the "man behind the curtain" as a convenient excuse that the people conjure up to absolve themselves of their own responsibility is to ignore that they recognize, either consciously or not, that the "man behind the curtain" is the system itself; The Empire of Consumption. They feel trapped by it. They feel powerless. But they like hot showers, damn it! And sweets. And porn. And violence.

Rather, the puppeteers hide in plain site. To wit: Bush-v-Gore; right in front of our eyes this very important election was handed to the candidate with hundreds of thousands fewer votes. To wit: the Paley Commission; from it society was presented nuclear energy instead of solar or geothermal, the two other choices considered by this overt though obscure commission. Out of the Paley Commission arose Price-Anderson, the product of an "elite" group - the US Congress - though unknown to the vast majority of the citizenry and without which the nuclear power industry could not exist.

At each stage, while feeling somewhat relieved knowing I was doing noble work, I always knew that these efforts were futile because bankers, an elite though hardly secret group, had taken over in plain sight. (Not to mention the fact that renewables can't power what exists no matter how hard we wish it to be true.)<br><br>What you identify as collective societal capitulation is rather the result of the successful enterprise of the hidden-in-plain-sight elite to dumb down society.

For myself, I gave up striving for the type of consistency necessary for guilt or heroism a long time ago, and see my life through the lens of Chaos theory, in the way some of Gleick's interviewees talk about "oscillating."<br><br>I have been at various stations of life's cross an obstructionist, an activist, an acquiescor, an aquisitor, and just poor ol' everyman doing my best with what I had. Graduating high school in 71, it looked inevitable that good changes were coming; all I had to do to be part of it was adopt the outward trappings of the counterculture, disengage from the destructive economy as much as possible, and wait. When that failed to materialize a new age, maybe a little activism to sort of nudge it along. When that failed, a detour into New Age (TM) consciousness biz, in the hopes that Capitalism a la Erhard et al would implement a Hail Mary. The collapse of that dream left the nihilism and irony of the early punk/New Wave scene to at least articulate just how aware I was of how crappy it all was becoming. But, alas, a pose is a poor substitute for a life plan, and eventually I settled down into a somewhat normal life complete with family, career, a little corner of a groovy cohousing version of Leave it to Beaver and most of the trappings of what passes for "normal." Earlier history would suggest that such an ending was unlikely, and indeed it was. No need to belabor the more recent incarnations.<br><br>So why have I bored everyone with the Classics Comics version of the bio? I guess to point out how futile is an attempt to assign guilt/responsibility. We are all, as Whitman said, multitudes. I may have consumed less than my quota of Kunstler's Cheese Doodles in this life, but that doesn't mean I don't leave my own wake of packaging and energy consumption. The question is where to go from here.<br><br>I find myself living a more and more monastic life on a few acres of some of the richest land in the world in one of the poorest counties in America. Many possibilities of direction from here. Some I might even have a choice about.

And it’s taken me a long time to craft this response. I have more issues with this post than the last one. Not that I completely disagree with you… the repetition of attempts like this and the resulting shift right back into BAU shows that there is something we’re missing. I’m reading a bio of Edward R. Murrow, and the parallels of his time to today are scary.<br><br>I see this as the heart of your post: <i>The hard but necessary task before us, instead, is to come to terms with the fact that our nation made a catastrophic mistake thirty years ago, and that most of us who were alive at that time either backed that mistake or acquiesced in it.</i><br><br>You may be preaching to the choir here, with caveats… I accept that your statement about us acquiescing to the “spend, baby, spend” – it fits me in my 20’s to 40’s…I had a veggie garden and bought from thrift stores always, but I worked for the corporate world and spent too much. But after that point I did shift, and started living my convictions… so for the last decade, I don’t see the problem as being me… or you, for that matter. So your definition of “we” eludes me… Frankly, as an ant, I resent being grouped with the grasshoppers! ;-) <br><br>I believe the purpose of looking at responsibility is in order to make correct choices and take better actions. So, it’s good to push back on the meme that the “corrupt elite” is totally responsible for the problem, but neither is it totally “us” (as if there was a homogenous “us”). Yes, there are steps I can take, but only so many. At that point, I still end up getting burned by others’ choices and decisions. So – I am not clear why you are pushing on this point – yes, it’s clear we all made bad choices in the past… how can knowing that fact help us now? Hopefully that is what you cover next time.<br><br><i>nearly all the people who accept the notions I have in mind are convinced that they’re rebelling against conformity by conforming to a belief system shared by nearly everybody else in the country.</i> There is a difference between “a belief system” that has no evidence and a consensus opinion that does have evidence. In your post, it’s very hard to discern how you differentiate that. Is accepting global warming or even the inevitable collapse of our culture “a belief system”? I would say not, because it is evidence-backed. The fact that some people blame “an elite” as an excuse for their own behavior does not necessarily make the elite a fantasy. (Some people use truthful statements as a dishonest cover-up for their behavior; happens every day). When I see those with vast wealth getting away with crimes that would get ordinary people jailed – over and over! – I have to conclude there is a different set of laws for those in power, and that is what I mean when I referred to the elite and their corruption.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c5630517397417797521 title="comment permalink">4/21/11, 8:37 AM</a><br><br>

I stepped away from the majority decades ago. I’m still paying for the results of their actions, even as I make my choices as best I can as the choices narrow.<br><br>I’m simplifying voluntarily, and there are days that I am hard put to justify it to myself, when my “comfort instincts” tell me I have the ability to just crank up the heat or buy some fast food. But I am taking responsibility for my choices… which is why your posting today grates, JMG. I know you don’t want to do an us/them scenario, but it’s just as wrong to ignore the fact that some of us, you included, are making different choices and are not nearly as currently responsible for this inability to respond to peak oil and climate change as the vast majority of Americans are. At this point, the only thing I can see that will change “the majority” are shortages and other consequences that hit them personally. This “recession” (depression) has shifted some people to more conservation, less debt and less waste, and some have even learned to cook from scratch. As the economic problems deepen, more will see or feel the consequences and perhaps feel guilty for a wasteful lifestyle. Or necessity will remove that wasteful lifestyle. That’s what I think it will take, unfortunately.<br><br>My thoughts about “why” the majority can’t or won’t see their part are that it’s not just the instinctive desire for comfort, but the growing complexity of the system that removes or distances the physical consequences from our actions. Also, the vastly speeded-up pace of our lives is a major factor (I believe) in our inability to see the problem, and our inability to find time to deal with it. I am finding that simplifying my life gives me more time to read/review the issues, but my friends have no time to discuss it with me! <br><br>I feel more discouraged to hear what I believe you are saying, JMG. Okay, so there is a pervasive popular laziness &amp; denial of responsibility that is destroying (has destroyed) the country’s moral fiber… it seems even less possible to shift a force <b>that large</b> than to vote out a bunch of corrupt politicians or sue a bunch of crooked corporations. From co-housing, I remember one elder saying, ‘What takes one man one hour to do takes ten people ten hours to do”… and he was right! No chance the change can come in time to prevent a fall… <br><br>@Richard <i>However if when a wal-mart moved in, people ignored it, then it would soon close and the local businesses would be unaffected, and if that happened in many places wal-mart wouldn't be so powerful anymore.</i> But the point I see here is that there always seems to be a huge mass who are willing to do the morally lazy thing! When in history has it ever been the (as opposed to a small group) who made big changes?? Masses may follow (chaotically) but they don’t lead, as far as I can tell. I have been bitterly disappointed during my early years while waiting for “people” to do the right thing. In my fifties, I’ve stopped hoping for that. <br><br>This is probably my most negative post… I see myself as a realist, not a nihilist. The only real change I can create is in my own life, and I hope that it will impact others, too. But I have seen too many years of repeating political patterns to be anything but a sceptic about political change, and a couple decades of grassroots activism has soured me on that, too.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c1102400412033360562 title="comment permalink">4/21/11, 8:39 AM</a><br><br>

A troubled conscience makes scapegoating an easy out. <br><br>GHung, good question. Given that chimps fight the occasional war, it's not all that improbable that their politics are akin to ours. <br><br>Matthew, I don't think they'll calm down much. <br><br>Jeff, it's my hope that some of these recollections might help your generation skip some of the mistakes mine made. <br><br>Richard, the Mall*Wart example is a good one. Not all that long ago, the boycott was a very effective way for communities to express their feelings in cases like that; it's a sign of the times that so many people grouse about Mall*Wart but still shop there. (I've never spent a penny at one, for whatever that's worth.) <br><br>Nathan, of course there are conspiracies -- any number of them, as often as not competing with one another. The coterie of Republican strategists I mentioned in my blog could be considered one of them; so could the Neoconservatives, etc., etc. The point I hoped to make is that, as my post said, manipulation works both ways; an assortment of power centers, conspiratorial or otherwise, compete to push the public one way or another, and the public pushes back in various directions of its own. <br><br>Loveandlight, I think most of us went through the experience of discovering that people we hoped would be the solution were one more part of the problem. I'll be addressing that in more detail in next week's post. <br><br>Robin, I was born here, and the wanton wastefulness -- nice phrase, that -- still makes my jaw drop. That's going to be central to a future post, also. <br><br>Charles, a number of us here had been unsure whether a post containing as many absurdities as yours could have been meant seriously, or whether it was an unusually subtle joke. Thanks for ciarifying. <br><br>X, it's important to remember that the seitgeist of any age is contested and provisional -- that is, there are always multiple narratives in any society competing for dominance, and different sectors of society hold to one or another narrative as it suits their interests and emotional needs. The sudden shifts in zeitgeist, such as the one at the end of the Seventies I've been discussing, are well worth studying with this in mind. <br><br>Avery, that's quite true. I think there was more going on than simply the impact of economic contraction, but that did have a major role to play. As for the prospect of an authoritarian government, well, that's unquestionably one of the risks we run. <br><br>Tim, and you could produce just as detailed a flow chart showing, first, how different power centers compete and conflict with one another, and second, how various sectors of the public choose which of the competing narratives they want to believe or, quite often, make up one of their own. The result isn't functionally equivalent to a man pulling strings; if anything, it looks more like a man entangled in strings!<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c255574780310591202 title="comment permalink">4/21/11, 9:29 AM</a><br><br>

It only just occurred to me that turquoise tracksuits are what you get when you stare at one of the red alien jumpsuits from <i>V</i> for a while, then look at a blank white wall and let the complementary color image appear...<br><br>Tiago, let's see. You pull a passing comment out of context, twist it around to say something I didn't say, combine it with a complete non sequitur -- North Africa isn't ruled by hereditary aristocracies last I checked -- and use it to beat up on a straw man. That's trolling. If you'd like to make a constructive contribution to this blog, you're going to have to do better than that. <br><br>Ward, I've discussed the viewpoint you've offered here at some length already in the post. The fact that there are people, plenty of them, who try to use their wealth and influence to get what they want -- nd sometimes succeed -- doesn't make them omnipotent, or erase the fact that the narrative of elite rule is a convenient evasion of our own responsibility for the future our own actions are shaping. <br><br>Thijs, er, stating that democracy has persistent problems with corruption doesn't mean that all other systems lack such problems. Military dictatorships are among the other systems that do. As for northern European democracies, well, see Jason Heppenstall's comment further down. <br><br>Sage, you'll notice the phrase "very, very few" in the post, if you reread it. <br><br>Scott, as I said to Richard early on in the comments, they're on the hook alongside the rest of us. The point that seems to get lost here is that a great many of the decisions that mattered, and still matter, are being made by individuals in their own lives, and blaming the elite of your choice for their bad decisions is all too often a means of ignoring our own equally bad decisions. <br><br>Mark, that speech deserves a great deal of attention here and now. <br><br>Mageprof, I'm very fond of the Churchill quote in particular. <br><br>Gruff, okay, you've identified your candidate for "corrupt [adjective] elite that pulls all the strings." So? I've already stated my reasons for finding that entire narrative unhelpful and inaccurate. <br><br>Hal, excellent. It's exactly the habit of playing the blame game -- trying to point fingers at the bankers, or the corporations, or the liberals, or the conservatives, or the evil space lizards, or whoever, so we don't have to look ourselves in the mirror -- that distracts us from doing what has to be done. <br><br>Chris, you're in a profoundly challenging spot. You're quite right; choices made before you were born set you up for a difficult future, in which most of the promises made to you are going to come up empty. Perhaps the hardest thing to do is to face that, accept it, and then get to work on what you can do from here on in -- but that's also the only choice that offers any real hope for the future.

You'll notice that it didn't make African American people shut up and go to the back of the bus in the 1950s South. <br><br>Cathy, good. I'd point out in response that first, the value of seeing our mistake as a collective matter is that it helps pop us out of the blame game that absorbs so much misplaced energy these days, and it also has a lot to teach us about how not to make the same mistakes. Second, that a consensus opinion that can't agree on who the evil elite is, just that there has to be one somewhere, is not a consensus opinion, but rather an act of faith, and the evidence that's presented to back it up actually is better explained by my model of diverse power centers competing against each other to catch the fancy of a public with its own multiple and conflicting agendas. <br><br>As for the rest, I'm not proposing a return to failed models of political activism, or denying that a very large number of people in this country, having sold out for material wealth and comfort, won't cling to those as long as they can, no matter what the cost.

(Previously, they were elected by state legislatures.) This amendment dealt a (fatal?) blow to federalism in the United States, though it was certainly aided by the Supreme Court and its expansive interpretation of the commerce clause...<br><br>Also consider that the membership of the House of Representatives has held steady at 435 since the 1920s, even though the population of the U.S. has more than doubled since then. <br><br>The point is that the federal government's power over our lives has grown enormously over the last century, but the mechanisms of controlling it have weakened. The states have no say in the federal government and the average representative now speaks for ~700,000 Americans. The Federal Reserve (apparently accountable to no one) controls our currency. And on top of it all, Americans have abandoned civic organizations and regularly give their (increasingly worthless) dollars to global corporations which do not care about local communities.<br><br>But then again, a powerful federal government capable of dolling out patronage and enforcing its will across an area as expansive and diverse as the United States is only possible in light of cheap energy. <br><br>If nothing else, the dysfunctional arrangement of our government is yet another reason why the most useful preparations are best done at an individual or community level.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c4859632206591864110 title="comment permalink">4/21/11, 10:14 AM</a><br><br>

There are elites and there is corruption, but it has always been so and democracy does not eliminate this, it just changes the form. The level of corruption and influence has waxed and waned over the years, but it always riles me when people pine for some idealized vision of the good old days when the American experiment was pure. Um, when exactly was that? They can influence things significantly from a short time and local perspective, but long term there are bigger forces driving the directions we take – the kinds of things always drive the rise and fall of societies.<br><br>In the '70s high energy prices due to scarcity were causing real pain, and there were two competing visions of how to deal with that. One said that through hard work and sacrifice we could push on through to something better, the other said we could just forget about it and go back to our comfortable ways. The people chose the later. Intellectually I never agreed, but in reality I enjoyed the car culture greatly – at least until I could no longer ignore the costs.<br><br>There are other examples too. Prior to the establishment of a global empire after WWII and the age of oil kicking into high gear, the nation was under considerable social stress driven by class warfare and the imbalance of wealth distribution. There were large workers organizations and many people very committed to real changes in the structure of power. The elites fought them with anything and everything they could get away with, but it was not clear at all how it would work out and it could have gone very differently than it did. But the war and the riches of empire and oil took the fire out of it – prosperity destroyed the will to pursue that social change.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c7732900233817320143 title="comment permalink">4/21/11, 10:38 AM</a><br><br>

A very large painting depicted the Chief in the typical modern/traditional get up that you see at pow-wows.

He even had a craggly face, flowing silver-gray hair and a twinkle in his eyes. Floating in the air above the landscape and his welcome gesture were just the words:<br><br>"Have Fun"<br><br>Taken out of the context of the casino, the painting could have been construed as a nugget of Native Wisdom.

I am, however, a firm believer in the phrase “Them that has gets,” or what a system thinker might call, “Success to the successful.” I’m also a believer of “what gets measured gets done.” The two dynamics work together to make the world we have today. Here’s a small example:<br><br>“Success to the successful” is a self-reinforcing feedback loop that shows its ugly head everywhere (Ugly that is unless it’s you that “has”). Years ago my son played little league baseball (he was 8 or 9). The coach set the batting order based on how well a player hit in the previous game. Anyone who appreciates 5-inning, little league baseball knows that the early part of the batting order gets more at-bats than the later part. Thus the good hitters got more practice. When I pointed this out to the coach he looked at me like I was a communist. <br><br>Meanwhile… Despite all the evidence that shows kids just want to play, most coaches thought it was all about the win. Win/loss was the measure and that’s’ what the coaches tried to get done. Therefore, they put their best batters early in the batting order. See “Success to the successful” above.<br><br>Imagine these reinforcing behaviors playing out when money or power is involved and you can see how we got where we are now. There is no one to blame. No one person is the “bad guy,” it’s the system. That same system drives people to shop at Walmart, invent credit default swaps, or do anything they can to prevent a Florida recount.<br><br>Unfortunately, few see the system (I’ve heard it called “system blindness”). Instead we see politicians, corporations, greedy investors, or some government program and we blame them.<br><br>Every once in a while, someone comes along who sees a system and is in a position to do (or try to do) something about it. Roosevelt and the New Deal, Jimmy Carter and oil, Al Gore and climate change come to mind.<br><br>Mark<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c5980578543067694250 title="comment permalink">4/21/11, 6:34 PM</a><br><br>

It probably shouldn't be necessary to point out that the fact that someone disagrees with you doesn't mean that they didn't do their homework, or that personal potshots of the sort you're engaging in here aren't a particularly useful addition to a conversation. Since apparently it's necessary, I'd encourage you to go learn civility somewhere else. <br><br>Mark, that's true, but success isn't something that can be measured with a single yardstick, especially in a society as complex as this one. One of the main sources of political conflict, in fact, is precisely that people are rarely successful in more than one field; a financier can be very good at getting rich and very poor at attracting a mass following, while a guy who is good at getting elected may find out the hard way that the guy who's better at leading a military coup has a skill that can trump his. Meanwhile you also get coalitions among those who aren't quite so good at getting rich or getting elected, and want to avoid being steamrollered by those who are, and the dance goes on. It's these patterns, endlessly repeated, that keep the reality of political process far more interesting than the simplistic notions in fashion these days.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c11183592331344836 title="comment permalink">4/21/11, 7:20 PM</a><br><br>

Bravo. Thank you for your criticism of nihilism. It really is an insidious psychological reaction. While reading your post, I thought a couple of times, "Americans are nihilistic because it is just the way they are." How nihilistic of me. I think your point is that we do not have a good excuse not to be living the right way ie low energy, independent, and with traditional principles of hardwork and sacrifice. The path to the right way is there for everyone and the obstacle is more in our minds and social perceptions than in physics.

Need shoes re-set on that horse." Farmer A takes said horse to nearest farrier or neighbor or whoever does local blacksmithing. That is, the need occurs, then the 'needy' look for a solution.<br><br>Now enter merchandising and marketing - increasing profits by creating a need that didn't previously exist. Not by sneaking into Farmer A's barn and jerking the shoe off the horse. But by communicating to Farmer A that he has a problem, and product B will solve it. <br><br>You might send a postcard, email, phone message, or even traveling farrier to Farmer A, and ask "Does your horse need our shoes yet?" Farmer A must then decide if that wouldn't be a good idea (he has to defeat the claim, or call the originator a liar for intimating that Farmer A didn't know enough to keep his horse safely shod, and that the originator's shoes would be better for the horse and for Farmer A than simply re-setting the shoes that have been working well since the last time).<br><br>Politicians and marketing concerns all use the "we have the answer to your discomforts, to your enemies, to your ignorance, and to your other problems" approach. Magazine ads and newspaper ads interrupt the narrative of the content that is supposed to be the product. Ads on web sites, and especially on TV and radio programs deliberately and intrusively interrupt.<br><br>America's basic form of communication, for those that haven't chosen to spend much of their day *away* from electronic media, is marketing. If your basic identity and default mode of communication is marketing propaganda - how can you not look to some well-communicating originator to solve any enemy, discomfort, impediments to your ambition, or other problems?<br><br>I grew up hearing "the proof is in the pudding". Today it seems the expectation is "the best pudding is the one that sells best". That is, the first response to marketing propaganda is assumed to solve the problem, and not the Scientific Method/six step troubleshooting paradigm, where you continue until the problem is fixed, and you verify that the fix you applied actually was the reason that the problem was corrected.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c4053921212584668762 title="comment permalink">4/22/11, 7:16 AM</a><br><br>

As any economist will incessantly remind you - people respond to incentives, and when the corporate powers managed to bring conventional energy sources down to bargain basemenet-level costs, alternative energy was unable to follow suit. Why would anyone install a 50,000 dollar solar array or take public transportaion when gasoline was under 99 cents a gallon? Of course, a farsighted approach would recognize the ephemeral nature of this arrangement and the inevitable backlash, but the average person is just going about their daily life just trying to pay the monthly bills and not thinking about the long-term good of the country. That is the type of thing our political leaders are theoretically paid to do. So you can't really blame the average American for embracing the conventional gas-guzzling lifestyle, given the incentives thye were facing. Its as much a question of economics as politics or sociology.<br>The backlash against the conservation ethic of the seventies had many facets - cultural counterreaction of the sixties, working class resentment of activist government, resurgent business power. By coincidence, there was a good post by Yves Smith on Naked Capitalism Thursday on a very similat topic, although considering it from the point of view of the why the US government abandoned any concern over the living standrds of average American and only concerned iteself with ways to increase corporate profits. She refers to a book by Hacker and Pierson -Winner Take All Politics, with extensive quotes from a review in the London Review of Books by David Runciman. For example, from Runciman's review:<br><br><i>One of Hacker and Pierson’s complaints about the way we usually regard politics is that we miss what’s really going on by focusing on the show of elections and the competition between parties. This is the theatre of electoral politics…‘This is no doubt why politics as electoral spectacle is so appealing to the media: it’s exciting and it’s simple.</i><br><br><i>What took place in the 1980s was therefore an extension of the Carter years, not a reversal of them. The process of deregulation and redistribution up the chain accelerated under Reagan, who was broadly sympathetic to these goals. Yet it happened not because he was sympathetic to them, but because his sympathies were allowed free rein in a political environment where the opposition was muted and the expected coalition of interests opposed to the changes never materialised.</i><br><br>The full post is here:<br><a href=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/04/musings-on-plutocracy.html rel=nofollow>http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/04/musings-on-plutocracy.html</a><br><br>Some good comments here too. W<br>hile it does not deal with the environmental movement per se, it does illustrate some of the shifts that indirectly affected that movement. You might find it instructional in fleshing out your thesis. I would also recomment Jefferson Cowie's book Staying Alive: The Last Days of the Working Class in America.

The documentary <i>One Percent</i> really opened my eyes to this. The Johnson &amp; Johnson family that inherited the wealth from the company's founder took no responsibility for their practices, or for the top 1%'s share of exploitation. It was almost as if it was too painful for them to feel like the 'bad guy'. The father of the filmmaker made a documentary about Apartheid Africa, and was threatened with being cut off from the family fund for it, and in the same vein, discouraged his son when he was shooting <i>One Percent</i>.<br><br>I look at the state of the world and go "Damn, I was born into a period of decline. How am I going to make it?" Again and again, from Peak Oil activists to permaculturists to spiritual activists and anyone willing to speak up, speak out, and do something, is "Take personal responsibility." It's painfully obvious to me, that regardless of party, political affiliation, or religion, most people have turned a blind eye to what models of sustainability are all but screaming at us. The hard question comes for people who are unestablished in either finance or a job/career, who are trying to work our way to being able to at least live on our own. With Peak Oil looming, and with so few of people in college having practical skills (Hey, I can <i>not</i> burn a packet of Ramen now!) I worry about my generation's ability to cope with what is coming. I don't expect everything to fall apart at once, but I wonder at times about the practical skills needed to survive the end of oil and cheap energy.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c619562048004780439 title="comment permalink">4/22/11, 1:09 PM</a><br><br>

So I will attempt to be milder this time. I fully appreciate the issue of nihilism heights, raised by JMG. But this second part only underscores <a href=http://healthafteroil.wordpress.com/2011/04/11/%E2%80%9Cbut-you%E2%80%99ve-offered-no-solutions%E2%80%9D-an-illustration-of-kuhn%E2%80%99s-incommensurability-thesis/ rel=nofollow>incommensurability</a> of mine and JMG’s understanding or experience. <br><br>First of all, I am annoyed by yet another displayed equivalence of “liberal” and “conservative” politics. Even in this example, a distinction between the clear almost guaranteed immunity of corporate cats and common liberals’ caricatures is too blatant for my mind. But the issue is not whether liberals or conservatives are serious about solving sustainability problems, or whether any of them deserve to be righteous. The issue is that this equivalence is exactly a part of that nihilism we are talking about. Ironically, this equivalence was first industrially applied in 2000, during the Bush-Gore campaign. By now I don’t believe that Gore would have done much to change the self-destructive course of the industrial society. But at least he would had put on a show some deviating moves - which would had been somewhat more interesting than the “cut more taxes, drill more oil” bore. With this nihilism, there is no real pressure neither on the politics that gives all green lights towards collapse, nor on the politics that is supposed to oppose that.<br><br>As for the denial of elite connivance, it is less funny than Moon landings denials. I grew up in the former Soviet block, where people were supposed to figure out real intentions of the party by cryptical means. Now the Japanese have to understand the Fukushima situation by comparable Eastern hints. And here, even on this blog, we are told not to think about <i>that</i>. The explanation by democratic preferences is just as lazy as by space lizards. Even in 1984, the “landslide” public votes differential was not great - and we won’t start to talk about 2000, 2004. It is obvious now that Obama and the Democrats are not enacting policies that majority of the electorate approves- they just let Foxnews, think tanks explain polls and supposed electorate preferences. In a sense, yeah, the voters choice is now openly pointless. Nihilism has won irreversibly. Plus, we may wonder why all other nations are making the same disastrous choices, from France to China and Japan, from Chile to Poland to Iraq. Are the electorates equally weak, or the same kit of <i>democratic</i> methods applied?<br><br>As I tried to argue last week, certain conspiracy awareness actually raises personal responsibility and pushes for probably appropriate adaptation and action.

It's difficult to see how these definitions apply to so-called democratic governments.<br><br>I also don't see that the cause of corruption in our politics is democracy. You've stated it but I don't think have given a reason why. Sure, you've effectively stated that humans are humans and greed/desire will lead to corruption but I don't see that democracy, as such, is the only way that such corruption could occur or that such corruption is inevitable with a democracy. Doesn't that depend on how that democracy is enacted? Look at the definitions of democracy, it's hard to tell whether western nations have ever had a true democracy and maybe true democracies are impossible at the national scale.<br><br>Abandonment of the move to sustainability, in the 70s? Well, I may have been young in the 70s (late teens to late 20s) but I don't recall a movement towards sustainability, only towards efficiency, conservation and a greater awareness of nature. All that doesn't lead to sustainability unless sustainability is an outright aim. I don't think it ever was. Indeed, I think that if that movement was at all successful, sustainability would still not be on the agenda, because depletion of resources and degradation of the environment wouldn't have progressed as much as it has, thus leading to the illusion that whatever society we'd have moved to could go on forever. It may have been a green movement but I don't think it was a sustainability movement.<br><br>I certainly agree, though, that we all (or most of us) acquiesced to the change of direction. I'm really sad that I didn't see what was coming, 30 years ago (not just in the US). Or perhaps I did but didn't want it to be true.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c326307889801254820 title="comment permalink">4/23/11, 3:43 AM</a><br><br>

You're certainly right that as things currently stand, that's hardly an option. <br><br>Andrew, I'm frankly more interested in what individuals can do, but small groups are certainly the next logical step after that. <br><br>Das Monde, it never fails to amaze me how I can say in so many words that there's plenty of manipulation and corruption in American (and of course other) societies, and still have people insist that I'm denying that that exists. Being aware of the existence of corruption and manipulation is important; convincing oneself that the corrupt and manipulative are wholly responsible for the world we're in, and our own choices had nothing to do with it, is an evasion. <br><br>As for the 2000 election, er, you might want to look up the 1960 election one of these days; the electoral fraud that put JFK in the White House was far more egregious than anything Dubya managed. Still, I can probably repeat both those points until I'm blue in the face and you still won't hear it. <br><br>Rita, many thanks for the link! That's a useful data point. <br><br>Matthew, no doubt. Still, we've got the advantage of some very good books he wrote before his death. <br><br>Jason, bingo. Note the weird fusion of energy myths and conspiracy theories; we've got that in spades over here. <br><br>Sofistek, I'd argue that you've got the question "what is democracy" by the wrong end. Of course it's possible to fantasize about a democracy that lives up to its own propaganda, but such a system is as mythical as free markets and unicorns. My point is that what we've got, warts and all, is the way democracy actually works in practice, and the confusion between democracy as it exists in reality and democracy as we like to imagine it is one of the sources of contemporary American nihilism. <br><br>Loveandlight, I've been there, and yes, the uneasiness of the fashionably radical when faced with honest idealism is a real factor. <br><br>Archivist, I'm trying to find a middle ground in a nation where everybody wants to find somebody else to blame for their troubles. If that requires abandoning a popular notion of what the plot is for the sake of greater clarity, that's what it requires. As for Soleri, I'm not a huge fan of his, but he certainly had some fascinating ideas and is probably worth a close second look. <br><br>Brad, I think it was Stuart Udall who said that American politics has only two modes -- complacency and panic. It's when we shift over to the second of those modes that it might just be possible to get something done, but it's going to require some very specific preparations here and now. More on this next week. <br><br>Hawlkeye, an excellent point. I'd say that learning to keep a keen eye out for manipulation and corruption is a crucial skill, and needn't be combined with the notion that those two forces are omnipotent in contemporary politics. <br><br>Walter, oh, for heaven's sake. I didn't accuse you of using the Nuremberg defense, but simply of fixating on an overly narrow sense of who to blame. Also, I'm not in the business of trying to be respectable, whether to the cultural mainstream or to existing activist factions; I'm trying to talk about some very challenging and, at least to modern Americans, counterintuitive ideas, and it's pretty much inevitable that people are going to get their egos bruised in that process.

For example, Bush was elected, for his first term, not only by a minority of those who voted but also by less than those who voted for his main opponent. Currently, the make up of the Senate doesn't represent a mjority vote. In Britain, the current government is the first in my memory (I'm 57) that could be said to represent a majority of voters, though no-one voted for a coalition. In my country, New Zealand, governments are typically coalitions, with the tail often wagging the dog, so that the main party can stay in power. And so on and so on.<br><br>It may not be possible to have a society as large as most nations and still have a democracy in the true sense of the word but that doesn't mean it can be argued that democracy is the cause of the inequality and corruption that we see.

And since I wrote it, that's my fault, not yours. Sorry. Allow me to try again. <br><br>People want to blame people (like the rich elites). When they don't have people to blame, they blame gods. (It's even in contract language as "acts of god").<br><br>I'm suggesting that it is the systems we live in that are the problem not the people. The people are just doing what the system dictates. How does the system work? That is the $64,000 question. The systems are made up of written and unwritten rules, rewards, punishments, etc. People respond to these rules, rewards, punishments etc. and we get what we've got. <br><br>Here is yet another example. In our town, they instituted a $25 fee to throw out an old television. This makes sense right? TVs are hazardous waste and it cost money to dispose of them. The owner should pay for that. Unfortunately, shortly after the fee was imposed, I would notice dead TVs showing up on one of the less traveled dirt roads near my home. The person (or organization) who imposed the fee either didn't think through how people would behave or figured that cleaning up TVs from the side of the road was a good use of taxpayer's dollars. <br><br>Most of us are good at seeing the big or obvious consequences, but not so good at seeing the small ones or the connections between cause and effect (the unintended consequences). A systems thinker, on the other hand, attempts to see the all the moving parts and tries to understand how they interact. Once the moving parts are understood, then adjustments to these system are more likely to have their desired effect while minimizing the undesirable or unintended consequences. <br><br>Unfortunately, understanding human systems is exceedingly difficult. It often takes years of studying the systems just to learn all the moving parts let alone understand the cause and effect relationship between those moving parts. <br><br>So back to the original point - there is no one to blame, it is just the system doing what it does. Fixing the system is the problem. So understand the moving parts and how they work together. Strategically adjust. See what happens. Adjust some more. Rinse and repeat.<br><br>-Mark<br><br><br>Footnote 1: There are wonderful (but expensive) tools out there for modeling systems (some of your readers are likely familiar with "iThink" http://www.iseesystems.com/softwares/Business/ithinkSoftware.aspx) System models help in the understanding and are a great way to document a system. But remember what the mathematician George Box said, "All models are lies, some models are useful."<br><br>Footnote 2: For those of you tired of Blogger killing your long and well thought out comments, there is a Firefox (Chrome and Safari too) Plug-in call Lazarus that captures (encrypts, and saves) what you type in web forms. http://lazarus.interclue.com/<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c4064724188421770646 title="comment permalink">4/23/11, 3:58 PM</a><br><br>

What you're calling a true democracy is a fiction; it doesn't exist, never has existed, and in all probability never will exist. It's as imaginary as a unicorn, and it's about as useful to bring it into a conversation about real systems of government as it is to bring unicorns into a discussion of draft animals. <br><br>Now of course we could decide to use the word "democracy" for that imaginary beast, and then fumble around with all sorts of pejoratives for the way actual democracies (your "so-called" democracies) work, but that's about as useful as calling horses "unicorns" and then denouncing them because they don't have horns. Why not instead clarify things by recognizing that the word "democracy" represents a system of government where the more important political offices are filled by elections in which most citizens have the right to vote, leave it at that, and look for ways to improve that flawed but functional system, instead of dragging in fantasies about "true" (that is, untrue, because unreal) democracy? <br><br>As for your comment about the sustainability movement, as I mentioned in my post, it was a very complex movement involving many different agendas. Some of those, including most of the ones I've cited specifically, were indeed focused on sustainability as a long-term goal, though of course there were others that weren't, and everyone realized that getting to sustainability was a very long road with a lot of intermediate steps. <br><br>Vera, I'm sorry to say Blogger doesn't save deleted messages -- and it also doesn't put your email on posts, so I'd have had nowhere to send it!

I don't know whether this is a simplification or not.<br><br>What I do worry about is food. The large scale agricultural practices in place today mean that we literally eat oil. It takes quite a few years, a lot of manual labour and initially reduced yields to transition to an organic approach to agriculture. Even with organic approaches, you can't send too much produce off site because you are then strip mining the soil and will eventually run short of some nutrients or minerals. You have to balance up the inputs and outputs. I use oil to bring fertility into this place and I understand what this means for the future and "somewhere else".

Still, I think seeing the system as the issue oversimplifies, because people don't just respond passively to the system, and the system itself isn't static. Rather, the behavior of the system and that of the individuals who work within it coevolve in complex ways. It's the inflection points of that process of coevolution that are important here -- the switch, again, from a period when the system provided incentives for saving energy to a period where the system provided incentives for wasting it.

I’ll have to start saving stuff before posting. I mistakenly thought it works like wordpress. (Thank you for the Lazarus tip, Mark! :-)<br><br>I see that your entire this week’s argument hangs on your contention that what we have is a democracy, an assumption many of us obviously reject. Is a system rightly called a democracy if most adults can vote people into political offices? That’s a pretty thin definition, isn’t it? But even that depends on a lot of things: whether the votes are clean (a dubious proposition in this day of computerized trackless votes), whether the candidates who can afford to run are legitimate or mostly moneyed-interest spokespeople, whether the people in those political offices are in any meaningful way responsive to those who elect them, whether the people in those political offices are indeed the people who govern, or whether those who actually govern are different folks, unelected and unresponsive to popular will, and whether the so called popular will actually makes any difference on how things are done. <br><br>I am one of the people who believe that on all of these counts, we do not have democracy. I would say that we have governance by the rich and powerful, and most of them are unelected and come from the ranks of financial, corporate and other elites. Last I checked, such a system was called a plutocracy. I don’t think you can legitimately argue that just because we want to believe we live in a democracy, and this is so far the best we could do here in America, this is a democracy. If it quacks like a plutocracy…<br><br>You say, then democracy is a dream and never was. Well, not so. Many Indian tribes had governance by the demos, one way or another. Some New England towns had governance by the town meeting, i.e. the demos, or close to it. And Pennsylvania enacted a rather profoundly democratic constitution in 1776 (remarkable for its time; even blacks could vote). It was eventually undermined and scuttled by the Federalists, whose vision of America was different. I believe that Vermont and Rhode Island too had democratic constitutions. The Constitution of the United States did away with those state-level democracies, and was pushed through via a whole slew of dirty tricks. After that, what we ended up with has been called democracy but isn’t. (And there are, of course, certain foreign system that are quite a bit more democratic than the system we have here in the States.)<br><br>In my view, the lie that we live in a democracy has been one of the biggest, most successful con jobs of the last 250 years.

Oil supplies may be depleting, but they aren't going away all at once, and while they're still available you can bet that (a) nations will do anything they can to get as much as they can, and (b) the world's militaries will get as much of the remaining supply as can be spared, as long as it can be spared, to maximize their ability to grab the rest. <br><br>Vera, no, my distinction between real and imaginary democracies is not the keystone of my argument, and I'm baffled that you think it is. From my perspective, you (and a lot of other people) have gotten hung up on the word "democracy" and are treating it as though it's a synonym for "good," instead of simply a label for a certain kind of political system with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. Thus you think I'm saying that America is "good," and rejecting that label with some heat, because it conflicts with your conviction that America is "bad." That's not what I'm saying at all. <br><br>I'm saying that no matter what label you want to pin on the contemporary Americal political system, if you use arguments based on that label to insist that everything that's wrong is the doing of some minority of people who you don't like, and who you claim have total control over society, you're doing yourself, your society, and the possibility of constructive change a huge disservice. I'd point out by way of evidence that the last three decades has seen your point of view become ever more deeply entrenched in the American left, and that same period has also seen the American left lose every battle it's tried to fight. I suggest that the attitude has helped cause those failures, just as the belief by a lot of people on the left in previous decades that constructive change was possible within the existing order of society was a crucial factor in making change happen -- as in fact it did, on numerous occasions.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c2391510140237436098 title="comment permalink">4/23/11, 9:13 PM</a><br><br>

It ended in the summer of 1970, when unarmed students were shot to death at Jackson State and Kent State by National Guard troops who were ordered to put down the demonstrations against the War in Vietnam. <br><br>Nixon referred to the students as "criminals", and it seemed that it was open season on us. <br><br>It was made clear that we had two choices: 1) rejoin "The System" and become good little consumers again or 2) arm ourselves and start<br>shooting back.<br><br>Almost everyone decided not to resort to physical force. <br><br>I recall that 1971 had the feeling of a sullen, defeated, rag-tag hippie army being marched off at gunpoint and sentenced to life at an "Arbeit Macht Frei" Consumerland. <br><br>The few that decided to use force did not come to a good end. They<br>accomplished virtually nothing, and often got themselves and/or other people killed in the process.

Neither am I saying that America = bad. I grew up under communism and I daresay I can tell the difference. I simply don’t think the word democracy fits this system. Iceland, where women banging pots and pans through the night brought down a government has a reason to call itself a democracy. America… not so much.<br><br>I doubt I will make any headway, since you have determined that those of us who believe (IMO with plenty of justification), that America is ruled by an elite – namely, the people who hold most of the wealth and most of the power – are wrong. So let me point folks who wish to double check your claim, as follows.<br><br>Locally. Plenty of evidence that most localities are ruled by growth coalitions of local landowners, businessmen, uni-people if there is a college, local bankers and so on, all the people who profit by growth, growth, growth. Check out professor Domhoff’s website, Who Rules America, here:<br>http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/<br><br>On the national level, the situation is similar, and financial elites and their friends hold sway. Evidence? Why do you think all the Wall Street crimes and Ponzi schemes have gone unpunished and unchanged? Why is it that the Fed can simply refuse the Congress access to its accounting? The uncontroversial evidence, much quoted, shows that most of the power and wealth in this country is held by a very small elite which is getting much richer, while the rest are growing poorer. That is the gist of elite rule. Most of these people are not in elected positions, and are unreachable to voter influence. <br><br>I do not claim “that everything that wrong is the doing of some minority of people whom [I] don’t like.” I am taking offense at your original claim, which said that those who believe America is governed by an elite which is [mostly] unelected and unaccountable, are wrong, are conventionally minded, and are nihilists. <br><br>Now you can call those of us who see the evidence plain as day names, and I admit you got my goat with that. But how does that help anything? I do believe that American people do have ways to change things, but it will be extremely difficult, and it certainly will not happen through the pablum of “vote” and “call your Congresspeople” and the like. The left (and whoever is still sane on the right) have not failed because they correctly note the profound sway of the elites. They have failed (in large part) because the system was built to put massive checks on the rule of the people, and much effort has been wasted by assuming otherwise. To this effect, I heavily recommend a little book called Taming Democracy, by Terry Bouton, who describes in great and engaging detail exactly what happened in the last decades of the 18th century in Pennsylvania. It’s my “book of the year” and the information Bouton conveys is vital to anyone who wants to understand the levers of power gone awry.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c713066949555314887 title="comment permalink">4/24/11, 8:31 AM</a><br><br>

Interestingly, very few of their political forms would be considered perfectly democratic.<br><br>However, the Athenian philosophers (e.g. Plato) also had another insight into the meaning of what an "idea" is. One way of looking at this is that they took a view that the perfect form of anything could only be conceived of subtly (as an idea, or more) - everything in the manifest material world was an imperfect copy.<br><br>For example, a perfect circle can be conceived in your mind, but can never be fully realised in reality. Even the most precise technology becomes an approximation at the nano-scale.<br><br>So applying this to the idea of democracy: the idea of the perfect form of democracy is important because it guides our vision and implementation in our politics, even if the manifest forms are "imperfect". <br><br>Ultimately I suspect that any system is subject to decay and corruption - it is only in the vigilance and creativity of human beings that these manifest forms can be maintained and evolved to meet the circumstances - preferably guided by the subtle vision of the perfect forms.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c8529029188948959632 title="comment permalink">4/24/11, 12:30 PM</a><br><br>

Since we don't live in a democracy, corruption is inevitable, as you say. Consequently, this version of democracy doesn't deserve our support at all, it deserves our disgust.<br><br>Of course, if one supposes that no other version is possible, at the nation scale, then we either accept that, and deal with it, or push for localisation of democracy, just as our lives should be more localised, anyway, in a sustainable society.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c4305755953302523708 title="comment permalink">4/24/11, 2:24 PM</a><br><br>

Furthermore, I believe that the more empowered, aware, informed, competent and clear about our values that each of us is, then the more effective we are likely to be in bringing about the structural and institutional changes that are required.

Without a whimper or a threat, they packed their bags and left, peacefully. That is democracy. It is less than a perfect ideal, but so is everything. 2008 proved we have democracy. It proved that the Bush administration was not fascist -- fascists do not honor the results of elections that go against them. Democracy : Rule by the people. People are corrupt, hence democracy will be corrupt. But it is still democracy. <br><br>More generally -- amazing how many nerves you obviously hit here, JMG! I think another reason people like to believe in conspiracies of evil is that they actually find them comforting -- at least SOMEONE is in charge, which means there is at least in theory hope for change! Just like why Xtians like to believe that evil comes from Satan -- that means it is not inevitable or inherent to the human condition. And I do find a strong correlation around where I live between belief in a dualistic theology and believe in mundane conspiracy theories. <br><br>Hey folks, there is exactly ONE person out there whose behavior you can control: Yourself. Live the way you think every individual should, even if everyone else does not.

We have no power." <br><br>"No, you give them power, and when you do that you act like babies, just accepting what you're given. Take responsibility for what you eat. Read ingredients, learn to cook, plant a garden." All new ideas to many of these students, who swim in our culture like fish in water, simultaneously electronically connected yet uninformed. <br><br>Two days later, facilitating a small discussion group for faculty about teaching sustainability in the classroom: Again to sumarize, they said, "The elites manipulate information, there are no green jobs to train our students for, so how do we make sustainability relevant in the classroom? And the students by and large don't care." <br><br>Thinking of the conversation here at Archdruid Report, I said, "There are all kinds of people all over the world working on living with self restraint and taking an alternate philosophical stance to "more is better." For example, show <i>Food. Inc.</i> and start talking about food in terms of personal responsibility." <br><br>Point being, thousands of private discussions can start seeds of change. Food is a small (well, actually huge) first step. Maybe those students won't plant a garden this spring, but they've entertained the idea and that's a start. One or two told me they will.<br><br>Maybe the instructors, already working on changing what and how they teach, won't make sudden moves, but the fact they discussed the issue with faculty from other disciplines brought an interdisciplinary fizz to the discussion and might help each see things in a new way. And maybe they don't feel so alone in their silos.<br><br>How to help people wake up, to discover that the herd instinct isn't necessarily correct, that they can think for themselves--and, most important, get beyond binary thinking! Those are some real, task-generating queries.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c8076758777682744485 title="comment permalink">4/25/11, 11:31 AM</a><br><br>

If young people growing up under dictatorship, censorship and oppression can risk their lives to demand a greater stake in how they are governed with absolutely no guarantee of success and odds stacked greatly against them in a region of the world that will be hit hardest by said perfect storm, certainly a rowdy bunch such as ourselves can push back a lot harder and more creatively than we have been to make our own Democracy function better.

If that state involves drawing down natural resources and degrading the environment, then there seems little hope for that society, since it's unlikely to see any major change in direction, without some external impetus (like extreme weather events becoming common or a precipitous decline in oil production).

First, an article in the local weekly about a nonprofit (hopefully well funded) with plans to bring local, organic grain to Maine. Grain? In Maine? Apparently Somerset County Maine was known as "The Breadbasket of Boston" back in the 1800s. The orgs' general goal is for 1. locally-grown, processed, baked and sold grain, 2. as petroleum-free as possible, 3. to be sold at 2fer 1 prices for foodstampers in farmer's markets. The idea is to bring jobs, improve local health, compete pricewise with Mall*warts (love that name!), reduce dependence on oil, and all other things good...(Note that the University of Maine and Aggie extension have reported several times in recent years that Maine already produceds enough to feed about 80% of its population. Relieved to know that at least some here are watching and taking action to bring that to 100%).<br><br>2nd ray of sun again came through the local weekly, this time in the calendar section. A weeklong symposium on sustainability, including talks on weatherization, homes without heating systems, growing your own food / locally produced food with talks by local farmers, and more.<br><br>All just 2 villages over from me, and during my week's "vacation" so I actually can attend!

Regardless of the legality or propriety of the <em>selection</em> of the new government, the <em>orderly</em> change of regime is noteworthy.<br><br>I don't know where the media get their definitions. When the populace rises up and without formal elections enact a change of power, I call that a revolution, and mob rule - as in Egypt, and what is ongoing in Syria.<br><br>I know that here in America we got used to 'just an election' and not think of it as a change of government, a change of policy and changing out of those in power. But the orderly and expected opportunity to change our leaders, and especially to do so with continuity, is not the mark of a kingdom or of a dictatorship.<br><br>Recall that the media focuses on exit polls and individual state counts, on improprieties, et. al., but the US Constitution provides for the <em>states</em> to elect the President via the electoral college. That separation between citizen and selecting the President was intentional, and by most reasonings separates the US from a full democracy. <br><br>On the other hand, the scheduled voting and simple plurality of votes to determine local mayor, in some places sheriff, etc. is pretty democratic - in a representative democracy fashion.<br><br>I was assured in public school, in middle school, that the most <em>efficient</em> form of government is the <em>benevolent</em> dictator. Sort of a father of the land. The problems with that form of government is assuring that the dictator actually is, and remains benevolent to all or most, and that there is little mechanism for choosing the succeeding leader to be benevolent as well. Thus the US chose this hodge-podge form of representative, democratic republic as a compromise, a way to look for those benevolent leaders, and to provide for an orderly transition in a reasonably timely fashion to the next, incoming leader.<br><br>Don't let the words hang you up, not here, not in the media. We use the word 'democracy' to describe America, knowing full well that our government and civic action isn't what the dictionary calls 'democracy'. The definition of America's form of government is the US Constitution, as amended, and not the dictionary, not the drive-by media, and not my school boy recollection of one day in US History class ever so many years ago.<br><br>Your task, should you accept it, is to understand America's government structure and your responsibilities under that Constitution, to hold common practice and elected officials to the letter of the written law. Because the Constitution also allows for remedies when the government, or individuals within that government, violate the law and the Constitution - but it requires that others do their part in the face of wrong doing.<br><br>Blessed be.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c8942632007286840830 title="comment permalink">4/26/11, 7:19 AM</a><br><br>

What we have in the U.S. and western+central Europe now is as close as you can get to democracy in such large nation states. If you are going to define democracy so strictly that it cannot in fact exist, then you have made the concept pretty useless. <br><br>Let's look at a parallel universe in which the 2000 presidential election went the "correct" way and Al Gore was president. Might the 9/11/2001 attacks have been avoided? Maybe, maybe not. Just suppose they happened pretty much the same way, though. In the aftermath, the American people were demanding blood -- Muslim blood, to be more specific. Anyone who tries to revisionize the atmosphere in this country back then to avoid this ugly fact is delusional. If Gore had not given it to them (us), he would have been out on his rear end in an unprecedented landslide. The Neocons would have swept into control of congress in 2002, and we would have had a decade of war in the middle east. Sound familiar? Democracy works in these sorts of ugly ways, too. If your people demand blood and you fail to deliver, they will find someone who will. <br><br>Just because the results are ugly, even inhuman and evil, does not mean the process that lead to them was not democratic. Those supreme court justices who threw out two centuries of precedent and ignored all their previously stated views about the role of the federal government were appointed by popularly elected (and often popular) presidents, and confirmed by the popularly elected senate. And of course the real question about the 2000 election that no Democrat wants to ask is "why was this election even close?" Vice president of well-liked president leaving office with high approval ratings, shoulda been a slam dunk. It's not "how could those people have been so stupid as to vote for Nader" but "How did we stray so far from our core principles that so many people who should have been our base could not even bring themselves to vote for our ticket?" Better to blame it on stupid voters and conspiracies of election fraud and supreme court tit-for-tat than to address your own failure to remain true to those who put you in power in the first place.<br><br>Besides, anyone can tell you that the problem with the 2000 Election was that Mercury went retrograde on election day.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-nihilism-part-two-lead.html#c6337205727538796803 title="comment permalink">4/26/11, 8:18 AM</a><br><br>

I teach a course on consumer culture in which I explain the problem as follows: The development of all sorts of conveniences and related technological developments follows the trajectory of fossil fuel usage (especially oil). This has taken shape over a course of several generations. Any new generation, however, is socialized into a world in which there are established norms of a taken for granted world - even when these norms a most extreme when viewed from a historical perspective (or a global perspective for that matter). These norms are reinforced continuously by everyone around the individual. There is tremendous pressure toward conformity in thought and behavior. I think one cure for this problem is the development of an awareness of the worlds of previous generations. Then a thinking person can see the extreme nature of it all. As one example, getting into a car (and other vehicles) and going literally anywhere more or less immediately is very new sort of thing even for the wealthy of the past.
