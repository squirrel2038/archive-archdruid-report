It occurred to me yesterday, while riding the train back from another speaking gig, that this must be a supremely difficult time to be a satirist. Imagine any statement, no matter how preposterous, and it’s a safe bet that somebody in America will be saying it with a straight face before long.<br><br>The example that came first to mind as the landscape rolled past was Ann Coulter, the Lady Gaga of modern American pseudoconservatism. Coulter’s claim to public notice is the fact that she’ll say or do quite literally anything to get attention, and her latest stunt was up, or perhaps down, to her usual standards. Commenting on the unfolding nuclear disaster in Japan, Coulter insisted that there’s nothing to worry about, because nuclear radiation is good for you. If someone is willing to start a bake sale to send her to the Fukushima Daiichi plant, I’m in a generous mood; put me down for two dozen cookies, and I’ll throw in the cost of a beach towel and a bikini, so she can bathe in the healthful, gently glowing waters streaming out of the No. 2 reactor.<br><br>Coulter’s utterance was far from the most absurd thing being said about the Fukushima disaster, to be sure. My readers may recall the people who insisted that the best way to respond to last year’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill was to blow up the leaking pipe with a nuclear warhead. Yes, the same suggestion is now being directed toward the Fukushima plant. I admit there’s a certain psychotic grandeur in the notion that a nuclear disaster can somehow be fixed by lofting three half-melted reactor cores and thousands of fuel rods into the atmosphere in a single mushroom cloud, so that hundreds of tons of radioactive waste can come drifting down across the Japanese landscape, killing thirty or forty million people and leaving half the island of Honshu uninhabitable for centuries to come. As a serious proposal, though – and some of the people making it appear to be serious – it’s hard to think of better evidence that a significant fraction of the American people has simply stopped thinking at all.<br><br>Still, the crowning bit of unintentional satire in recent news came from the White House. It’s a subtle joke, and one that seems to have gone over the heads of most of its listeners, but that’s one of the risks run by truly inspired humor. The comic routine in question, of course, was President Obama’s speech on energy policy last Wednesday.<br><br>More precisely, Obama’s speech outlined an energy nonpolicy. He seems to have had his speechwriters scrape up every cliché from every speech on energy policy made by every other resident of the White House since Richard Nixon, and the result was very nearly a nonspeech about his nonpolicy: a sort of verbal pantomime, in which Obama pretended to be doing something about energy in much the same way a mime pretends to be trapped inside a phone booth. He proposed, in effect, that the energy policy of the United States should include all the same things it’s included for the last thirty years, under the pretense that this is something new, and in the serene conviction that the same policy choices that backed us into our present corner will somehow succeed in getting us out of it.<br><br>What made Obama’s nonpolicy nonspeech such a bravura performance, though, was the easy grace with which it avoided mentioning any of the policy options that might actually do some good. The words “conservation” and “efficiency” appeared in the text only in reference to shiny new products that use up one set of resources to conserve another, and the only comments about solar energy referred to exactly the sort of complex, centralized approach that’s consistently proven uneconomical since the 1870s; mature, off-the-shelf technologies such as solar water heating and passive solar space heating, which could slice good-sized collops off our national energy use in a hurry, were never mentioned. None of the sensible steps that reduced US energy use by 15% between 1975 and 1985 had a place in Obama’s nonplan.<br><br>Mind you, Obama was quite right to suggest that America can cut its dependence on foreign oil by 30% by 2025. In fact, America <i>will</i> cut its dependence on foreign oil by at least 30%, and probably quite a bit more, by 2025; it’s just that the cut in question is not going to be made by any choice of ours, much less as a result of any of the fancy technological ventures Obama spent his speech promoting. It will be made because faltering oil production, rising competition for the oil that remains, and the decline of American imperial power compared to its emerging rivals, will slice a shrinking pie in new and, for Americans, distinctly unwelcome ways.<br><br>As that happens, the approaches ignored by Obama – and, to be fair, by the rest of today’s US political establishment, on both sides of the increasingly irrelevant divide between the major parties – are going to be among the very few options open to individuals in America and elsewhere who hope to ride the curve of energy decline to something like a soft landing. One example, which I’d like to explore in detail here, is the use of passive solar retrofits for domestic space heating.<br><br>Back in the halcyon days of the 1970s appropriate-tech movement, a great deal of effort went into designing passive solar architecture, and the results were impressive by any standard. In most areas, given a decent southern exposure, a house designed for passive solar heating, and adequately insulated and weatherized to make best use of it, requires little or no heating other than what the sun provides. The one drawback, and it’s a significant one, is that the house has to be designed and built with passive solar heating in mind. Those of my readers who expect to have the resources to build a house from the ground up, or have one built for them, should certainly look into passive solar designs; the rest of us will be living in existing construction, and the possibilities here are more limited.<br><br>The most important limit, of course, is that you can’t do passive solar at all unless a good part of the south or southeast face of your house receives direct sunlight during at least a significant fraction of each winter, spring, and autumn day. Some houses have that option; many others don’t, and if you don’t, you need to do something else. If you do, on the other hand, you have at least three options available, and they can be used alone or together.<br><br>The first is a thermosiphon air panel or TAP. Those of my readers who remember how a passive thermosiphon solar water heater works already know most of what they need to know here. A TAP is a wide, flat box with glass on the front, insulation on the sides and back, and a sheet of metal running parallel to the glass, with a couple of inches of air space between metal and glass. Air comes in at the bottom, flows over the metal, and goes out the top into the space that needs to be heated. Position the panel in the sun, and the metal very quickly gets hot; the air passing over the panel picks up the heat, and you very quickly have cold air being sucked into the pipe that leads to the bottom, and hot air being blown out the pipe that leads out of the top.<br><br>The TAP is one of the cheapest solar technologies you can make – it costs about as much as a good solar oven – and it produces heat fast: if you live someplace where winters are cold but sunny, and you can place the panel so that it catches rays as soon as the sun comes up, you can have hot air warming your house within a half hour or so of dawn. The downside is that the heat goes away as soon as the sun does, and at night, the thermosiphon effect can work in reverse – hot air gets sucked in the top, flows over the chilly metal, and emerges as an icy breeze at floor level. Thus a TAP needs valves to cut off the air flow when the sun goes away; it wouldn’t be too hard to work a light or temperature sensor into the system, so that the valves close automatically whenever there isn’t sunlight falling on the panel. If you’ve got a well-insulated and thoroughly weatherstripped house, the heat from a couple of well-placed panels can keep you comfortable well into the night, but the technology does have its limits for round-the-clock heating.<br><br>To balance the quick but unsteady heat of a TAP system, you need another system that soaks up heat whenever the sun is out, and distributes it to the house in a steadier manner throughout the day and night. The key to getting this effect is thermal mass. Some substances are good at soaking up heat; when it’s hot, they absorb it, and when it gets cold, they radiate it. Old-fashioned fireplaces used to include plenty of brick or stone precisely because these have plenty of heat storage capacity, and will still be radiating heat via infrared rays long after the fire has been banked down for the night. In the same way, most passive solar systems use plenty of thermal mass to soak up the sun’s heat in the daytime, and radiate it all night.<br><br>There are several different gimmicks for retrofitting a house to use thermal mass. One of the standard methods, back in the day, was the trombe wall. What’s a trombe wall? Basically, it’s a wall-sized TAP with thermal mass rather than a metal sheet inside the glass. One very effective, though rather ugly, way of building a trombe wall back in the day was to take black 55-gallon drums full of water and stack them in a sturdy frame so that their ends faced the sunlight; glass went over the sunward surface, a few inches from the ends of the drums, and the wall on the other side was pierced by vents at top and bottom, which could be opened and closed. Some kind of insulation to cover the glass on a cold night or cloudy days was a common addition that improved the efficiency of the system quite a bit. Water is among the very best thermal masses, but brick, stone, or concrete will also do a good job, and the less unsightly trombe walls tended to use these instead of barrels of water.<br><br>The next step up from the trombe wall, and one of the most widely used and thoroughly tested of the passive solar retrofit technologies, is the attached solar greenhouse. You build this onto the south or southeast face of your house, sealing it up tight so that air doesn’t leak in or out, and put a trombe wall between the greenhouse and the rest of the house; the floor of the greenhouse may also be made of heat-absorbing brick, stone, or concrete, to add to the effect. Sunlight streaming in through the glazing warms the air and the trombe wall inside, and heat then radiates from the thermal mass to the rest of the house, regulated by vents that can be opened or closed; the greenhouse should also be vented to the outside on hot days. In addition to a significant heat gain, of course, the greenhouse also allows you to keep fresh vegetables in the diet from early spring into late fall, and right through winter in climates that aren’t too arctic.<br><br>Quite a few experiments were made with active solar space heating – that is, systems that collect heat from the sun and then pump it somewhere else. It can be done, but because of the diffuse nature of solar heat, the efficiencies are low, and you very quickly end up using (and losing) more energy in the process than you gain by it. That’s been a persistent problem all along with attempts to run complex systems on the diffuse and intermittent energy flows that can be gotten from renewable sources. Too many people, faced with that reality, either give up on renewables altogether, or waste their time and resources trying to find some gimmick that will allow a diffuse and intermittent energy source to do the same things as a concentrated and instantly available one.<br><br>Given that renewables are the only energy supply we can count on for the long term, the first choice is not very helpful. Given that the laws of nature are under no compulsion to provide humanity with the kind of energy supplies that the fraction of humanity currently living in industrial societies seem to think they are entitled to get, the second one is not much better. The viable alternative, of course, is to recognize that renewable energy sources can’t simply be shoved into existing roles as replacements for oil, coal, and natural gas; they require different ways of thinking about energy, and imply an entirely different kind of energy technology.<br><br>That kind of energy technology – the ecotechnic kind, to use a term I’ve discussed here several times in the past – barely exists as yet. The thermosiphoning air panels, trombe walls, and attached solar greenhouses that emerged as the best products of a decade of lively experimentation are baby steps in the direction of the ecotechnic energy systems of the far future. Still, just as baby steps are precisely what’s most appropriate when a baby starts learning to walk, these simple, flexible, and inexpensive approaches are good ways to make a start on the task of learning how to live comfortably on the diffuse energy flows nature provides.<br><br>It’s also important to remember that all these things can be put to use by individuals, families, and local community groups with readily available resources, very much including salvage – old windows, for example, make excellent glazing for all three of the systems just discussed. That’s important, since the political class here in America seems to have decided that our nation’s apparently limitless reserves of absurdity can be used to replace its dwindling supplies of fossil fuels. While they’re busy making nonspeeches about nonplans or insisting that death is good for your health, those of us interested in alternatives to absurdity can get to work.<br><br><span style=font-size:130%>Resources</span><br><br>The starting point for this week’s techologies, here again, is the Master Conserver collection at <a href=http://www.culturalconservers.org/library.php>the Cultural Conservers Foundation website</a>; the papers you’ll need are on Passive Solar Heating -- Residential and Solar Greenhouses. Ed Mazria’s classic <i>The Passive Solar Energy Book</i> has plenty of information on passive solar systems generally, and <i>The Integral Urban House</i> by Sim van der Ryn, et al., has – among many other useful things – a good chapter on solar systems.<br><br>For solar greenhouses, the best books I know are Rick Fisher and Bill Yanda’s classic <i>The Food and Heat Producing Solar Greenhouse</i> and the predictably massive and detailed Rodale Press book on the subject, James C. McCullagh (ed)., <i>The Solar Greenhouse Book</i>.

The efficiency is actually really good, comparing watts of heat delivered versus watts used to run the fan. It's way better than even the best (readily available, household-sized) electric heat pump. Plus these electric fans should be easy to run with a supplemental PV panel, since they are only needed when the sun is shining. Now put a bunch of these panels on the roof and add some insulated ductwork and you have the system I am currently experimenting with in small trial-and-error steps. It has all the same problems as the TAP with lack of thermal mass; on the other hand to a significant degree if the house is insulated well enough the structure and furnishings of the house provide a noteworthy thermal mass all by themselves and can at least buffer the temperature swings overnight. I've been impressed how much heat can even be gathered on lightly overcast days provided the ambient temperature is not terribly low. It'll never get you through January in the eastern U.S. all by itself, but it can be great in spring and fall and hopefully cut down significantly on wood and fossil fuel use in midwinter too. If I can figure out a way to handle the condensation problems it might be workable for nighttime cooling in the summer too. <br><br>Likewise, fans can be used to help circulate air between an attached greenhouse and the rest of the house, also putting a little bit of activity into your passive system. One thing about air, it does not take much energy to make it move. I doubt anyone reading this blog will outlive the era of usable PV panels, old truck alternators, and scrap electric motors, so we should have access to modest amounts of electricity for some time to come. <br><br>Pisces -- be cautious about using old scrap windows for greenhouses. They have a tendency to degrade and start leaking, depending on their condition and how you make use of them. Condensation can really attack the wooden parts, especially if you also use the greenhouse for growing plants and hence create a high-humidity environment. <br><br>As for Obama and his non-energy non-plan, it is becoming clearer by the week that we can just forget about the political system when it comes to all the fundamentals that need realigning. Economic, thermodynamic, geophysical, and ecological realities will drive change, politics are likely useless (I believe you covered some of the reasons for this on these pages a while back, JMG).<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-absurdity.html#c5068781400868707352 title="comment permalink">4/6/11, 10:52 PM</a><br><br>

I recently forwarded a (satirical newspaper) Onion headline to my friends. It read 'Experts reassure public that nuclear power is 100% safe, unless something goes wrong'. <br><br>Sad to say that only a couple of them realised it was a joke ...<br><br>About using solar greenhouses to trap heat and relay it to houses. It occurs to me that cars make excellent mini-greenhouses, whether their engines function or not. I wonder how plausible it would be to somehow relay the 'waste' heat, perhaps via ventilation tubes, into living spaces. Another good thing about this is that cars are, of course, moveable and could therefore be positioned correctly depending on the season. You could even increase their thermal mass by, say, removing all the fittings and putting down a layer of concrete or gravel. <br><br>In this way cars could atone for the carbon sins of their past life ;-)<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-absurdity.html#c282508546535696643 title="comment permalink">4/6/11, 11:17 PM</a><br><br>

I agree that anyone building new or remodeling should make it a priority. I feel that it should have been part of building codes long ago. <br><br>One note on box type solar collectors: if it is to be at ground level try to use tempered glass for safety. Older patio doors (@ '70s - '80s) were tempered, many were double-glazed, but were lower iron and weren't gas (eg argon) filled. More modern insulated windows will reduce your heat gain, as they were designed to do. Also, the double-glazed patio doors can be split into two panes. I prefer to keep them intact because the frames (usually aluminum) are handy for constuction and protect the edges. One chip on the edge of tempered glass and the whole thing slowly falls apart. Kind of fun to watch as your glass slowly destroys itself ;-/ I have quite a collection of old patio doors from our remodeling business, hoping to build a totally passive greenhouse soon. Chech swap lists, salvage yards and window contractors. Alot of these older doors are being replaced these days.<br><br>I've seen heat boxes constructed to seal themselves to double-hung sash windows in winter, removed in summer. They work well in bedrooms and baths with south facing windows. The best I've seen hang below the window, allowing some daylight into the room, the absorber is placed below the top half of the window. Operation consists of just opening or closing the bottom and top of the window a few inches. It is also possible to construct an absorber for the interior of windows, the existing window acts as the glazing. Some skills involved, though nothing ventured ....<br><br>The most simple passive solar heater I've constucted was made of metal ductwork, flat ducts called "wall stack" about 12 inches x 3 1/2 inches, painted black on the sun side, insulated with foam board on the other three sides, 90 degree elbows top and bottom. Two of these hung in a sash window produce an amazing amount of heat on sunny days. The lady I made them for has been using these for years to heat her sewing room in winter.<br><br>Note: As JMG suggested, most all of these passive designs require some level of active control, mainly by you. They are not "set and forget" unless you invest in some sort of automatic control, increasing complexity and cost. Whether it is closing thermal curtains or shutting vent dampers at night, they will work in reverse at night and on cloudy days. Backflow preventers reduce efficiency and don't work so well, IME. Bimetal thermostatic vents are available (usually for venting crawl spaces) and may be adjusted for our purposes; something I've been meaning to try.<br><br>The only fully active solar heating scheme I would consider would be a water based radiant floor system for a small area. If one is considering a new bathroom, adding pex tubing to a poured concrete shower pan, connected to a small solar water heater with a small pump; stores heat in the thermal mass tile/concrete of the shower and heats the whole bathroom, a wonderful thing in winter. It may also be possible to do this PV direct with an under-tile electric heater. While the rest of the house may not be quite as warm as one would like during those cold, cloudy winters, the bathroom floor can never be too warm. Our bathroom floor stores heat for days (and it keeps the seat warm as well ;-)<br><br>Suggestion for future discusion: <br>Simple ways to reclaim waste heat.<br><br>Thanks, JMG!<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-absurdity.html#c4172971226357490052 title="comment permalink">4/7/11, 7:54 AM</a><br><br>

Since being involved in a business that has actually installed a fair number, I do have a few pointers. <br><br>If one can install a collector over the basement sill, then your basement can become the heat sink. You have already given your followers the lowdown about the 2nd Law, so we all know heating the basement is both worthwhile, and, the walls/floor/and building floor will all become part of the thermal mass. I would caution against heating, say, a box of rocks with an air system, or something similar, as this will create condensation and mold issues in most of these arrangements. <br><br>I do have a basement heat supply on the solar heater installed on my house and the furnace does not kick in for a full 2 hours after sundown, those on full sun days. Calm days and nights it is 3ish hours.<br><br>And there are numerous installation mounts available, if there is sun shining for four hours a day, anywhere on the house, the heater can be installed, even to work from the roof with inner attic insulated ducts and ceiling return and supply.<br><br>Another pointer is to shy away from any solar air collector (collector for heating, panel for photovoltaic, my distinction) inner absorbing plate not made of copper. Copper is a very good transfer mechanism, and is anti-microbial. The best one that I have found also seals the air between the glass and the absorbing copper sheet thus the home/building air is allowed to flow behind the sheet and never comes into contact with the condensation that sometimes occurs on the inside of the glass. This manufacturer also adheres a sheet of TINOX on the copper sheet, and please believe me, my house gets right up to 80 degrees on a zero degree full sun day - even during winter solstice.<br><br>I have a lot more thoughts, but it is easier if you would visit our website and find the air heating part found on Residential, my house is the first one highlighted. greenskyenergetics.com<br><br>I have actually burned out and have stopped selling here of late. Too many nos to find a yes, then the yes is not satisfied because of unrealistic expectations - but not from my account. One lady, who is an avowed environmentalist, asked why her heat bill did not go down by 60 percent, like she said I claimed. But the claim was very clear in the proposal, that the solar water heater natgas consumption would be at least 60 percent less, with her drainback type system actually being closer to 80 percent! People are just spoiled rotten by heavily subsidized very powerful fuel sources, and most feel this will continue for the rest of their lives, and woe be to anyone telling them different. <br><br>One last point to make; now is not the time to rail against all things powered by fossil fuels. These fuels are a gift from Mother Earth. Using these fuels to help become more sustainable is/was my best message when speaking towards a perspective customer. <br><br>Anyway, people 20 years from now will be very happy to be living in a house with these devices installed on them.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-absurdity.html#c6192831957406523934 title="comment permalink">4/7/11, 9:00 AM</a><br><br>

There are many question marks over the evidence, and for the most part it seems that radiation scientists and clinicians do not accept the theory, but it's not complete pseudoscience. <a href=http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/22/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-lexposure-low-levels-radiation-ar/ rel=nofollow>Politifact did some digging on the statement, which you can find here.

One day, when my wife and I have a house of our own, I will be sure to look into it.<br><br>It occurs to me as well that not all is doom and gloom for energy conservation in the world of policy. Having been tangentially involved with the building of a new students union building at my campus, I have been made aware that there are a number of standards for "green architecture" -- the new SUB is aiming for <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership_in_Energy_and_Environmental_Design rel=nofollow>LEED Gold</a>. I think these are still baby steps, but I also think professional architects are getting into the right frame of mind.

Then we will start the tomatoes, etc. without the frost worry.<br><br>About making a practical heat sink; nothing much beats Gauber's Salt (sodium sulfate) at a couple hundred dollars per ton. It goes through a phase change at 32C. This is consistant with solar heaters and stores about 19cal/gm. A few feet of 6" black sewer pipe containing Gauber's salt gets to 32C (90F) and starts to liquify and soaking up solar calories. As the temerature cools the pipe has to give up those calories back to your solar heat conduit. This is our next project after high tunnel.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-absurdity.html#c215820065031531683 title="comment permalink">4/7/11, 11:18 AM</a><br><br>

So far I only have a couple of panels and a few square meters of collector area. Still in full sun I get something like 1000 watts out with only something like 20 or 50 watts in (I forget the fan rating), which makes an apparent EROI of something like 20. This is all hillbilly engineering, stuff you can buy at any builders supply and make in your garage. My hillbilly neighbors have actually been very interested; I think the last two winters have put the fear of the gods into them about heating with electricity or propane. <br><br>Of course that sort of apparent EROI is what makes people say "see, it's a cheap as oil, we can power the world with it!" Of course I haven't included the embodied energy of the building materials, construction, and maintenance -- but they don't include those when they tell you the efficiency of the heat pump you just had installed for $10K either and I still beat them by about a factor of 5 or 10. Even without that, though, the energy I get out is just hot air, and not even that hot (50C at best). You can't power the global economy on hot air! And I can't gather more than my south-facing roof will allow, so there's a hard limit no matter how efficient I might get. At this point I still have the vast majority of the roof left to exploit, so I am FAR from Peak Hot Air in my own highly local economy.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-absurdity.html#c8427202485973934167 title="comment permalink">4/7/11, 11:35 AM</a><br><br>

You did omit the solar slab as promoted by James Kachadorian<br>in his book"the Passive Solar House:<br>http://www.amazon.com/Passive-Solar-House-Complete-Heating/dp/1933392037/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1302206907&amp;sr=8-1<br> It uses concrete for solar heat storage by virtue of making a house's entire first floor a concrete slab poured over concrete blocks laying on their sides with their holes lined up. Think of it as a trobe' wall laying flat. This allows air to circulate under and through the concrete. The dark stained slab floor is insulated with 2-4" of foam insulation under and around the perimeter. Vents in the floor allow air circulation. I built a 14 X 32'solar sunspace along the side of our log cabin with the solar slab. 4 X6' windows face south and a 4 layer clear lexan roof covers the space. Plastic water barrels here and there soak up and store heat. I used forced air drawn from the peak which blows hot air under the slab when desired.Our big pressure tank and large water heater both painted black augmented with black poly pipe sit in the space and provide 100% of our hot water in the summer and lesser amoiunts in spring and fall. In winter we switch to another water heater. The slab also has hydronic heating via pex tubing in the slab but I have never felt the need to hook it up. All of the lumber, windows, heater and tank were salvaged. I only purchased the concrete and the lexan. On warm summer days we open windows and doors and the green house provides copious warm weather veggies which wont grow outside in our high mountain valley. Cost was $6000. My system would be feasible for cool climates and in warmer climates in spring and fall. Using a solar slab under a conventional new house is suitable in all climates.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-absurdity.html#c1004159174114765686 title="comment permalink">4/7/11, 1:13 PM</a><br><br>

I agree with you about systems, especially the part about keeping it simple. I run a drainback solar hot water system, with wood and LPG assistance and I'm shamed to admit it but after it was installed everyone assumed that it worked fine, but being a complex system there were about 5 things wrong with it. Each had to be tracked down and resolved one by one. What a nuisance and I missed most of the heat from the sun over summer as it's taken about 6 months to track down every problem. <br><br>Luckily it seems to be fine now, although you have to understand how things work in a renewable system to really know when and why it's gone horribly wrong. People don't realise how easy they have it if all they have to do to produce heat is press a switch, pay a bill etc. It's the ultimate in detachment!<br><br>We're having an Indian summer this week so I've been busy painting the outside walls before it becomes to cool and wet for the paint to cure.<br><br>Love to see you speak down this way.

For what it's worth, and I could be wrong of course, I think the reason might be the ghost of Ronald Reagan. The only president who really got Americans serious about energy conservation was, of course, Jimmy Carter, as you mentioned regarding our 15% reduction in energy consumption during the late 1970s and early '80s. But despite the fact that Carter's "crisis of confidence" speech of 1979 was well-received by the public, and despite the fact that at the time people were truly interested in saving energy, Carter got politically reamed by Ronald Reagan's rhetoric about "morning in America" and the notion--which Reagan hammered persistently during the 1980 campaign--that it was wrong to ask Americans to cut back on anything.<br><br>And ever since the Reagan presidency, no president of either party has been willing publicly to counter the Reagan myth. This haunting by Reagan's ghost manifests itself in many ways, including tax policy, regulation policy, and, of course, energy policy. And no politician will dare utter the word "conservation" when talking about energy. Hence Obama's non-energy-policy speech last week.<br><br>On the other hand, and again I could be mistaken, I recall that some of the so-called economic stimulus money that Congress passed during the first year of Obama's presidency included funding for the kinds of energy-saving home improvements we've been discussing here--weatherstripping, insulation, etc. If that's right, what came of those provisions? Does anyone know how many homes were insulated with the help of this stimulus money?<br><br>Regarding passive solar, I'm in a similar situation as Adrian--an east-west facing home, in my case in the 'burbs--squeezed between two homes to the north and south. However, our south-facing wall, which is two stories tall, does receive the full force of winter sunlight (to the extent we get any sunshine during our Ohio winters). It has no windows, however. I might be able to mount a TAP on that wall, but I'd have to do some fancy duct work through the wall to get any heat into the house. It might be feasible...<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-absurdity.html#c7038916310404297466 title="comment permalink">4/8/11, 5:05 AM</a><br><br>

We don't have broadcast, cable, or satellite TV reception at our place, but we do partake of modest amounts of television and cinema via DVD (on our schedule, at our choosing). I particularly wonder about this in the context of the upcoming post you mentioned on the Energy Bulletin about the rise of cynicism. I feel that this is intimately connected to the effects of continuous media and 24-hour fearmongering newscasts on the mass psyche. My mother is convinced there is a rapist behind every bush, a tornado inside every cloud, and a terrorist aboard every airplane, thanks to a constant diet of cable TV. I suspect this world of fear and hopelessness has more than a little to do with the cynicism and negativity of contemporary discourse. <br><br>So how do you keep yourself attuned to these societal waves and currents without subjecting yourself to the idiot box? I wouldn't know a Kardashian if one ran me over on the sidewalk (I'm not really even sure what a Kardashian is, other than something connected to "Reality" TV), but the majority of Americans seem to place a whole lot of their view of the world in people like them.<br><br><a href=alternatives-to-absurdity.html#c5016698476579466277 title="comment permalink">4/9/11, 9:54 AM</a><br><br>

I'll put in a few rocks as I find them as well, to increase the thermal mass of the north wall.<br>The interesting thing about this greenhouse is that it's planned for expansion ... into a chicken coop. The north wall of the greenhouse will be designed to double as the south wall of a chicken coop: I'll be putting PVC pipes through the bottom and top of the wall, to act as vents (sticking out enough that I can just cap them to block airflow when I don't want it). This way, the greenhouse can act as a thermosiphon on the south side of the chicken coop, keeping the chooks a bit warmer in our (very) cold winters.<br>That's the plan, anyway ...

I'm not sure whether it's true or an urban legend as I haven't verified it, but how it goes is that there was a survey done on people living downstream from a dam, asking them how concerned they were about possible failure of the dam. They started far away from the dam, and the level of concern increased as they got closer to the dam, as one might expect. However, that trend did not continue once they got very close to the dam, and the people living at the foot of the cam showed very little concern about it. The thought was just too overwhelming for most of them to consider.<br><br>Relating this to our current predicament, in the seventies we had gone down our unsustainable path enough for many people to take notice that something was wrong. However it was still a manageable distance off, if the right measures were taken to avert the crisis, so it wasn't too overwhelming for most people to think of. Now here we are in a nasty position because those steps were not taken, and I think thought about what's really going on is just too overwhelming for most to consider, just like those at the foot of the dam in the above example.
