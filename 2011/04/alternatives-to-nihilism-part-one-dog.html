"Where do you get your ideas?" is a question that most writers fairly often field, and generally dread. Science fiction writer Harlan Ellison is just about the only person in print with a ready answer; he used to state crisply – for all I know, he still does – that a little old lady in Poughkeepsie, New York sends him a weekly manila envelope full of story ideas. The rest of us are left to fumble with the difficult task of explaining the tangled roots of creativity.<br><br>Still, there are times when it’s an easy question to answer, and for me, at least, this week is one of those. The idea behind this <i>Archdruid Report</i> post came from a comment on last week’s post, made on <a href=http://www.energybulletin.net/stories/2011-04-06/alternatives-absurdity>Energy Bulletin’s</a> repost by a commenter who used the name "pulltheweeds." My post was a comparison of today’s vacuous political rhetoric on energy with the more pragmatic and effective responses that were pioneered during the energy crisis of the Seventies. The comment in its entirety – I’ve taken the liberty of adding such old-fashioned conveniences as capitals and punctuation – was this: "The days of ‘Me and You and a Dog Named Boo’ are over."<br><br>To some extent, that was simply another example of the sort of internet witticism that’s designed to score points instead of addressing an argument. Equally, it’s a fine example of unintentional irony, since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fgGNZYR5QM">the Seventies hit it referenced</a> was an open-road song that celebrated the freedom that cheap abundant petroleum briefly gave to footloose young Americans. In that sense, the comment is quite correct; the days of "another tank of gas and then back on the road again," to quote the song, are over for good.<br><br>Still, that wasn’t what "pulltheweeds" was saying, of course. What he or she was suggesting was that the conservation and alternative-energy technologies I discussed in last week’s post were the products of an aspect of American popular culture that flourished in the Seventies, and died a wretched death in the decades that followed. The homebuilt solar panels, hand-typed guides to insulation and weatherstripping, basement-workshop inventions, lively little nonprofits running on raw enthusiasm and shoestring budgets, and the rest of the landscape of the Seventies appropriate-tech scene drew on the same cultural current that made "Me and You and a Dog Named Boo" a hit, and also, however briefly, had quite a few Americans thinking about living with a lot less energy and a lot fewer resources as an adventure rather than a fate worse than death.<br><br>It’s easy to make fun of the excesses and eccentricities of the era: the air of well-scrubbed, fresh-faced innocence, say, that was so assiduously cultivated by the exact equivalents of those who now cultivate an equally artificial aura of sullen despair. Still, the 15% drop in America’s petroleum consumption that took place between 1975 and 1985, coupled with equally sharp declines in other forms of energy use, might suggest that the John Denver fans of that time, with their granny glasses and dogs sporting brightly colored bandannas in place of collars, had something going for them that today’s supposedly more sophisticated culture has not been able to match so far. The shift from the one to the other set of cultural themes may have more to do with that difference in outcomes than is often recognized, and that possibility is one that needs to be explored.<br><br>That is to say, we need to talk about the roots of the contemporary American cult of nihilism.<br><br>I don’t think that last phrase is too extreme a description. For the last few decades, it’s been hugely fashionable in America to believe, or at least affect to believe, the cynical notions that all ideals are frauds or delusions, that those who try to live up to them are either posturing liars or simple-minded fools, and that we might as well enjoy ugliness because all beauty is by definition fake. Watching this week’s idols dragged down to the lowest common denominator by yet another wretched scandal has become America’s most popular spectator sport. Meanwhile, and crucially, the notion that the American people might face a challenge, any challenge, by rising to the occasion, much less might reasonably be encouraged to do so, gets dismissed out of hand by pundits, politicians, and ordinary people alike when it’s mentioned at all. This wasn’t always the case, and as this nation and the industrial world as a whole lurches blindly toward a set of challenges right up there with anything in the last five thousand years or so of recorded history, it bears asking why a rallying of the nation’s will and potential that would have been an obvious part of a response to crisis fifty years ago is so unthinkable now.<br><br>It’s useful, in making sense of this cultural shift, to remember that there are at least two kinds of cynicism. There’s the kind – variously weary, amused, hurt, or icily dangerous – that comes naturally to those who have too often seen others betray their ideals. Then there’s the other kind – sullen, jeering, brittle, and defensive – that comes just as naturally to those who betray their own ideals, and makes them lash out angrily whenever anything too reminiscent of that betrayal flicks them on the raw. It’s the latter kind, I’m convinced, that shapes the mood of America today; the disquieting sounds that murmur through the crawlspaces of our collective imagination, waking us abruptly at night, are the echoes of a profoundly troubled national conscience.<br><br>For another measure of the same troubled conscience, think of the extraordinary reach of conspiracy theories of all kinds through American culture. These days, if you hear people talking about any of the problems or predicaments that beset our society, it’s normally a safe bet that the conversation will end up fixating on some group of people whose monstrous wickedness is allegedly the cause of it all. Democrats talk that way about Republicans, and Republicans about Democrats, while those who have abandoned the grinning corpse of America’s once-vital political culture have their own colorfully stocked rogues’ galleries of alleged villains to offer.<br><br>Any of my readers who would like to see how much of this fixation on hunting for scapegoats unfolds from an uneasy conscience need only suggest in public that ordinary Americans might bear some modest degree of responsibility for the unwelcome trends of the last few decades. The shrillness with which most Americans will insist that all the blame lies elsewhere makes it tolerably clear just how sensitive a nerve has been touched. What Carl Jung called "projecting the shadow" has become a potent political reality in America, but you don’t need a degree in Jungian psychoanalysis to realize that people who spend their lives pointing fingers at other people are trying to paste a villain’s mask on the rest of the world in order to avoid seeing it when they look in the mirror.<br><br>A third measure? Consider the contemporary American obsession with apocalyptic fantasies. Back of all the gaudy claims of history’s end currently on display – the Rapture, the Singularity, the supposed end of the Mayan calendar in 2012, and all the rest of it – is a frantic insistence that we don’t have to live with the consequences of our collective actions. That’s the common thread that connects the seeming optimism of the claim that Jesus or the Space Brothers or superintelligent computers will fix things, on the one hand, with the seeming pessimism of the claims that we’re all about to be wiped out by solar flares or asteroid bombardment or the evil plans of the Illuminati. Either way, the world that our choices have made is not the world we have to inhabit; either way, it’s not our responsibility to fix what we’ve broken, either because someone else is going to fix it or because it’s all going to be blown to smithereens shortly by something that, please note, is never our fault.<br><br>All three of these factors have deep roots in American history, but it’s not too hard to identify the point in time when they moved in from the fringes to dominate the collective imagination – and that lands us once again in the wake of the Seventies, the years when a society that previously idolized John-Boy Walton and John Denver suddenly started idolizing Gordon Gekko and self-proclaimed "material girl" Madonna instead.<br><br>Putting that shift into context requires a glance back over the history of the second half of the twentieth century. The aftermath of the Second World War left the United States abrubtly filling the position of global hegemon previously held by Great Britain. In the aftermath of Hitler’s defeat, Americans believed they had a permanent lease on the moral high ground as they expanded around the globe and confronted the Soviet Union. Mixed motives and the pressures of expediency had their usual effect, though, and as the cognitive dissonance built up, it became increasingly hard for Americans to pretend that all the atrocities and abuses of the Cold War era belonged to the other side.<br><br>Those pressures reached critical mass in the early 1970s. The Pentagon’s epic incompetence in the Vietnam war and the blatant illegality and corruption of the Nixon administration sparked a backlash that, for once, reached right up into the corridors of power. In the wake of the resulting explosions, American troops came home from Southeast Asia, Nixon was forced out of office, and a quarter century of dubious and often illegal policies unexpectedly saw the light of day. All this took place during the runup to the US bicentennial, and the contrast between admittedly idealized notions of the 1770s and the awkward realities of the 1970s forced many Americans to notice the gap between what they had become and what they claimed to be.<br><br>These cultural shifts also happened, of course, as America’s own oilfields reached their all-time peak production, and the coming of America’s own encounter with peak oil threw a generation of easy assumptions of perpetual national prosperity into question. There were still plenty of people alive who vividly recalled the Great Depression and the austerity of the war years, and thus could get their minds around the concept that the postwar boom might be a temporary and self-canceling event, or even a corner into which the United States had backed itself. Many Americans, across a wide range of social and political positions, embraced the possibility that a prudent regard for the limits of nonrenewable resources might be a valid approach to economic and political questions, and that resource conservation and a shift toward less extravagant ways of living might be the best available options over the long term. An even broader spectrum of Americans came to believe, at least for a time, that something crucial to their nation’s meaning and value had gotten lost in the rush to global empire, but might still be recovered in time to matter.<br><br>It’s popular nowadays to forget that this happened, or to insist with varying degrees of cynicism that the moment of awareness couldn’t have lasted. Maybe that’s so, but I wonder how much of that comes from the same uneasy conscience that drives so much of today’s fashionable nihilism. Americans came together during the long ordeal that began with the stock market crash of 1929 and wound its way through the shadows of depression and war until 1945, and a similar effort over a similar time scale would have been more than adequate to the task of launching America into the transition to an ecotechnic future. Back then, the US still had abundant coal, oil, and natural gas reserves, not to mention a great many other resources; annual consumption of energy and resources was far below what it later became, and though a great many factories were shuttered in the sharp recessions of the 1970s, there were still millions of capable laborers who could have been put to work retooling the economy for a new and frugal age.<br><br>The steps necessary to make that transition were discussed during that time in any number of periodicals, some of them surprisingly mainstream. The United States would have had to step back from its self-appointed role as global policeman; it would have had to pass on a fair share of the cost of deterring the Soviet Union to its comparatively more prosperous allies in western Europe and the west Pacific, and accept a less expansive notion of its own national interests. Government subsidies for nuclear power and other nonrenewable energy sources would have been phased out, and the money – along with savings from a less gargantuan military – shifted into grants for conservation, renewable energy retrofits, and research programs aimed at repositioning American industry to lead the world in green energy technologies.<br><br>Changes in tax policy, zoning regulations and building codes would reshape the built environment to decrease energy use, while funds formerly wasted on highways would go instead to build high-speed rail between urban cores and rapid transit systems that would make commuting by car all but obsolete. All this would have cost plenty, and would have required Americans to tighten their belts and accept a diminished standard of living and some formal or informal rationing for a time. Down the road a quarter century or so, though, a prosperous nation getting by comfortably on a fraction of its previous energy needs, and thus able to ignore the Middle East as an irrelevance, would have the lion’s share of global trade in new energy technologies, high-speed rail, and a dozen other fields, while other nations burdened with high energy costs were left scrambling to catch up.<br><br>That was the vision. Again, it’s comforting to the collective conscience of today’s America to insist that it couldn’t have happened, but "comforting" is rarely a synonyn for "true." Myself, I think that it could have been done, or that there was at least a very real chance of doing it. The uncomfortable silence that falls whenever anyone brings up the subject of conservation in most circles in America today is one of the reasons I’ve come to that belief. When people set aside an obvious impossibility, they don’t remain brittle and angry about it for decades afterwards. It’s only when the road not taken was a real option, and the goal at the end of it noticeably better than the endpoint looming up ahead, that those who chose otherwise get shrill in defense of their decision.<br><br>That shrill tone is hard to miss these days, and it’s grown in volume and intensity over the course of the thirty-year vacation from reality America took in the aftermath of the Seventies. We’ll talk more about that in next week’s post.

I'd encourage you to set that aside, just for a moment, and allow the possibility that we could have done it, and didn't. Yes, I know it's acutely uncomfortable; it's the attempt to avoid that discomfort that's behind a great deal of the shrillness of our time.<br><br><a href=#c7190858708479309847 title="comment permalink">4/13/11, 8:07 PM</a><br><br>

I am younger than most readers of your blog, being 25, so I wasn't born yet in the seventies, and although I've known for a while a lot of the interesting things that got started then, I guess I didn't realize just how much they actually got into the mainstream back then until some of your recent posts and people's replies. <br><br>Being immersed in a culture that defines itself as alternative and against the mainstream, but really shares more of the same problems as mainstream America then most of them would ever admit, the same cynicism is rampant. I've dealt with some of it myself but always had an inner drive so it would rarely overwhelm me, and it's been in the last couple of years that I've realized how pervasive and counterproductive it really is. I've argued recently that in America at least, apathy is an even worse problem at the current time than fundamentalism. People take more notice of the issues with fundamentalism because it leads to more dramatic events, but apathy is a slow, insidious killer.<br><br>I have also found that most of people who say they want to be hopeful or have optimism really just want someone or something else to improve their situation and aren't willing to try to do so themselves. I'm pretty sure I'm going to face some rough times, but I see enough purpose in what I'm doing to make it fulfilling, and many who are in close to the exact same outward situation as myself, and have a much more smiley cheery appearance than I do can't find the drive or don't have enough values to follow through on them with action.<br><br>The modern obsession is with changing the outside conditions to make life as easy as possible. I'm thinking that's an unhealthy attitude, as you mentioned a while back in the post about Jack Lalanne, it's pretty obvious that Americans are growing weaker in body and mind, and a lack of natural limits such as peak oil would likely lead to further degeneration. What's the alternative? The word that pops into my mind is resilience. The book "The Resilient Gardener" by carol Deppe got me thinking about resilience not just in our gardens but in ourselves too, the internal motivation we have, the less likely we are to be brought down by outside events.<br><br><a href=#c8274262762264685411 title="comment permalink">4/13/11, 8:08 PM</a><br><br>

Was it a lack of clear vision? I don't understand the Big Oil greed and profit explanation because, well, from what I understand currently the oil companies are actually the ones producing solar panels and so on, at least one that I know of. You would think that there would have been plenty of profit in building alternative transport and energy systems.<br><br><a href=#c7849842625989439763 title="comment permalink">4/13/11, 8:40 PM</a><br><br>

Rather what we face is an arduous but limited journey between the road taken and the road not. <br><br>In other words, its gonna feel like Christian Hell, but actually be like Buddhist Hell.;) <br><br>Somewhere in the distance we can find the farthest part of that untaken road our map ever depicted -the ecotechnic future.

You get tonight's gold star for perceptiveness. You're quite right that most of what calls itself alternative culture these days shares the values of the mainstream it pretends to despise -- and also quite right that there's a better way, for those willing to replace the pose of opposition with the actual embrace of a real alternative. <br><br>Remonster, you're around <i>now</i>. The tools of the Seventies -- right down to a spare bandanna or two for dogs -- are still available. Are you willing to do something with them? <br><br>Matt and Jess, thank you. You may just have restored my faith in the younger generation. Of course the big corporations could have made ample profits selling insulation and solar panels, building high speed trains, etc., etc., and you're quite right; blaming what happened on them doesn't make sense. I'll be discussing my ideas about what happened later on in this series of posts.<br><br><a href=#c4612798233694061782 title="comment permalink">4/13/11, 9:04 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_61c74c" id=c7084373566965351289></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/02333438671130100114 rel=nofollow>Bill Pulliam</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I expect I am not the only one here who has never quite fully assimilated this tectonic shift of the mass psyche into my own day-to-day awareness. I still frequently forget that the defining concepts of the youth of my generation are considered distant abstractions at present. They still seem just as true and obvious to me as they did then; it feels as it would if people had entirely ceased to notice that the sky is blue, and had difficulty seeing it even when you pointed it out to them on a glorious sunny day (never mind the ones who argue vehemently that it is in fact pink). I suppose this is a common experience of we who have passed that critical point in mid-life at which we realize that historical change is something we have lived though, not just read about. <br><br>History always seems inevitable in hindsight; but as it is happening it is much more volatile and unstable. The election of Ronald Reagan was described as a "landslide," as it was exceedingly lopsided in the electoral college. But in the bulk percentages it was indeed rather narrow; many capricious and turbulent winds combined to create the outcome of that day. They could have perhaps almost as easily blown slightly differently and lead to a different path. When we woke up that morning, we were all very uncertain what the day would hold. I personally was utterly shocked by how the numbers fell out that evening; it had not seemed inevitable at all. <br><br>I have of course been sensing the creep, first of exhuberant materialism, then evolving into the strange nihilistic materialistic of the present, over all this time. But it has been hard to say to what extent I was experiencing the passing of history versus my own passage out of youth and into mid-life. Middle-aged men, traditionally, are always convinced that the world is going to hades in a wicker container, that the kids these days are useless, that values and morals have gone down the toilet. But, statistics seem to bear out that JMG and I and the rest of us are not just curmudgeons. So many social and economic metrics are doing things they have not done since before we were born, and doing them steadily in the long-term. And it seems very hard to argue that our political dialogue has not come profoundly unglued -- sheesh, Reagan would be a centrist now, Nixon a liberal, Eisenhower a socialist! <br><br>What comes next in the world...? I have even less idea now than I usually do. The collapse of the 90s bubbles and their almost 10-year overshoot was not hard to foresee; now that we are past that point, the future is murky indeed. Maybe, JMG, you have some special green wizard lightning bugs in the post next week that might shed a little light?<br><br><a href=#c7084373566965351289 title="comment permalink">4/13/11, 9:05 PM</a><br><br>

Your perception is subtle. I'm over fifty, so I know from experience that during the period of which you write many Americans possessed the will, desire and downright enthusiasm for conservation and for responsible resource use, about which they evinced a palpable "can-do" attitude. I'm sure we could have implemented the agenda you've sketched out, or something like it. <br><br>Your remarks about the gradual creep of cynicism are spot on. I've seen it in my contemporaries - I'm thinking of one old friend in particular, a formerly visionary artist who went from embracing the optimistic idealism of the time to thinking that Donald Trump is a really cool guy to work for, and dismissing his own former enthusiasms as hopelessly naive, silly, even contemptible. <br><br>Recently I've begun to drop the word "conservation" into my speech from time to time, mainly in connection with energy. On these few occasions I've been acutely aware of how socially awkward it now is to use the term - as though the idea were slightly indecent, an outmoded erroneous notion that one wouldn't think of asking serious people to consider putting into practice. In light of what you've said here, I think I'll start using it more often. It'll be interesting to see whether I start getting some defensive denialist pushback on it - somehow I rather fancy so. <br><br>Stewart Brand is shilling for nukes? Disgusting.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c4035225913827323140></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/01142838271562232220 rel=nofollow>Adam Streed</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>This post brought two things to mind. (And, having written these comments, I see they're rather long. They're going somewhere, I promise!)<br><br>The first is a moment in Neal Stephenson's <em>Cryptonomicon</em> (which I can only remember the gist of, sorry). In the late '90s, one protagonist, Randy, is struck when he realizes that his grandfather would not have recognized something as hokey, and indeed didn't even have the concept of hokiness. Finding something hokey requires an ironic distance that, Randy believes, Americans in the 1940s didn't or couldn't adopt. (Stephenson doesn't, if I recall correctly, offer any candidate explanation of this shift in consciousness.)<br><br>The second thing is my experience teaching philosophy, and in particular ethics. I've taught a few different types of ethics class to undergrads, and by and large the students walk into the room at the beginning of the term holding some kind of relativism or subjectivism about morality. Even in upper-division philosophy classes, the complaint gets aired early on in the term: "but isn't right and wrong just subjective?"<br><br>That's probably no surprise to anyone reading, but what might be less well-known is that philosophy professors---almost to the man and woman, as far as I can tell---devote a chunk of their ethics classes <em>specifically</em> to fighting this reaction, and they often do it right away. (One of my colleagues calls it the "So You Think You're a Relativist" portion of the syllabus.) One thing we point out is that, although broad principles of tolerance might <em>seem</em> to push for relativism/subjectivism (after all, shouldn't we respect everyone?), relativism in fact leads toward complete isolation and intolerance of other views: if what's right is so only relative to my attitudes or yours, then I've got no reason to engage in dialogue. I can rest comfortably knowing that I'm right (relative to my attitudes), and so are you (relative to your attitudes), and neither of us needs to listen to critical voices. <br><br>Although we teachers of ethics present this as a <em>reductio</em> of relativism, it doesn't always come off that way---the fact that relativism entails the impotence of critical discourse can look like a benefit rather than a cost. Indeed, that "benefit," dimly grasped, might be one reason among many why students begin college as relativists in the first place. (Fortunately there are many other arguments against relativism, for those students who are willing to engage arguments.)<br><br>But what strikes me about this sort of relativism---I'm right, you're right, we're all right because we all have our own special beliefs and attitudes---is that it's effectively a sort of nihilism. In <em>The Incredibles</em>, Dash complains (or does Syndrome gloat?) that "if everyone's special, then nobody is," and the point here is analogous: if everyone is morally good, then there are no moral failures, and the idea of morality as a standard which separates the right from the wrong is as good as dead. The argument generalizes for any standard about which one is a relativist---true belief, rational inference, beautiful experience, and so on. <br><br>So this could be (after the two outlined in JMG's post) a third sort of nihilism, which doesn't necessarily delight in failure or humiliation, and which doesn't set out looking for scapegoats, but which nonetheless counsels apathy and inactivity. If everyone's right, why bother trying to change minds or behaviors? Or, to put the point conversely, the motivation to get out and make things better requires a judgment that doing X rather than Y really is---independently of anyone's attitudes---better. And making that kind of commitment is something that people (or, to stick to my sample, California undergrads) seem loath to do.<br><br><a href=#c4035225913827323140 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 12:11 AM</a><br><br>

Maybe this relates to Richard's point about apathy.<br><br>My own experience of nihilism comes from the thought that, because no one can tell you that there's one right way to live because no one has come back from the dead to give us a report, then we have less right to judge other routes through life as any route is as good as another. Therefore what is the point of having convictions? And, to me, this is sometimes a bit of a downer, it makes it easy to just say 'what's the point' and then to do nothing. Also because someone could justify all sorts of terrible things.<br><br>I often say fine, to each his/her own, as long as what he/she is doing is somehow supporting the conditions through which the many forms and members of life can do their thing. <br><br>If every route one can take through existence is good as another, then wonderful, one is free to adapt without being locked in any one set of ideals or ideology. But I often get into circular arguments with myself about this; where does one draw a line between 'to each their own' and some kind of absolute value… I guess I'm writing all this in response to your post because in the past this circular thought process certainly did make cynical, frustrated and indeed, shrill when speaking about certain topics with others!<br><br>I'm reminded by Bill's post above of 'shifting baselines' (a term I've come across while doing research into overfishing). In a nutshell: when I was born and started to grow up my first impressions of this new world around me was the only world I ever knew, and so this world was 'normal' to me. As I grew older, I compared every change in the state of the world to this 'normal world' of my youth. But my parents and my children will have very different ideas of what a normal world is to them because of course they were born at different times. Put more succinctly, 'technology is everything that happens after you were born' (I forget where I heard that quote).<br><br>The key thing is that people unaware of this would, as they grow older, compare changes only to their own idea of a 'normal world' rather than comparing their 'normal' with other what people of different generations think is normal (what a scientist would do by plotting data).<br><br>I would venture that there are two effects of this; the first is the obvious effect where people who aren't aware of this phenomenon would have trouble seeing changes which happen very slowly over many lifetimes but which are happening rapidly on a planetary timescale. The second effect is that one's own ideals formed in youth are to some extent locked to a fixed idea of a world from their past which they believe was normal, while the world continues to change as it does. If one's ideals stay fixed they can become heavy, preventing one from adapting along with the world. And perhaps one effect of this gap is cynicism.<br><br>By restating the obvious this way, I thought that perhaps this might illustrate that nihilism, which is of course a mental state, is not only shaped by what is actually happening in the world (which is what we think we're reacting to) but also just as much by what we perceive to be happening in the world along with our own perceptual limitations (which we may not often consider). Nihilism, and the beliefs which must exist in order to create it, starts to become less 'solid' and more of a matter of choice.<br><br>I'm sorry - this is a long response, and probably quite muddled. I've been rewriting it quite a bit over the past couple of hours, your original post touches on something I think about quite often.<br><br><a href=#c1970445681902283318 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 2:42 AM</a><br><br>

I reckon you have the sound of truth about your writings which seems to be a rare thing in these days of rhetoric.<br><br>The thought that's been bugging me though, is where are we going? I've been wondering lately if the best way to defuse the impending future situation is to simply stand back and let the cornucopians etc. have their day in the sun (not that anyone has any say about it really). My reasons for this is that they will simply prove to be ineffective. They don't seem to be going away and their claims are becoming more shrill, so it's probably best they are diffused through their own ineptitude.

I'm not sure to what extent you understand this, but we do; check out the works of Morris Berman. And we have a vicious "cry me a river" attitude to the homeless, to the poor, and to the working class.<br><br>I've attempted to explain some of your ideas to modern conservatives (not real conservatives, I mean the pseudoconservatives you were talking about in your previous post), but they cite Horatio Alger and tell me that anyone can get rich (really rich) if they really wanted to.<br><br>When I attempt to explain to them, using information I learned from you, that riches as we currently think of them are built on cheap oil and that this nation will be experiencing economic contraction in the future and formal employment will be scarce and homelessness will be common not due to malice but simply to dwindling resources and energy supplies, they call me a hippie. <br><br>They insist that there's nothing wrong with our system, that American prosperity will continue forever, and that I sounded like a typical Marxist.<br><br>How are we going to convince people that maybe poverty isn't a vice deserving of condemnation, and that as a general rule our response to the misfortune of others shouldn't be anger and rage, especially in a time when we simply are NOT going to be wealthy (as we currently conceive of wealth) anymore and therefore insisting that "lack of wealth = failure as a human being" is not a productive manner in which we should approach our lives and the lives of the communities (and country) in which we live?<br><br>If you have any ideas on that particular component of the issue, I would be very grateful.<br><br>Thank you in advance at least for reading this!<br><br><a href=#c3638860562005653665 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 5:50 AM</a><br><br>

Because I was such a young kid back then, my impression of that era is pretty much exclusively colored by my personal experiences. And my experience was being a very spoiled, ignorant, and dysfunctional kid who was shaped that way by a very spoiled, ignorant, and dysfunctional society. I was blessed enough to have lifelines to growth and self-improvement. But remembering that and also the ubiquitously pervasive moral <i>rot</i> I encountered in society and in myself (and from which I attempted to shelter myself through various ego-fantasies and True Believer-isms) makes me doubt we were spiritually capable of making the better choice back then. It may have been possible on a practical level, but what I remember makes it difficult for me to envision the idealized "might-have-been" alternative past you describe here.<br><br>BTW, I recommend that commentors save their comments to their clipboards (CTRL A and then CTRL C), because the first time I tried to submit my comment, I had to log into G-Mail, and when I didn't jump through the hoops in exactly the way the brain-trust at Google wanted me to do (I'm still not sure what I did incorrectly), my comment was summarily nuked.<br><br><a href=#c4358604590449679800 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 6:22 AM</a><br><br>

That raising money is the definition of 'help'. At the same time, public schools engage in fundraising as a deliberate means to defeat the limits imposed by local taxing authorities.<br><br>Back in Iowa, we occasionally got together when a farmer was hurt, or desperately ill, and lent a hand - most often, planting or harvesting the crop for the farm. Today I cannot walk into the local store without seeing a collection jar on the counter.<br><br>I recall the day my foster 8-year old told me I was killing the earth by throwing away a 2-liter coke bottle - instead of making a terrarium from it. That begs so many questions for me, I doubt I can list them all. I mean, the issue isn't throwing away the bottle - it is packaging in plastic. Or buying soda beverages instead of preparing fresh fruit juice, occasionally, or even mixing Kool-Aid. Or drinking water. Recycling plastics is a problem for me, when the amount of energy consumed in gathering, in processing, and re-fielding the substance consumes more energy and petroleum than making a new item. And shipping the process over the border because it is cheaper without EPA regulations on toxic emissions (still goes into the same air on the same planet, folks). And I understand that glass is still the only material that is cost-effective (thus, possibly energy-effective) to recycle, barring government subsidies.<br><br>The other major driver that changed America since WWII was, I think, the 60 and 30 second advertisement on broadcast media. I think ads have programmed Americans to <em>believe</em> that all *real* problems are solved by choosing well at the nearest store. Minor issues like intolerance, bigotry, and exploitation don't begin to bother those that watch NCIS and Oprah on a regular basis.<br><br>Even a certain amount of 'crime' is enjoyable. On "Cops". Grr.<br><br>One of the important outcomes of the 1970's might well have been turning away from broadcast media (remember the folk music of the time?) and guarding children from the insidious social engineering of the public schools - which has gotten much more pointed since then.<br><br>All growing and learning is about indoctrination. If we hope for the future, we need to take ownership of how our children are being indoctrinated today.<br><br><a href=#c2484019367584658813 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 6:26 AM</a><br><br>

USA's people are defined by the successes of their empire, the greatness of their past up to WWII. It is commonly refered as the american exceptionalist. However the new global order is sending subtle reminder that success is just fleeting and USA is far from exceptional. The average american becomes very defensive when such aspect is mentionned. Mentally americans have locked themselves into that cul-de-sac and only when they will decide to back up from that one-way street they will be able to resume their journey.<br>Note that other empires have precede the USA into that one-way street and still think of themselves as great and exceptional without recognizing that they have become irrelevant. The best example is France. <br>French people still live mentally in Napoleon's time and it is taking them 200 years to wake up to the fact that they are no longer great or relevant. Note that, cynicism is a national sport in France.

And isn’t that why any mention of things spiritual is often met with polite dismissal or open disdain, even among those expressing some concern for the state of our world? Notwithstanding the widespread debasement of real spiritual values and realities by the popular religions and wacko new age cults, maybe the absence of higher purpose in our lives plays a crucial but unappreciated role in our steadily accelerating unraveling.<br><br>It is so unpopular for anyone to seem to play the role of old testament prophet, that I can understand why even an Archdruid would choose to avoid this prickly subject, lest he lose a large segment of his audience forthwith. Nevertheless, my own analysis of our world dilemmas is that they are at root caused by a lack of true spiritual development. Therefore, the real solutions lie in the direction of a deep spiritual transformation in hearts and minds, leading to a new way of sharing our lives on Earth. <br><br>I could say more about how this might possibly be accomplished, but my question to you, John, is do you discount or despair of this kind of inner revolution as a key factor in reversing our nearly certain path of self-destruction?<br><br><a href=#c4191817303158984406 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 6:55 AM</a><br><br>

It is almost an art form which has within in it its own seeds of destruction. During the good economic times, we took cynical pleasure in the discomfort of US 'intervention' in Iraq and basked in stilted opposition but have gone strangely quiet during the last 3 or 4 years as our own economic sitution deteriorates across Europe. And, lo and behold, we suddendly find that we've identified our own bad guy in Libya. We now need to arm democracy loving rebels and bomb the bejesus out of the bad guys. Oil fields, what oil fields would those be? It seems oil and irony don't mix.<br><br>Ireland in the 1970's was a country of communities and low tech solutions to ordinary problems because that was all we could afford. We had few homeless and even those in dire straights could rely friends, family and sometimes a shaky public system to barely scape through. We even had laughter occassionally. However, these times are always portrayed in the MSM as the bad times with soaring unemployment when we were naive and backward. Today we have soaring unemployment but plenty of shiny cars, tax shelters (avoidance) for mega multinational corporations and loads of unoccupied buildings, but alas no communities and a fast destruction of self reliance and services so that we can payoff loans to Germany, France, and others accrued by private sector financiers of the empires. A sense irony, indeed perspective in itself, seems to be a casulty of deeply cultivated negative cynacism.<br><br><a href=#c7427977293896883018 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 7:07 AM</a><br><br>

Despite our happy illusion of government by and for the people, the fact remains that Ike's warning about the military-industrial complex as a major threat to democracy was prescient.<br><br>To quote Eisenhower: "In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist."<br><br>Social changes of the kind that were required back when we could still do something about the environmental and other disasters facing us would have required a level of both leadership and intellectual honesty in our elected officials that apparently wasn't there, because in the years since, government has become increasingly by and for business, with "the people" an asset that must be managed. <br><br>While I agree that some – even most – of the so-called "conspiracy theories" floating around are risible, just because you are paranoid doesn't mean they aren't out to get you. Pointing the finger back at ourselves in blame for our current social predicament is not, in my opinion, a cure for the projection of the shadow you mention. Yes, that projection exists, and is made clear in the highly emotional content of the accusations, but we must not lose sight of the fact that our elected officials have considerable power – much more than the "average American". By virtue of the fact that they ran for office, those officials have taken responsibility for structuring and managing the government. Therefore, failures of government, leadership and vision should be dumped right in the laps of those who said they would do the job. This is not scapegoating – this is accountability, a necessary first step for change.<br><br>I turned 20 in 1972. I remember those days well. I spent years in college and grad school studying soil science, and have been growing at least some of my own food almost every year since the late 70s. I supported various environmental causes and organizations over the years. I recycled, hung clothes on the clothesline, educated myself, voted carefully, and did all those things that good, environmentally-responsible citizens were "supposed" to do. Now, finally, for the last 11 years I have lived on 2 rural acres, something I'd been planning since the 70s. I work at home, no commute. I don't see a villain when I look in the mirror, because I'm not one. But I sure as hell can point to some, and I don't believe I am projecting or scapegoating. <br><br>That said, I do think you are right on track when you say that the nihilistic mindset is a major cultural problem; one that holds us back from making necessary changes. The level of psychological and psychic illness that pervades our culture is so extreme that "what happened" will only be really understood after those who are alive now are long gone. <br><br>I also agree wholeheartedly that we need to bring back the low-tech, energy-conservative methods of living, and thank you for freely sharing your thoughts and ideas. They are much needed.<br><br><a href=#c6624654290651992978 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 8:07 AM</a><br><br>

At the time, to my eight-year-old mind, the long lines of cars at gas stations seemed just one piece of the perception I had that a preparation for imminent scarcity and a focus on ecology were commonplace societal norms.<br> <br>Granted, I lived in liberal Northern California, but as a previous commenter said, your own normal is what you first grew up with, and I first grew up with "Save Mono Lake" bumperstickers on compact Datsuns and the "Energy Blues" clip from <i>Schoolhouse Rock</i> that I posted last week. But when I look back on what felt societally important during my high-school years of the mid-late 1980s, that earlier mindset does not seem to play any part. <br><br>You make an excellent point, JMG, that in the 1970s lots of people were around who well remembered the Great Depression; the teenagers of the early 1930s were still only in their fifties, and in control of the country, in 1973. As you say, that meant the generation in power viscerally understood what scarcity and pulling together for a common purpose (think WW2) entailed. Combine those historical memories and the resulting learned discipline of the older generation with the conservation fervor of many Baby Boomers, and you had what might have been a rather winning combination for lasting change.<br><br>Fear is perhaps the ultimate motivator, and the fear of scarcity engendered by the 1970s oil shocks had their effects—until the oil glut (I'm using <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s_oil_glut rel=nofollow>Wikipedia's term</a>) of the 1980s made the previous concerns seem (note: emphasis on "seem") overblown. People desperate for predictability and stability (which is most people, frankly) were all too happy to cling to the belief that the '70s scarcity fears were but small rips in the fabric of continual progress, and that such fears had been "solved" (they weren't, of course) by the combination of factors that led, and quickly, to complacency once oil seemed again "cheap enough" in the 1980s and '90s. <br><br>Nothing too revelatory in my comment here, I'm afraid, except again to consider, oh, what we might have been able to do, back when we still had a chance.<br><br><a href=#c9075430386585560550 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 8:31 AM</a><br><br>

Once again you've roped me into considering things yet unresolved, though I question my own worthiness to respond.<br><br>1974 was the coming-of-age year for me in many ways. I had started the previous fall in a new, essentially "white flight", upper middle class highschool, coming from 4 years as a non-catholic in a Catholic-Military boy's prep-school (jeez). Girls, Sports, lots of freedom and weed ....plenty of distractions, though it wasn't to last. After a summer of study in Europe and the USSR, I returned to highschool. It wasn't long before I was in the hot seat of an evangelical public school principal, a bible close at hand, his idea of 'corrective detention', so I wrote my parents a note, donned my pack and left; a Hobo at sixteen. <br><br>Until that day, nothing of the '70s made any sense. What I had been taught to that point clearly didn't jive with my vision of things. The pipe-dream hopes of the '60s, those brief flashes of sanity, had devolved into, as you describe, a society with no honest sense of self. It was on the cold highways and filthy boxcars of America that I found sanity, hope and honor,, among the social outcast tribe; Kristofferson's version of freedom. The view from the bottom can be enlightening indeed. <br><br>This was my 'walkabout', the first of several actually. I apologise for perhaps being self-indulgent so far. While most of the comments here indicate an awareness of the 'what', regarding our society's collective disfunctionalities, I'm trying to get a handle on the 'why' aspect. To blame the causes and effects of the industrial age and to say that <i>fossil fuels have spoiled us</i> goes more to the <i>how</i> we've arrived at this age of conundrums and predicaments. As I type, yet another generation of babies are drowning in our bathwater. Why?<br><br>Joseph Cambell touched on the idea of a 'coming of age' event in the lives of the young people of many primitive cultures. He discussed the Australian Aboriginal walkabout, when young men were expected to go into the wilderness, fend for themselves, cleansing themselves of youthful expectations and opening themselves to the wisdom and responsibilities of adulthood. His concern was that this transition ritual, this metamorphosis of individuals has been discarded for the most part. (His take was that a girl's transition into womanhood was more self-evident.) <br><br>Question: For me it is evident that our society, perhaps our species as a whole, requires a walkabout event, far longer than the Jews' 40 years, a multi-generational reset of expectation and responsibility, some time in the wilderness to consider its future. Is this even possible? I believe it is inevitable, though, as with the tribal walkabouts of the Australian outback, as with Moses, many will not survive, and there is no guarantee of a promised land. <br><br>This site, especially, seems about imparting the qualities and skills worthy of being passed on to the next generation, not just physical skills, but the courage to face the mirror as our time in the wilderness approaches. It is encouraging that so many excellent comments are from younger generations. Good on all of you!<br><br>Again, to the garden I go...<br><br><a href=#c6245559563889417457 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 9:03 AM</a><br><br>

We can't change the past, but we can learn from its mistakes and do something different this time. <br><br>Archivist, it's only people who live lives insulated from nature who can afford to daydream about nature as an all-nurturing momma. <br><br>Robo, now explain to me why you find this insistence on your own powerlessness so compelling. <br><br>Kevin, excellent. By all means keep speaking the unspeakable; with your permission, I'll use your comment in a future post. <br><br>John, yes, and then you said "it was never in the cards" and "the car and oil companies would never have allowed it." That's simply another way of claiming that it couldn't have happened. What if it could have happened, and we as a nation wimped out? <br><br>Jason, that makes a lot of sense -- and yes, Lao Tsu is always welcome company here. <br><br>Adam, that's an excellent point. I went through a relativist period in my undergraduate days, too, before classical philosophy and a sizable dash of virtue ethics taught me otherwise. You're right that relativism is a form of nihilism, but as I see it, the connection's much more direct: relativism is a way of denying that anything you want to do can be blameworthy, and when you live in a society that's committed itself to a blameworthy course, that sort of thinking becomes very, very popular. <br><br>Nathan, that's excellent news!<br><br>Andrew, I haven't owned a television since 1984, so haven't followed Curtis' career and can't really comment on his ideas. <br><br>Justin, no, it's not particularly muddled, and you're tackling some serious issues here. I'd suggest that nihilism is always a matter of choice; the Existentialists pointed out correctly that the world does not provide us with meaning, but they tended to miss the point that the world also doesn't provide us with a denial of meaning: we choose to experience the world as meaningful or meaningless. That being the case, which of these two choices produces the most creative, fulfilling, and compassionate life? <br><br>Chris, there's no way to force the cornucopians to come to their senses; all we can do is to craft a working alternative in our own lives and communities. The increasingly strident yelps from the cornucopian camp when they're confronted with that alternative is evidence enough that we're on the right track!<br><br><a href=#c1157515138512213901 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 9:13 AM</a><br><br>

As a younger boomer watching what the older ones were up to, I embraced and tried to live the ideals and 70s lifeways discussed in this post. Like Bill P. I'm one of those that never really participated in the cultural shift of the 80s and 90s. Our land became strange to me and I felt I was in the wilderness.<br><br>As my husband and I raised our children according to anti-materialistic, frugal, conservationist ideas, they, having been born in the late 80s, sometimes had a hard time at school, since we were raising them counter to the prevailing ethos. However, they turned out well: neither owns a car, they are not "relativists" of the sort described by Adam S. above, nor are they cynical.<br><br>I gradually found other, like-minded people, where I live and online, so no longer feel alienated. Yet I, too, see this creeping nihilism and cynicism and agree with your (JMG's) assessment.<br><br>I think there's a distinction to be made between nihilism and going through a period of grief and despair (which I have done) because conscious that the sort of alternative history you describe was possible, and realizing that it wasn't going to happen. And because of feeling, on a very deep level, the level of being, the damage humanity has done/continues to do to itself and the living earth.<br><br>Somehow, having traveled through what St. John of the Cross calls "the dark night of the soul," I emerged, and, as I've remarked here and elsewhere, have joined the great upwelling--as exemplified by green wizards and many others--of people who, one way or another, are choosing reality-based, life-affirming, resilient thinking and doing as opposed to soul-sucking nihilism. This is a profoundly moral, and willed, stance. <br><br>Perhaps it is not only betrayal of one sort or another that leads to the collective cynicism/nihilism. Perhaps it is also that making it through that dark night truly is difficult. Rather than, as St. John counsels, enduring it patiently through to the end, to new, chastened light, some might take prozac, though what they suffer isn't really depression, but a spiritual crises about their relation to the world. Some might get stuck halfway, and cynicism becomes a form of self "medication" that allows them to keep functioning in the world, somehow, and even to take a perverse pleasure in their hopelessness. But touchy withal, as you point out.<br><br>More and more I'm understanding how complicated the world is, how one can never have full information about anything, fully control outcomes, or fully understand the ramifications and effects of what one chooses to do or not do.<br><br>Yet we do think and act, guided by our beliefs, whether we admit to having any or not. It's easier to choose to do nothing or to destroy. Choosing to build and heal, as so many commenters here seem to be doing, is hard work that is inconsistent with, and impossible to do while embracing cynicism and nihilism. <br><br>What is the old saying? "Don't tell me what you're against, tell me what you are for." And if you've made it this far, thanks for your patience. ;)<br><br><a href=#c4692927392884285264 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 9:17 AM</a><br><br>

Unfortunately most of America ended up rolling over and going to sleep. <br><br>Hawlkeye, good. Very good. "The road to Reagan and the road to Jerry were the same road all along..." That one in particular is a keeper. <br><br>GeoWend, that's a good metaphor. <br><br>Thijs, of course you're quite correct. It's all the more interesting because the Cynic philosopers of ancient Greece were about as far from today's "cynics" as you can get; they argued, as I recall, that nothing other than moral excellence was worth thinking about at all, and their complete disregard for public opinion and material goods came from that strong stance. It's telling that the Stoic philosophy emerged as a more moderate, less hard-edged offshoot of the Cynics! <br><br>GeoWend, or the fact that the "identity" in question, too often, was a matter of following the latest fashion. <br><br>RainbowShadow, to my mind it's part and parcel of the same thing. The refusal of empathy you're describing is the response of people who know they got theirs by no virtue of their own, and feel sufficiently troubled by that fact that they end up crafting ever more elaborate justifications for why they deserve what they have and those who don't have the same thing don't deserve it. Think of Gollum making up lies in the dark about the Ring, trying to convince himself that it was a birthday present rather than the thing for which he murdered his closest friend, and you've got a very good model for that kind of thinking. <br><br>The end of the artificial prosperity of the last few decades means the end of that set of excuses, though it will take a while; exactly the same sort of Horatio Alger nonsense was highly popular in the 1920s, before the experiences of the 1930s beat the stuffing out of it. <br><br>Don, that seems unlikely to me, both because my post wasn't talking about "back on the road again" attitudes, and because of the consistently snarky tone of other comments by "pulltheweeds." Still, I'm perfectly capable of being wrong. <br><br>Loveandlight, if it had been done, it would have been subject to all the moral ambiguities and mixed motives of any human activity; the decreased standard of living would have been very unevenly shared out, and there would have been plenty of problems and embarrassments along the way. Even so, I think it could have been done, and could have landed us in a much better future than the one we're now facing. <br><br>Brad, the public schools are certainly part of the problem -- or the predicament -- rather than any sort of solution; they were wretched enough when I attended them in the 70s, though I understand they're much worse today. It may be worth noting that the homeschool movement had one of its major seedtimes during the Seventies, and alternative schools were also very much in favor; that's another dimension of the road not taken. <br><br>Rashakor, that's an excellent point. The thing about France, though, is that it was a major world power from the seventeenth century straight through to 1940, so the French can be forgiven a bit of megalomania. America's world empire really took off in 1945 and will be a thing of the past by 2045 at the latest; committing to an imperial identity when your empire is basically a flash in the pan is not a useful habit!<br><br><a href=#c4140318648092209241 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 9:38 AM</a><br><br>

Up through the 1970s, entertainment, culture, news, art, etc. were shared community experiences. Sure, books and music were individualized, but nearly everyone still got a very large part of their music off broadcast radio and bought their books at a local bookshop (we didn't call them "independent booksellers" because there was no other kind) and their music at a local record shop (a what?). TV was broadcast on the networks, great masses all watched the same shows at the same time and talked about them at school and work the next day. Movies were in the theater and everyone went to see them there, old movies still went on revival tours. Video games came on the scene late in the decade, but were played in the pinball arcades. Owning a video game (not counting "Pong") in your rec room was a status symbol comparable to having a large, heated pool in the backyard and a BMW in the garage. Even if your tastes were alternative, you still pursued these interests with other people. Clubs and groups and bars existed where these minority interests could find each other, and pursue them together, as social activities and in communities. <br><br>In the 1980s came the videocasette recorder and widespread affordable urban cable TV (previously Community Antenna TV, for remote areas with poor broadcast reception, one high-powered tower to receive broadcasts from the distant cities which was then cabled into surrounding homes). Satellite TV spread through rural areas, and the Sony Walkman suddenly made it possible for private, personalized music listening to happen all day, anywhere. <br><br>These were of course just the warm-up acts (though we didn't know it at the time). The internet burst free of its .gov/.mil/.edu cage in the 1990s, and we all know where that has lead. Now media, arts, and culture are personal, private, individual activities. even sex has moved this way. With each passing innovation we have become psychologically and culturally more atomic and autonomous, living in our own created personalized world. I have my word, you really are not relevant to it. Indeed you are just an interruption, or another piece of media for me to be amused by, to ridicule, to abuse. <br><br>Ironically, initially it looked like the internet was going to be the great uniter of people. Suddenly all these cultural minorities who had previously lived in intellectual and social isolation could find each other! If you were a homosexual zoophile, you could actually find other homosexual zoophiles and arrange to meet them in person. MANY social networks were forged during the 1990s this way (most not quite that fringe...), frequently leading to long-lasting ties when these groups arranged to get together in person. But then, gradually, that second part faded away. The online world became not an enhancement to the real world, but a replacement for it. Now folks just swap pictures and post to discussion forums, and leave it at that. And this is counted as being "friends." <br><br>It's really hard for me to think that this has not been a major influence on the phenomenon we're talking about here.<br><br><a href=#c2690220613253504037 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 9:42 AM</a><br><br>

Still, you're only trapped by your past choices if you choose to be. Every day, each of us decides whether to reaffirm the life choices we've made or to do something different. If you decide to do something different, it's going to cost you, and it's going to hurt, but if your conscience won't let you rest, don't try to bargain with it; do the right thing and make the changes you need to make to get your life back on track toward your ideals from here on out, whatever it costs you and however much it hurts. That's actually the easiest as well as the best way to do it, though it won't seem that way at the time.<br><br>Michael, the inner revolution you're describing can only be achieved one person at a time, and then only when that person is ready and willing to undertake the very hard work involved. Yes, it's a crucial factor, but there's no way to do it on a mass scale; every past attempt to do so, and of course there have been any number of those, has ended up turning into yet another ideology, and usually killing a lot of people sooner or later. <br><br>Bill, true enough. <br><br>X, since I don't have any experience living outside the US, I've tried not to generalize -- among other things, the US has very tightly (though "unofficially") censored media these days, and I have no way of knowing whether the information that comes across the borders gets here in useful form. Still, I'm not surprised that the same phenomenon is at work in Europe. What was it Yeats said about the prospects of European unity? "Only dead or dying sticks can be tied into a bundle..."<br><br>Sage, I'll be discussing that in a later series of posts. Expect them around the time the last space shuttle flight touches down. <br><br>Dio, I'll be addressing this in more detail in the next two posts. Still, the problem with identifying some iteration of "them" as the cause of our current situation is that it feeds the fantasy of powerlessness -- "they" stopped us from doing whatever, and will continue to do so, so why try? Eldridge Cleaver was exactly wrong; it's only by acknowleding that we're part of the problem that we can become part of the solution, because if we recognize our own participation in the problem, we identify the places where we can exert our own power to make things different. <br><br>K, granted, we had a chance then and blew it. We have a chance now. It won't accomplish as much or be anything like as easy -- and it wasn't going to be easy even then -- but the future we can have now, given a willingness to act, beats the bejesus out of the future we're going to get if we sit on our hind ends bemoaning the situation. That being the case, what are you prepared to do about the opportunities we've got right now?<br><br><a href=#c8892963099239710278 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 9:51 AM</a><br><br>

And I did also grow up (as anyone born after 1980) in a purely consumerist society. And yes, there is a lot of hopelessness and nihilism when people think about the future. The signs are many, and pretty hard to ignore -- from climate change and peak oil to mass species extinctions, depleted natural resources and increasing levels of contaminants in our food chain. As you have said, people get uncomfortable and prefer to stick their heads in the sand rather than confront these issues.<br><br>And when those among my generation and younger ones do confront the problem, there is a certain current of resentment and blame aimed at the baby boomer generation. I can only see this getting worse with each subsequent generation, until things start to stabilise out.<br><br>But I think that is also where projects like Green Wizardry or Transition Towns come in. They give people, to use your words, an "alternative to nihilism". It's much easier to confront the grim state of the world when you have a list of feasible things you can do about it.<br><br>I'd also add that there are currents in the current adolescent generation that give me hope. In the context of the US, on the one hand you have the far-left associated modern hipsters, who seem to be already <a href=http://www.theawl.com/2010/12/welcome-to-the-hipocalypse rel=nofollow>practising for the scavenger-tech stage of our culture</a>. On the other hand, you have the far-right associated borderline survivalist types who embrace such philosophies as the "<a href=http://edcforums.com/ rel=nofollow>every day carry (EDC)</a> -- that of keeping a set of high-quality tools on one's person on a daily basis to confront situations as they arise. This philosophy, while it does overlap with the carrying of weapons (which I find questionable) is highly practical and tends to be associated with a rejection of consumerism for the alternative of buying fewer, better-made items. <br><br>In both these groups I see some hope for the future, although in the US they are diametrically opposed to one another politically.<br><br>I also see some hope in gradual shifts in the consumption of electronics. I don't have figures, but I get the impression that for every early adopter with several dozen obsolete devices in their basement, there are several people who simply buy a computer to fulfil their basic needs of web browsing and word processing, and use it for five years or more. It's still far from the ideal of, say, buying an appliance that lasts a lifetime, but it's a shift towards where we need to be longer term.<br><br><a href=#c6216211487555479112 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 10:08 AM</a><br><br>

I recall working with my parents in the large garden we had, helping my Dad with installing the woodstove and gathering firewood, all of us trying to learn how to grow hay on our fields and run the ancient baler our neighbor had bought so feed the steers he was raising. Yeah, we were clueless, but I daresay we would be fairly proficient by now if those efforts had continued. But I loved that lifestyle and mindset, even though I was not overtly aware of all the forces that were driving these changes. That understanding did not begin to dawn until I was in collage and took a course on the limits to growth, but by that time it was the Reagan era and I was one of the few longhairs at an engineering &amp; business school. No one seemed to care and I fell for the “someone will think of something” line. Mostly I thought it was a political problem, as at that time I still believed the two party distraction was meaningful. <br><br>I suspect that what happened is akin to the topics you've been discussing the last few weeks. Too many people with essentially free and unlimited energy for too long. All those energy slaves allowed people to live with little social interaction, destroyed cultural institutions and with them the acceptance of limits. The message of “no, you cannot have all the energy you want” was rejected in a national temper tantrum.<br><br>But why societies choose to succeed or fail is the question Diamond asked in the subtitle, and you and Tainter and others have explored. Maybe there was a time some decades before the Maya fell into terminal decline that another path could have been taken by some who saw what was happening (or maybe for all we know they did and succeeded). Isn’t that one of the basic ideas, that too many people are stuck on a particular set of responses, and when changing circumstances and external events require new courses of action not enough are able to change direction?<br><br><a href=#c7377738752013854800 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 10:10 AM</a><br><br>

How can this be so? It is because intelligence is not the same thing as wisdom. When a society misuses partial intelligence and ignores holistic wisdom, its people forget the benefits of a plan and natural life. Seduced by their desires, emotions, and egos, they become slaves to the bodily demands, to luxuries, to power and unbalanced religion and psychological excuses. Then the reign of calamity and confusion begins. Nonetheless, superior people can awaken during times of turmoil to lead others out of the mire. But how can one liberate the many? By first liberating his own being. He does this not by elevating himself, but by lowering himself. He lowers himself to that which is simple and modest and truthful, and by integrating it into himself, he becomes a master of simplicity, modesty and truth. Completely emancipated from his former false life, he discovers his original pure nature, which is the nature of the universe.<br><br>Loa Tzu<br>from the Hua Hu Ching<br><br>JMG, thank you for your giving back to the rest of us.

A lot of otherwise ordinary people are still into organic gardening, for example, and earth-friendly products of various kinds still have steady sales. From one perspective, those are the scraps of what could have been, but they're also things we won't have to reinvent this time. <br><br>GHung, the "how" is complex enough; the "why" reaches into some very deep and obscure places. As for our culture's approaching time in the wilderness, that's a good metaphor; trying not to face that may be a good part of the reason why so many people are praying that the world will end soon. <br><br>Tom, I don't know that I'd call the Seventies a halcyon time; it had a lot of problems of its own. The one thing it had going for it was at least some willingness to confront those problems, rather than insisting that they were virtues. <br><br>Adrian, the distinction between nihilism and grief is crucial; thanks for bringing it up. It's precisely the attempt to avoid the grief, the inevitable mourning that comes from accepting a loss, that drives the nihilism; it's the pretense that what you lost wasn't worth having anyway. <br><br>Bill, I think you're right that the two phenomena are intertwined, but tracing which is cause and which effect is a fascinating question. A less nihilistic society might have applied the basic technologies in a very different way, for example. <br><br>Kieran, the boomer generation has worked overtime to earn the wrath of its descendants, though there's plenty of responsibility to go around. I hope the rising generations can find productive uses for their rejection of the boomers' values. <br><br>Twilight, exactly. I'll be touching on those issues in the next couple of posts. <br><br>Robert, it's anybody's guess; Druids are notoriously difficult to track. Also, of course, Druids make up only a small fraction of the people I do hear from now and then who are reading this and similar blogs, and doing the work that needs to be done, either for the first time or as part of a continuing path. <br><br>Joy, thank you, but that's a title I don't wish to use for a variety of reasons. <br><br>Eric, that's true. Still, there's another point to consider, which is that blame and responsibiity are not the same things. Passing blame isn't really useful; accepting responsibility is, and especially in a situation like this, all of us need to recognize our own participation in what's happened. <br><br>I'm as good an example as any. Though my lifestyle choices are very strongly influenced by my sense of resource limits and the needs of the planet, there are plenty of things I could have done but didn't; there's also the fact that as a US citizen, I benefit directly and indirectly in any number of ways from the vast wealth of this nation, essentially all of which is propped up by unsustainable energy and resource use. Accepting my own participation in that system, it seems to me, is crucial to figuring out what I can do to change the system for the better, starting with my own life. <br><br>Karyn, you were right on target then, and now. If you've preserved the skills and knowledge you learned at that time, or can recover them, you'll be in a position to help a lot of people catch up; my sense is that's one thing those of us who never sold out can usefully do.<br><br><a href=#c3242075036503788084 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 12:36 PM</a><br><br>

My present understanding of that takes the form of a question: where does one expect to find "true spiritual development," if not in the process of diligently taking care of practical matters such as growing food and keeping warm, understanding the world we live in and making some concrete positive contribution? <br><br>The visualization of spiritual development as some magic force from an alternate reality is one of the many handicaps that afflict our collective consciousness. To me, the great revelation of writers like JMG and Wendell Berry is that the key to a healthy spirit is—literally—at our fingertips. It's something we build, not something we find.<br><br>Perhaps what makes a revelation great is that it's camouflaged by its obviousness?<br><br><a href=#c4915589162254541447 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 12:40 PM</a><br><br>

However we got here, Homo nihilisticus autonomotivus is the dominant species in American society at this historical juncture, and that is what we have to live with at the present. <br><br>You are certainly also correct that technology is what we make of it, and people with different societal concepts would (will, do) use the internet differently. In my own personal case, as all this virtual social networking evolved away from a way to enhance real social networks and instead began to displace them, my interest and participation in it dropped dramatically. I had a personal website way back in 1995, was all over the usenet, started my first blog in 2004, yet I have not even bothered to get a Facebook account. <br><br>About the convergence of events in the 1970s that gave us a national "wake-up call"... I was hopeful that the events surrounding the second term of Bush II might have the same effect. The magnitude of the shocks was comparable -- revelations of lawlessness and inhumanity in our military, incompetence at conducting military operations, a massive natural disaster which we were inexcusably unprepared to respond to, resulting oil shocks that highlighted the frailty of our gasoline-based economy, the second round of oil shocks that could not be blamed on some simple short-term supply interruption, the collapse of the financial system pulling the curtain back on the freak show that we were trying to pass off as an economy, on and on. The initial reaction indicated that indeed there might be a sea change beginning -- people actually started buying smaller cars, and the Party in Power was swept out en masse in two rounds of elections. Never mind whether or not the Opposition Party was any better, an electoral purge is a strong show that the electorate has come to suspect that "business as usual" is a crock of manure and they are ready for real change. <br><br>But it looks like instead of waking up, we may have just smacked the snooze alarm. Somehow we seem to have collectively decided that everything troubled and shaky in our society is simply a matter of how the Federal Budget is shuffled. The anxiety of the late Aughts seems to have been funneled into conspiracy theories and political polarization, two of the least productive responses imaginable. Sigh.<br><br>A few months ago, we watched "The Day After Tomorrow" and "2012" back-to-back. I had avoided both of them initially, but decided it might be fun to watch them just for the visual effects. One very interesting contrast -- in the former (and older) film, the End of the World is brought about by our own actions and refusal to come to terms with their inevitable consequences. In the latter (and more recent) film, the End of the World just happens (via laughably convoluted Solar physics), we have nothing to do with it, we are just left to react to it. Both involve government corruption, but in the first case this corruption helps lead to the catastrophe, in the second case it just interferes with the response to the catastrophe that is Nobody's Fault. <br><br>Both movies also seem to think we have a vastly greater knowledge of what is happening on our planet, moment to moment and square mile by square mile, than we actually do.<br><br><a href=#c2735260862908869764 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 1:08 PM</a><br><br>

However, on that difficult path of self change, the right kind of help can be very helpful, sometimes essential. I have been a Skeptic (of the healthy kind) all my life. Yet, I am constantly amazed and gratified by the profound spiritual changes taking place in participants of the AA program. I have been part of this for over fifty years now, and feel that the principals of small group mutual help central to AA could be easily extended to embrace the need for deep changes in our addictive society.<br><br>I have been part of many groups over the years: Sufis, Yogis, Aikido, Zen, Quakers….the list is a long one. AA is unique in that it explicitly has no leaders, accepts no money, accepts anyone who is interested, abjures organization, does not advertise or proselytize, and has almost no rules -- and yet has been successful in transforming the lives of millions around the world. The twelve steps are perhaps the most generic and complete spiritual path ever devised.<br><br>To me, AA exemplifies the possibilities of small groups for changing our world. I agree that mass movements miss the point of what people really need: a world of responsible spiritually motivated people capable of walking away from the false premises of our moribund culture. And yet AA is an example of a mass movement based on small groups of independent agents helping each other to grow beyond the need of leader/follower movements. We have a lot to learn from each other, and it can be done outside the stultifying confines of traditional groups.<br><br>If anyone who reads this is interested in further exploring these possibilities, my email is annsiudmak@windstream.net<br><br><a href=#c4061741767743680101 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 2:05 PM</a><br><br>

But we must also acknowledge the currents in which we swim. The problem of overproduction that the unthinking use of fossil fuel leads to were “solved” by massive propaganda campaigns to over consume starting in the middle of the last century as you have noted. The campaigns have continued to this day in ever more debased form, leading to a point where our elite can’t let go of them even when there are great advantages to doing so, even for a short while. Had we done so after the 9/11 incident and had a year or more of “sacrifice for the war effort”, we would have a much better economy right now – not a healthy, i.e. “old normal”, one as the transition to a post-fossil fuel one has begun, but one perhaps slightly better suited to that transition.<br><br>I think in bitter amusement of the attacks on the French and other Europeans for their (weakening) resistance to some of worst features of American culture like McDonald’s bad food. The amazing amount of anger that this generated just confirms your thesis about fears that our choices have not been the best. It also shows that strong cultural inheritance can fight the propaganda.<br><br>I am also bitterly amused as a scientist, that training in science, engineering and similar hard disciplines are mostly now done by foreign students, or first/second generation Americans. I suspect this lack of elites in these areas is one reason that they are disengaged from any thing that smacks of realist thinking. I went and got an MBA a decade after I received my Ph.D. I noticed that except for accounting, business statistics and other business math, there was not much else there, and this was from a top-ten school. Economics was especially amusing and in its way frustrating.<br><br>This first/second generation thing also speaks of the influence on weakening the will that our culture on people over the generations. Just as the big bad wolf said to Red Riding Hood, “The better to eat you, my dear.”, our culture says “The better to sell you plastic crap you don’t need and reduce you to a willing debt serf.”<br><br>One result of influence can be seen in observation that first generation Italians had a low incidence of alcoholism, but the rate is closed to the mainstream one for third and higher generations.<br><br>Yes, these currents are very strong, but a major waterfall is now directly ahead. I agree with you that many of our elite will regret the propaganda of ease and abundance that they profited from so greatly. And I think that is one of the keys to why they choose the particular road that we decided to follow them on. Yes, one could have made more railroads and solar panels, but there was greater (short-term) profit in autos and planes and centralized power systems, especially if one can play games to keep the cost of oil down. There was more profit in getting people to move to the suburbs, rather than renovating the existing cities.<br>There is of course the question of why our top elite are so short sighted. I wonder if it is because they are basically merchants. I say this thinking of the Japanese in much of their history. While their top merchants were rich and certainly an elite, I understand that the top elite in their country were their military. And a military should understand the concepts of discipline and sacrifice.<br><br><a href=#c9035369006302219559 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 2:10 PM</a><br><br>

As for conspiracy theories and political polarization, I'll be addressing that next week. I expect to see quite a bit of unproductive responses. <br><br>Robert, that's good to hear. Too few people have heroes these days; it's one of the reasons we so often fall short of our own potentials for heroism. <br><br>Michael, some people have good experiences with AA and its equivalents, others don't, and a lot of people on both sides have their teeth set on edge by its adherents' tendency to proselytise. I put your post through this time, but recruitment pitches normally aren't in good taste here. <br><br>Kevin, that's because the Reagan administration gutted the mental health system and turned hundreds of thousands of mentally ill people out onto the streets.

I don't buy it. I think that a very large fraction of the "blame the elites" verbiage we hear these days is an attempt to evade personal responsibility. More on this next week. <br><br>Michael T., here's hoping that "a new day will dawn for those who stay long, and the forest will echo with laughter." (I think I wore straight through a copy of that track...)<br><br>Monkey, thank you. <br><br>Dennis, I remember too. My thought is that it's time for those of us who were there to dust off the old books and old skills, and try to get something moving again. <br><br>Robo, what I'm suggesting is that trying to claim that it's all a function of manipulation by the elites is an argument in favor of powerlessness. <br><br>Sofistek, it wasn't sustainable over the long run, but it would have bought us a great deal of time with which to tackle the next steps in the transition down from industrialism. As for other countries, without the flood of cheap oil from the North Slope and North Sea, they'd have spent the last thirty years struggling with sky-high oil prices, you know. <br><br>Malcolm, that's a huge oversimplification. Reagan was a mascot -- a worn-out actor who had the chance to play one final big role to cap his career. If most of the Americans who'd gotten aboard the sustainability bandwagon in the previous decade had refused to follow his lead, the last thirty years would have been very different. It's the way that so many people bailed out on sustainability and rushed to drink Reagan's koolaid that deserves our attention.<br><br><a href=#c4233919144158338596 title="comment permalink">4/14/11, 5:54 PM</a><br><br>

If they try to go against the wave they wipe out. Obama is furiously trying to read the current waves and figure out how to get back on top of them (supposed pro-environmentalist who just agreed to de-list the Gray Wolf); the Tea Party actually believe they are creating the wave and thus have a very high risk of crashing in a heap of political foam rather soon. <br><br>What was so horrifying on Election night 1980, and again in 2004, was not so much the realization that Ronald Ray-Gun was going to be president, or that we were going to have to endure 4 more years if Shrub.

The fact that power is unevenly distributed in America (like every other human society, past, present, and future) does not mean that a handful of people can make the country do whatever they want.

In the 1968 the Soviet union intervented and began occupation of ČR which lasted until 1987-9's collapse. In that time the regime was being internally "normalized", as the sixties liberation movement was presumably a big danger to the "Eastern block", but it was probably so perceived also by the west, which didn't perform any, nor formal, action to "save our freedom". I think it was also due to big seductiveness of free democratic and cooperative system, which was as I think arising here(and to a lesser extent in US).<br>The flower was smothered before it could flower. In ninethies, the most of our state was sold off underprice to various, mostly western, subjects and speculants(we were one of the most industrialized countries throughout the 20th century, even through socialistic era). The corrupted totalitarian government with socialistic rhetoric was replaced by similary or even more corrupted "democratic" government with neoliberal "conservative" rhetoric, maybe partly driven from outside(if there were a real democratic shift, the new regime probably wouldn't be capitallist at all).<br>After this historical development, the whole spirit, ideology and enthusiasm is away, only relativism, delusion and bare concurrention at all costs remained. The "conservative" dissolution of state infrastructure continues (the pension funds and public healthcare are the few things which remained serving and a big fight about their future now becomes, "right" parties trying to privatize it all using mostly false arguments and extensive "mass communication").<br>Well, what I originally wanted to point out is that at least here, and in USA, and I think in bigger part of world, the spirit of sixties and maybe seventies(here cutted in 1968) was really diferent than that of eighties.<br>I'm sorry for longer than indended and partly offtopic post. :)<br><br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Petr<br><br><a href=#c5094440886949871051 title="comment permalink">4/15/11, 1:16 AM</a><br><br>

One of the contributors, David Korowicz, says in the context of our societies having adapted to global economic growth over 200 years:<br>"The self-organisation [he has sketched and illustrated the nature of complex civilisation] reminds us that governments do not control their economies. Nor does civil society. The corporate or financial sectors do not control the economies within which they operate. That they can destroy the economy should not be taken as evidence that they can control it."<br><br>I am reminded, however, of what hubris can do at critical junctures; Stalin and Mao's attempts at forced modernisation and industrialisation, for example.<br><br>Then we came to that tipping point, Reagan stimulants and the road to la-la land; BAU to its logical conclusion.(Probably not a co-incidence that we had Margaret Thatcher here in Britain, though she injected more than a modicum of hubris into historical process.)<br><br>If you all can help find the antidotes to injections of hubris, or to doses of fanciful Reagan-type assumptions, then we might with luck keep on the right side of future tipping points. Our personal consciousness probably has some small leverage within the developing national or wider modern consciousness. <br><br>Having said that, I tend to think that most of "The Future" is evolving elsewhere than in the USA.

I'm not sure why, but then again I never saw the title of the song in print.)<br><br>In your response to Malcolm, you wrote, "It's the way that so many people bailed out on sustainability and rushed to drink Reagan's koolaid that deserves our attention." I've been trying, with limited success, to come up with an answer to that question, and I will be interested in your thoughts. In the meantime, I'm trying to remember the historical background to what might have been the turning point of the 1970's conservation effort: President Jimmy Carter's <a href=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/carter-crisis/ rel=nofollow>"crisis of confidence"</a> speech, delivered July 15, 1979.<br><br>In a comment to last week's <i>Archdruid Report</i>, I noted that speech was initially well-received by the public. (The speech reads like prophecy today, 32 years later.) But only two days after delivering the speech, Carter fired his cabinet, destroying this momentum and public favor before it had any chance of achieving critical mass. That political and leadership blunder, plus Carter's other leadership errors, most particularly the fumbling of the Iran hostage rescue attempt, made him look incompetent. This appearance of incompetent leadership opened the door for his political opponents--not just Ronald Reagan. You will no doubt recall that Ted Kennedy challenged Carter for the 1980 Democratic nomination, believing that Carter was a fumbling, weak leader. Kennedy thus divided the Democratic party and aided the Republicans and Ronald Reagan.<br><br>While Reagan, like Kennedy, attacked Carter for his alleged incompetence, he also assailed Carter for promoting the notion that we Americans had to do with less. Yes, the American people drank his Kool-aid, but the notion that we would never have to do with less seemed to be confirmed by the opening of the Prudhoe Bay and North Sea oil fields and the subsequent crash of petroleum prices.<br><br>Ever since then, "sacrifice" and "conservation" have become dirty words, as several commenters here have noted.<br><br>Why did we Americans accept Reagan's consumptive notion of the "good life"? Well, isn't it sort of hard-wired into our national psyche? Hasn't it been that way ever since the colonial period, when the first English-speaking Americans initially beheld this seemingly empty continent full of seemingly unlimited resources and equally unlimited possibilities? Would Reagan's attacks on frugality have had such political effect if he hadn't been tapping into something already there, something that resonated deeply with the American people? I don't think so.<br><br>Yes, Reagan rode a wave; we have to give him credit for perceiving it and being ready for it. Many Americans today who are old enough to remember the Carter years still cannot think of him without a greater or lesser degree of contempt. (The speech has derisively become known as the "malaise" speech, even though Carter never used that word--it initially was a label the media attached to it). In other words, the public's perception of the Carter years is colored by the attacks his opponents made on him in 1980, not peoples' recollections of the actual events of Carter's presidency.<br><br>Maybe in retrospect, the debasing of Carter and his ideas was part of the first round of catabolic collapse that you have noted began around that time. I don't know. Maybe I'm just playing with my reminiscences. What do you all think?<br><br><a href=#c2286150349749776818 title="comment permalink">4/15/11, 5:46 AM</a><br><br>

I'm sorry to hear you're being treated to the same sort of pseudoconservative nonsense we've got over here. That set of ideas is well past its pull date. <br><br>Chris, exactly. I'll be talking more about that way off the carousel, in your phrase, when we get back to green wizardry after this extended tangent. <br><br>Phil, it's not cynical at all. The US, as a failing empire, isn't likely to have much to say to the form the future takes outside of its own borders; it's too deeply committed to preserving its own hegemony to be willing to risk substantive change. It's when the hegemony implodes -- and we're within decades of that at the outside -- that the real window for change here will open. In the meantime, those of us who aren't interested in maintaining that hegemony, and are willing to do without its benefits -- a major point, this latter -- can get to work crafting alternative and transitional structures to help fill the vacuum when American empire collapses and a dazed and probably traumatized nation has to deal with the consequences of its collective actions. <br><br>Don, there's no more challenging task for any historian than trying to tease out the causes of the major inflection points in history -- the moments when changes in public mood intersect with the usually improvised actions of those who hold power, those who want it, and those who happen to stumble into the crucial places at the crucial times, to send history careening down a new path. The shift we're talking about right now isn't one of the really big examples of that, but it's an example. <br><br>Hawlkeye, it never fails to amaze me how often I can say something and still be understood as saying something different. In any society, ours very much included, there are a number of power centers with a disproportionate amount of influence over the political process, all of them competing to push their own agendas on a largely but not entirely passive public using whatever means come to hand, many of them underhanded and manipulative. <br><br>Our society differs from a dictatorship in that there are a lot of power centers of various levels of influence, and thus decisionmaking in the US is largely a matter of cobbling together an alliance of convenience between a large enough collection of power centers, and then trying to talk enough of the public into backing it to avoid a backlash that could give a competing alliance its entering wedge. All this involves a lot of horse trading and bribery, and again, a lot of it is pretty seamy. <br><br>That's the context in which each of us live our lives and make our decisions. In that context, it remains possible for individuals to make their own choices, and even to help build new power centers with a different agenda -- that's what protest and activism are about, when they're not simply a matter of playacting. Thus we each bear responsibility for our own choices, and we share in the responsibility for what our society has become; of course it's not hard to find people whose responsibility for a given change is greater than others, but the point I'd like to make is that this is a lot less useful just now than facing our own troubled conscience and making the changes we know we need to make. <br><br>Richard, nicely summarized. <br><br>Bill, it does need to be revisited. It's primarily among the well-to-do that conservation is a dirty word, and maybe it's time to talk about that.<br><br><a href=#c3507970205175469161 title="comment permalink">4/15/11, 9:01 AM</a><br><br>

I often get the sense that what many people who have become cynics on the the subject of liberal democracy TRULY object to is how WELL democracy works! Whatever one thinks of Reagan or W. Bush, they were, in their moment, quite genuinely popular. Their policies- "Let's close our eyes and imagine prosperity" (Reagan) and "We Americans! We Strong! We no afraid! We smash you for making us afraid!" (W. Bush)- were also truly popular and actually remain so today. What many liberal democracy cynics want is a different demos.<br><br>2. It never ceases to surprise me a bit when people insist on imagining the Oligarchs (to put it into a word) as "hidden". They are as visible as the Medicis! They found large organisations, that occupy big office buildings around the capital, that release "policy papers" and newsletters, that have websites, that host press-attended dinners and events, that sponsor books and articles in the popular press, and that provide pundits for radio and television. All of this to espouse, publicly and repeatedly their particular vision, mission, and modus operandi.<br><br>The man on television with the dull tie and the shrill voice, and the words "The Heritage Foundation" floating beneath his head is "hidden" how, again?<br><br>Note to hawkleye:<br><br>Please don't take this as shot at you specifically. I understand what you are saying is a bit different and I generally agree.

But it also has infrastructure consequences that will/would benefit a "powering down" society in many ways from encouraging a nodal urban layout that can localize more easily all the way down to salvaging the rails for horseshoes. Compare this to the sprawl encouraged by airlines -and their needed counterpart, interurban highways- and their relative lack of usable salvage, and the picture becomes clearer.<br><br>It's all water under the bridge in the U.S. now. But in those few countries that did pursue high-speed and higher-speed (meaning 70-90ish, not 200 or 30, MPH) rail when the time was right -France, Japan, Germany, and the UK- it will be interesting to see the effects those systems have on the local "Long Descent".<br><br>High-speed allowed rail transport networks to survive the age of the airline and the freeway interchange more or less intact. Because it could compete directly with the airlines. Because EVERY society that has had the chance to becomes the "kind of society needs to have large numbers of people... whizzing around the country".<br><br>That is how it would have fit in a path to sustainability in the U.S. and that's how it may yet in those countries mentioned above, as I see it.<br><br>-matt<br><br><a href=#c5669270219348330789 title="comment permalink">4/16/11, 2:09 PM</a><br><br>

I am as fed up with the current attitude of cynical helplessness as you are. I don’t tell people who say that the government is the problem to shut up, but sometimes it’s close.

My understanding of history is that is often par for the course. The manipulation I speak of didn’t come fully formed out of nothing. Take for example the housing meltdown. This didn’t happen because all-powerful banks were able to sell the idea of sub-prime, alt-A, etc mortgages to debt-adverse Americans, like the ones that lived through the Great Depression. Getting Americans to do this took generational turn-over and long-term propaganda campaigns that built up over time. Financial leverage is like a drug. It can be wonderful in small, controlled, doses, like drinking wine with dinner in a family setting. Convince people to lose the control can lead to a greater high for the user and greater sales for the supplier. Each small step led to the next. Please note that eventually the propaganda campaigns affect the perceptions of the elites themselves. A member of our banking elite in sixties would consider the idea of offering option-ARM’s on a mass scale to Americans to be the madness that it is. That was no longer the case in the previous decade.<br><br><a href=#c4213861536344357255 title="comment permalink">4/16/11, 2:49 PM</a><br><br>

Wouldn't just old fashioned reasonable speed rail have done that? But "encouraged" appears to imply a nudging of the free market into that direction. I don't think the kind of notional free market that we've had is the least bit interested in sustainability. So, if high speed rail could do some of the things you claim, I'd support it, as I wrote, as part of a true sustainable strategy. Eventually cannibalising the rail tracks for horseshoes sounds like an excellent end game but I very much doubt that it would have worked out that way.<br><br>As JMG says, we'll never know how things might have turned out but I raise the issue of high speed rail and the notion of global leadership in some technology (however simple) because I keep coming across these ideas and, for the life of me, I can't figure out where they fit in a sustainable society. Maybe they can, but it's never made clear. Prior to JMG mentioning them, I'd previously read it by Chris Martenson (in terms of rail) and by a Green party member (in terms of green exports). In trying to imagine what a sustainable society might look like, I just can't see where these things fit in, at all.

I agree w/ another poster that this is one of your best. I'm so glad that you've opened up this subject. I think you're spot on re: cynicism/nihilism being a cover for a guilty collective conscience. <br><br>I find the following esoteric calculus of the evolutionary condition of souls useful for understanding the stupidity of the majority. That calculus says that 75% of humanity at any given time exists in a herd state, concerned w/ security, afraid to think for themselves, and easily led by manipulators. Only 20% of humanity at any given time are individuated and seek the freedom to think for themselves.<br> <br>I was born in 1944, and left the herd at an early age, so I've watched things unfold in the US and world during my lifetime with dismay. I was in college in California beginning in 1961 - a time when herd mentality was challenged by the champions of individuation (Uranus &amp; Pluto). I was in New York City in the early years of the age of greed (early 1980s) and watched people go into a zombie-like trance over money, which has continued to this day. <br><br>The crises of this century have all been brought on by the ignorance of the masses, the herd falling for the false promises of the capitalist manipulators or whatever you want to call them. Some people have been lying and the majority have fallen for the lies. And now the herd people hate to be told that they are responsible for the collective suffering that is the result of their ignorance/stupidity. Nihilism is just another abdication of responsibility. <br><br>But maybe the crises of this century will result in collective learning of essential lessons - to stop believing in parental saviors, grow up and think for ourselves, and establish our own direct, unmediated relationship with the natural world - which will enable a few members of our species (20% ?) to survive and establish, at last (or again!), a mature human presence on Mother Earth.<br><br><a href=#c1143880179519592049 title="comment permalink">4/18/11, 5:25 AM</a><br><br>

No one seems to talk much about Ivan Illich but he was a prolific writer who lived long enough to see the potential of the 'web' in some form. He though that it might allow the de-schooling of society. He also said "Tell me how fast you go and I'll tell you who you are." Here is a bit from an abstract of his work, "Energy and Equity." I have that book around somewhere but cant find it..<br><br>"In this essay, (Energy and Equity) Illich examines the question of whether or not humans need any more energy than is their natural birthright. Along the way he gives a startling analysis of the marginal disutility of tools. After a certain point, that is, more energy gives negative returns. For example, moving around causes loss of time proportional to the amount of energy which is poured into the transport system, so that the speed of the fastest traveller correlates inversely to the equality as well as freedom of the median traveller."<br><br><a href=#c5853129627939028975 title="comment permalink">4/18/11, 9:20 AM</a><br><br>

Rather than envision connecting the coasts more quickly, I would rather see local transportation making a transition to something that uses an appropriate technology, responsible energy source, and connects to the high capacity, high energy, long distance transport system. Today's private fleets of trucks don't look so efficient if fuel and energy become significantly more expensive and also only available intermittently. Just one for-instance - the number of individual delivery trucks - Budweiser, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Ralph's Meats, Syscom, etc. that make nearly-daily deliveries to a local 6 table convenience store/(excellent!) fried chicken and deli store.<br><br>How about some city planning that puts businesses on a common modest rail line or even canal for moving bulk stuff?

It's possible that sustainability can never be reached though if that is the case, I'm not sure what our goal should be. A lower rate of resource consumption or a lower rate of damage to our habitat simply means that the problem might be put off for some future generation to deal with (if there is a future generation).

To take up the military colonial intervention of the French on the behalf of a minority of Vietnamese who had benefitted from the French rule was folly. We should have started building friendly bridges to socialists committed to the betterment of their people. <br>Intervening in complex civil conflicts where our soldiers can't even speak the language has been disastrous again and again. No tactical magic can make this plan work.<br><br><a href=#c5615137162258658502 title="comment permalink">4/18/11, 9:11 PM</a><br><br>

A particularly engaging read this week, with so many thoughtful contributions. I'm looking forward to part two already. <br><br>Bill, your portrayal of snooze alarm habituated Homo nihilisticus autonomotivus has had me thinking about the pervasiveness of the reset button in our culture. <br><br>Handmaiden to the Horatio Alger meme the popular second chance narrative allows denial of the possible finality of failure. When something goes wrong, just reboot; causal analysis is optional and generally not recommended as complex systems are perceived to be beyond the grasp of individual ability, the realm only of experts. But whether adoption of this do-over mentality has helped to occasion or is merely symptomatic of the exhibited cult of disengagement that ranges from affectation of indifference, to cynical skepticism, to the absolutist denialist, is sort of that old chicken or egg quandary. <br><br>Come twilight, the imperative for chickens is the roost. There is no reset button for dusk and a chicken without a roost is dinner.<br><br>In my estimation the only thing we should be doing at high speed - is slowing down - so that we might have a chance to learn a thing or two from our chickens.<br><br><a href=#c680554480149938516 title="comment permalink">4/18/11, 9:44 PM</a><br><br>

It's "really a return to nature, but also about living a comfortable, fulfilling, abundant life."<br><br>http://yourlife.usatoday.com/your-look/story/2011/04/Eco-luxe-products-Low-impact-high-price/46223492/1?csp=ylf<br><br>Yeah, right - if that's not a "have my cake and eat it too" attitude, I don't know what is... <br><br>But I agree about personal responsibility. I've stopped preaching to others and now I'm focused on doing everything I can to withdraw from, and not support the current consumer culture. The more I do, the more I see can be done... so I just keep on learning and doing...<br><br>@Adam Streed: <i>Or, to put the point conversely, the motivation to get out and make things better requires a judgment that doing X rather than Y really is---independently of anyone's attitudes---better. And making that kind of commitment is something that people (or, to stick to my sample, California undergrads) seem loath to do.</i><br><br>I encountered that in a cohousing community – the “unwillingness to judge” and the “equality of point of view; no hierarchies” – which I tried to point out was a false front, because 1) so many of the members were acting on judgments they were unwilling to admit and 2)pushing that point of view as “best” actually creates the hierarchy they were decrying. But deaf ears… I suppose they’re still struggling; I left 5 years ago.<br><br><br>@BradK: <i>All growing and learning is about indoctrination. If we hope for the future, we need to take ownership of how our children are being indoctrinated today.</i><br><br>Out in Oregon, we have a statewide “Green Schools Association” that encourages and supports schools to develop reducing, reusing and recycle technique and also to have a school garden where they use the compost generated from the school lunches, for example. It’s fun and it seems to be developing a generation of more-aware Oregonians.<br><br><a href=#c8900407803006019542 title="comment permalink">4/19/11, 7:27 AM</a><br><br>
